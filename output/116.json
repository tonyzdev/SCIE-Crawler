    "abstract": "Diffraction (X-ray, neutron and electron) and electron cryo-microscopy are powerful methods to determine three-dimensional macromolecular structures, which are required to understand biological processes and to develop new therapeutics against diseases. The overall structure-solution workflow is similar for these techniques, but nuances exist because the properties of the reduced experimental data are different. Software tools for structure determination should therefore be tailored for each method. Phenix is a comprehensive software package for macromolecular structure determination that handles data from any of these techniques. Tasks performed with Phenix include data-quality assessment, map improvement, model building, the validation/rebuilding/refinement cycle and deposition. Each tool caters to the type of experimental data. The design of Phenix emphasizes the automation of procedures, where possible, to minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, while default parameters are chosen to encourage best practice. A graphical user interface provides access to many command-line features of Phenix and streamlines the transition between programs, project tracking and re-running of previous tasks.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the implementation of real-space refinement in the phenix.real_space_refine program from the PHENIX suite. The use of a simplified refinement target function enables very fast calculation, which in turn makes it possible to identify optimal data-restraint weights as part of routine refinements with little runtime cost. Refinement of atomic models against low-resolution data benefits from the inclusion of as much additional information as is available. In addition to standard restraints on covalent geometry, phenix.real_space_refine makes use of extra information such as secondary-structure and rotamer-specific restraints, as well as restraints or constraints on internal molecular symmetry. The re-refinement of 385 cryo-EM-derived models available in the Protein Data Bank at resolutions of 6 Å or better shows significant improvement of the models and of the fit of these models to the target maps.",

ISOLDE combines interactive molecular-dynamics flexible fitting with modern molecular-graphics visualization and established structural biology libraries to provide an immersive interface wherein the model constantly acts to maintain physically realistic conformations as the user interacts with it by directly tugging atoms with a mouse or haptic interface or applying/removing restraints. In addition, common validation tasks are accelerated and visualized in real time. Using the recently described 3.8 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase complex as a case study, it is demonstrated how ISOLDE can be used alongside other modern refinement tools to avoid common pitfalls of low-resolution modelling and improve the quality of the final model. A detailed analysis of changes between the initial and final model provides a somewhat sobering insight into the dangers of relying on a small number of validation metrics to judge the quality of a low-resolution model.",

    "abstract": "The crystallographic maps that are routinely used during the structure-solution workflow are almost always model-biased because model information is used for their calculation. As these maps are also used to validate the atomic models that result from model building and refinement, this constitutes an immediate problem: anything added to the model will manifest itself in the map and thus hinder the validation. OMIT maps are a common tool to verify the presence of atoms in the model. The simplest way to compute an OMIT map is to exclude the atoms in question from the structure, update the corresponding structure factors and compute a residual map. It is then expected that if these atoms are present in the crystal structure, the electron density for the omitted atoms will be seen as positive features in this map. This, however, is complicated by the flat bulk-solvent model which is almost universally used in modern crystallographic refinement programs. This model postulates constant electron density at any voxel of the unit-cell volume that is not occupied by the atomic model. Consequently, if the density arising from the omitted atoms is weak then the bulk-solvent model may obscure it further. A possible solution to this problem is to prevent bulk solvent from entering the selected OMIT regions, which may improve the interpretative power of residual maps. This approach is called a polder (OMIT) map. Polder OMIT maps can be particularly useful for displaying weak densities of ligands, solvent molecules, side chains, alternative conformations and residues both in terminal regions and in loops. The tools described in this manuscript have been implemented and are available in PHENIX .",

    "abstract": "The program AceDRG is designed for the derivation of stereochemical information about small molecules. It uses local chemical and topological environment-based atom typing to derive and organize bond lengths and angles from a small-molecule database: the Crystallography Open Database (COD). Information about the hybridization states of atoms, whether they belong to small rings (up to seven-membered rings), ring aromaticity and nearest-neighbour information is encoded in the atom types. All atoms from the COD have been classified according to the generated atom types. All bonds and angles have also been classified according to the atom types and, in a certain sense, bond types. Derived data are tabulated in a machine-readable form that is freely available from CCP 4. AceDRG can also generate stereochemical information, provided that the basic bonding pattern of a ligand is known. The basic bonding pattern is perceived from one of the computational chemistry file formats, including SMILES, mmCIF, SDF MOL and SYBYL MOL2 files. Using the bonding chemistry, atom types, and bond and angle tables generated from the COD, AceDRG derives the `ideal' bond lengths, angles, plane groups, aromatic rings and chirality information, and writes them to an mmCIF file that can be used by the refinement program REFMAC 5 and the model-building program Coot . Other refinement and model-building programs such as PHENIX and BUSTER can also use these files. AceDRG also generates one or more coordinate sets corresponding to the most favourable conformation(s) of a given ligand. AceDRG employs RDKit for chemistry perception and for initial conformation generation, as well as for the interpretation of SMILES strings, SDF MOL and SYBYL MOL2 files.",

    "abstract": "An algorithm for automatic map sharpening is presented that is based on optimization of the detail and connectivity of the sharpened map. The detail in the map is reflected in the surface area of an iso-contour surface that contains a fixed fraction of the volume of the map, where a map with high level of detail has a high surface area. The connectivity of the sharpened map is reflected in the number of connected regions defined by the same iso-contour surfaces, where a map with high connectivity has a small number of connected regions. By combining these two measures in a metric termed the `adjusted surface area', map quality can be evaluated in an automated fashion. This metric was used to choose optimal map-sharpening parameters without reference to a model or other interpretations of the map. Map sharpening by optimization of the adjusted surface area can be carried out for a map as a whole or it can be carried out locally, yielding a locally sharpened map. To evaluate the performance of various approaches, a simple metric based on map-model correlation that can reproduce visual choices of optimally sharpened maps was used. The map-model correlation is calculated using a model with B factors (atomic displacement factors; ADPs) set to zero. This model-based metric was used to evaluate map sharpening and to evaluate map-sharpening approaches, and it was found that optimization of the adjusted surface area can be an effective tool for map sharpening.",

One promising solution is to collect small wedges of data (5-10°) separately from multiple crystals. The data from these crystals can then be merged into a complete reflection-intensity set. However, data processing of multiple small-wedge data sets is challenging. Here, a new open-source data-processing pipeline, KAMO, which utilizes existing programs, including the XDS and CCP4 packages, has been developed to automate whole data-processing tasks in the case of multiple small-wedge data sets. Firstly, KAMO processes individual data sets and collates those indexed with equivalent unit-cell parameters. The space group is then chosen and any indexing ambiguity is resolved. Finally, clustering is performed, followed by merging with outlier rejections, and a report is subsequently created. Using synthetic and several real-world data sets collected from hundreds of crystals, it was demonstrated that merged structure-factor amplitudes can be obtained in a largely automated manner using KAMO, which greatly facilitated the structure analyses of challenging targets that only produced microcrystals.",

    "abstract": "Refinement is a process that involves bringing into agreement the structural model, available prior knowledge and experimental data. To achieve this, the refinement procedure optimizes a posterior conditional probability distribution of model parameters, including atomic coordinates, atomic displacement parameters ( B factors), scale factors, parameters of the solvent model and twin fractions in the case of twinned crystals, given observed data such as observed amplitudes or intensities of structure factors. A library of chemical restraints is typically used to ensure consistency between the model and the prior knowledge of stereochemistry. If the observation-to-parameter ratio is small, for example when diffraction data only extend to low resolution, the Bayesian framework implemented in REFMAC 5 uses external restraints to inject additional information extracted from structures of homologous proteins, prior knowledge about secondary-structure formation and even data obtained using different experimental methods, for example NMR. The refinement procedure also generates the `best' weighted electron-density maps, which are useful for further model (re)building. Here, the refinement of macromolecular structures using REFMAC 5 and related tools distributed as part of the CCP 4 suite is discussed.",

The number of high-resolution reconstructions continues to grow, increasing the importance of the accurate determination of atomic coordinates. Here, a new Python package and program called Servalcat is presented that is designed to facilitate atomic model refinement. Servalcat implements a refinement pipeline using the program REFMAC5 from the CCP4 package. After the refinement, Servalcat calculates a weighted Fo - Fc difference map, which is derived from Bayesian statistics. This map helps manual and automatic model building in real space, as is common practice in crystallography. The Fo - Fc map helps in the visualization of weak features including hydrogen densities. Although hydrogen densities are weak, they are stronger than in the electron-density maps produced by X-ray crystallography, and some H atoms are even visible at ∼1.8 Å resolution. Servalcat also facilitates atomic model refinement under symmetry constraints. If point-group symmetry has been applied to the map during reconstruction, the asymmetric unit model is refined with the appropriate symmetry constraints.",

To overcome this limitation, the coflow method was developed, where the sample flows through the centre of its cell surrounded by a flow of matched buffer. The method permits an order-of-magnitude increase of X-ray incident flux before sample damage, improves measurement statistics and maintains low sample concentration limits. The method also efficiently handles sample volumes of a few microlitres, can increase sample throughput, is intrinsically resistant to capillary fouling by sample and is suited to static samples and size-exclusion chromatography applications. The method unlocks further potential of third-generation synchrotron beamlines to facilitate new and challenging applications in solution scattering.",

    "abstract": "For the purpose of this article, experimental phasing is understood to mean the determination of macromolecular structures by exploiting small intensity differences of Friedel opposites and possibly of reflections measured at different wavelengths or for heavy-atom derivatives, without the use of specific structural models. The SHELX programs provide a robust and efficient route for routine structure solution by the SAD, MAD and related methods, but involve a number of simplifying assumptions that may limit their applicability in borderline cases. The substructure atoms ( i.e. those with significant anomalous scattering) are first located by direct methods, and the experimental data are then used to estimate phase shifts that are added to the substructure phases to obtain starting phases for the native reflections. These are then improved by density modification and, if the resolution of the data and the type of structure permit, polyalanine tracing. A number of extensions to the tracing algorithm are discussed; these are designed to improve its performance at low resolution. Given native data to 2.5 Å resolution or better, a correlation coefficient greater than 25% between the structure factors calculated from such a trace and the native data is usually a good indication that the structure has been solved.",

Scaling corrects for effects such as changes in sample illumination, absorption and, to some extent, global radiation damage that cause the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent observations to differ throughout a data set. This necessarily requires a prior evaluation of the point-group symmetry of the crystal. This paper describes and evaluates the scaling algorithms implemented within the DIALS data-processing package and demonstrates the effectiveness and key features of the implementation on example macromolecular crystallographic rotation data. In particular, the scaling algorithms enable new workflows for the scaling of multi-crystal or multi-sweep data sets, providing the analysis required to support current trends towards collecting data from ever-smaller samples. In addition, the implementation of a free-set validation method is discussed, which allows the quantification of the suitability of scaling-model and algorithm choices.",

    "abstract": "A new method called Pepsi-SAXS is presented that calculates small-angle X-ray scattering profiles from atomistic models. The method is based on the multipole expansion scheme and is significantly faster compared with other tested methods. In particular, using the Nyquist–Shannon–Kotelnikov sampling theorem, the multipole expansion order is adapted to the size of the model and the resolution of the experimental data. It is argued that by using the adaptive expansion order, this method has the same quadratic dependence on the number of atoms in the model as the Debye-based approach, but with a much smaller prefactor in the computational complexity. The method has been systematically validated on a large set of over 50 models collected from the BioIsis and SASBDB databases. Using a laptop, it was demonstrated that Pepsi-SAXS is about seven, 29 and 36 times faster compared with CRYSOL , FoXS and the three-dimensional Zernike method in SAStbx , respectively, when tested on data from the BioIsis database, and is about five, 21 and 25 times faster compared with CRYSOL , FoXS and SAStbx , respectively, when tested on data from SASBDB. On average, Pepsi-SAXS demonstrates comparable accuracy in terms of χ 2 to CRYSOL and FoXS when tested on BioIsis and SASBDB profiles. Together with a small allowed variation of adjustable parameters, this demonstrates the effectiveness of the method. Pepsi-SAXS is available at http://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/pepsi-saxs.",

    "abstract": "Electron diffraction is a relatively novel alternative to X-ray crystallography for the structure determination of macromolecules from three-dimensional nanometre-sized crystals. The continuous-rotation method of data collection has been adapted for the electron microscope. However, there are important differences in geometry that must be considered for successful data integration. The wavelength of electrons in a TEM is typically around 40 times shorter than that of X-rays, implying a nearly flat Ewald sphere, and consequently low diffraction angles and a high effective sample-to-detector distance. Nevertheless, the DIALS software package can, with specific adaptations, successfully process continuous-rotation electron diffraction data. Pathologies encountered specifically in electron diffraction make data integration more challenging. Errors can arise from instrumentation, such as beam drift or distorted diffraction patterns from lens imperfections. The diffraction geometry brings additional challenges such as strong correlation between lattice parameters and detector distance. These issues are compounded if calibration is incomplete, leading to uncertainty in experimental geometry, such as the effective detector distance and the rotation rate or direction. Dynamic scattering, absorption, radiation damage and incomplete wedges of data are additional factors that complicate data processing. Here, recent features of DIALS as adapted to electron diffraction processing are shown, including diagnostics for problematic diffraction geometry refinement, refinement of a smoothly varying beam model and corrections for distorted diffraction images. These novel features, combined with the existing tools in DIALS , make data integration and refinement feasible for electron crystallography, even in difficult cases.",

It is therefore necessary to combine diffraction images from a large number of crystals (hundreds to hundreds of thousands) to obtain a final data set, bringing about sample-refreshment challenges that have previously been unknown to the MX synchrotron community. In view of this experimental complexity, a number of sample delivery methods have emerged, each with specific requirements, drawbacks and advantages. To provide useful selection criteria for future experiments, this review summarizes the currently available sample delivery methods, emphasising the basic principles and the specific sample requirements. Two main approaches to sample delivery are first covered: (i) injector methods with liquid or viscous media and (ii) fixed-target methods using large crystals or using microcrystals inside multi-crystal holders or chips. Additionally, hybrid methods such as acoustic droplet ejection and crystal extraction are covered, which combine the advantages of both fixed-target and injector approaches.",

    "abstract": "The low reproducibility of published experimental results in many scientific disciplines has recently garnered negative attention in scientific journals and the general media. Public transparency, including the availability of `raw' experimental data, will help to address growing concerns regarding scientific integrity. Macromolecular X-ray crystallography has led the way in requiring the public dissemination of atomic coordinates and a wealth of experimental data, making the field one of the most reproducible in the biological sciences. However, there remains no mandate for public disclosure of the original diffraction data. The Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography (IRRMC) has been developed to archive raw data from diffraction experiments and, equally importantly, to provide related metadata. Currently, the database of our resource contains data from 2920 macromolecular diffraction experiments (5767 data sets), accounting for around 3% of all depositions in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with their corresponding partially curated metadata. IRRMC utilizes distributed storage implemented using a federated architecture of many independent storage servers, which provides both scalability and sustainability. The resource, which is accessible via the web portal at http://www.proteindiffraction.org, can be searched using various criteria. All data are available for unrestricted access and download. The resource serves as a proof of concept and demonstrates the feasibility of archiving raw diffraction data and associated metadata from X-ray crystallographic studies of biological macromolecules. The goal is to expand this resource and include data sets that failed to yield X-ray structures in order to facilitate collaborative efforts that will improve protein structure-determination methods and to ensure the availability of `orphan' data left behind for various reasons by individual investigators and/or extinct structural genomics projects.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in instrumentation and software have resulted in cryo-EM rapidly becoming the method of choice for structural biologists, especially for those studying the three-dimensional structures of very large macromolecular complexes. In this contribution, the tools available for macromolecular structure refinement into cryo-EM reconstructions that are available via CCP-EM are reviewed, specifically focusing on REFMAC 5 and related tools. Whilst originally designed with a view to refinement against X-ray diffraction data, some of these tools have been able to be repurposed for cryo-EM owing to the same principles being applicable to refinement against cryo-EM maps. Since both techniques are used to elucidate macromolecular structures, tools encapsulating prior knowledge about macromolecules can easily be transferred. However, there are some significant qualitative differences that must be acknowledged and accounted for; relevant differences between these techniques are highlighted. The importance of phases is considered and the potential utility of replacing inaccurate amplitudes with their expectations is justified. More pragmatically, an upper bound on the correlation between observed and calculated Fourier coefficients, expressed in terms of the Fourier shell correlation between half-maps, is demonstrated. The importance of selecting appropriate levels of map blurring/sharpening is emphasized, which may be facilitated by considering the behaviour of the average map amplitude at different resolutions, as well as the utility of simultaneously viewing multiple blurred/sharpened maps. Features that are important for the purposes of computational efficiency are discussed, notably the Divide and Conquer pipeline for the parallel refinement of large macromolecular complexes. Techniques that have recently been developed or improved in Coot to facilitate and expedite the building, fitting and refinement of atomic models into cryo-EM maps are summarized. Finally, a tool for symmetry identification from a given map or coordinate set, ProSHADE , which can identify the point group of a map and thus may be used during deposition as well as during molecular visualization, is introduced.",

    "abstract": "XChemExplorer (XCE) is a data-management and workflow tool to support large-scale simultaneous analysis of protein-ligand complexes during structure-based ligand discovery (SBLD). The user interfaces of established crystallographic software packages such as CCP4 [Winn et al. (2011), Acta Cryst. D67, 235-242] or PHENIX [Adams et al. (2010), Acta Cryst. D66, 213-221] have entrenched the paradigm that a `project' is concerned with solving one structure. This does not hold for SBLD, where many almost identical structures need to be solved and analysed quickly in one batch of work. Functionality to track progress and annotate structures is essential. XCE provides an intuitive graphical user interface which guides the user from data processing, initial map calculation, ligand identification and refinement up until data dissemination. It provides multiple entry points depending on the need of each project, enables batch processing of multiple data sets and records metadata, progress and annotations in an SQLite database. XCE is freely available and works on any Linux and Mac OS X system, and the only dependency is to have the latest version of CCP4 installed. The design and usage of this tool are described here, and its usefulness is demonstrated in the context of fragment-screening campaigns at the Diamond Light Source. It is routinely used to analyse projects comprising 1000 data sets or more, and therefore scales well to even very large ligand-design projects.",

    "abstract": "The steady expansion in the capacity of modern beamlines for high-throughput data collection, enabled by increasing X-ray brightness, capacity of robotics and detector speeds, has pushed the bottleneck upstream towards sample preparation. Even in ligand-binding studies using crystal soaking, the experiment best able to exploit beamline capacity, a primary limitation is the need for gentle and nontrivial soaking regimens such as stepwise concentration increases, even for robust and well characterized crystals. Here, the use of acoustic droplet ejection for the soaking of protein crystals with small molecules is described, and it is shown that it is both gentle on crystals and allows very high throughput, with 1000 unique soaks easily performed in under 10 min. In addition to having very low compound consumption (tens of nanolitres per sample), the positional precision of acoustic droplet ejection enables the targeted placement of the compound/solvent away from crystals and towards drop edges, allowing gradual diffusion of solvent across the drop. This ensures both an improvement in the reproducibility of X-ray diffraction and increased solvent tolerance of the crystals, thus enabling higher effective compound-soaking concentrations. The technique is detailed here with examples from the protein target JMJD2D, a histone lysine demethylase with roles in cancer and the focus of active structure-based drug-design efforts.",

    "abstract": "Here, a method for presenting crystals of soluble and membrane proteins growing in the lipid cubic or sponge phase for in situ diffraction data collection at cryogenic temperatures is introduced. The method dispenses with the need for the technically demanding and inefficient crystal-harvesting step that is an integral part of the lipid cubic phase or in meso method of growing crystals. Crystals are dispersed in a bolus of mesophase sandwiched between thin plastic windows. The bolus contains tens to hundreds of crystals, visible with an in-line microscope at macromolecular crystallography synchrotron beamlines and suitably disposed for conventional or serial crystallographic data collection. Wells containing the crystal-laden boluses are removed individually from hermetically sealed glass plates in which crystallization occurs, affixed to pins on goniometer bases and excess precipitant is removed from around the mesophase. The wells are snap-cooled in liquid nitrogen, stored and shipped in Dewars, and manually or robotically mounted on a goniometer in a cryostream for diffraction data collection at 100 K, as is performed routinely with standard, loop-harvested crystals. The method is a variant on the recently introduced in meso in situ serial crystallography (IMISX) method that enables crystallographic measurements at cryogenic temperatures where crystal lifetimes are enormously enhanced whilst reducing protein consumption dramatically. The new approach has been used to generate high-resolution crystal structures of a G-protein-coupled receptor, α-helical and β-barrel transporters and an enzyme as model integral membrane proteins. Insulin and lysozyme were used as test soluble proteins. The quality of the data that can be generated by this method was attested to by performing sulfur and bromine SAD phasing with two of the test proteins.",

This is at least an order of magnitude smaller than was previously possible. The molecular-replacement solution, based on a monomeric polyalanine model, provided sufficient phasing power to show side-chain density, and automated model building was used to reconstruct the side chains. Diffraction data were acquired using the rotation method with parallel beam diffraction on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope equipped with a novel in-house-designed 1024 × 1024 pixel Timepix hybrid pixel detector for low-dose diffraction data collection. Favourable detector characteristics include the ability to accurately discriminate single high-energy electrons from X-rays and count them, fast readout to finely sample reciprocal space and a high dynamic range. This work, together with other recent milestones, suggests that electron crystallography can provide an attractive alternative in determining biological structures.",

Here, a series of new methods are presented based on the use of a low X-ray-background film as a crystallization support and a photoablation laser that enable the automation of major operations required for the preparation of crystals for X-ray diffraction experiments. In this approach, the controlled removal of the mother liquor before crystal mounting simplifies the cryocooling process, in many cases eliminating the use of cryoprotectant agents, while crystal-soaking experiments are performed through diffusion, precluding the need for repeated sample-recovery and transfer operations. Moreover, the high-precision laser enables new mounting strategies that are not accessible through other methods. This approach bridges an important gap in automation and can contribute to expanding the capabilities of modern macromolecular crystallography facilities.",

Large parts of the predicted models typically approach the accuracy of experimentally determined structures, although there are frequently local errors and errors in the relative orientations of domains. Importantly, residues in the model of a protein predicted by AlphaFold are tagged with a predicted local distance difference test score, informing users about which regions of the structure are predicted with less confidence. AlphaFold also produces a predicted aligned error matrix indicating its confidence in the relative positions of each pair of residues in the predicted model. The phenix.process_predicted_model tool downweights or removes low-confidence residues and can break a model into confidently predicted domains in preparation for molecular replacement or cryo-EM docking. These confidence metrics are further used in ISOLDE to weight torsion and atom–atom distance restraints, allowing the complete AlphaFold model to be interactively rearranged to match the docked fragments and reducing the need for the rebuilding of connecting regions.",

It is often necessary to merge data sets from multiple crystals; for example, small-wedge data collections from micro-crystals, in situ room-temperature data collections and data collection from membrane proteins in lipidic mesophases. Whilst the indexing and integration of individual data sets may be relatively straightforward with existing software, merging multiple data sets from small wedges presents new challenges. The identification of a consensus symmetry can be problematic, particularly in the presence of a potential indexing ambiguity. Furthermore, the presence of non-isomorphous or poor-quality data sets may reduce the overall quality of the final merged data set. To facilitate and help to optimize the scaling and merging of multiple data sets, a new program, xia2.multiplex, has been developed which takes data sets individually integrated with DIALS and performs symmetry analysis, scaling and merging of multi-crystal data sets. xia2.multiplex also performs analysis of various pathologies that typically affect multi-crystal data sets, including non-isomorphism, radiation damage and preferential orientation. After the description of a number of use cases, the benefit of xia2.multiplex is demonstrated within a wider autoprocessing framework in facilitating a multi-crystal experiment collected as part of in situ room-temperature fragment-screening experiments on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.",

Here, an automatic procedure requiring only sequence information and crystallographic data is presented that uses AlphaFold predictions to produce an electron-density map and a structural model. Iterating through cycles of structure prediction is a key element of this procedure: a predicted model rebuilt in one cycle is used as a template for prediction in the next cycle. This procedure was applied to X-ray data for 215 structures released by the Protein Data Bank in a recent six-month period. In 87% of cases our procedure yielded a model with at least 50% of C α atoms matching those in the deposited models within 2 Å. Predictions from the iterative template-guided prediction procedure were more accurate than those obtained without templates. It is concluded that AlphaFold predictions obtained based on sequence information alone are usually accurate enough to solve the crystallographic phase problem with molecular replacement, and a general strategy for macromolecular structure determination that includes AI-based prediction both as a starting point and as a method of model optimization is suggested.",

Protein crystals of various sizes are presented to the X-ray beam in either a static or a moving medium. Photoactive proteins were naturally the initial systems to be studied in TR-SX experiments using pump–probe schemes, where the pump is a pulse of visible light. Other reaction initiations through small-molecule diffusion are gaining momentum. Here, selected examples of XFEL and synchrotron time-resolved crystallography studies will be used to highlight the specificities of the various instruments and methods with respect to time resolution, and are compared with cryo-trapping studies.",

Such cases are identified and analyzed, showing that duplication is possible since the PDB does not currently have tools or mechanisms that would detect potentially duplicate submissions. Some duplicated entries represent modeling efforts of ligand binding that masquerade as experimentally determined structures. We propose that duplicate entries should either be obsoleted by the PDB or, as a minimum, marked with a clear `CAVEAT' record that would alert potential users to the presence of such problems. We also suggest that using a tool for verifying the uniqueness of the deposited structure, such as that presented in this work, should become part of the routine validation procedure for new depositions.",

ProSMART is a program that can generate restraints for macromolecules using homologous structures, as well as generic restraints for the stabilization of secondary structures. These restraints are used by REFMAC 5 to stabilize the refinement of an atomic model. However, the optimal refinement protocol varies from case to case, and it is not always obvious how to select appropriate homologous structure(s), or other sources of prior information, for restraint generation. After running extensive tests on a large data set of low-resolution models, the best-performing refinement protocols and strategies for the selection of homologous structures have been identified. These strategies and protocols have been implemented in the Low-Resolution Structure Refinement ( LORESTR ) pipeline. The pipeline performs auto-detection of twinning and selects the optimal scaling method and solvent parameters. LORESTR can either use user-supplied homologous structures, or run an automated BLAST search and download homologues from the PDB. The pipeline executes multiple model-refinement instances using different parameters in order to find the best protocol. Tests show that the automated pipeline improves R factors, geometry and Ramachandran statistics for 94% of the low-resolution cases from the PDB included in the test set.",

Recently developed self-wicking EM grids allow the use of small volumes of sample, with nanowires on the grid bars removing excess solution to produce a thin film within tens of milliseconds from sample application to freezing. Here, a simple cryo-EM specimen-preparation device that uses components from an ultrasonic humidifier to transfer protein solution onto a self-wicking EM grid is presented. The device is controlled by a Raspberry Pi single-board computer and all components are either widely available or can be manufactured by online services, allowing the device to be constructed in laboratories that specialize in cryo-EM rather than instrument design.

Typical systems studied include multi-protein or protein-DNA/RNA complexes and solubilized membrane proteins. The internal features of these systems are less accessible to the more broadly used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique owing to a limited range of intra-complex and solvent electron-density variation. Here, the progress and developments of biological applications of SANS in the past decade are reviewed. The review covers scientific results from selected biological systems, including protein-protein complexes, protein-RNA/DNA complexes and membrane proteins. Moreover, an overview of recent developments in instruments, sample environment, deuterium labelling and software is presented.

The quality with which small-molecule ligands have been modelled in Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries has been, and continues to be, a matter of concern for many investigators. Correctly interpreting whether electron density found in a binding site is compatible with the soaked or co-crystallized ligand or represents water or buffer molecules is often far from trivial. The Worldwide PDB validation report (VR) provides a mechanism to highlight any major issues concerning the quality of the data and the model at the time of deposition and annotation, so the depositors can fix issues, resulting in improved data quality. The ligand-validation methods used in the generation of the current VRs are described in detail, including an examination of the metrics to assess both geometry and electron-density fit. It is found that the LLDF score currently used to identify ligand electron-density fit outliers can give misleading results and that better ligand-validation metrics are required.",

    "abstract": "Crystallography chips are fixed-target supports consisting of a film (for example Kapton) or wafer (for example silicon) that is processed using semiconductor-microfabrication techniques to yield an array of wells or through-holes in which single microcrystals can be lodged for raster-scan probing. Although relatively expensive to fabricate, chips offer an efficient means of high-throughput sample presentation for serial diffraction data collection at synchrotron or X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources. Truly efficient loading of a chip (one microcrystal per well and no wastage during loading) is nonetheless challenging. The wells or holes must match the microcrystal size of interest, requiring that a large stock of chips be maintained. Raster scanning requires special mechanical drives to step the chip rapidly and with micrometre precision from well to well. Here, a `chip-less' adaptation is described that essentially eliminates the challenges of loading and precision scanning, albeit with increased, yet still relatively frugal, sample usage. The device consists simply of two sheets of Mylar with the crystal solution sandwiched between them. This sheet-on-sheet (SOS) sandwich structure has been employed for serial femtosecond crystallography data collection with micrometre-sized crystals at an XFEL. The approach is also well suited to time-resolved pump–probe experiments, in particular for long time delays. The SOS sandwich enables measurements under XFEL beam conditions that would damage conventional chips, as documented here. The SOS sheets hermetically seal the sample, avoiding desiccation of the sample provided that the X-ray beam does not puncture the sheets. This is the case with a synchrotron beam but not with an XFEL beam. In the latter case, desiccation, setting radially outwards from each punched hole, sets lower limits on the speed and line spacing of the raster scan. It is shown that these constraints are easily accommodated.",

    "abstract": "Higher throughput methods to mount and collect data from multiple small and radiation-sensitive crystals are important to support challenging structural investigations using microfocus synchrotron beamlines. Furthermore, efficient sample-delivery methods are essential to carry out productive femtosecond crystallography experiments at X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). To address these needs, a high-density sample grid useful as a scaffold for both crystal growth and diffraction data collection has been developed and utilized for efficient goniometer-based sample delivery at synchrotron and XFEL sources. A single grid contains 75 mounting ports and fits inside an SSRL cassette or uni-puck storage container. The use of grids with an SSRL cassette expands the cassette capacity up to 7200 samples. Grids may also be covered with a polymer film or sleeve for efficient room-temperature data collection from multiple samples. New automated routines have been incorporated into the Blu-Ice/DCSS experimental control system to support grids, including semi-automated grid alignment, fully automated positioning of grid ports, rastering and automated data collection. Specialized tools have been developed to support crystallization experiments on grids, including a universal adaptor, which allows grids to be filled by commercial liquid-handling robots, as well as incubation chambers, which support vapor-diffusion and lipidic cubic phase crystallization experiments. Experiments in which crystals were loaded into grids or grown on grids using liquid-handling robots and incubation chambers are described. Crystals were screened at LCLS-XPP and SSRL BL12-2 at room temperature and cryogenic temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The crystallographic diffraction experiment measures Bragg intensities; crystallographic electron-density maps and other crystallographic calculations in phasing require structure-factor amplitudes. If data were measured with no errors, the structure-factor amplitudes would be trivially proportional to the square roots of the intensities. When the experimental errors are large, and especially when random errors yield negative net intensities, the conversion of intensities and their error estimates into amplitudes and associated error estimates becomes nontrivial. Although this problem has been addressed intermittently in the history of crystallographic phasing, current approaches to accounting for experimental errors in macromolecular crystallography have numerous significant defects. These have been addressed with the formulation of LLGI, a log-likelihood-gain function in terms of the Bragg intensities and their associated experimental error estimates. LLGI has the correct asymptotic behaviour for data with large experimental error, appropriately downweighting these reflections without introducing bias. LLGI abrogates the need for the conversion of intensity data to amplitudes, which is usually performed with the French and Wilson method [French & Wilson (1978), Acta Cryst. A35, 517-525], wherever likelihood target functions are required. It has general applicability for a wide variety of algorithms in macromolecular crystallography, including scaling, characterizing anisotropy and translational noncrystallographic symmetry, detecting outliers, experimental phasing, molecular replacement and refinement. Because it is impossible to reliably recover the original intensity data from amplitudes, it is suggested that crystallographers should always deposit the intensity data in the Protein Data Bank.",

    "abstract": "The DIALS diffraction-modeling software package has been applied to serial crystallography data. Diffraction modeling is an exercise in determining the experimental parameters, such as incident beam wavelength, crystal unit cell and orientation, and detector geometry, that are most consistent with the observed positions of Bragg spots. These parameters can be refined by nonlinear least-squares fitting. In previous work, it has been challenging to refine both the positions of the sensors (metrology) on multipanel imaging detectors such as the CSPAD and the orientations of all of the crystals studied. Since the optimal models for metrology and crystal orientation are interdependent, alternate cycles of panel refinement and crystal refinement have been required. To simplify the process, a sparse linear algebra technique for solving the normal equations was implemented, allowing the detector panels to be refined simultaneously against the diffraction from thousands of crystals with excellent computational performance. Separately, it is shown how to refine the metrology of a second CSPAD detector, positioned at a distance of 2.5 m from the crystal, used for recording low-angle reflections. With the ability to jointly refine the detector position against the ensemble of all crystals used for structure determination, it is shown that ensemble refinement greatly reduces the apparent nonisomorphism that is often observed in the unit-cell distributions from still-shot serial crystallography. In addition, it is shown that batching the images by timestamp and re-refining the detector position can realistically model small, time-dependent variations in detector position relative to the sample, and thereby improve the integrated structure-factor intensity signal and heavy-atom anomalous peak heights.",

    "abstract": "Recent technological advances, such as the introduction of the direct electron detector, have transformed the field of cryo-EM and the landscape of molecular and cellular structural biology. This study analyses these trends from the vantage point of the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB), the public archive for three-dimensional EM reconstructions. Over 1000 entries were released in 2016, representing almost a quarter of the total number of entries (4431). Structures at better than 6 Å resolution now represent one of the fastest-growing categories, while the share of annually released tomography-related structures is approaching 20%. The use of direct electron detectors is growing very rapidly: they were used for 70% of the structures released in 2016, in contrast to none before 2011. Microscopes from FEI have an overwhelming lead in terms of usage, and the use of the RELION software package continues to grow rapidly after having attained a leading position in the field. China is rapidly emerging as a major player in the field, supplementing the US, Germany and the UK as the big four. Similarly, Tsinghua University ranks only second to the MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology in terms of involvement in publications associated with cryo-EM structures at better than 4 Å resolution. Overall, the numbers point to a rapid democratization of the field, with more countries and institutes becoming involved.",

The advantage of the crYOLO -based procedure is that it performs accurately on very challenging data sets and selects filaments with high accuracy. Although STRIPER is less precise, the user benefits from less intervention, since in contrast to crYOLO , STRIPER does not require training. The performance of both procedures on Tobacco mosaic virus and filamentous F-actin data sets is described to demonstrate the robustness of each method.",

    "abstract": "The functions of most proteins result from their 3D structures, but determining their structures experimentally remains a challenge, despite steady advances in crystallography, NMR and single-particle cryoEM. Computationally predicting the structure of a protein from its primary sequence has long been a grand challenge in bioinformatics, intimately connected with understanding protein chemistry and dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, combined with the availability of genomic data for inferring co-evolutionary patterns, provide a new approach to protein structure prediction that is complementary to longstanding physics-based approaches. The outstanding performance of AlphaFold2 in the recent Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) experiment demonstrates the remarkable power of deep learning in structure prediction. In this perspective, we focus on the key features of AlphaFold2, including its use of (i) attention mechanisms and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) symmetry principles to facilitate reasoning over protein structures in three dimensions and (iii) end-to-end differentiability as a unifying framework for learning from protein data. The rules of protein folding are ultimately encoded in the physical principles that underpin it; to conclude, the implications of having a powerful computational model for structure prediction that does not explicitly rely on those principles are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The breakthrough recently made in protein structure prediction by deep-learning programs such as AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold will certainly revolutionize biology over the coming decades. The scientific community is only starting to appreciate the various applications, benefits and limitations of these protein models. Yet, after the first thrills due to this revolution, it is important to evaluate the impact of the proposed models and their overall quality to avoid the misinterpretation or overinterpretation of these models by biologists. One of the first applications of these models is in solving the `phase problem' encountered in X-ray crystallography in calculating electron-density maps from diffraction data. Indeed, the most frequently used technique to derive electron-density maps is molecular replacement. As this technique relies on knowledge of the structure of a protein that shares strong structural similarity with the studied protein, the availability of high-accuracy models is then definitely critical for successful structure solution. After the collection of a 2.45 Å resolution data set, we struggled for two years in trying to solve the crystal structure of a protein involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, an mRNA quality-control pathway dedicated to the elimination of eukaryotic mRNAs harboring premature stop codons. We used different methods (isomorphous replacement, anomalous diffraction and molecular replacement) to determine this structure, but all failed until we straightforwardly succeeded thanks to both AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold models. Here, we describe how these new models helped us to solve this structure and conclude that in our case the AlphaFold model largely outcompetes the other models. We also discuss the importance of search-model generation for successful molecular replacement.",

Single-particle cryo-EM provides a powerful platform to approach this challenge, since samples can be frozen faster than the single-turnover timescales of most biochemical reactions. In order to enable time-resolved analysis, significant innovations in the handling and preparation of cryo-EM samples have been implemented, bringing us closer to the goal of the direct observation of protein dynamics in the milliseconds to seconds range.

FABPs are known to associate with membranes and also enter the nucleus. Using NMR and a human FABP4 (hFABP4) preparation completely free of endogenous ligands, we studied the influence of fatty acids and inhibitors on the conformational flexibility and bicelle/membrane association of this isoform. Binding of fatty acids and ligands rigidifies hFABP4, particularly at the portal region where ligands enter the binding site. Depending on the nature of the ligand, hFABP4 stays associated with bicelles via the portal region or segregates into solution, a prerequisite for nuclear import using a nonclassical nuclear localization signal. These results indicate that different ligands can lead to different biological outcomes. One of the major determinants for FABP4 segregation is Phe58, which in X-ray crystal structures adopts different conformations as a function of ligand volume. It is possible that other FABP isoforms use a similar mechanism for ligand-dependent membrane detachment and activation of nuclear import.",

    "abstract": "Although noncovalent binding by small molecules cannot be assumed a priori to be stoichiometric in the crystal lattice, occupancy refinement of ligands is often avoided by convention. Occupancies tend to be set to unity, requiring the occupancy error to be modelled by the B factors, and residual weak density around the ligand is necessarily attributed to `disorder'. Where occupancy refinement is performed, the complementary, superposed unbound state is rarely modelled. Here, it is shown that superior accuracy is achieved by modelling the ligand as partially occupied and superposed on a ligand-free `ground-state' model. Explicit incorporation of this model of the crystal, obtained from a reference data set, allows constrained occupancy refinement with minimal fear of overfitting. Better representation of the crystal also leads to more meaningful refined atomic parameters such as the B factor, allowing more insight into dynamics in the crystal. An outline of an approach for algorithmically generating ensemble models of crystals is presented, assuming that data sets representing the ground state are available. The applicability of various electron-density metrics to the validation of the resulting models is assessed, and it is concluded that ensemble models consistently score better than the corresponding single-state models. Furthermore, it appears that ignoring the superposed ground state becomes the dominant source of model error, locally, once the overall model is accurate enough; modelling the local ground state properly is then more meaningful than correcting all remaining model errors globally, especially for low-occupancy ligands. Implications for the simultaneous refinement of B factors and occupancies, and for future evaluation of the limits of the approach, in particular its behaviour at lower data resolution, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "There are more H atoms than any other type of atom in an X-ray crystal structure of a protein-ligand complex, but as H atoms only have one electron they diffract X-rays weakly and are `hard to see'. The positions of many H atoms can be inferred by our chemical knowledge, and such H atoms can be added with confidence in `riding positions'. For some chemical groups, however, there is more ambiguity over the possible hydrogen placements, for example hydroxyls and groups that can exist in multiple protonation states or tautomeric forms. This ambiguity is far from rare, since about 25% of drugs have more than one tautomeric form. This paper focuses on the most common, `prototropic', tautomers, which are isomers that readily interconvert by the exchange of an H atom accompanied by the switch of a single and an adjacent double bond. Hydrogen-exchange rates and different protonation states of compounds (e.g. buffers) are also briefly discussed. The difference in heavy (non-H) atom positions between two tautomers can be small, and careful refinement of all possible tautomers may single out the likely bound ligand tautomer. Experimental methods to determine H-atom positions, such as neutron crystallography, are often technically challenging. Therefore, chemical knowledge and computational approaches are frequently used in conjugation with experimental data to deduce the bound tautomer state. Proton movement is a key feature of many enzymatic reactions, so understanding the orchestration of hydrogen/proton motion is of critical importance to biological chemistry. For example, structural studies have suggested that, just as a chemist may use heat, some enzymes use directional movement to protonate specific O atoms on phosphates to catalyse phosphotransferase reactions. To inhibit `wriggly' enzymes that use movement to effect catalysis, it may be advantageous to have inhibitors that can maintain favourable contacts by adopting different tautomers as the enzyme `wriggles'.",

The structures of lan YFP and mNeonGreen have been determined and compared in order to rationalize the directed evolution process leading from a bright, tetrameric to a still bright, monomeric fluorescent protein. An unusual discolouration of crystals of mNeonGreen was observed after X-ray data collection, which was investigated using a combination of X-ray crystallography and UV–visible absorption and Raman spectroscopies, revealing the effects of specific radiation damage in the chromophore cavity.

Motivated by recent studies identifying a chemically diverse array of lysine acyl modifications in vivo, the acyl-chain specificity of the acetyltransferase human Gcn5 (Gcn5L2) was examined. Whereas Gcn5L2 robustly catalyzes lysine acetylation, the acyltransferase activity of Gcn5L2 becomes progressively weaker with increasing acyl-chain length. To understand how Gcn5 discriminates between different acyl-CoA molecules, structures of the catalytic domain of human Gcn5L2 bound to propionyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA were determined. Although the active site of Gcn5L2 can accommodate propionyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA without major structural rearrangements, butyryl-CoA adopts a conformation incompatible with catalysis that obstructs the path of the incoming lysine residue and acts as a competitive inhibitor of Gcn5L2 versus acetyl-CoA. These structures demonstrate how Gcn5L2 discriminates between acyl-chain donors and explain why Gcn5L2 has weak activity for acyl moieties that are larger than an acetyl group.",

    "abstract": "K-Ras, a molecular switch that regulates cell growth, apoptosis and metabolism, is activated when it undergoes a conformation change upon binding GTP and is deactivated following the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Hydrolysis of GTP in water is accelerated by coordination to K-Ras, where GTP adopts a high-energy conformation approaching the transition state. The G12A mutation reduces intrinsic K-Ras GTP hydrolysis by an unexplained mechanism. Here, crystal structures of G12A K-Ras in complex with GDP, GTP, GTPγS and GppNHp, and of Q61A K-Ras in complex with GDP, are reported. In the G12A K-Ras-GTP complex, the switch I region undergoes a significant reorganization such that the Tyr32 side chain points towards the GTP-binding pocket and forms a hydrogen bond to the GTP γ-phosphate, effectively stabilizing GTP in its precatalytic state, increasing the activation energy required to reach the transition state and contributing to the reduced intrinsic GTPase activity of G12A K-Ras mutants.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to twinning by merohedry, the reciprocal lattices of the different domains of non-merohedral twins do not overlap exactly. This leads to three kinds of reflections: reflections with no overlap, reflections with an exact overlap and reflections with a partial overlap of a reflection from a second domain. This complicates the unit-cell determination, indexing, data integration and scaling of X-ray diffraction data. However, with hindsight it is possible to detwin the data because there are reflections that are not affected by the twinning. In this article, the successful solution and refinement of one mineral, one organometallic and two protein non-merohedral twins using a common strategy are described. The unit-cell constants and the orientation matrices were determined by the program CELL_NOW . The data were then integrated with SAINT . TWINABS was used for scaling, empirical absorption corrections and the generation of two different data files, one with detwinned data for structure solution and refinement and a second one for (usually more accurate) structure refinement against total integrated intensities. The structures were solved by experimental phasing using SHELXT for the first two structures and SHELXC / D / E for the two protein structures; all models were refined with SHELXL .",

Here, it is shown that solution sprayed onto one side of a holey cryoEM grid can be wicked through the grid by a glass-fiber filter held against the opposite side, often called the `back', of the grid, producing a film suitable for vitrification. This process can be completed in tens of milliseconds. Ultrasonic specimen application and through-grid wicking were combined in a high-speed specimen-preparation device that was named `Back-it-up' or BIU. The high liquid-absorption capacity of the glass fiber compared with self-wicking grids makes the method relatively insensitive to the amount of sample applied. Consequently, through-grid wicking produces large areas of ice that are suitable for cryoEM for both soluble and detergent-solubilized protein complexes. The speed of the device increases the number of views for a specimen that suffers from preferred orientations.",

Over the last 30 years synchrotron radiation has nucleated a succession of advances, ranging from detectors to optics and automation. These advances, in turn, open up opportunities. For instance, a further order of magnitude could perhaps be gained in signal to noise for general synchrotron experiments. In addition, X-ray free-electron lasers offer to capture fragments of reciprocal space without radiation damage, and open up the subpicosecond regime of protein dynamics and activity. But electrons have recently stolen the limelight: so is X-ray crystallography in rude health, or will imaging methods, especially single-particle electron microscopy, render it obsolete for the most interesting biology, whilst electron diffraction enables structure determination from even the smallest crystals? We will lay out some information to help you decide.",

    "abstract": "ARCIMBOLDO solves the phase problem by combining the location of small model fragments using Phaser with density modification and autotracing using SHELXE. Mainly helical structures constitute favourable cases, which can be solved using polyalanine helical fragments as search models. Nevertheless, the solution of coiled-coil structures is often complicated by their anisotropic diffraction and apparent translational noncrystallographic symmetry. Long, straight helices have internal translational symmetry and their alignment in preferential directions gives rise to systematic overlap of Patterson vectors. This situation has to be differentiated from the translational symmetry relating different monomers. ARCIMBOLDO_LITE has been run on single workstations on a test pool of 150 coiled-coil structures with 15-635 amino acids per asymmetric unit and with diffraction data resolutions of between 0.9 and 3.0 Å. The results have been used to identify and address specific issues when solving this class of structures using ARCIMBOLDO. Features from Phaser v.2.7 onwards are essential to correct anisotropy and produce translation solutions that will pass the packing filters. As the resolution becomes worse than 2.3 Å, the helix direction may be reversed in the placed fragments. Differentiation between true solutions and pseudo-solutions, in which helix fragments were correctly positioned but in a reverse orientation, was found to be problematic at resolutions worse than 2.3 Å. Therefore, after every new fragment-placement round, complete or sparse combinations of helices in alternative directions are generated and evaluated. The final solution is once again probed by helix reversal, refinement and extension. To conclude, density modification and SHELXE autotracing incorporating helical constraints is also exploited to extend the resolution limit in the case of coiled coils and to enhance the identification of correct solutions. This study resulted in a specialized mode within ARCIMBOLDO for the solution of coiled-coil structures, which overrides the resolution limit and can be invoked from the command line (keyword coiled_coil) or ARCIMBOLDO_LITE task interface in CCP4i.",

However, the combination of crystal-to-crystal variation and X-ray-induced changes can make the formation of a final complete data set challenging; this is particularly true in the case of metalloproteins, where X-ray-induced changes occur rapidly and at the active site. An approach is described that allows the resolution, separation and structure determination of crystal polymorphs, and the tracking of radiation damage in microcrystals. Within the microcrystal population of copper nitrite reductase, two polymorphs with different unit-cell sizes were successfully separated to determine two independent structures, and an X-ray-driven change between these polymorphs was followed. This was achieved through the determination of multiple serial structures from microcrystals using a high-throughput high-speed fixed-target approach coupled with robust data processing.",

Owing to the intrinsic ability of the technique to discern between 1 H- and 2 H-labelled particles, it is especially useful for contrast-variation studies of biological systems containing multiple components. SANS is complementary to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), in which similar contrast variation is not easily performed but in which data with superior counting statistics are more easily obtained. Obtaining small-angle scattering (SAS) data on monodisperse complex biological structures is often challenging owing to sample degradation and/or aggregation. This problem is enhanced in the D 2 O-based buffers that are typically used in SANS. In SAXS, such problems are solved using an online size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) setup. In the present work, the feasibility of SEC–SANS was investigated using a series of complex and difficult samples of membrane proteins embedded in nanodisc particles that consist of both phospholipid and protein components. It is demonstrated that SEC–SANS provides data of sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for these systems, while at the same time circumventing aggregation. By combining SEC–SANS and SEC–SAXS data, an optimized basis for refining structural models of the investigated structures is obtained.",

Automated model-building programs such as Buccaneer often make it quicker and easier by completing most of the model in advance.

The Buccaneer pipeline is a relatively simple program that iterates Buccaneer with REFMAC to refine the model and update the map. A new pipeline called ModelCraft has been developed that expands on this to include shift-field refinement, machine-learned pruning of incorrect residues, classical density modification, addition of water and dummy atoms, building of nucleic acids and final rebuilding of side chains. Testing was performed on 1180 structures solved by experimental phasing, 1338 structures solved by molecular replacement using homologues and 2030 structures solved by molecular replacement using predicted AlphaFold models. Compared with the previous Buccaneer pipeline, ModelCraft increased the mean completeness of the protein models in the experimental phasing cases from 91% to 95%, the molecular-replacement cases from 50% to 78% and the AlphaFold cases from 82% to 91%.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has become a well established technique to elucidate the 3D structures of biological macromolecules. Projection images from thousands of macromolecules that are assumed to be structurally identical are combined into a single 3D map representing the Coulomb potential of the macromolecule under study. This article discusses possible caveats along the image-processing path and how to avoid them to obtain a reliable 3D structure. Some of these problems are very well known in the community. These may be referred to as sample-related (such as specimen denaturation at interfaces or non-uniform projection geometry leading to underrepresented projection directions). The rest are related to the algorithms used. While some have been discussed in depth in the literature, such as the use of an incorrect initial volume, others have received much less attention. However, they are fundamental in any data-analysis approach. Chiefly among them, instabilities in estimating many of the key parameters that are required for a correct 3D reconstruction that occur all along the processing workflow are referred to, which may significantly affect the reliability of the whole process. In the field, the term overfitting has been coined to refer to some particular kinds of artifacts. It is argued that overfitting is a statistical bias in key parameter-estimation steps in the 3D reconstruction process, including intrinsic algorithmic bias. It is also shown that common tools (Fourier shell correlation) and strategies (gold standard) that are normally used to detect or prevent overfitting do not fully protect against it. Alternatively, it is proposed that detecting the bias that leads to overfitting is much easier when addressed at the level of parameter estimation, rather than detecting it once the particle images have been combined into a 3D map. Comparing the results from multiple algorithms (or at least, independent executions of the same algorithm) can detect parameter bias. These multiple executions could then be averaged to give a lower variance estimate of the underlying parameters.",

In contrast to the well studied two-component tryptophan halogenases, AetF is a single-component flavoprotein monooxygenase. Here, crystal structures of AetF alone and in complex with various substrates are presented, representing the first experimental structures of a single-component FDH. Rotational pseudosymmetry and pseudomerohedral twinning complicated the phasing of one structure. AetF is structurally related to flavin-dependent monooxygenases. It contains two dinucleotide-binding domains for binding the ADP moiety with unusual sequences that deviate from the consensus sequences G X G XX G and G X G XX A. A large domain tightly binds the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), while the small domain responsible for binding the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADP) is unoccupied. About half of the protein forms additional structural elements containing the tryptophan binding site. FAD and tryptophan are about 16 Å apart. A tunnel between them presumably allows diffusion of the active halogenating agent hypohalous acid from FAD to the substrate. Tryptophan and 5-bromotryptophan bind to the same site but with a different binding pose. A flip of the indole moiety identically positions C5 of tryptophan and C7 of 5-bromotryptophan next to the tunnel and to catalytic residues, providing a simple explanation for the regioselectivity of the two successive halogenations. AetF can also bind 7-bromotryptophan in the same orientation as tryptophan. This opens the way for the biocatalytic production of differentially dihalogenated tryptophan derivatives. The structural conservation of a catalytic lysine suggests a way to identify novel single-component FDHs.",

    "abstract": "The validation of structural models obtained by macromolecular X-ray crystallography against experimental diffraction data, whether before deposition into the PDB or after, is typically carried out exclusively against the merged data that are eventually archived along with the atomic coordinates. It is shown here that the availability of unmerged reflection data enables valuable additional analyses to be performed that yield improvements in the final models, and tools are presented to implement them, together with examples of the results to which they give access. The first example is the automatic identification and removal of image ranges affected by loss of crystal centering or by excessive decay of the diffraction pattern as a result of radiation damage. The second example is the `reflection-auditing' process, whereby individual merged data items showing especially poor agreement with model predictions during refinement are investigated thanks to the specific metadata (such as image number and detector position) that are available for the corresponding unmerged data, potentially revealing previously undiagnosed instrumental, experimental or processing problems. The third example is the calculation of so-called F(early) - F(late) maps from carefully selected subsets of unmerged amplitude data, which can not only highlight the location and extent of radiation damage but can also provide guidance towards suitable fine-grained parametrizations to model the localized effects of such damage.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography is a rapidly developing field for studying macromolecular complexes in their native environments and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of protein function. However, fast and accurate identification of particles in cryo-tomograms is challenging and represents a significant bottleneck in downstream processes such as subtomogram averaging. Here, we present tomoCPT (Tomogram Centroid Prediction Tool), a transformer-based solution that reformulates particle detection as a centroid-prediction task using Gaussian labels. Our approach, which is built upon the SwinUNETR architecture, demonstrates superior performance compared with both conventional binary labelling strategies and template matching. We show that tomoCPT effectively generalizes to novel particle types through zero-shot inference and can be significantly enhanced through fine-tuning with limited data. The efficacy of tomoCPT is validated using three case studies: apoferritin, achieving a resolution of 3.0 Å compared with 3.3 Å using template matching, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins on cell surfaces, yielding an 18.3 Å resolution map where template matching proved unsuccessful, and rubisco molecules within carboxysomes, reaching 8.0 Å resolution. These results demonstrate the ability of tomoCPT to handle varied scenarios, including densely packed environments and membrane-bound proteins. The implementation of the tool as a command-line program, coupled with its minimal data requirements for fine-tuning, makes it a practical solution for high-throughput cryo-ET data-processing workflows.",

    "abstract": "Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) is an imaging technique that is widely used in structural biology to determine the three-dimensional structure of biological molecules from noisy two-dimensional projections with unknown orientations. As the typical pipeline involves processing large amounts of data, efficient algorithms are crucial for fast and reliable results. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been used to improve the speed of ab initio reconstruction, which results in an initial, low-resolution estimation of the volume representing the molecule of interest, but has yet to be applied successfully in the high-resolution regime, where expectation–maximization algorithms achieve state-of-the-art results, at a high computational cost. In this article, we investigate the conditioning of the optimization problem and show that the large condition number prevents the successful application of gradient descent-based methods at high resolution. Our results include a theoretical analysis of the condition number of the optimization problem in a simplified setting where the individual projection directions are known, an algorithm based on computing a diagonal preconditioner using Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and numerical experiments showing the improvement in the convergence speed when using the estimated preconditioner with SGD. The preconditioned SGD approach can potentially enable a simple and unified approach to ab initio reconstruction and high-resolution refinement with faster convergence speed and higher flexibility, and our results are a promising step in this direction.",

This makes it possible to collect diffraction data for hundreds of protein–ligand complexes within a day, provided that a suitable crystal system is at hand. However, developing a suitable crystal system can prove challenging, exceeding the timescale of data collection by several orders of magnitude. Firstly, a useful crystallization construct of the protein of interest needs to be chosen and its expression and purification optimized, before screening for suitable crystallization and soaking conditions can start. This article reviews recent publications analysing large data sets of crystallization trials, with the aim of identifying factors that do or do not make a good crystallization construct, and gives guidance in the design of an expression construct. It provides an overview of common protein-expression systems, addresses how ligand binding can be both help and hindrance for protein purification, and describes ligand co-crystallization and soaking, with an emphasis on troubleshooting.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding protein 39 (RBM39) is a splicing factor and a transcriptional co-activator of estrogen receptors and Jun/AP-1, and its function has been associated with malignant progression in a number of cancers. The C-terminal RRM domain of RBM39 belongs to the U2AF homology motif family (UHM), which mediate protein–protein interactions through a short tryptophan-containing peptide known as the UHM-ligand motif (ULM). Here, crystal and solution NMR structures of the RBM39-UHM domain, and the crystal structure of its complex with U2AF65-ULM, are reported. The RBM39–U2AF65 interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts, by isothermal titration calorimetry and by NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments with the purified proteins. When compared with related complexes, such as U2AF35–U2AF65 and RBM39–SF3b155, the RBM39-UHM–U2AF65-ULM complex reveals both common and discriminating recognition elements in the UHM–ULM binding interface, providing a rationale for the known specificity of UHM–ULM interactions. This study therefore establishes a structural basis for specific UHM–ULM interactions by splicing factors such as U2AF35, U2AF65, RBM39 and SF3b155, and a platform for continued studies of intermolecular interactions governing disease-related alternative splicing in eukaryotic cells.",

In addition, L-asparaginase is involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids such as lysine, methionine and threonine. These enzymes have been used as chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and other haematopoietic malignancies since the tumour cells cannot synthesize sufficient L-asparagine and are thus killed by deprivation of this amino acid. L-Asparaginases are also used in the food industry and have potential in the development of biosensors, for example for asparagine levels in leukaemia. The thermostable type I L-asparaginase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (TkA) is composed of 328 amino acids and forms homodimers in solution, with the highest catalytic activity being observed at pH 9.5 and 85°C. It has a K m value of 5.5 m M for L-asparagine, with no glutaminase activity being observed. The crystal structure of TkA has been determined at 2.18 Å resolution, confirming the presence of two α/β domains connected by a short linker region. The N-terminal domain contains a highly flexible β-hairpin which adopts `open' and `closed' conformations in different subunits of the solved TkA structure. In previously solved L-asparaginase structures this β-hairpin was only visible when in the `closed' conformation, whilst it is characterized with good electron density in all of the subunits of the TkA structure. A phosphate anion resides at the active site, which is formed by residues from both of the neighbouring monomers in the dimer. The high thermostability of TkA is attributed to the high arginine and salt-bridge content when compared with related mesophilic enzymes.",

The structures reveal a novel arrangement of two malectin-like domains connected by a short β-hairpin linker and stabilized by calcium ions. The canonical carbohydrate-interaction surfaces of related animal and bacterial carbohydrate-binding modules are not conserved in plant Cr RLK1Ls. In line with this, the binding of chemically diverse oligosaccharides to ANXUR1 and HERCULES1 could not be detected. Instead, Cr RLK1Ls have evolved a protein–protein interface between their malectin domains which forms a deep cleft lined by highly conserved aromatic and polar residues. Analysis of the glycosylation patterns of different Cr RLK1Ls and their oligomeric states suggests that this cleft could resemble a binding site for a ligand required for receptor activation of Cr RLK1Ls.",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in data-collection strategies have pushed the limits of native SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) phasing, a method that uses the weak anomalous signal of light elements naturally present in macromolecules. These involve the merging of multiple data sets from either multiple crystals or from a single crystal collected in multiple orientations at a low X-ray dose. Both approaches yield data of high multiplicity while minimizing radiation damage and systematic error, thus ensuring accurate measurements of the anomalous differences. Here, the combined use of these two strategies is described to solve cases of native SAD phasing that were particular challenges: the integral membrane diacylglycerol kinase (DgkA) with a low Bijvoet ratio of 1% and the large 200 kDa complex of the CRISPR-associated endonuclease (Cas9) bound to guide RNA and target DNA crystallized in the low-symmetry space group C2. The optimal native SAD data-collection strategy based on systematic measurements performed on the 266 kDa multiprotein/multiligand tubulin complex is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Composite data sets measured on different objects are usually affected by random errors, but may also be influenced by systematic (genuine) differences in the objects themselves, or the experimental conditions. If the individual measurements forming each data set are quantitative and approximately normally distributed, a correlation coefficient is often used to compare data sets. However, the relations between data sets are not obvious from the matrix of pairwise correlations since the numerical value of the correlation coefficient is lowered by both random and systematic differences between the data sets. This work presents a multidimensional scaling analysis of the pairwise correlation coefficients which places data sets into a unit sphere within low-dimensional space, at a position given by their CC* values [as defined by Karplus & Diederichs (2012), Science, 336, 1030-1033] in the radial direction and by their systematic differences in one or more angular directions. This dimensionality reduction can not only be used for classification purposes, but also to derive data-set relations on a continuous scale. Projecting the arrangement of data sets onto the subspace spanned by systematic differences (the surface of a unit sphere) allows, irrespective of the random-error levels, the identification of clusters of closely related data sets. The method gains power with increasing numbers of data sets. It is illustrated with an example from low signal-to-noise ratio image processing, and an application in macromolecular crystallography is shown, but the approach is completely general and thus should be widely applicable.",

Furthermore, its data-management module allows experiments to be organized in groups of tomograms, while offering specialized three-dimensional tomographic browsers that facilitate visualization, location of regions of interest, modelling and particle extraction in complex geometries. Here, a technical description of the package is presented, focusing on its diverse strategies for optimizing computing performance. Dynamo is built upon mbtools (middle layer toolbox), a general-purpose MATLAB library for object-oriented scientific programming specifically developed to underpin Dynamo but usable as an independent tool. Its structure intertwines a flexible MATLAB codebase with precompiled C++ functions that carry the burden of numerically intensive operations. The package can be delivered as a precompiled standalone ready for execution without a MATLAB license. Multicore parallelization on a single node is directly inherited from the high-level parallelization engine provided for MATLAB, automatically imparting a balanced workload among the threads in computationally intense tasks such as alignment and classification, but also in logistic-oriented tasks such as tomogram binning and particle extraction. Dynamo supports the use of graphical processing units (GPUs), yielding considerable speedup factors both for native Dynamo procedures (such as the numerically intensive subtomogram alignment) and procedures defined by the user through its MATLAB-based GPU library for three-dimensional operations. Cloud-based virtual computing environments supplied with a pre-installed version of Dynamo can be publicly accessed through the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), enabling users to rent GPU computing time on a pay-as-you-go basis, thus avoiding upfront investments in hardware and longterm software maintenance.",

The introduction of the expected log-likelihood gain [eLLG; McCoy et al. (2017), Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA , 114 , 3637–3641] has given the crystallographer a powerful new tool to aid in making this decision. The eLLG is the log-likelihood gain on intensity [LLGI; Read &amp; McCoy (2016), Acta Cryst.

It is calculated as a sum over the reflections of a function dependent on the fraction of the scattering for which the model accounts, the estimated model coordinate error and the measurement errors in the data. It is shown how the eLLG may be used to answer the question `can I solve my structure by molecular replacement?'. However, this is only the most obvious of the applications of the eLLG. It is also discussed how the eLLG may be used to determine the search order and minimal data requirements for obtaining a molecular-replacement solution using a given model, and for decision making in fragment-based molecular replacement, single-atom molecular replacement and likelihood-guided model pruning.",

    "abstract": "Proteins inherently fluctuate between conformations to perform functions in the cell. For example, they sample product-binding, transition-state-stabilizing and product-release states during catalysis, and they integrate signals from remote regions of the structure for allosteric regulation. However, there is a lack of understanding of how these dynamic processes occur at the basic atomic level. This gap can be at least partially addressed by combining variable-temperature (instead of traditional cryogenic temperature) X-ray crystallography with algorithms for modeling alternative conformations based on electron-density maps, in an approach called multitemperature multiconformer X-ray crystallography (MMX). Here, the use of MMX to reveal alternative conformations at different sites in a protein structure and to estimate the degree of energetic coupling between them is discussed. These insights can suggest testable hypotheses about allosteric mechanisms. Temperature is an easily manipulated experimental parameter, so the MMX approach is widely applicable to any protein that yields well diffracting crystals. Moreover, the general principles of MMX are extensible to other perturbations such as pH, pressure, ligand concentration etc. Future work will explore strategies for leveraging X-ray data across such perturbation series to more quantitatively measure how different parts of a protein structure are coupled to each other, and the consequences thereof for allostery and other aspects of protein function.",

The workflows initially put into place, while highly innovative at the time, have been expanded to include increased complexity and additional intelligence using the information gathered during characterization; this includes adapting the beam diameter dynamically to match the diffraction volume within the crystal.

    "abstract": "Chemical restraints are a fundamental part of crystallographic protein structure refinement. In response to mounting evidence that conventional restraints have shortcomings, it has previously been documented that using backbone restraints that depend on the protein backbone conformation helps to address these shortcomings and improves the performance of refinements [Moriarty et al. (2014), FEBS J. 281, 4061-4071]. It is important that these improvements be made available to all in the protein crystallography community. Toward this end, a change in the default geometry library used by Phenix is described here. Tests are presented showing that this change will not generate increased numbers of outliers during validation, or deposition in the Protein Data Bank, during the transition period in which some validation tools still use the conventional restraint libraries.",

    "abstract": "The industrial conversion of cellulosic plant biomass into useful products such as biofuels is a major societal goal. These technologies harness diverse plant degrading enzymes, classical exo- and endo-acting cellulases and, increasingly, cellulose-active lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, to deconstruct the recalcitrant β-D-linked polysaccharide. A major drawback with this process is that the exo-acting cellobiohydrolases suffer from severe inhibition from their cellobiose product. β-D-Glucosidases are therefore important for liberating glucose from cellobiose and thereby relieving limiting product inhibition. Here, the three-dimensional structures of two industrially important family GH3 β-D-glucosidases from Aspergillus fumigatus and A. oryzae , solved by molecular replacement and refined at 1.95 Å resolution, are reported. Both enzymes, which share 78% sequence identity, display a three-domain structure with the catalytic domain at the interface, as originally shown for barley β-D-glucan exohydrolase, the first three-dimensional structure solved from glycoside hydrolase family GH3. Both enzymes show extensive N-glycosylation, with only a few external sites being truncated to a single GlcNAc molecule. Those glycans N-linked to the core of the structure are identified purely as high-mannose trees, and establish multiple hydrogen bonds between their sugar components and adjacent protein side chains. The extensive glycans pose special problems for crystallographic refinement, and new techniques and protocols were developed especially for this work. These protocols ensured that all of the D-pyranosides in the glycosylation trees were modelled in the preferred minimum-energy 4 C 1 chair conformation and should be of general application to refinements of other crystal structures containing O- or N-glycosylation. The Aspergillus GH3 structures, in light of other recent three-dimensional structures, provide insight into fungal β-D-glucosidases and provide a platform on which to inform and inspire new generations of variant enzymes for industrial application.",

    "abstract": "Increasing sophistication in molecular-replacement (MR) software and the rapid expansion of the PDB in recent years have allowed the technique to become the dominant method for determining the phases of a target structure in macromolecular X-ray crystallography. In addition, improvements in bioinformatic techniques for finding suitable homologous structures for use as MR search models, combined with developments in refinement and model-building techniques, have pushed the applicability of MR to lower sequence identities and made weak MR solutions more amenable to refinement and improvement. MrBUMP is a CCP4 pipeline which automates all stages of the MR procedure. Its scope covers everything from the sourcing and preparation of suitable search models right through to rebuilding of the positioned search model. Recent improvements to the pipeline include the adoption of more sensitive bioinformatic tools for sourcing search models, enhanced model-preparation techniques including better ensembling of homologues, and the use of phase improvement and model building on the resulting solution. The pipeline has also been deployed as an online service through CCP4 online, which allows its users to exploit large bioinformatic databases and coarse-grained parallelism to speed up the determination of a possible solution. Finally, the molecular-graphics application CCP4mg has been combined with MrBUMP to provide an interactive visual aid to the user during the process of selecting and manipulating search models for use in MR. Here, these developments in MrBUMP are described with a case study to explore how some of the enhancements to the pipeline and to CCP4mg can help to solve a difficult case.",

    "abstract": "The biological processes related to protein homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the etiologic agent of tuberculosis, have recently been established as critical pathways for therapeutic intervention. Proteins of particular interest are ClpC1 and the ClpC1–ClpP1–ClpP2 proteasome complex. The structure of the potent antituberculosis macrocyclic depsipeptide ecumicin complexed with the N-terminal domain of ClpC1 (ClpC1-NTD) is presented here. Crystals of the ClpC1-NTD–ecumicin complex were monoclinic (unit-cell parameters a = 80.0, b = 130.0, c = 112.0 Å, β = 90.07°; space group P 2 1 ; 12 complexes per asymmetric unit) and diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the self-rotation function to resolve space-group ambiguities. The new structure of the ecumicin complex showed a unique 1:2 (target:ligand) stoichiometry exploiting the intramolecular dyad in the α-helical fold of the target N-terminal domain. The structure of the ecumicin complex unveiled extensive interactions in the uniquely extended N-terminus, a critical binding site for the known cyclopeptide complexes. This structure, in comparison with the previously reported rufomycin I complex, revealed unique features that could be relevant for understanding the mechanism of action of these potential antituberculosis drug leads. Comparison of the ecumicin complex and the ClpC1-NTD-L92S/L96P double-mutant structure with the available structures of rufomycin I and cyclomarin A complexes revealed a range of conformational changes available to this small N-terminal helical domain and the minor helical alterations involved in the antibiotic-resistance mechanism. The different modes of binding and structural alterations could be related to distinct modes of action.",

This process transfers information from one part of a map to another and can improve the accuracy of a map. Here, the assumptions behind density modification for maps from electron cryomicroscopy are examined and a procedure is presented that allows the incorporation of model-based information. Density modification works best in cases where unfiltered, unmasked maps with clear boundaries between the macromolecule and solvent are visible, and where there is substantial noise in the map, both in the region of the macromolecule and the solvent. It also is most effective if the characteristics of the map are relatively constant within regions of the macromolecule and the solvent. Model-based information can be used to improve density modification, but model bias can in principle occur. Here, model bias is reduced by using ensemble models that allow an estimation of model uncertainty. A test of model bias is presented that suggests that even if the expected density in a region of a map is specified incorrectly by using an incorrect model, the incorrect expectations do not strongly affect the final map.",

    "abstract": "Despite the tremendous success of X-ray cryo-crystallography in recent decades, the transfer of crystals from the drops in which they are grown to diffractometer sample mounts remains a manual process in almost all laboratories. Here, the Shifter, a motorized, interactive microscope stage that transforms the entire crystal-mounting workflow from a rate-limiting manual activity to a controllable, high-throughput semi-automated process, is described. By combining the visual acuity and fine motor skills of humans with targeted hardware and software automation, it was possible to transform the speed and robustness of crystal mounting. Control software, triggered by the operator, manoeuvres crystallization plates beneath a clear protective cover, allowing the complete removal of film seals and thereby eliminating the tedium of repetitive seal cutting. The software, either upon request or working from an imported list, controls motors to position crystal drops under a hole in the cover for human mounting at a microscope. The software automatically captures experimental annotations for uploading to the user's data repository, removing the need for manual documentation. The Shifter facilitates mounting rates of 100–240 crystals per hour in a more controlled process than manual mounting, which greatly extends the lifetime of the drops and thus allows a dramatic increase in the number of crystals retrievable from any given drop without loss of X-ray diffraction quality. In 2015, the first in a series of three Shifter devices was deployed as part of the XChem fragment-screening facility at Diamond Light Source, where they have since facilitated the mounting of over 120 000 crystals. The Shifter was engineered to have a simple design, providing a device that could be readily commercialized and widely adopted owing to its low cost. The versatile hardware design allows use beyond fragment screening and protein crystallography.",

    "abstract": "The refinement of biomolecular crystallographic models relies on geometric restraints to help to address the paucity of experimental data typical in these experiments. Limitations in these restraints can degrade the quality of the resulting atomic models. Here, an integration of the full all-atom Amber molecular-dynamics force field into Phenix crystallographic refinement is presented, which enables more complete modeling of biomolecular chemistry. The advantages of the force field include a carefully derived set of torsion-angle potentials, an extensive and flexible set of atom types, Lennard-Jones treatment of nonbonded interactions and a full treatment of crystalline electrostatics. The new combined method was tested against conventional geometry restraints for over 22 000 protein structures. Structures refined with the new method show substantially improved model quality. On average, Ramachandran and rotamer scores are somewhat better, clashscores and MolProbity scores are significantly improved, and the modeling of electrostatics leads to structures that exhibit more, and more correct, hydrogen bonds than those refined using traditional geometry restraints. In general it is found that model improvements are greatest at lower resolutions, prompting plans to add the Amber target function to real-space refinement for use in electron cryo-microscopy. This work opens the door to the future development of more advanced applications such as Amber-based ensemble refinement, quantum-mechanical representation of active sites and improved geometric restraints for simulated annealing.",

    "abstract": "Despite the great strides made in the field of single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in microscope design, direct electron detectors and new processing suites, the area of sample preparation is still far from ideal. Traditionally, sample preparation involves blotting, which has been used to achieve high resolution, particularly for well behaved samples such as apoferritin. However, this approach is flawed since the blotting process can have adverse effects on some proteins and protein complexes, and the long blot time increases exposure to the damaging air-water interface. To overcome these problems, new blotless approaches have been designed for the direct deposition of the sample on the grid. Here, different methods of producing droplets for sample deposition are compared. Using gas dynamic virtual nozzles, small and high-velocity droplets were deposited on cryo-EM grids, which spread sufficiently for high-resolution cryo-EM imaging. For those wishing to pursue a similar approach, an overview is given of the current use of spray technology for cryo-EM grid preparation and areas for enhancement are pointed out. It is further shown how the broad aspects of sprayer design and operation conditions can be utilized to improve grid quality reproducibly.",

Here, it is demonstrated how the sample thickness can be determined before data acquisition, allowing the identification of optimal regions and the restriction of automated data collection to images with preserved high-resolution details. This quality-over-quantity approach almost entirely eliminates the time- and storage-consuming collection of suboptimal images, which are discarded after a recorded session or during early image processing due to a lack of high-resolution information. It maximizes the data-collection efficiency and lowers the electron-microscopy time required per data set.

These ensemble models have been shown to produce more accurate structures than traditional single-model structures. However, suboptimal sampling of the molecular-dynamics simulation and modelling of crystallographic disorder has limited the utility of the method, and can lead to unphysical and strained models. Here, two improvements to the ensemble refinement method implemented within Phenix are presented: DEN restraints, which guide the local sampling of conformations and allow a more robust exploration of local conformational landscapes, and ECHT disorder models, which allow the selection of more physically meaningful and effective disorder models for parameterizing the continuous disorder components within a crystal. These improvements lead to more consistent and physically interpretable simulations of macromolecules in crystals, and allow structural heterogeneity and disorder to be systematically explored on different scales. The new approach is demonstrated on several case studies and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and demonstrates how the choice of disorder model affects the type of disorder that is sampled by the restrained molecular-dynamics simulation.",

    "abstract": "Through an expansive international effort that involved data collection on 12 small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and four small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) instruments, 171 SAXS and 76 SANS measurements for five proteins (ribonuclease A, lysozyme, xylanase, urate oxidase and xylose isomerase) were acquired. From these data, the solvent-subtracted protein scattering profiles were shown to be reproducible, with the caveat that an additive constant adjustment was required to account for small errors in solvent subtraction. Further, the major features of the obtained consensus SAXS data over the q measurement range 0-1 Å-1 are consistent with theoretical prediction. The inherently lower statistical precision for SANS limited the reliably measured q-range to <0.5 Å-1, but within the limits of experimental uncertainties the major features of the consensus SANS data were also consistent with prediction for all five proteins measured in H2O and in D2O. Thus, a foundation set of consensus SAS profiles has been obtained for benchmarking scattering-profile prediction from atomic coordinates. Additionally, two sets of SAXS data measured at different facilities to q > 2.2 Å-1 showed good mutual agreement, affirming that this region has interpretable features for structural modelling. SAS measurements with inline size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) proved to be generally superior for eliminating sample heterogeneity, but with unavoidable sample dilution during column elution, while batch SAS data collected at higher concentrations and for longer times provided superior statistical precision. Careful merging of data measured using inline SEC and batch modes, or low- and high-concentration data from batch measurements, was successful in eliminating small amounts of aggregate or interparticle interference from the scattering while providing improved statistical precision overall for the benchmarking data set.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has emerged as an effective and efficient method to identify new chemical scaffolds for the development of lead compounds. X-ray crystallography can be used in FBDD as a tool to validate and develop fragments identified as binders by other methods. However, it is also often used with great success as a primary screening technique. In recent years, technological advances at macromolecular crystallography beamlines in terms of instrumentation, beam intensity and robotics have enabled the development of dedicated platforms at synchrotron sources for FBDD using X-ray crystallography. Here, the development of the Fast Fragment and Compound Screening (FFCS) platform, an integrated next-generation pipeline for crystal soaking, handling and data collection which allows crystallography-based screening of protein crystals against hundreds of fragments and compounds, at the Swiss Light Source is reported.",

Historically, protein crystal structures have been described using a single set of atomic coordinates. Because conformational variation is important for protein function, researchers now often build models that contain multiple structures. Methods for building such models can fail, however, in regions where the crystallographic density is difficult to interpret, for example at the protein–solvent interface. To address this limitation, a set of MD–MX methods that combine MD simulations of protein crystals with conventional modeling and refinement tools have been developed. In an application to a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase at room temperature, the procedure improved the interpretation of ambiguous density, yielding an alternative water model and a revised protein model including multiple conformations. The revised model provides mechanistic insights into the catalytic and regulatory interactions of the enzyme. The same methods may be used in other MX studies to seek mechanistic insights.",

    "abstract": "In macromolecular crystallographic structure refinement, ligands present challenges for the generation of geometric restraints due to their large chemical variability, their possible novel nature and their specific interaction with the binding pocket of the protein. Quantum-mechanical approaches are useful for providing accurate ligand geometries, but can be plagued by the number of minima in flexible molecules. In an effort to avoid these issues, the Quantum Mechanical Restraints (QMR) procedure optimizes the ligand geometry in situ , thus accounting for the influence of the macromolecule on the local energy minima of the ligand. The optimized ligand geometry is used to generate target values for geometric restraints during the crystallographic refinement. As demonstrated using a sample of &gt;2330 ligand instances in &gt;1700 protein–ligand models, QMR restraints generally result in lower deviations from the target stereochemistry compared with conventionally generated restraints. In particular, the QMR approach provides accurate torsion restraints for ligands and other entities.",

    "abstract": "Protein conformational dynamics that may inform biology often lie dormant in high-resolution electron-density maps. While an estimated ∼18% of side chains in high-resolution models contain alternative conformations, these are underrepresented in current PDB models due to difficulties in manually detecting, building and inspecting alternative conformers. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated multi-conformer modeling program, FLEXR . Using Ringer -based electron-density sampling, FLEXR builds explicit multi-conformer models for refinement. Thereby, it bridges the gap of detecting hidden alternate states in electron-density maps and including them in structural models for refinement, inspection and deposition. Using a series of high-quality crystal structures (0.8–1.85 Å resolution), we show that the multi-conformer models produced by FLEXR uncover new insights that are missing in models built either manually or using current tools. Specifically, FLEXR models revealed hidden side chains and backbone conformations in ligand-binding sites that may redefine protein–ligand binding mechanisms. Ultimately, the tool facilitates crystallographers with opportunities to include explicit multi-conformer states in their high-resolution crystallographic models. One key advantage is that such models may better reflect interesting higher energy features in electron-density maps that are rarely consulted by the community at large, which can then be productively used for ligand discovery downstream.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic and concomitant lockdowns presented a global health challenge and triggered unprecedented research efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The spike glycoprotein decorating the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions is a prime target for vaccine development, antibody therapy and serology as it binds the host cell receptor and is central for viral cell entry. The electron cryo-microscopy structure of the spike protein revealed a hydrophobic pocket in the receptor-binding domain that is occupied by an essential fatty acid, linoleic acid (LA). The LA-bound spike protein adopts a non-infectious locked conformation which is more stable than the infectious form and shields important immunogenic epitopes. Here, the impact of LA binding on viral infectivity and replication, and the evolutionary conservation of the pocket in other highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), are reviewed. The importance of LA metabolic products, the eicosanoids, in regulating the human immune response and inflammation is highlighted. Lipid and fatty-acid binding to a hydrophobic pocket in proteins on the virion surface appears to be a broader strategy employed by viruses, including picornaviruses and Zika virus. Ligand binding stabilizes their protein structure and assembly, and downregulates infectivity. In the case of rhinoviruses, this has been exploited to develop small-molecule antiviral drugs that bind to the hydrophobic pocket. The results suggest a COVID-19 antiviral treatment based on the LA-binding pocket.",

For this reason, their experimental characterization is crucial to obtain improved knowledge of their structure and biological functions. The three-dimensional structure represents highly relevant information since it provides insight into the interaction between the metal ion(s) and the protein fold. Such interactions determine the chemical reactivity of the bound metal. The available PDB structures can contain errors due to experimental factors such as poor resolution and radiation damage. A lack of use of distance restraints during the refinement and validation process also impacts the structure quality. Here, the aim was to obtain a thorough overview of the distribution of the distances between metal ions and their donor atoms through the statistical analysis of a data set based on more than 115 000 metal-binding sites in proteins. This analysis not only produced reference data that can be used by experimentalists to support the structure-determination process, for example as refinement restraints, but also resulted in an improved insight into how protein coordination occurs for different metals and the nature of their binding interactions. In particular, the features of carboxylate coordination were inspected, which is the only type of interaction that is commonly present for nearly all metals.",

It has successfully been employed for analyzing metal-binding sites in macromolecule structures.

Given the large number of experimental crystal structures gathered since these initial parameters were determined and the similarity of binding sites in organic compounds and macromolecules, the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) is a valuable resource for refining metal–organic bond-valence parameters. R 0 bond-valence parameters for iron(II), iron(III) and other metals have been optimized based on an automated processing of all CSD crystal structures. Almost all R 0 bond-valence parameters were reproduced, except for iron–nitrogen bonds, for which distinct R 0 parameters were defined for two observed subpopulations, corresponding to low-spin and high-spin states, of iron in both oxidation states. The significance of this data-driven method for parameter discovery, and how the spin state affects the interpretation of heme-containing proteins and iron-binding sites in macromolecular structures, are discussed.",

This information has provided key new insights into enzyme mechanisms, ligand binding and hydration. However, despite the importance of this information, the application of neutron crystallography in biology has been limited by the relatively low flux of available neutron beams and the large incoherent neutron scattering from hydrogen, both of which contribute to weak diffraction data with relatively low signal-to-background ratios. A method has been developed to fit weak data based on three-dimensional profile fitting of Bragg peaks in reciprocal space by an Ikeda–Carpenter function with a bivariate Gaussian. When applied to data collected from three different proteins, three-dimensional profile fitting yields intensities with higher correlation coefficients (CC 1/2 ) at high resolutions, decreased R free factors, extended resolutions and improved nuclear density maps. Importantly, additional features are revealed in nuclear density maps that may provide additional scientific information. These results suggest that three-dimensional profile fitting will help to extend the capabilities of neutron macromolecular crystallography.",

This system assembles on a core baseplate and elongates like a phage puncturing device; it is thought to penetrate the target membrane and deliver effectors into the host or competing bacteria. Valine-glycine repeat protein G1 (VgrG1) forms the spike at the tip of the elongating tube formed by haemolysin co-regulated protein 1 (Hcp1); it is structurally similar to the T4 phage (gp27)3-(gp5)3 puncturing complex. Here, the crystal structure of full-length VgrG1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is reported at a resolution of 2.0 Å, which through a trimeric arrangement generates a needle-like shape composed of two main parts, the head and the spike, connected via a small neck region. The structure reveals several remarkable structural features pointing to the possible roles of the two main segments of VgrG1: the head as a scaffold cargo domain and the β-roll spike with implications in the cell-membrane puncturing process and as a carrier of cognate toxins.",

In addition to typical microcrystals of purified recombinant protein, these advances have enabled the analysis of microcrystals produced inside living cells. Here, a pipeline where crystals are grown in insect cells, sorted by flow cytometry and directly analysed by X-ray diffraction is presented and applied to in vivo-grown crystals of the recombinant CPV1 polyhedrin. When compared with the analysis of purified crystals, in cellulo diffraction produces data of better quality and a gain of ∼0.35 Å in resolution for comparable beamtime usage. Importantly, crystals within cells are readily derivatized with gold and iodine compounds through the cellular membrane. Using the multiple isomorphous replacement method, a near-complete model was autobuilt from 2.7 Å resolution data. Thus, in favourable cases, an in cellulo pipeline can replace the complete workflow of structure determination without compromising the quality of the resulting model.

    "abstract": "Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and is a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis and glyconeogenesis and, more generally, of the control of energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Vertebrates, and notably Homo sapiens, express two FBPase isoforms. The liver isozyme is expressed mainly in gluconeogenic organs, where it functions as a regulator of glucose synthesis. The muscle isoform is expressed in all cells, and recent studies have demonstrated that its role goes far beyond the enzymatic function, as it can interact with various nuclear and mitochondrial proteins. Even in its enzymatic function, the muscle enzyme is different from the liver isoform, as it is 100-fold more susceptible to allosteric inhibition by AMP and this effect can be abrogated by complex formation with aldolase. All FBPases are homotetramers composed of two intimate dimers: the upper dimer and the lower dimer. They oscillate between two conformational states: the inactive T form when in complex with AMP, and the active R form. Parenthetically, it is noted that bacterial FBPases behave somewhat differently, and in the absence of allosteric activators exist in a tetramer-dimer equilibrium even at relatively high concentrations. [Hines et al. (2007), J. Biol. Chem. 282, 11696-11704]. The T-to-R transition is correlated with the conformation of the key loop L2, which in the T form becomes `disengaged' and unable to participate in the catalytic mechanism. The T states of both isoforms are very similar, with a small twist of the upper dimer relative to the lower dimer. It is shown that at variance with the well studied R form of the liver enzyme, which is flat, the R form of the muscle enzyme is diametrically different, with a perpendicular orientation of the upper and lower dimers. The crystal structure of the muscle-isozyme R form shows that in this arrangement of the tetramer completely new protein surfaces are exposed that are most likely targets for the interactions with various cellular and enzymatic partners. The cruciform R structure is stabilized by a novel `leucine lock', which prevents the key residue, Asp187, from locking loop L2 in the disengaged conformation. In addition, the crystal structures of muscle FBPase in the T conformation with and without AMP strongly suggest that the T-to-R transition is a discrete jump rather than a shift of an equilibrium smooth transition through multiple intermediate states. Finally, using snapshots from three crystal structures of human muscle FBPase, it is conclusively demonstrated that the AMP-binding event is correlated with a β→α transition at the N-terminus of the protein and with the formation of a new helical structure.",

It catalyzes the cleavage of α-1,4 glucan linkages and subsequent reattachment to form α-1,6 branch points. These branches are crucial to the final structure of glycogen and starch. The crystal structures of Escherichia coli BE (EcBE) in complex with α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrin were determined in order to better understand substrate binding. Four cyclodextrin-binding sites were identified in EcBE; they were all located on the surface of the enzyme, with none in the vicinity of the active site. While three of the sites were also identified as linear polysaccharide-binding sites, one of the sites is specific for cyclodextrins. In previous work three additional binding sites were identified as exclusively binding linear malto-oligosaccharides. Comparison of the binding sites shed light on this apparent specificity. Binding site IV is located in the carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48) domain of EcBE and superimposes with the cyclodextrin-binding site found in the CBM48 domain of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Comparison of these sites shows the similarities and differences in the two binding modes. While some of the binding sites were found to be conserved between branching enzymes of different organisms, some are quite divergent, indicating both similarities and differences between oligosaccharide binding in branching enzymes from various sources.",

Here, the effectiveness of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis to aid in the crystallization of biological macromolecules is demonstrated. It was found that the presence of well ordered lattices with higher order Bragg spots, revealed by Fourier analysis of TEM images, is a good predictor of diffraction-quality crystals. Moreover, the use of TEM allowed (i) comparison of lattice quality among crystals from different conditions in crystallization screens; (ii) the detection of crystal pathologies that could contribute to poor X-ray diffraction, including crystal lattice defects, anisotropic diffraction and crystal contamination by heavy protein aggregates and nanocrystal nuclei; (iii) the qualitative estimation of crystal solvent content to explore the effect of lattice dehydration on diffraction and (iv) the selection of high-quality crystal fragments for microseeding experiments to generate reproducibly larger sized crystals.

During translation, a newly synthesized polypeptide chain enters the ribosomal exit tunnel and actively interacts with the ribosome elements - the r-proteins and rRNA that line the tunnel - prior to emerging into the cellular milieu. While understanding of the structure and function of the ribosome has advanced significantly, little is known about the process of folding of the emerging nascent chain (NC). Advances in cryo-electron microscopy are enabling visualization of NCs within the exit tunnel, allowing early glimpses of the interplay between the NC and the ribosome. Once it has emerged from the exit tunnel into the cytosol, the NC (still attached to its parent ribosome) can acquire a range of conformations, which can be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Using experimental restraints within molecular-dynamics simulations, the ensemble of NC structures can be described. In order to delineate the process of co-translational protein folding, a hybrid structural biology approach is foreseeable, potentially offering a complete atomic description of protein folding as it occurs on the ribosome.",

    "abstract": "Two-component systems (TCSs) are key elements in bacterial signal transduction in response to environmental stresses. TCSs generally consist of sensor histidine kinases (SKs) and their cognate response regulators (RRs). Many SKs exhibit autokinase, phosphoryltransferase and phosphatase activities, which regulate RR activity through a phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle. However, how SKs perform different enzymatic activities is poorly understood. Here, several crystal structures of the minimal catalytic region of WalK, an essential SK from Lactobacillus plantarum that shares 60% sequence identity with its homologue VicK from Streptococcus mutans , are presented. WalK adopts an asymmetrical closed structure in the presence of ATP or ADP, in which one of the CA domains is positioned close to the DHp domain, thus leading both the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP/ADP to form hydrogen bonds to the ∊- but not the δ-nitrogen of the phosphorylatable histidine in the DHp domain. In addition, the DHp domain in the ATP/ADP-bound state has a 25.7° asymmetrical helical bending coordinated with the repositioning of the CA domain; these processes are mutually exclusive and alternate in response to helicity changes that are possibly regulated by upstream signals. In the absence of ATP or ADP, however, WalK adopts a completely symmetric open structure with its DHp domain centred between two outward-reaching CA domains. In summary, these structures of WalK reveal the intrinsic dynamic properties of an SK structure as a molecular basis for multifunctionality.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, validation was considered to be a final gatekeeping function, but refinement is smoother and results are better if model validation actively guides corrections throughout structure solution. This shifts emphasis from global to local measures: primarily geometry, conformations and sterics. A fit into the wrong local minimum conformation usually produces outliers in multiple measures. Moving to the right local minimum should be prioritized, rather than small shifts across arbitrary borderlines. Steric criteria work best with all explicit H atoms. `Backrub' motions should be used for side chains and `P-perp' diagnostics to correct ribose puckers. A `water' may actually be an ion, a relic of misfitting or an unmodeled alternate. Beware of wishful thinking in modeling ligands. At high resolution, internally consistent alternate conformations should be modeled and geometry in poor density should not be downweighted. At low resolution, CaBLAM should be used to diagnose protein secondary structure and ERRASER to correct RNA backbone. All atoms should not be forced inside density, beware of sequence misalignment, and very rare conformations such as cis -non-Pro peptides should be avoided. Automation continues to improve, but the crystallographer still must look at each outlier, in the context of density, and correct most of them. For the valid few with unambiguous density and something that is holding them in place, a functional reason should be sought. The expectation is a few outliers, not zero.",

    "abstract": "While the rapid proliferation of high-resolution structures in the Protein Data Bank provides a rich set of templates for starting models, it remains the case that a great many structures both past and present are built at least in part by hand-threading through low-resolution and/or weak electron density. With current model-building tools this task can be challenging, and the de facto standard for acceptable error rates (in the form of atomic clashes and unfavourable backbone and side-chain conformations) in structures based on data with d max not exceeding 3.5 Å reflects this. When combined with other factors such as model bias, these residual errors can conspire to make more serious errors in the protein fold difficult or impossible to detect. The three recently published 3.6–4.2 Å resolution structures of complement C4 (PDB entries 4fxg, 4fxk and 4xam) rank in the top quartile of structures of comparable resolution both in terms of R free and MolProbity score, yet, as shown here, contain register errors in six β-strands. By applying a molecular-dynamics force field that explicitly models interatomic forces and hence excludes most physically impossible conformations, the recently developed interactive molecular-dynamics flexible fitting (iMDFF) approach significantly reduces the complexity of the conformational space to be searched during manual rebuilding. This substantially improves the rate of detection and correction of register errors, and allows user-guided model building in maps with a resolution lower than 3.5 Å to converge to solutions with a stereochemical quality comparable to atomic resolution structures. Here, iMDFF has been used to individually correct and re-refine these three structures to MolProbity scores of &lt;1.7, and strategies for working with such challenging data sets are suggested. Notably, the improved model allowed the resolution for complement C4b to be extended from 4.2 to 3.5 Å as demonstrated by paired refinement.",

    "abstract": "The radius of gyration is a fundamental structural parameter that is particularly useful for describing polymers. It has been known since Flory's seminal work in the mid-20th century that polymers show a power-law dependence, where the radius of gyration is proportional to the number of residues raised to a power. The power-law exponent has been measured experimentally for denatured proteins and derived empirically for folded monomeric proteins using crystal structures. Here, the biological assemblies in the Protein Data Bank are surveyed to derive the power-law parameters for protein oligomers having degrees of oligomerization of 2-6 and 8. The power-law exponents for oligomers span a narrow range of 0.38-0.41, which is close to the value of 0.40 obtained for monomers. This result shows that protein oligomers exhibit essentially the same power-law behavior as monomers. A simple power-law formula is provided for estimating the oligomeric state from an experimental measurement of the radius of gyration. Several proteins in the Protein Data Bank are found to deviate substantially from power-law behavior by having an atypically large radius of gyration. Some of the outliers have highly elongated structures, such as coiled coils. For coiled coils, the radius of gyration does not follow a power law and instead scales linearly with the number of residues in the oligomer. Other outliers are proteins whose oligomeric state or quaternary structure is incorrectly annotated in the Protein Data Bank. The power laws could be used to identify such errors and help prevent them in future depositions.",

A series of diffraction data sets with increasing absorbed radiation dose were collected from a single crystal of Steccherinum murashkinskyi laccase at 1.35 Å resolution. Changes in the active-site structure associated with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water on increasing the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation were detected. The structures in the series are mixtures of different states of the enzyme–substrate complex.

    "abstract": "The modulation of main-chain and side-chain conformational heterogeneity and solvent structure in monoclinic lysozyme crystals by dehydration (related to water activity) and temperature is examined. Decreasing the relative humidity (from 99 to 11%) and decreasing the temperature both lead to contraction of the unit cell, to an increased area of crystal contacts and to remodeling of primarily contact and solvent-exposed residues. Both lead to the depopulation of some minor side-chain conformers and to the generation of new conformations. Side-chain modifications and main-chain r.m.s.d.s associated with cooling from 298 to 100 K depend on relative humidity and are minimized at 85% relative humidity (r.h.). Dehydration from 99 to 93% r.h. and cooling from 298 to 100 K result in a comparable number of remodeled residues, with dehydration-induced remodeling somewhat more likely to arise from contact interactions. When scaled to equivalent temperatures based on unit-cell contraction, the evolution of side-chain order parameters with dehydration shows generally similar features to those observed on cooling to T = 100 K. These results illuminate the qualitative and quantitative similarities between structural perturbations induced by modest dehydration, which routinely occurs in samples prepared for 298 and 100 K data collection, and cryocooling. Differences between these perturbations in terms of energy landscapes and occupancies, and implications for variable-temperature crystallography between 180 and 298 K, are discussed. It is also noted that remodeling of a key lysozyme active-site residue by dehydration, which is associated with a radical decrease in the enzymatic activity of lysozyme powder, arises due to a steric clash with the residue of a symmetry mate.",

    "abstract": "Native SAD is an emerging phasing technique that uses the anomalous signal of native heavy atoms to obtain crystallographic phases. The method does not require specific sample preparation to add anomalous scatterers, as the light atoms contained in the native sample are used as marker atoms. The most abundant anomalous scatterer used for native SAD, which is present in almost all proteins, is sulfur. However, the absorption edge of sulfur is at low energy (2.472 keV = 5.016 Å), which makes it challenging to carry out native SAD phasing experiments as most synchrotron beamlines are optimized for shorter wavelength ranges where the anomalous signal of sulfur is weak; for longer wavelengths, which produce larger anomalous differences, the absorption of X-rays by the sample, solvent, loop and surrounding medium ( e.g. air) increases tremendously. Therefore, a compromise has to be found between measuring strong anomalous signal and minimizing absorption. It was thus hypothesized that shorter wavelengths should be used for large crystals and longer wavelengths for small crystals, but no thorough experimental analyses have been reported to date. To study the influence of crystal size and wavelength, native SAD experiments were carried out at different wavelengths (1.9 and 2.7 Å with a helium cone; 3.0 and 3.3 Å with a helium chamber) using lysozyme and ferredoxin reductase crystals of various sizes. For the tested crystals, the results suggest that larger sample sizes do not have a detrimental effect on native SAD data and that long wavelengths give a clear advantage with small samples compared with short wavelengths. The resolution dependency of substructure determination was analyzed and showed that high-symmetry crystals with small unit cells require higher resolution for the successful placement of heavy atoms.",

    "abstract": "Macromolecular structures can be solved by molecular replacement provided that suitable search models are available. Models from distant homologues may deviate too much from the target structure to succeed, notwithstanding an overall similar fold or even their featuring areas of very close geometry. Successful methods to make the most of such templates usually rely on the degree of conservation to select and improve search models. ARCIMBOLDO_SHREDDER uses fragments derived from distant homologues in a brute-force approach driven by the experimental data, instead of by sequence similarity. The new algorithms implemented in ARCIMBOLDO_SHREDDER are described in detail, illustrating its characteristic aspects in the solution of new and test structures. In an advance from the previously published algorithm, which was based on omitting or extracting contiguous polypeptide spans, model generation now uses three-dimensional volumes respecting structural units. The optimal fragment size is estimated from the expected log-likelihood gain (LLG) values computed assuming that a substructure can be found with a level of accuracy near that required for successful extension of the structure, typically below 0.6 Å root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from the target. Better sampling is attempted through model trimming or decomposition into rigid groups and optimization through Phaser 's gyre refinement. Also, after model translation, packing filtering and refinement, models are either disassembled into predetermined rigid groups and refined ( gimble refinement) or Phaser 's LLG-guided pruning is used to trim the model of residues that are not contributing signal to the LLG at the target r.m.s.d. value. Phase combination among consistent partial solutions is performed in reciprocal space with ALIXE . Finally, density modification and main-chain autotracing in SHELXE serve to expand to the full structure and identify successful solutions. The performance on test data and the solution of new structures are described.",

The most prominent feature of this enzyme is the presence of the 3Fe–4S cluster, which is located at the surface of the catalytic subunit and functions in intramolecular and intermolecular electron transfer from FAD to the electron-transfer subunit.

Observations are presented here from retrospective analyses of the strategies actively deployed for the extensive crystallization experiments at the Oxford site of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), where comprehensive annotations by SGC scientists were recorded on a customized database infrastructure. The results point to the importance of using redundancy in crystallizing conditions, specifically by varying the mixing ratios of protein sample and precipitant, as well as incubation temperatures. No meaningful difference in performance could be identified between the four most widely used sparse-matrix screens, judged by the yield of crystals leading to deposited structures; this suggests that in general any comparison of screens will be meaningless without extensive cross-testing. Where protein sample is limiting, exploring more conditions has a higher likelihood of being informative by yielding hits than does redundancy of either mixing ratio or temperature. Finally, on the logistical question of how long experiments should be stored, 98% of all crystals that led to deposited structures appeared within 30 days. Overall, these analyses serve as practical guidelines for the design of initial screening experiments for new crystallization targets.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in the SAD phasing method is solving a structure when the anomalous signal-to-noise ratio is low. A simple theoretical framework for describing measurements of anomalous differences and the resulting useful anomalous correlation and anomalous signal in a SAD experiment is presented. Here, the useful anomalous correlation is defined as the correlation of anomalous differences with ideal anomalous differences from the anomalous substructure. The useful anomalous correlation reflects the accuracy of the data and the absence of minor sites. The useful anomalous correlation also reflects the information available for estimating crystallographic phases once the substructure has been determined. In contrast, the anomalous signal (the peak height in a model-phased anomalous difference Fourier at the coordinates of atoms in the anomalous substructure) reflects the information available about each site in the substructure and is related to the ability to find the substructure. A theoretical analysis shows that the expected value of the anomalous signal is the product of the useful anomalous correlation, the square root of the ratio of the number of unique reflections in the data set to the number of sites in the substructure, and a function that decreases with increasing values of the atomic displacement factor for the atoms in the substructure. This means that the ability to find the substructure in a SAD experiment is increased by high data quality and by a high ratio of reflections to sites in the substructure, and is decreased by high atomic displacement factors for the substructure.",

For samples containing inherent flexibility, heterogeneity or preferred orientation, the collection of extensive cryo-EM data using several conditions and microscopes is often required. In such a scenario, merging cryo-EM data sets is advantageous because it allows improved three-dimensional reconstructions to be obtained. Since data sets are not always collected with the same pixel size, merging data can be challenging. Here, two methods to combine cryo-EM data are described. Both involve the calculation of a rescaling factor from independent data sets. The effects of errors in the scaling factor on the results of data merging are also estimated. The methods described here provide a guideline for cryo-EM users who wish to combine data sets from the same type of microscope and detector.",

    "abstract": "Antibody labeling has been conducted extensively for structure determination using both X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (EM). However, establishing target-specific antibodies is a prerequisite for applying antibody-assisted structural analysis. To expand the applicability of this strategy, an alternative method has been developed to prepare an antibody complex by inserting an exogenous epitope into the target. It has already been demonstrated that the Fab of the NZ-1 monoclonal antibody can form a stable complex with a target containing a PA12 tag as an inserted epitope. Nevertheless, it was also found that complex formation through the inserted PA12 tag inevitably caused structural changes around the insertion site on the target. Here, an attempt was made to improve the tag-insertion method, and it was consequently discovered that an alternate tag (PA14) could replace various loops on the target without inducing large structural changes. Crystallographic analysis demonstrated that the inserted PA14 tag adopts a loop-like conformation with closed ends in the antigen-binding pocket of the NZ-1 Fab. Due to proximity of the termini in the bound conformation, the more optimal PA14 tag had only a minor impact on the target structure. In fact, the PA14 tag could also be inserted into a sterically hindered loop for labeling. Molecular-dynamics simulations also showed a rigid structure for the target regardless of PA14 insertion and complex formation with the NZ-1 Fab. Using this improved labeling technique, negative-stain EM was performed on a bacterial site-2 protease, which enabled an approximation of the domain arrangement based on the docking mode of the NZ-1 Fab.",

    "abstract": "Time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (TrEM) allows the study of proteins under non-equilibrium conditions on the millisecond timescale, permitting the analysis of large-scale conformational changes or assembly and disassembly processes. However, the technique is developing and there have been few comparisons with other biochemical kinetic studies. Using current methods, the shortest time delay is on the millisecond timescale (∼5-10 ms), given by the delay between sample application and vitrification, and generating longer time points requires additional approaches such as using a longer delay line between the mixing element and nozzle, or an incubation step on the grid. To compare approaches, the reaction of ATP with the skeletal actomyosin S1 complex was followed on grids prepared with a 7-700 ms delay between mixing and vitrification. Classification of the cryo-EM data allows kinetic information to be derived which agrees with previous biochemical measurements, showing fast dissociation, low occupancy during steady-state hydrolysis and rebinding once ATP has been hydrolysed. However, this rebinding effect is much less pronounced when on-grid mixing is used and may be influenced by interactions with the air-water interface. Moreover, in-flow mixing results in a broader distribution of reaction times due to the range of velocities in a laminar flow profile (temporal spread), especially for longer time delays. This work shows the potential of TrEM, but also highlights challenges and opportunities for further development.",

Therefore, the protein crystallography research communities at the University of Oulu, Weizmann Institute of Science and Diamond Light Source have joined forces to automate the uploading of sample metadata to the synchrotron. In IceBear , each crystal selected for data collection is given a unique sample name and a crystal page is generated. Subsequently, the metadata required for data collection are uploaded directly to the ISPyB synchrotron database by a shipment module, and for each sample a link to the relevant ISPyB page is stored. IceBear allows notes to be made for each sample during cryocooling treatment and during data collection, as well as in later steps of the structure determination. Protocols are also available to aid the recycling of pins, pucks and dewars when the dewar returns from the synchrotron. The IceBear database is organized around projects, and project members can easily access the crystallization and diffraction metadata for each sample, as well as any additional information that has been provided via the notes.

This has markedly increased the demand for throughput of high-resolution electron microscopes, which are required to produce high-resolution images at high rates. An increase in data-collection throughput can be achieved by using large beam-image shifts combined with off-axis coma correction, enabling the acquisition of multiple images from a large area of the EM grid without moving the microscope stage. Here, the optical properties of the JEOL CRYO ARM 300 electron microscope equipped with a K3 camera were characterized under off-axis illumination conditions. It is shown that efficient coma correction can be achieved for beam-image shifts with an amplitude of at least 10 µm, enabling a routine throughput for data collection of between 6000 and 9000 images per day. Use of the benchmark for the rapid data-collection procedure (with beam-image shifts of up to 7 µm) on apoferritin resulted in a reconstruction at a resolution of 1.7 Å. This demonstrates that the rapid automated acquisition of high-resolution micrographs is possible using a CRYO ARM 300.",

Here, a crystal structure is presented in which Mpro adopts an inactive state that has never been observed before, called new-inactive. It is shown that the oxyanion loop, which is involved in substrate recognition and enzymatic activity, adopts a new catalytically incompetent conformation and that many of the key interactions of the active conformation of the enzyme around the active site are lost. Solvation/desolvation energetic contributions play an important role in the transition from the inactive to the active state, with Phe140 moving from an exposed to a buried environment and Asn142 moving from a buried environment to an exposed environment. In new-inactive Mpro a new cavity is present near the S2' subsite, and the N-terminal and C-terminal tails, as well as the dimeric interface, are perturbed, with partial destabilization of the dimeric assembly. This novel conformation is relevant both for comprehension of the mechanism of action of Mpro within the catalytic cycle and for the successful structure-based drug design of antiviral drugs.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-cooling has been nearly universally adopted to mitigate X-ray damage and facilitate crystal handling in protein X-ray crystallography. However, cryo X-ray crystallographic data provide an incomplete window into the ensemble of conformations that is at the heart of protein function and energetics. Room-temperature (RT) X-ray crystallography provides accurate ensemble information, and recent developments allow conformational heterogeneity (the experimental manifestation of ensembles) to be extracted from single-crystal data. Nevertheless, high sensitivity to X-ray damage at RT raises concerns about data reliability. To systematically address this critical issue, increasingly X-ray-damaged high-resolution data sets (1.02–1.52 Å resolution) were obtained from single proteinase K, thaumatin and lysozyme crystals at RT (277 K). In each case a modest increase in conformational heterogeneity with X-ray damage was observed. Merging data with different extents of damage (as is typically carried out) had negligible effects on conformational heterogeneity until the overall diffraction intensity decayed to ∼70% of its initial value. These effects were compared with X-ray damage effects in cryo-cooled crystals by carrying out an analogous analysis of increasingly damaged proteinase K cryo data sets (0.9–1.16 Å resolution). X-ray damage-associated heterogeneity changes were found that were not observed at RT. This property renders it difficult to distinguish real from artefactual conformations and to determine the conformational response to changes in temperature. The ability to acquire reliable heterogeneity information from single crystals at RT, together with recent advances in RT data collection at accessible synchrotron beamlines, provides a strong motivation for the widespread adoption of RT X-ray crystallography to obtain conformational ensemble information.",

To simplify and streamline the cryo-ET workflow, Tomo Live , an on-the-fly solution that automates the alignment and reconstruction of tilt-series data, enabling real-time data-quality assessment, has been developed. Through the integration of Tomo Live into the data-acquisition workflow for cryo-ET, motion correction is performed directly after each of the acquired tilt angles. Immediately after the tilt-series acquisition has completed, an unattended tilt-series alignment and reconstruction into a 3D volume is performed. The results are displayed in real time in a dedicated remote web platform that runs on the microscope hardware. Through this web platform, users can review the acquired data (aligned stack and 3D volume) and several quality metrics that are obtained during the alignment and reconstruction process. These quality metrics can be used for fast feedback for subsequent acquisitions to save time. Parameters such as Alignment Accuracy, Deleted Tilts and Tilt Axis Correction Angle are visualized as graphs and can be used as filters to export only the best tomograms (raw data, reconstruction and intermediate data) for further processing. Here, the Tomo Live algorithms and workflow are described and representative results on several biological samples are presented. The Tomo Live workflow is accessible to both expert and non-expert users, making it a valuable tool for the continued advancement of structural biology, cell biology and histology.",

Within the computer-vision research community, implicits such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have enabled the detailed reconstruction of 3D objects from few images at different camera-viewing angles. While other neural implicits, specifically density fields, have been used to map conformational heterogeneity from noisy cryo-EM projection images, most approaches represent volume with an implicit function in Fourier space, which has disadvantages compared with solving the problem in real space, complicating, for instance, masking, constraining physics or geometry, and assessing local resolution. In this work, we build on a recent development in neural implicits, a multi-resolution hash-encoding framework called instant-NGP, that we use to represent the scalar volume directly in real space and apply it to the cryo-EM density-map reconstruction problem ( InstaMap ). We demonstrate that for both synthetic and real data, InstaMap for homogeneous reconstruction achieves higher resolution at shorter training stages than five other real-spaced representations. We propose a solution to noise overfitting, demonstrate that InstaMap is both lightweight and fast to train, implement masking from a user-provided input mask and extend it to molecular-shape heterogeneity via bending space using a per-image vector field.",

    "abstract": "Serial crystallography is an important technique with unique abilities to resolve enzymatic transition states, minimize radiation damage to sensitive metalloenzymes and perform de novo structure determination from micrometre-sized crystals. This technique requires the merging of data from thousands of crystals, making manual identification of errant crystals unfeasible. cctbx.xfel.merge uses filtering to remove problematic data. However, this process is imperfect, and data reduction must be robust to outliers. We add robustness to cctbx.xfel.merge at the step of uncertainty determination for reflection intensities. This step is a critical point for robustness because it is the first step where the data sets are considered as a whole, as opposed to individual lattices. Robustness is conferred by reformulating the error-calibration procedure to have fewer and less stringent statistical assumptions and incorporating the ability to down-weight low-quality lattices. We then apply this method to five macromolecular XFEL data sets and observe the improvements to each. The appropriateness of the intensity uncertainties is demonstrated through internal consistency. This is performed through theoretical CC1/2 and I/σ relationships and by weighted second moments, which use Wilson's prior to connect intensity uncertainties with their expected distribution. This work presents new mathematical tools to analyze intensity statistics and demonstrates their effectiveness through the often underappreciated process of uncertainty analysis.",

Multiple catalytic domains in a glycoside hydrolase family 18 chitinase function synergistically during chitin degradation. Here, an insect group III chitinase from the agricultural pest Ostrinia furnacalis ( Of ChtIII) is revealed to be an arthropod-conserved chitinase that contains two nonsynergistic GH18 domains according to its catalytic properties. Both GH18 domains are active towards single-chained chitin substrates, but are inactive towards insoluble chitin substrates. The crystal structures of each unbound GH18 domain, as well as of GH18 domains complexed with hexa- N -acetyl-chitohexaose or penta- N -acetyl-chitopentaose, suggest that the two GH18 domains possess endo-specific activities. Physiological data indicated that the developmental stage-dependent gene-expression pattern of Of ChtIII was the same as that of the chitin synthase Of ChsA but significantly different from that of the chitinase Of ChtI, which is indispensable for cuticular chitin degradation. Additionally, immunological staining indicated that Of ChtIII was co-localized with Of ChsA. Thus, Of ChtIII is most likely to be involved in the chitin-synthesis pathway.",

    "abstract": "Modern crystal structure refinement programs rely on geometry restraints to overcome the challenge of a low data-to-parameter ratio. While the classical Engh and Huber restraints work well for standard amino-acid residues, the chemical complexity of small-molecule ligands presents a particular challenge. Most current approaches either limit ligand restraints to those that can be readily described in the Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format, thus sacrificing chemical flexibility and energetic accuracy, or they employ protocols that substantially lengthen the refinement time, potentially hindering rapid automated refinement workflows. PHENIX-AFITT refinement uses a full molecular-mechanics force field for user-selected small-molecule ligands during refinement, eliminating the potentially difficult problem of finding or generating high-quality geometry restraints. It is fully integrated with a standard refinement protocol and requires practically no additional steps from the user, making it ideal for high-throughput workflows. PHENIX-AFITT refinements also handle multiple ligands in a single model, alternate conformations and covalently bound ligands. Here, the results of combining AFITT and the PHENIX software suite on a data set of 189 protein-ligand PDB structures are presented. Refinements using PHENIX-AFITT significantly reduce ligand conformational energy and lead to improved geometries without detriment to the fit to the experimental data. For the data presented, PHENIX-AFITT refinements result in more chemically accurate models for small-molecule ligands.",

    "abstract": "Determination of protein crystal structures requires that the phases are derived independently of the observed measurement of diffraction intensities. Many techniques have been developed to obtain phases, including heavy-atom substitution, molecular replacement and substitution during protein expression of the amino acid methionine with selenomethionine. Although the use of selenium-containing methionine has transformed the experimental determination of phases it is not always possible, either because the variant protein cannot be produced or does not crystallize. Phasing of structures by measuring the anomalous diffraction from S atoms could in theory be almost universal since almost all proteins contain methionine or cysteine. Indeed, many structures have been solved by the so-called native sulfur single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (S-SAD) phasing method. However, the anomalous effect is weak at the wavelengths where data are normally recorded (between 1 and 2 Å) and this limits the potential of this method to well diffracting crystals. Longer wavelengths increase the strength of the anomalous signal but at the cost of increasing air absorption and scatter, which degrade the precision of the anomalous measurement, consequently hindering phase determination. A new instrument, the long-wavelength beamline I23 at Diamond Light Source, was designed to work at significantly longer wavelengths compared with standard synchrotron beamlines in order to open up the native S-SAD method to projects of increasing complexity. Here, the first novel structure, that of the oxidase domain involved in the production of the natural product patellamide, solved on this beamline is reported using data collected to a resolution of 3.15 Å at a wavelength of 3.1 Å. The oxidase is an example of a protein that does not crystallize as the selenium variant and for which no suitable homology model for molecular replacement was available. Initial attempts collecting anomalous diffraction data for native sulfur phasing on a standard macromolecular crystallography beamline using a wavelength of 1.77 Å did not yield a structure. The new beamline thus has the potential to facilitate structure determination by native S-SAD phasing for what would previously have been regarded as very challenging cases with modestly diffracting crystals and low sulfur content.",

These programs help to automate the process and therefore minimize the errors that could otherwise occur if it were performed manually. Furthermore, restraint-dictionary generation programs can incorporate chemical and other prior knowledge to provide reasonable choices of types and values. However, the use of restraints to define the geometry of a molecule is an approximation introduced with efficiency in mind. The representation of a bond as a parabolic function is a convenience and does not reflect the true variability in even the simplest of molecules. Another complicating factor is the interplay of the molecule with other parts of the macromolecular model. Finally, difficult situations arise from molecules with rare or unusual moieties that may not have their conformational space fully explored. These factors give rise to the need for an interactive editor for WYSIWYG interactions with the restraints and molecule.

Here, the use of electron cryotomography (ECT) to obtain significant insights into how an archetypal molecular machine, the bacterial flagellar motor, functions and how it has evolved is described. Over the last decade, studies using a high-throughput, medium-resolution ECT approach combined with genetics, phylogenetic reconstruction and phenotypic analysis have revealed surprising structural diversity in flagellar motors. Variations in the size and the number of torque-generating proteins in the motor visualized for the first time using ECT has shown that these variations have enabled bacteria to adapt their swimming torque to the environment. Much of the structural diversity can be explained in terms of scaffold structures that facilitate the incorporation of additional motor proteins, and more recent studies have begun to infer evolutionary pathways to higher torque-producing motors. This review seeks to highlight how the emerging power of ECT has enabled the inference of ancestral states from various bacterial species towards understanding how, and `why', flagellar motors have evolved from an ancestral motor to a diversity of variants with adapted or modified functions.",

To identify the DNA structural polymorphisms that are possible in such adaptations, the dinucleotide structures of 60 000 DNA steps from sequentially nonredundant crystal structures were classified and an automated protocol assigning 44 distinct structural (conformational) classes called NtC (for Nucleotide Conformers) was developed. To further facilitate understanding of the DNA structure, the NtC were assembled into the DNA structural alphabet CANA (Conformational Alphabet of Nucleic Acids) and the projection of CANA onto the graphical representation of the molecular structure was proposed. The NtC classification was used to define a validation score called confal, which quantifies the conformity between an analyzed structure and the geometries of NtC. NtC and CANA assignment were applied to analyze the structural properties of typical DNA structures such as Dickerson–Drew dodecamers, guanine quadruplexes and structural models based on fibre diffraction. NtC, CANA and confal assignment, which is accessible at the website https://dnatco.org, allows the quantitative assessment and validation of DNA structures and their subsequent analysis by means of pseudo-sequence alignment.

Caprin-1 has been implicated in several human diseases, including osteosarcoma, breast cancer, viral infection, hearing loss and neurodegenerative disorders. The functions of Caprin-1 depend on its molecular-interaction network. Direct interactions have been established between Caprin-1 and the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), Ras GAP-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) core protein. Here, crystal structures of a fragment (residues 132-251) of Caprin-1, which adopts a novel all-α-helical fold and mediates homodimerization through a substantial interface, are reported. Homodimerization creates a large and highly negatively charged concave surface suggestive of a protein-binding groove. The FMRP-interacting sequence motif forms an integral α-helix in the dimeric Caprin-1 structure in such a way that the binding of FMRP would not disrupt the homodimerization of Caprin-1. Based on insights from the structures and existing biochemical data, the existence of an evolutionarily conserved ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of Caprin-1, FMRP and G3BP1 is proposed. The JEV core protein may bind Caprin-1 at the negatively charged putative protein-binding groove and an adjacent E-rich sequence to hijack the RNP complex.",

Although the binding sites for the substrates CoA, phosphate, and the nucleotides ADP and ATP or GDP and GTP have been identified, the binding site for succinate has not. To determine this binding site, pig GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase was crystallized in the presence of succinate, magnesium ions and CoA, and the structure of the complex was determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.2 Å resolution. Succinate binds in the carboxy-terminal domain of the β-subunit. The succinate-binding site is near both the active-site histidine residue that is phosphorylated in the reaction and the free thiol of CoA. The carboxy-terminal domain rearranges when succinate binds, burying this active site. However, succinate is not in position for transfer of the phosphoryl group from phosphohistidine. Here, it is proposed that when the active-site histidine residue has been phosphorylated by GTP, the phosphohistidine displaces phosphate and triggers the movement of the carboxylate of succinate into position to be phosphorylated. The structure shows why succinyl-CoA synthetase is specific for succinate and does not react appreciably with citrate nor with the other C4-dicarboxylic acids of the citric acid cycle, fumarate and oxaloacetate, but shows some activity with L-malate.",

    "abstract": "The conventional approach to finding structurally similar search models for use in molecular replacement (MR) is to use the sequence of the target to search against those of a set of known structures. Sequence similarity often correlates with structure similarity. Given sufficient similarity, a known structure correctly positioned in the target cell by the MR process can provide an approximation to the unknown phases of the target. An alternative approach to identifying homologous structures suitable for MR is to exploit the measured data directly, comparing the lattice parameters or the experimentally derived structure-factor amplitudes with those of known structures. Here, SIMBAD , a new sequence-independent MR pipeline which implements these approaches, is presented. SIMBAD can identify cases of contaminant crystallization and other mishaps such as mistaken identity (swapped crystallization trays), as well as solving unsequenced targets and providing a brute-force approach where sequence-dependent search-model identification may be nontrivial, for example because of conformational diversity among identifiable homologues. The program implements a three-step pipeline to efficiently identify a suitable search model in a database of known structures. The first step performs a lattice-parameter search against the entire Protein Data Bank (PDB), rapidly determining whether or not a homologue exists in the same crystal form. The second step is designed to screen the target data for the presence of a crystallized contaminant, a not uncommon occurrence in macromolecular crystallography. Solving structures with MR in such cases can remain problematic for many years, since the search models, which are assumed to be similar to the structure of interest, are not necessarily related to the structures that have actually crystallized. To cater for this eventuality, SIMBAD rapidly screens the data against a database of known contaminant structures. Where the first two steps fail to yield a solution, a final step in SIMBAD can be invoked to perform a brute-force search of a nonredundant PDB database provided by the MoRDa MR software. Through early-access usage of SIMBAD , this approach has solved novel cases that have otherwise proved difficult to solve.",

    "abstract": "The performance of automated model building in crystal structure determination usually decreases with the resolution of the experimental data, and may result in fragmented models and incorrect side-chain assignment. Presented here are new methods for machine-learning-based docking of main-chain fragments to the sequence and for their sequence-independent connection using a dedicated library of protein fragments. The combined use of these new methods noticeably increases sequence coverage and reduces fragmentation of the protein models automatically built with ARP/wARP.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in crystallographic hardware and software have allowed automated structure-solution pipelines to approach a near-`one-click' experience for the initial determination of macromolecular structures. However, in many cases the resulting initial model requires a laborious, iterative process of refinement and validation. A new method has been developed for the automatic modeling of side-chain conformations that takes advantage of rotamer-prediction methods in a crystallographic context. The algorithm, which is based on deterministic dead-end elimination (DEE) theory, uses new dense conformer libraries and a hybrid energy function derived from experimental data and prior information about rotamer frequencies to find the optimal conformation of each side chain. In contrast to existing methods, which incorporate the electron-density term into protein-modeling frameworks, the proposed algorithm is designed to take advantage of the highly discriminatory nature of electron-density maps. This method has been implemented in the program Fitmunk, which uses extensive conformational sampling. This improves the accuracy of the modeling and makes it a versatile tool for crystallographic model building, refinement and validation. Fitmunk was extensively tested on over 115 new structures, as well as a subset of 1100 structures from the PDB. It is demonstrated that the ability of Fitmunk to model more than 95% of side chains accurately is beneficial for improving the quality of crystallographic protein models, especially at medium and low resolutions. Fitmunk can be used for model validation of existing structures and as a tool to assess whether side chains are modeled optimally or could be better fitted into electron density. Fitmunk is available as a web service at http://kniahini.med.virginia.edu/fitmunk/server/ or at http://fitmunk.bitbucket.org/.",

Its recent adoption by industry, particularly in structure-based drug design, creates new requirements in terms of reliability, reproducibility and throughput. In 2016, Thermo Fisher Scientific (then FEI) partnered with the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, the University of Cambridge Nanoscience Centre and five pharmaceutical companies [Astex Pharmaceuticals, AstraZeneca, GSK, Sosei Heptares and Union Chimique Belge (UCB)] to form the Cambridge Pharmaceutical Cryo-EM Consortium to share the risks of exploring cryo-EM for early-stage drug discovery. The Consortium expanded with a second Themo Scientific Krios Cryo-EM at the University of Cambridge Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy. Several Consortium members have set up in-house facilities, and a full service cryo-EM facility with Krios and Glacios has been created with the Electron Bio-Imaging Centre for Industry (eBIC for Industry) at Diamond Light Source (DLS), UK. This paper will cover the lessons learned during the setting up of these facilities, including two Consortium Krios microscopes and preparation laboratories, several Glacios microscopes at Consortium member sites, and a Krios and Glacios at eBIC for Industry, regarding site evaluation and selection for high-resolution cryo-EM microscopes, the installation process, scheduling, the operation and maintenance of the microscopes and preparation laboratories, and image processing.",

However, it is inevitable that more high-profile biological drug targets will be identified for which high-quality, highly homogenous crystal systems cannot be found. With increasing heterogeneity in crystal systems, the application of current multi-data-set methods becomes ever less sensitive to bound ligands. In order to ease the bottleneck of finding a well behaved crystal system, pre-clustering of data sets can be carried out using cluster4x after data collection to separate data sets into smaller partitions in order to restore the sensitivity of multi-data-set methods. Here, the software cluster4x is introduced for this purpose and validated against published data sets using PanDDA, showing an improved total signal from existing ligands and identifying new hits in both highly heterogenous and less heterogenous multi-data sets. cluster4x provides the researcher with an interactive graphical user interface with which to explore multi-data set experiments.",

    "abstract": "When building atomic models into weak and/or low-resolution density, a common strategy is to restrain their conformation to that of a higher resolution model of the same or similar sequence. When doing so, it is important to avoid over-restraining to the reference model in the face of disagreement with the experimental data. The most common strategy for this is the use of `top-out' potentials. These act like simple harmonic restraints within a defined range, but gradually weaken when the deviation between the model and reference grows beyond that range. In each current implementation the rate at which the potential flattens at large deviations follows a fixed form, although the form chosen varies among implementations. A restraint potential with a tuneable rate of flattening would provide greater flexibility to encode the confidence in any given restraint. Here, two new such potentials are described: a Cartesian distance restraint derived from a recent generalization of common loss functions and a periodic torsion restraint based on a renormalization of the von Mises distribution. Further, their implementation as user-adjustable/switchable restraints in ISOLDE is described and their use in some real-world examples is demonstrated.",

Here, some important methods for validation at several stages in this process are described. Firstly, how Fourier shell correlation of two independent maps and phase randomization beyond a certain frequency address the assessment of map resolution is reviewed. Techniques for local resolution estimation and map sharpening are also touched upon. The topic of validating models which are either built de novo or based on a known atomic structure fitted into a cryo-EM map is then approached. Map–model comparison using Q -scores and Fourier shell correlation plots is used to assure the agreement of the model with the observed map density. The importance of annotating the model with B factors to account for the resolvability of individual atoms in the map is illustrated. Finally, the timely topic of detecting and validating water molecules and metal ions in maps that have surpassed ∼2 Å resolution is described.",

However, a single structural conformation identified at cryogenic temperatures may introduce a fictitious structure as a result of cryogenic cooling artefacts, limiting the overview of inherent protein physiological dynamics, which play a critical role in the biological functions of proteins. Here, a room-temperature X-ray crystallographic method using temperature as a trigger to record movie-like structural snapshots has been developed. The method has been used to show how TL00150, a 175.15 Da fragment, undergoes binding-mode changes in endothiapepsin. A surprising fragment-binding discrepancy was observed between the cryo-cooled and physiological temperature structures, and multiple binding poses and their interplay with DMSO were captured. The observations here open up new promising prospects for structure determination and interpretation at physiological temperatures with implications for structure-based drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, serial X-ray crystallography has enabled the structure determination of a wide range of proteins. With the advent of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), ever-smaller crystals have yielded high-resolution diffraction and structure determination. A crucial need to continue advancement is the efficient delivery of fragile and micrometre-sized crystals to the X-ray beam intersection. This paper presents an improved design of an all-polymer microfluidic `chip' for room-temperature fixed-target serial crystallography that can be tailored to broadly meet the needs of users at either synchrotron or XFEL light sources. The chips are designed to be customized around different types of crystals and offer users a friendly, quick, convenient, ultra-low-cost and robust sample-delivery platform. Compared with the previous iteration of the chip [Gilbile et al. (2021), Lab Chip , 21 , 4831–4845], the new design eliminates cleanroom fabrication. It has a larger imaging area to volume, while maintaining crystal hydration stability for both in situ crystallization or direct crystal slurry loading. Crystals of two model proteins, lysozyme and thaumatin, were used to validate the effectiveness of the design at both synchrotron (lysozyme and thaumatin) and XFEL (lysozyme only) facilities, yielding complete data sets with resolutions of 1.42, 1.48 and 1.70 Å, respectively. Overall, the improved chip design, ease of fabrication and high modifiability create a powerful, all-around sample-delivery tool that structural biologists can quickly adopt, especially in cases of limited sample volume and small, fragile crystals.",

    "abstract": "In 2017, guidelines were published for reporting structural modelling of small-angle scattering (SAS) data from biomolecules in solution that exemplified best-practice documentation of experiments and analysis. Since then, there has been significant progress in SAS data and model archiving, and the IUCr journal editors announced that the IUCr biology journals will require the deposition of SAS data used in biomolecular structure solution into a public archive, as well as adherence to the 2017 reporting guidelines. In this context, the reporting template tables accompanying the 2017 publication guidelines have been reviewed with a focus on making them both easier to use and more general. With input from the SAS community via the IUCr Commission on SAS and attendees of the triennial 2022 SAS meeting (SAS2022, Campinas, Brazil), an updated reporting template table has been developed that includes standard descriptions for proteins, glycosylated proteins, DNA and RNA, with some reorganization of the data to improve readability and interpretation. In addition, a specialized template has been developed for reporting SAS contrast-variation (SAS-cv) data and models that incorporates the additional reporting requirements from the 2017 guidelines for these more complicated experiments. To demonstrate their utility, examples of reporting with these new templates are provided for a SAS study of a DNA–protein complex and a SAS-cv experiment on a protein complex. The examples demonstrate how the tabulated information promotes transparent reporting that, in combination with the recommended figures and additional information best presented in the main text, enables the reader of the work to readily draw their own conclusions regarding the quality of the data and the validity of the models presented.",

The technique involves locally melting a cryo sample with a laser beam to allow the proteins to undergo dynamics in the liquid phase. When the laser is switched off, the sample cools within just a few microseconds and revitrifies, trapping particles in their transient configurations, in which they can subsequently be imaged. Two alternative implementations of the technique have previously been described, using either an optical microscope or performing revitrification experiments in situ. Here, it is shown that it is possible to obtain near-atomic resolution reconstructions from in situ revitrified cryo samples. Moreover, the resulting map is indistinguishable from that obtained from a conventional sample within the spatial resolution. Interestingly, it is observed that revitrification leads to a more homogeneous angular distribution of the particles, suggesting that revitrification may potentially be used to overcome issues of preferred particle orientation.",

The results are used for the generation of new ligand descriptions, which are subsequently used by macromolecular model-building and structure-refinement software. To increase the reliability of the derived data, and therefore the new ligand descriptions, the entries from this database were subjected to very strict validation. The selection criteria made sure that the crystal structures used to derive atom types, bond and angle classes are of sufficiently high quality. Any suspicious entries at a crystal or molecular level were removed from further consideration. The selection criteria included (i) the resolution of the data used for refinement (entries solved at 0.84 Å resolution or higher) and (ii) the structure-solution method (structures must be from a single-crystal experiment and all atoms of generated molecules must have full occupancies), as well as basic sanity checks such as (iii) consistency between the valences and the number of connections between atoms, (iv) acceptable bond-length deviations from the expected values and (v) detection of atomic collisions. The derived atom types and bond classes were then validated using high-order moment-based statistical techniques. The results of the statistical analyses were fed back to fine-tune the atom typing. The developed procedure was repeated four times, resulting in fine-grained atom typing, bond and angle classes. The procedure will be repeated in the future as and when new entries are deposited in the COD. The whole procedure can also be applied to any source of small-molecule structures, including the Cambridge Structural Database and the ZINC database.",

Multiple structures of the TGFβR1 kinase domain are known, but the structure of TGFβR2 remains unreported. Wild-type TGFβR2 kinase domain was refractory to crystallization, leading to the design of two mutated constructs: firstly, a TGFβR1 chimeric protein with seven ATP-site residues mutated to their counterparts in TGFβR2, and secondly, a reduction of surface entropy through mutation of six charged residues on the surface of the TGFβR2 kinase domain to alanines. These yielded apo and inhibitor-bound crystals that diffracted to high resolution (&lt;2 Å). Comparison of these structures with those of TGFβR1 reveal shared ligand contacts as well as differences in the ATP-binding sites, suggesting strategies for the design of pan and selective TGFβR inhibitors.",

It remains unclear how the sensor protein PERK is activated by ER stress. It has been demonstrated that the PERK luminal domain can recognize and selectively interact with misfolded proteins but not native proteins. Moreover, the PERK luminal domain may function as a molecular chaperone to directly bind to and suppress the aggregation of a number of misfolded model proteins. The data strongly support the hypothesis that the PERK luminal domain can interact directly with misfolded proteins to induce ER stress signaling. To illustrate the mechanism by which the PERK luminal domain interacts with misfolded proteins, the crystal structure of the human PERK luminal domain was determined to 3.2 Å resolution. Two dimers of the PERK luminal domain constitute a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Superimposition of the PERK luminal domain molecules indicated that the β-sandwich domain could adopt multiple conformations. It is hypothesized that the PERK luminal domain may utilize its flexible β-sandwich domain to recognize and interact with a broad range of misfolded proteins.",

A second Krios microscope is now in operation, with two more due to come online in 2017. In the next phase of growth of eBIC, in addition to more microscope time, new data-collection strategies and sample-preparation techniques will be made available to external user groups.

Well diffracting crystals showing how the inhibitor binds to human ATP-citrate lyase were grown by modifying the protein. The protein was modified by introducing cleavage sites for Tobacco etch virus protease on either side of a disordered linker. The protein crystallized consisted of residues 2–425-ENLYFQ and S-488–810 of human ATP-citrate lyase. (2 S ,3 S )-2-Hydroxycitrate binds in the same orientation as citrate, but the citrate-binding domain (residues 248–421) adopts a different orientation with respect to the rest of the protein (residues 4–247, 490–746 and 748–809) from that previously seen. For the first time, electron density was evident for the loop that contains His760, which is phosphorylated as part of the catalytic mechanism. The pro- S carboxylate of (2 S ,3 S )-2-hydroxycitrate is available to accept a phosphoryl group from His760. However, when co-crystals were grown with ATP and magnesium ions as well as either the inhibitor or citrate, Mg 2+ -ADP was bound and His760 was phosphorylated. The phosphoryl group was not transferred to the organic acid. This led to the interpretation that the active site is trapped in an open conformation. The strategy of designing cleavage sites to remove disordered residues could be useful in determining the crystal structures of other proteins.",

This has been exploited in several existing pipelines. This paper presents a new pipeline, named Fragon , in which fragments (ideal α-helices or β-strands) are placed using Phaser and the phases calculated from these coordinates are then improved by the density-modification methods provided by ACORN . The reliable scoring algorithm provided by ACORN identifies success. In these cases, the resulting phases are usually of sufficient quality to enable automated model building of the entire structure. Fragon was evaluated against two test sets comprising mixed α/β folds and all-β folds at resolutions between 1.0 and 1.7 Å. Success rates of 61% for the mixed α/β test set and 30% for the all-β test set were achieved. In almost 70% of successful runs, fragment placement and density modification took less than 30 min on relatively modest four-core desktop computers. In all successful runs the best set of phases enabled automated model building with ARP / wARP to complete the structure.",

The overall conformation of the helicase core, formed by two RecA-like domains, does not differ significantly between the ADP-bound and the nucleotide-free states. However, intrinsic flexibility of Prp2 is observed, varying the position of the C-terminal domains with respect to the RecA domains. Additionally, in one of the structures a unique ADP conformation is found which has not been observed in any other DEAH-box, DEAD-box or NS3/NPH-II helicase.",

The structure of the human U4 snRNP core domain was initially solved at 3.6 Å resolution by experimental phasing using data with tetartohedral twinning. Molecular replacement from this model followed by density modification using untwinned data recently led to a structure of the minimal U1 snRNP at 3.3 Å resolution. With the latter structure providing a search model for molecular replacement, the U4 core-domain structure has now been re-refined. The U4 Sm site-sequence AAUUUUU has been shown to bind to the seven Sm proteins SmF-SmE-SmG-SmD3-SmB-SmD1-SmD2 in an identical manner as the U1 Sm-site sequence AAUUUGU, except in SmD1 where the bound U replaces G. The progression from the initial to the re-refined structure exemplifies a tortuous route to accuracy: where well diffracting crystals of complex assemblies are initially unavailable, the early model errors are rectified by exploiting preliminary interpretations in further experiments involving homologous structures. New insights are obtained from the more accurate model.",

The cap-binding domain of the PB2 subunit (PB2cap) in the viral polymerase binds the cap of a host pre-mRNA molecule, while the endonuclease of the PA subunit cleaves the RNA 10-13 nucleotides downstream from the cap. The capped RNA fragment is then used as the primer for viral mRNA transcription. The structure of PB2cap from influenza virus H1N1 A/California/07/2009 and of its complex with the cap analog m(7)GTP were solved at high resolution. Structural changes are observed in the cap-binding site of this new pandemic influenza virus strain, especially the hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the target protein. m(7)GTP binds deeper in the pocket than some other virus strains, much deeper than the host cap-binding proteins. Analysis of the new H1N1 structures and comparisons with other structures provide new insights into the design of small-molecule inhibitors that will be effective against multiple strains of both type A and type B influenza viruses.",

Being able to visualise protein-glycan and glycan-glycan contacts in a clear way is thus of great importance for the understanding of these biological processes. In structural terms, glycosylation sugars glue the protein together via hydrogen bonds, whereas non-covalently bound glycans frequently harness additional stacking interactions. Finding an unobscured molecular view of these multipartite scenarios is usually far from trivial; in addition to the need to show the interacting protein residues, glycans may contain many branched sugars, each composed of more than ten non-H atoms and offering more than three potential bonding partners. With structural glycoscience finally gaining popularity and steadily increasing the deposition rate of three-dimensional structures of glycoproteins, the need for a clear way of depicting these interactions is more pressing than ever. Here a schematic representation, named Glycoblocks, is introduced which combines a simplified bonding-network depiction (covering hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions) with the familiar two-dimensional glycan notation used by the glycobiology community, brought into three dimensions by the CCP4 molecular graphics project (CCP4mg).",

    "abstract": "A number of X-ray analyses of an enzyme involved in a key early stage of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis are reported. Two structures of human 5-aminolaevulinate dehydratase (ALAD), native and recombinant, have been determined at 2.8 Å resolution, showing that the enzyme adopts an octameric quaternary structure in accord with previously published analyses of the enzyme from a range of other species. However, this is in contrast to the finding that a disease-related F12L mutant of the human enzyme uniquely forms hexamers [Breinig et al. (2003), Nature Struct. Biol. 10 , 757–763]. Monomers of all ALADs adopt the TIM-barrel fold; the subunit conformation that assembles into the octamer includes the N-terminal tail of one monomer curled around the (α/β) 8 barrel of a neighbouring monomer. Both crystal forms of the human enzyme possess two monomers per asymmetric unit, termed A and B . In the native enzyme there are a number of distinct structural differences between the A and B monomers, with the latter exhibiting greater disorder in a number of loop regions and in the active site. In contrast, the second monomer of the recombinant enzyme appears to be better defined and the active site of both monomers clearly possesses a zinc ion which is bound by three conserved cysteine residues. In native human ALAD, the A monomer also has a ligand resembling the substrate ALA which is covalently bound by a Schiff base to one of the active-site lysines (Lys252) and is held in place by an ordered active-site loop. In contrast, these features of the active-site structure are disordered or absent in the B subunit of the native human enzyme. The octameric structure of the zinc-dependent ALAD from the hyperthermophile Pyrobaculum calidifontis is also reported at a somewhat lower resolution of 3.5 Å. Finally, the details are presented of a high-resolution structure of the Escherichia coli ALAD enzyme co-crystallized with a noncovalently bound moiety of the product, porphobilinogen (PBG). This structure reveals that the pyrrole side-chain amino group is datively bound to the active-site zinc ion and that the PBG carboxylates interact with the enzyme via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with invariant residues. A number of hydrogen-bond interactions that were previously observed in the structure of yeast ALAD with a cyclic intermediate resembling the product PBG appear to be weaker in the new structure, suggesting that these interactions are only optimal in the transition state.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases (CHDLs) produce resistance to the last-resort carbapenem antibiotics and render these drugs ineffective for the treatment of life-threatening infections. Here, it is shown that among the clinically important CHDLs, OXA-143 produces the highest levels of resistance to carbapenems and has the highest catalytic efficiency against these substrates. Structural data demonstrate that acylated carbapenems entirely fill the active site of CHDLs, leaving no space for water molecules, including the deacylating water. Since the entrance to the active site is obstructed by the acylated antibiotic, the deacylating water molecule must take a different route for entry. It is shown that in OXA-143 the movement of a conserved hydrophobic valine residue on the surface opens a channel to the active site of the enzyme, which would not only allow the exchange of water molecules between the active site and the milieu, but would also create extra space for a water molecule to position itself in the vicinity of the scissile bond of the acyl-enzyme intermediate to perform deacylation. Structural analysis of the OXA-23 carbapenemase shows that in this enzyme movement of the conserved leucine residue, juxtaposed to the valine on the molecular surface, creates a similar channel to the active site. These data strongly suggest that all CHDLs may employ a mechanism whereupon the movement of highly conserved valine or leucine residues would allow a water molecule to access the active site to promote deacylation. It is further demonstrated that the 6α-hydroxyethyl group of the bound carbapenem plays an important role in the stabilization of this channel. The recognition of a universal deacylation mechanism for CHDLs suggests a direction for the future development of inhibitors and novel antibiotics for these enzymes of utmost clinical importance.",

Individual drops with volumes as small as ∼65 pl were rapidly cooled to achieve the glass phase, and their densities at T = 77 K were determined by cryoflotation. These densities were used to determine the glass-phase electron density of each solution and its volume thermal contraction between room temperature and 77 K.

A number of features were also calculated for each residue using Coot, including map-to-model correlation, density values, B factors, clashes, Ramachandran scores, rotamer scores and resolution. Two neural networks were created using these features as inputs: one to predict the correctness of main-chain atoms and the other for side chains. The 639 structures were split into 511 that were used to train the neural networks and 128 that were used to test performance. The predicted correctness scores could correctly categorize 92.3% of the main-chain atoms and 87.6% of the side chains. A Coot ML Correctness script was written to display the scores in a graphical user interface as well as for the automatic pruning of chains, residues and side chains with low scores. The automatic pruning function was added to the CCP4i2 Buccaneer automated model-building pipeline, leading to significant improvements, especially for high-resolution structures.",

With input from the community, EMDB has developed new resources for the validation of cryo-EM structures, focusing on the quality of the volume data alone and that of the fit of any models, themselves archived in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), to the volume data. Based on recommendations from community experts, the validation resources are developed in a three-tiered system. Tier 1 covers an extensive and evolving set of validation metrics, including tried and tested metrics as well as more experimental ones, which are calculated for all EMDB entries and presented in the Validation Analysis (VA) web resource. This system is particularly useful for cryo-EM experts, both to validate individual structures and to assess the utility of new validation metrics. Tier 2 comprises a subset of the validation metrics covered by the VA resource that have been subjected to extensive testing and are considered to be useful for specialists as well as nonspecialists. These metrics are presented on the entry-specific web pages for the entire archive on the EMDB website. As more experience is gained with the metrics included in the VA resource, it is expected that consensus will emerge in the community regarding a subset that is suitable for inclusion in the tier 2 system. Tier 3, finally, consists of the validation reports and servers that are produced by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) Consortium. Successful metrics from tier 2 will be proposed for inclusion in the wwPDB validation pipeline and reports. The details of the new resource are described, with an emphasis on the tier 1 system. The output of all three tiers is publicly available, either through the EMDB website (tiers 1 and 2) or through the wwPDB ftp sites (tier 3), although the content of all three will evolve over time (fastest for tier 1 and slowest for tier 3). It is our hope that these validation resources will help the cryo-EM community to obtain a better understanding of the quality and of the best ways to assess the quality of cryo-EM structures in EMDB and PDB.",

The size and low resolution of such molecular systems often make structural modelling and molecular dynamics simulations challenging and computationally expensive. This, together with the growing wealth of structural data arising from cryoEM and other structural biology methods, has driven a trend in the computational biophysics community towards the development of new pipelines for analysing global dynamics using coarse-grained models and methods. At the centre of this trend has been a return to elastic network models, normal mode analysis (NMA) and ensemble analyses such as principal component analysis, and the growth of hybrid simulation methodologies that make use of them. Here, this field is reviewed with a focus on ProDy, the Python application programming interface for protein dynamics, which has been developed over the last decade. Two key developments in this area are highlighted: (i) ensemble NMA towards extracting and comparing the signature dynamics of homologous structures, aided by the recent SignDy pipeline, and (ii) pseudoatom fitting for more efficient global dynamics analyses of large and low-resolution supramolecular assemblies from cryoEM, revisited in the CryoDy pipeline. It is believed that such a renewal and extension of old models and methods in new pipelines will be critical for driving the field forward into the next cryoEM revolution.",

Here, crucial details are added to the characterization of the method. It is shown that single-particle reconstructions of apoferritin and Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus from revitrified samples are indistinguishable from those from conventional samples, demonstrating that melting and revitrification leaves the particles intact and that they do not undergo structural changes within the spatial resolution afforded by the instrument. How rapid revitrification affects the properties of the ice is also characterized, showing that revitrified samples exhibit comparable amounts of beam-induced motion. The results pave the way for microsecond time-resolved studies of the conformational dynamics of proteins and open up new avenues to study the vitrification process and to address beam-induced specimen movement.",

This technique requires the accurate measurement of intensities to determine differences between Bijvoet pairs. Although SAD experiments are commonly conducted at cryogenic temperatures to mitigate the effects of radiation damage, such temperatures can alter the conformational ensemble of the protein and may impede the merging of data from multiple crystals due to non-uniform freezing. Here, a strategy is presented to obtain high-quality data from room-temperature, single-crystal experiments. To illustrate the strengths of this approach, native SAD phasing at 6.55 keV was used to solve four structures of three model systems at 295 K. The resulting data sets allow automatic phasing and model building, and reveal alternate conformations that reflect the structure of proteins at room temperature.",

The Coronavirus Structural Task Force evaluated all structures from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, but errors in measurement, data processing and modelling are present beyond these structures and throughout the structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Identifying them is only the first step; in order to minimize the impact that errors have in structural biology, error culture needs to change. It should be emphasized that the atomic model which is published is an interpretation of the measurement. Furthermore, risks should be minimized by addressing issues early and by investigating the source of a given problem, so that it may be avoided in the future. If we as a community can do this, it will greatly benefit experimental structural biologists as well as downstream users who are using structural models to deduce new biological and medical answers in the future.",

    "abstract": "Fucoidanases (EC 3.2.1.–) catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds between fucose residues in fucoidans. Fucoidans are a compositionally and structurally diverse class of fucose-containing sulfated polysaccharides that are primarily found in brown seaweeds. Here, the structural characterization of a novel endo-α(1,4)-fucoidanase, Mef1, from the marine bacterium Muricauda eckloniae is presented, showing sequence similarity to members of glycoside hydrolase family 107. Using carbohydrate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, it is shown that the fucoidanase Mef1 catalyzes the cleavage of α(1,4)-linkages between fucose residues sulfated on C2 in the structure [-3)-α-L-Fuc p 2S-(1,4)-α-L-Fuc p 2S-(1-] n in fucoidan from Fucus evanescens . Kinetic analysis of Mef1 activity by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the specific Mef1 fucoidanase activity (U f ) on F. evanescens fucoidan was 0.1 × 10 −3 U f µ M −1 . By crystal structure determination of Mef1 at 1.8 Å resolution, a single-domain organization comprising a (β/α) 8 -barrel domain was determined. The active site was in an extended, positively charged groove that is likely to be designed to accommodate the binding of the negatively charged, sulfated fucoidan substrate. The active site of Mef1 comprises the amino acids His270 and Asp187, providing acid/base and nucleophile groups, respectively, for the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in the fucoidan backbone. Electron densities were identified for two possible Ca 2+ ions in the enzyme, one of which is partially exposed to the active-site groove, while the other is very tightly coordinated. A water wire was discovered leading from the exterior of the Mef1 enzyme into the active site, passing the tightly coordinated Ca 2+ site.",

Using pump–probe schemes, this should make the mechanistic study of photoactive proteins and other suitable systems possible with time resolutions down to microseconds. In order to identify relevant time delays, time-resolved spectroscopic experiments directly performed on protein crystals are often desirable. To this end, an instrument has been built at the ic OS Lab ( in crystallo Optical Spectroscopy Laboratory) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility using reflective focusing objectives with a tuneable nanosecond laser as a pump and a microsecond xenon flash lamp as a probe, called the TR- ic OS (time-resolved ic OS) setup. Using this instrument, pump–probe spectra can rapidly be recorded from single crystals with time delays ranging from a few microseconds to seconds and beyond. This can be repeated at various laser pulse energies to track the potential presence of artefacts arising from two-photon absorption, which amounts to a power titration of a photoreaction. This approach has been applied to monitor the rise and decay of the M state in the photocycle of crystallized bacteriorhodopsin and showed that the photocycle is increasingly altered with laser pulses of peak fluence greater than 100 mJ cm −2 , providing experimental laser and delay parameters for a successful TR-MX experiment.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold 2 has revolutionized structural biology by offering unparalleled accuracy in predicting protein structures. Traditional methods for determining protein structures, such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. AlphaFold 2 provides models that are valuable for molecular replacement, aiding in model building and docking into electron density or potential maps. However, despite its capabilities, models from AlphaFold 2 do not consistently match the accuracy of experimentally determined structures, need to be validated experimentally and currently miss some crucial information, such as post-translational modifications, ligands and bound ions. In this paper, the advantages are explored of collecting X-ray anomalous data to identify chemical elements, such as metal ions, which are key to understanding certain structures and functions of proteins. This is achieved through methods such as calculating anomalous difference Fourier maps or refining the imaginary component of the anomalous scattering factor f ′′. Anomalous data can serve as a valuable complement to the information provided by AlphaFold 2 models and this is particularly significant in elucidating the roles of metal ions.",

    "abstract": "Serum albumin (SA) is the most abundant protein in plasma and is the main transporter of molecules in the circulatory system of all vertebrates, with applications in medicine, the pharmaceutical industry and molecular biology. It is known that albumins from different organisms vary in sequence; thus, it is important to know the impact of the amino-acid sequence on the three-dimensional structure and ligand-binding properties. Here, crystal structures of ovine (OSA) and caprine (CSA) serum albumins, isolated from sheep and goat blood, are described, as well those of their complexes with 3,5-diiodosalicylic acid (DIS): OSA–DIS (2.20 Å resolution) and CSA–DIS (1.78 Å resolution). The ligand-free OSA structure was determined in the trigonal space group P 3 2 21 at 2.30 Å resolution, while that of CSA in the orthorhombic space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 was determined at 1.94 Å resolution. Both albumins are also capable of crystallizing in the triclinic space group P 1, giving isostructural crystals that diffract to around 2.5 Å resolution. A comparison of OSA and CSA with the closely related bovine serum albumin (BSA) shows both similarities and differences in the distribution of DIS binding sites. The investigated serum albumins from domesticated ruminants in their complexes with DIS are also compared with the analogous structures of equine and human serum albumins (ESA–DIS and HSA–DIS). Surprisingly, despite 98% sequence similarity, OSA binds only two molecules of DIS, whereas CSA binds six molecules of this ligand. Moreover, the binding of DIS to OSA and CSA introduced changes in the overall architecture of the proteins, causing not only different conformations of the amino-acid side chains in the binding pockets, but also a significant shift of the whole helices, changing the volume of the binding cavities.",

    "abstract": "Accurately refining biomacromolecules using a quantum-chemical method is challenging because the cost of a quantum-chemical calculation scales approximately as nm, where n is the number of atoms and m (≥3) is based on the quantum method of choice. This fundamental problem means that quantum-chemical calculations become intractable when the size of the system requires more computational resources than are available. In the development of the software package called Q|R, this issue is referred to as Q|R#1. A divide-and-conquer approach has been developed that fragments the atomic model into small manageable pieces in order to solve Q|R#1. Firstly, the atomic model of a crystal structure is analyzed to detect noncovalent interactions between residues, and the results of the analysis are represented as an interaction graph. Secondly, a graph-clustering algorithm is used to partition the interaction graph into a set of clusters in such a way as to minimize disruption to the noncovalent interaction network. Thirdly, the environment surrounding each individual cluster is analyzed and any residue that is interacting with a particular cluster is assigned to the buffer region of that particular cluster. A fragment is defined as a cluster plus its buffer region. The gradients for all atoms from each of the fragments are computed, and only the gradients from each cluster are combined to create the total gradients. A quantum-based refinement is carried out using the total gradients as chemical restraints. In order to validate this interaction graph-based fragmentation approach in Q|R, the entire atomic model of an amyloid cross-β spine crystal structure (PDB entry 2oNA) was refined.",

    "abstract": "Radiation damage during macromolecular X-ray crystallographic data collection is still the main impediment for many macromolecular structure determinations. Even when an eventual model results from the crystallographic pipeline, the manifestations of radiation-induced structural and conformation changes, the so-called specific damage, within crystalline macromolecules can lead to false interpretations of biological mechanisms. Although this has been well characterized within protein crystals, far less is known about specific damage effects within the larger class of nucleoprotein complexes. Here, a methodology has been developed whereby per-atom density changes could be quantified with increasing dose over a wide (1.3–25.0 MGy) range and at higher resolution (1.98 Å) than the previous systematic specific damage study on a protein–DNA complex. Specific damage manifestations were determined within the large trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) bound to a single-stranded RNA that forms a belt around the protein. Over a large dose range, the RNA was found to be far less susceptible to radiation-induced chemical changes than the protein. The availability of two TRAP molecules in the asymmetric unit, of which only one contained bound RNA, allowed a controlled investigation into the exact role of RNA binding in protein specific damage susceptibility. The 11-fold symmetry within each TRAP ring permitted statistically significant analysis of the Glu and Asp damage patterns, with RNA binding unexpectedly being observed to protect these otherwise highly sensitive residues within the 11 RNA-binding pockets distributed around the outside of the protein molecule. Additionally, the method enabled a quantification of the reduction in radiation-induced Lys and Phe disordering upon RNA binding directly from the electron density.",

ACBPs act to form intracellular acyl-CoA pools, transport acyl-CoA esters and regulate lipid metabolism. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a family of six ACBPs has been demonstrated to function in stress and development. Six ACBPs (OsACBPs) have also been identified in Oryza sativa (rice), but they are not as well characterized as those in Arabidopsis thaliana. To understand the need in rice for the two 10 kDa ACBPs, namely OsACBP1 and OsACBP2, which share 79% sequence identity, their crystal structures were elucidated and their affinities toward acyl-CoA esters were compared using isothermal titration calorimetry. OsACBP2 was found to display a higher binding affinity for unsaturated acyl-CoA esters than OsACBP1. A difference between the two proteins is observed at helix 3 and is predicted to lead to different ligand-binding modes in terms of the shape of the binding pocket and the residues that are involved. OsACBP1 thus resembles bovine ACBP, while OsACBP2 is similar to human liver ACBP, in both structure and binding affinity. This is the first time that ACBP structures have been reported from plants, and suggests that OsACBP1 and OsACBP2 are not redundant in function despite their high sequence identity and general structural similarity.",

    "abstract": "Conventional macromolecular crystallographic refinement relies on often dubious stereochemical restraints, the preparation of which often requires human validation for unusual species, and on rudimentary energy functionals that are devoid of nonbonding effects owing to electrostatics, polarization, charge transfer or even hydrogen bonding. While this approach has served the crystallographic community for decades, as structure-based drug design/discovery (SBDD) has grown in prominence it has become clear that these conventional methods are less rigorous than they need to be in order to produce properly predictive protein–ligand models, and that the human intervention that is required to successfully treat ligands and other unusual chemistries found in SBDD often precludes high-throughput, automated refinement. Recently, plugins to the Python-based Hierarchical ENvironment for Integrated Xtallography ( PHENIX ) crystallographic platform have been developed to augment conventional methods with the in situ use of quantum mechanics (QM) applied to ligand(s) along with the surrounding active site(s) at each step of refinement [Borbulevych et al. (2014), Acta Cryst D 70 , 1233–1247]. This method (Region-QM) significantly increases the accuracy of the X-ray refinement process, and this approach is now used, coupled with experimental density, to accurately determine protonation states, binding modes, ring-flip states, water positions and so on. In the present work, this approach is expanded to include a more rigorous treatment of the entire structure, including the ligand(s), the associated active site(s) and the entire protein, using a fully automated, mixed quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) Hamiltonian recently implemented in the DivCon package. This approach was validated through the automatic treatment of a population of 80 protein–ligand structures chosen from the Astex Diverse Set. Across the entire population, this method results in an average 3.5-fold reduction in ligand strain and a 4.5-fold improvement in MolProbity clashscore, as well as improvements in Ramachandran and rotamer outlier analyses. Overall, these results demonstrate that the use of a structure-wide QM/MM Hamiltonian exhibits improvements in the local structural chemistry of the ligand similar to Region-QM refinement but with significant improvements in the overall structure beyond the active site.",

This makes them catalysts of interest for various biotechnological applications. The X-ray structure of the GH78 family α-L-rhamnosidase from Aspergillus terreus has been determined at 1.38 Å resolution using the sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method. The protein was isolated from its natural source in the native glycosylated form, and the active site contained a glucose molecule, probably from the growth medium. In addition to its catalytic domain, the α-L-rhamnosidase from A. terreus contains four accessory domains of unknown function. The structural data suggest that two of these accessory domains, E and F, might play a role in stabilizing the aglycon portion of the bound substrate.",

The outer membrane protein OmpU is the most abundant outer membrane protein in V. cholerae , and has been identified as an important virulence factor that is involved in host-cell interaction and recognition, as well as being critical for the survival of the pathogenic V. cholerae in the host body and in harsh environments. The mechanism of these processes is not well understood owing to a lack of the structure of V. cholerae OmpU. Here, the crystal structure of the V. cholerae OmpU trimer is reported to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The protomer forms a 16-β-stranded barrel with a noncanonical N-terminal coil located in the lumen of the barrel that consists of residues Gly32–Ser42 and is observed to participate in forming the second gate in the pore. By mapping the published functional data onto the OmpU structure, the OmpU structure reinforces the notion that the long extracellular loop L4 with a β-hairpin-like motif may be critical for host-cell binding and invasion, while L3, L4 and L8 are crucially implicated in phage recognition by V. cholerae .",

In light of the importance of A. thaliana as a model organism for understanding higher plant biology, and the pivotal role of Rubisco in photosynthetic carbon assimilation, there has been a notable absence of an A. thaliana Rubisco crystal structure. A. thaliana Rubisco is an L 8 S 8 hexadecamer comprising eight plastome-encoded catalytic large (L) subunits and eight nuclear-encoded small (S) subunits. A. thaliana produces four distinct small-subunit isoforms (RbcS1A, RbcS1B, RbcS2B and RbcS3B), and this crystal structure provides a snapshot of A. thaliana Rubisco containing the low-abundance RbcS3B small-subunit isoform. Crystals were obtained in the presence of the transition-state analogue 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol-1,5-bisphosphate. A. thaliana Rubisco shares the overall fold characteristic of higher plant Rubiscos, but exhibits an interesting disparity between sequence and structural relatedness to other Rubisco isoforms. These results provide the structural framework to understand A. thaliana Rubisco and the potential catalytic differences that could be conferred by alternative A. thaliana Rubisco small-subunit isoforms.",

    "abstract": "Oxidation states of individual metal atoms within a metalloprotein can be assigned by examining X-ray absorption edges, which shift to higher energy for progressively more positive valence numbers. Indeed, X-ray crystallography is well suited for such a measurement, owing to its ability to spatially resolve the scattering contributions of individual metal atoms that have distinct electronic environments contributing to protein function. However, as the magnitude of the shift is quite small, about +2 eV per valence state for iron, it has only been possible to measure the effect when performed with monochromated X-ray sources at synchrotron facilities with energy resolutions in the range 2–3 × 10 −4 (Δ E / E ). This paper tests whether X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses, which have a broader bandpass (Δ E / E = 3 × 10 −3 ) when used without a monochromator, might also be useful for such studies. The program nanoBragg is used to simulate serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) diffraction images with sufficient granularity to model the XFEL spectrum, the crystal mosaicity and the wavelength-dependent anomalous scattering factors contributed by two differently charged iron centers in the 110-amino-acid protein, ferredoxin. Bayesian methods are then used to deduce, from the simulated data, the most likely X-ray absorption curves for each metal atom in the protein, which agree well with the curves chosen for the simulation. The data analysis relies critically on the ability to measure the incident spectrum for each pulse, and also on the nanoBragg simulator to predict the size, shape and intensity profile of Bragg spots based on an underlying physical model that includes the absorption curves, which are then modified to produce the best agreement with the simulated data. This inference methodology potentially enables the use of SFX diffraction for the study of metalloenzyme mechanisms and, in general, offers a more detailed approach to Bragg spot data reduction.",

The balance between these three probes within their strengths and weaknesses is perceived to change, even dramatically so at times.

Of course, to understand biological systems the required perspectives are surely physiologically relevant temperatures and relevant chemical conditions, as well as a minimal perturbation owing to the needs of the probe itself. These remain very tough challenges because, for example, cryoEM by its very nature will never be performed at room temperature, crystallization often requires nonphysiological chemical conditions, and X-rays and electrons cause beam damage. However, integrated structural biology techniques and functional assays provide a package towards physiological relevance of any given study. Reporting of protein crystal structures, and their associated database entries, could usefully indicate how close to the biological situation they are, as discussed in detail in this feature article.",

    "abstract": "Fragment-based molecular replacement exploits the use of very accurate yet incomplete search models. In the case of the ARCIMBOLDO programs, consistent phase sets produced from the placement and refinement of fragments with Phaser can be combined in order to increase their signal before proceeding to the step of density modification and autotracing with SHELXE. The program ALIXE compares multiple phase sets, evaluating mean phase differences to determine their common origin, and subsequently produces sets of combined phases that group consistent solutions. In this work, its use on different scenarios of very partial molecular-replacement solutions and its performance after the development of a much-optimized set of algorithms are described. The program is available both standalone and integrated within the ARCIMBOLDO programs. ALIXE has been analysed to identify its rate-limiting steps while exploring the best parameterization to improve its performance and make this software efficient enough to work on modest hardware. The algorithm has been parallelized and redesigned to meet the typical landscape of solutions. Analysis of pairwise correlation between the phase sets has also been explored to test whether this would provide additional insight. ALIXE can be used to exhaustively analyse all partial solutions produced or to complement those already selected for expansion, and also to reduce the number of redundant solutions, which is particularly relevant to the case of coiled coils, or to combine partial solutions from different programs. In each case parallelization and optimization to provide speedup makes its use amenable to typical hardware found in crystallography. ARCIMBOLDO_BORGES and ARCIMBOLDO_SHREDDER now call on ALIXE by default.",

    "abstract": "Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE) is commonly recognized as an epimerase as most CEs mainly exhibit an epimerization activity towards disaccharides. In recent years, several CEs have been found to possess bifunctional epimerization and isomerization activities. They can convert lactose into lactulose, a high-value disaccharide that is widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, the factors that determine the catalytic direction in CEs are still not clear. In this study, the crystal structures of three newly discovered CEs, Cs CE (a bifunctional CE from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus ), St CE (a bifunctional CE from Spirochaeta thermophila DSM 6578) and Bt CE (a monofunctional CE from Bacillus thermoamylovorans B4166), were determined at 1.54, 2.05 and 1.80 Å resolution, respectively, in order to search for structural clues to their monofunctional/bifunctional properties. A comparative analysis of the hydrogen-bond networks in the active pockets of diverse CEs, YihS and mannose isomerase suggested that the histidine corresponding to His188 in Cs CE is uniquely required to catalyse isomerization. By alignment of the apo and ligand-bound structures of diverse CEs, it was found that bifunctional CEs tend to have more flexible loops and a larger entrance around the active site, and that the flexible loop 148–181 in Cs CE displays obvious conformational changes during ligand binding. It was speculated that the reconstructed molecular interactions of the flexible loop during ligand binding helped to motivate the ligands to stretch in a manner beneficial for isomerization. Further site-directed mutagenesis analysis of the flexible loop in Cs CE indicated that the residue composition of the flexible loop did not greatly impact epimerization but affects isomerization. In particular, V177D and I178D mutants showed a 50% and 80% increase in isomerization activity over the wild type. This study provides new information about the structural characteristics involved in the catalytic properties of CEs, which can be used to guide future molecular modifications.",

    "abstract": "Covalent linkages between constituent blocks of macromolecules and ligands have been subject to inconsistent treatment during the model-building, refinement and deposition process. This may stem from a number of sources, including difficulties with initially detecting the covalent linkage, identifying the correct chemistry, obtaining an appropriate restraint dictionary and ensuring its correct application. The analysis presented herein assesses the extent of problems involving covalent linkages in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Not only will this facilitate the remediation of existing models, but also, more importantly, it will inform and thus improve the quality of future linkages. By considering linkages of known type in the CCP4 Monomer Library (CCP4-ML), failure to model a covalent linkage is identified to result in inaccurate (systematically longer) interatomic distances. Scanning the PDB for proximal atom pairs that do not have a corresponding type in the CCP4-ML reveals a large number of commonly occurring types of unannotated potential linkages; in general, these may or may not be covalently linked. Manual consideration of the most commonly occurring cases identifies a number of genuine classes of covalent linkages. The recent expansion of the CCP4-ML is discussed, which has involved the addition of over 16 000 and the replacement of over 11 000 component dictionaries using AceDRG. As part of this effort, the CCP4-ML has also been extended using AceDRG link dictionaries for the aforementioned linkage types identified in this analysis. This will facilitate the identification of such linkage types in future modelling efforts, whilst concurrently easing the process involved in their application. The need for a universal standard for maintaining link records corresponding to covalent linkages, and references to the associated dictionaries used during modelling and refinement, following deposition to the PDB is emphasized. The importance of correctly modelling covalent linkages is demonstrated using a case study, which involves the covalent linkage of an inhibitor to the main protease in various viral species, including SARS-CoV-2. This example demonstrates the importance of properly modelling covalent linkages using a comprehensive restraint dictionary, as opposed to just using a single interatomic distance restraint or failing to model the covalent linkage at all.",

The latter two effects cause a change in the apparent binding affinity of the compound, which is indirectly assessed by cellular activity assays. To date, direct measurement of the intracellular binding affinity remains a challenging task. In this work, in-cell NMR spectroscopy was applied to measure intracellular dissociation constants in the nanomolar range by means of protein-observed competition binding experiments. Competition binding curves relative to a reference compound could be retrieved either from a series of independent cell samples or from a single real-time NMR bioreactor run. The method was validated using a set of sulfonamide-based inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase II with known activity in the subnanomolar to submicromolar range. The intracellular affinities were similar to those obtained in vitro, indicating that these compounds selectively bind to the intracellular target. In principle, the approach can be applied to any soluble intracellular target that gives rise to measurable chemical shift changes upon ligand binding.",

For most of these studies the desired crystal size is limited to a few micrometres, and the generation of large amounts of nanocrystals or microcrystals of defined size has become a bottleneck for the wider implementation of these techniques. Despite this, methods to reliably generate microcrystals and fine-tune their size have been poorly explored. Working with three different enzymes, L-aspartate α-decarboxylase, copper nitrite reductase and copper amine oxidase, the precipitating properties of ammonium sulfate were exploited to quickly transition from known vapour-diffusion conditions to reproducible, large-scale batch crystallization, circumventing the tedious determination of phase diagrams. Furthermore, the specific ammonium sulfate concentration was used to fine-tune the crystal size and size distribution. Ammonium sulfate is a common precipitant in protein crystallography, making these findings applicable to many crystallization systems to facilitate the production of large amounts of microcrystals for serial macromolecular crystallography experiments.",

Glycosylation is a powerful method to improve water solubility and reduce pungency while preserving bioactivity. PaGT3, a uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (UGT) from Phytolacca americana, is known for its ability to glycosylate capsaicinoids and other phenolic compounds. While structural information on several UGTs is available, structures of UGTs that can glycosylate a range of phenolic compounds are rare. To fill this gap, crystal structures of PaGT3 with a sugar-donor analogue (UDP-2-fluoroglucose) and the acceptors capsaicin and kaempferol were determined. PaGT3 adopts a GT-B-fold structure that is highly conserved among UGTs. However, the acceptor-binding pocket in PaGT3 is hydrophobic and large, and is surrounded by longer loops. The larger acceptor-binding pocket in PaGT3 allows the enzyme to bind a range of compounds, while the flexibility of the longer loops possibly plays a role in accommodating the acceptors in the binding pocket according to their shape and size. This structural information provides insights into the acceptor-binding mechanism in UGTs that bind multiple substrates.",

    "abstract": "Phage lysins are a source of novel antimicrobials to tackle the bacterial antibiotic-resistance crisis. The engineering of phage lysins is being explored as a game-changing technological strategy to introduce a more precise approach in the way in which antimicrobial therapy is applied. Such engineering efforts will benefit from a better understanding of lysin structure and function. In this work, the antimicrobial activity of the endolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage JG004, termed Pae87, has been characterized. This lysin had previously been identified as an antimicrobial agent candidate that is able to interact with the Gram-negative surface and disrupt it. Further evidence is provided here based on a structural and biochemical study. A high-resolution crystal structure of Pae87 complexed with a peptidoglycan fragment showed a separate substrate-binding region within the catalytic domain, 18 Å away from the catalytic site and located on the opposite side of the lysin molecule. This substrate-binding region was conserved among phylogenetically related lysins lacking an additional cell-wall-binding domain, but not among those containing such a module. Two glutamic acids were identified to be relevant for the peptidoglycan-degradation activity, although the antimicrobial activity of Pae87 was seemingly unrelated. In contrast, an antimicrobial peptide-like region within the Pae87 C-terminus, named P87, was found to be able to actively disturb the outer membrane and display antibacterial activity by itself. Therefore, an antimicrobial mechanism for Pae87 is proposed in which the P87 peptide plays the role of binding to the outer membrane and disrupting the cell-wall function, either with or without the participation of the catalytic activity of Pae87.",

    "abstract": "The 90 kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp90) is an abundant molecular chaperone that is essential to activate, stabilize and regulate the function of a plethora of client proteins. As drug targets for the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, Hsp90 inhibitors that bind to the N-terminal ATP-binding site of Hsp90 have shown disappointing efficacy in clinical trials. Thus, allosteric regulation of the function of Hsp90 by compounds that interact with its middle and C-terminal (MC) domains is now being pursued as a mechanism to inhibit the ATPase activity and client protein-binding activity of Hsp90 without concomitant induction of the heat-shock response. Here, the crystal structure of the Hsp90αMC protein covalently linked to a coumarin derivative, MDCC {7-diethylamino-3-[N-(2-maleimidoethyl)carbamoyl]coumarin}, which is located in a hydrophobic pocket that is formed at the Hsp90αMC hexamer interface, is reported. MDCC binding leads to the hexamerization of Hsp90, and the stabilization and conformational changes of three loops that are critical for its function. A fluorescence competition assay demonstrated that other characterized coumarin and isoflavone-containing Hsp90 inhibitors compete with MDCC binding, suggesting that they could bind at a common site or that they might allosterically alter the structure of the MDCC binding site. This study provides insights into the mechanism by which the coumarin class of allosteric inhibitors potentially disrupt the function of Hsp90 by regulating its oligomerization and the burial of interaction sites involved in the ATP-dependent folding of Hsp90 clients. The hydrophobic binding pocket characterized here will provide new structural information for future drug design.",

    "abstract": "Structure predictions have matched the accuracy of experimental structures from close homologues, providing suitable models for molecular replacement phasing. Even in predictions that present large differences due to the relative movement of domains or poorly predicted areas, very accurate regions tend to be present. These are suitable for successful fragment-based phasing as implemented in ARCIMBOLDO. The particularities of predicted models are inherently addressed in the new predicted_model mode, rendering preliminary treatment superfluous but also harmless. B-value conversion from predicted LDDT or error estimates, the removal of unstructured polypeptide, hierarchical decomposition of structural units from domains to local folds and systematically probing the model against the experimental data will ensure the optimal use of the model in phasing. Concomitantly, the exhaustive use of models and stereochemistry in phasing, refinement and validation raises the concern of crystallographic model bias and the need to critically establish the information contributed by the experiment. Therefore, in its predicted_model mode ARCIMBOLDO_SHREDDER will first determine whether the input model already constitutes a solution or provides a straightforward solution with Phaser. If not, extracted fragments will be located. If the landscape of solutions reveals numerous, clearly discriminated and consistent probes or if the input model already constitutes a solution, model-free verification will be activated. Expansions with SHELXE will omit the partial solution seeding phases and all traces outside their respective masks will be combined in ALIXE, as far as consistent. This procedure completely eliminates the molecular replacement search model in favour of the inferences derived from this model. In the case of fragments, an incorrect starting hypothesis impedes expansion. The predicted_model mode has been tested in different scenarios.",

Here, checkMySequence, a fast, fully automated and parameter-free method for detecting register shifts in protein models built into cryo-EM maps, is introduced. It is shown that the method can assist model building in cases where poorer map resolution hinders visual interpretation.

Here, a new protocol is presented for evaluating a protein model built from a cryo-EM map and applying local structure refinement in the case where the model has potential errors. Firstly, model evaluation is performed using a deep-learning-based model–local map assessment score, DAQ, that has recently been developed. The subsequent local refinement is performed by a modified AlphaFold 2 procedure, in which a trimmed template model and a trimmed multiple sequence alignment are provided as input to control which structure regions to refine while leaving other more confident regions of the model intact. A benchmark study showed that this protocol, DAQ-refine , consistently improves low-quality regions of the initial models. Among 18 refined models generated for an initial structure, DAQ shows a high correlation with model quality and can identify the best accurate model for most of the tested cases. The improvements obtained by DAQ-refine were on average larger than other existing methods.",

DnaC and DnaI were the first loaders to be characterized. However, most bacteria do not contain any of these genes, which are domesticated phage elements that have replaced the ancestral and unrelated loader gene dciA several times during evolution. To understand how DciA assists the loading of DnaB, the crystal structure of the complex from Vibrio cholerae was determined, in which two Vc DciA molecules interact with a dimer of Vc DnaB without changing its canonical structure. The data showed that the Vc DciA binding site on Vc DnaB is the conserved module formed by the linker helix LH of one monomer and the determinant helix DH of the second monomer. Interestingly, DnaC from Escherichia coli also targets this module onto Ec DnaB. Thanks to their common target site, it was shown that Vc DciA and Ec DnaC could be functionally interchanged in vitro despite sharing no structural similarity. This represents a milestone in understanding the mechanism employed by phage helicase loaders to hijack bacterial replicative helicases during evolution.",

    "abstract": "The genome of Rhizobium etli , a nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbiont of legume plants, encodes two L-asparaginases, ReAIV and ReAV, that have no similarity to the well characterized enzymes of class 1 (bacterial type) and class 2 (plant type). It has been hypothesized that ReAIV and ReAV might belong to the same structural class 3 despite their low level of sequence identity. When the crystal structure of the inducible and thermolabile protein ReAV was solved, this hypothesis gained a stronger footing because the key residues of ReAV are also present in the sequence of the constitutive and thermostable ReAIV protein. High-resolution crystal structures of ReAIV now confirm that it is a class 3 L-asparaginase that is structurally similar to ReAV but with important differences. The most striking differences concern the peculiar hydration patterns of the two proteins, the presence of three internal cavities in ReAIV and the behavior of the zinc-binding site. ReAIV has a high pH optimum (9–11) and a substrate affinity of ∼1.3 m M at pH 9.0. These parameters are not suitable for the direct application of ReAIV as an antileukemic drug, although its thermal stability and lack of glutaminase activity would be of considerable advantage. The five crystal structures of ReAIV presented in this work allow a possible enzymatic scenario to be postulated in which the zinc ion coordinated in the active site is a dispensable element. The catalytic nucleophile seems to be Ser47, which is part of two Ser–Lys tandems in the active site. The structures of ReAIV presented here may provide a basis for future enzyme-engineering experiments to improve the kinetic parameters for medicinal applications.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the High-Pressure Freezing Laboratory for Macromolecular Crystallography (HPMX) at the ESRF, and highlights new and complementary research opportunities that can be explored using this facility. The laboratory is dedicated to investigating interactions between macromolecules and gases in crystallo , and finds applications in many fields of research, including fundamental biology, biochemistry, and environmental and medical science. At present, the HPMX laboratory offers the use of different high-pressure cells adapted for helium, argon, krypton, xenon, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and methane. Important scientific applications of high pressure to macromolecules at the HPMX include noble-gas derivatization of crystals to detect and map the internal architecture of proteins (pockets, tunnels and channels) that allows the storage and diffusion of ligands or substrates/products, the investigation of the catalytic mechanisms of gas-employing enzymes (using oxygen, carbon dioxide or methane as substrates) to possibly decipher intermediates, and studies of the conformational fluctuations or structure modifications that are necessary for proteins to function. Additionally, cryo-cooling protein crystals under high pressure (helium or argon at 2000 bar) enables the addition of cryo-protectant to be avoided and noble gases can be employed to produce derivatives for structure resolution. The high-pressure systems are designed to process crystals along a well defined pathway in the phase diagram (pressure–temperature) of the gas to cryo-cool the samples according to the three-step `soak-and-freeze method'. Firstly, crystals are soaked in a pressurized pure gas atmosphere (at 294 K) to introduce the gas and facilitate its interactions within the macromolecules. Samples are then flash-cooled (at 100 K) while still under pressure to cryo-trap macromolecule–gas complexation states or pressure-induced protein modifications. Finally, the samples are recovered after depressurization at cryo-temperatures. The final section of this publication presents a selection of different typical high-pressure experiments carried out at the HPMX, showing that this technique has already answered a wide range of scientific questions. It is shown that the use of different gases and pressure conditions can be used to probe various effects, such as mapping the functional internal architectures of enzymes (tunnels in the haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA) and allosteric sites on membrane-protein surfaces, the interaction of non-inert gases with proteins (oxygen in the hydrogenase ReMBH) and pressure-induced structural changes of proteins (tetramer dissociation in urate oxidase). The technique is versatile and the provision of pressure cells and their application at the HPMX is gradually being extended to address new scientific questions.",

    "abstract": "Macromolecular crystallography generally requires the recovery of missing phase information from diffraction data to reconstruct an electron-density map of the crystallized molecule. Most recent structures have been solved using molecular replacement as a phasing method, requiring an a priori structure that is closely related to the target protein to serve as a search model; when no such search model exists, molecular replacement is not possible. New advances in computational machine-learning methods, however, have resulted in major advances in protein structure predictions from sequence information. Methods that generate predicted structural models of sufficient accuracy provide a powerful approach to molecular replacement. Taking advantage of these advances, AlphaFold predictions were applied to enable structure determination of a bacterial protein of unknown function (UniProtKB Q63NT7, NCBI locus BPSS0212) based on diffraction data that had evaded phasing attempts using MIR and anomalous scattering methods. Using both X-ray and micro-electron (microED) diffraction data, it was possible to solve the structure of the main fragment of the protein using a predicted model of that domain as a starting point. The use of predicted structural models importantly expands the promise of electron diffraction, where structure determination relies critically on molecular replacement.",

Since its creation, numerous technical developments have resulted in a device that is now widely utilized in multiple laboratories worldwide. It features plasma treatment, low-volume sample deposition through pin printing, optical ice-thickness measurement and cryofixation of pre-clipped Autogrids through jet vitrification. This paper presents recent technical improvements to the VitroJet and the benefits that it brings to the cryo-EM workflow. A wide variety of applications are shown: membrane proteins, nucleosomes, fatty-acid synthase, Tobacco mosaic virus, lipid nanoparticles, tick-borne encephalitis viruses and bacteriophages.

It is thus vital to apply careful verification procedures to those segments of the PDB that are of direct medicinal interest.

The focus was on the adherence of the atomic coordinates to the rules of stereochemistry and their agreement with the experimental electron-density maps. Whereas the current clinical application of L-asparaginases is limited to two bacterial proteins and their chemical modifications, the field of investigations of such enzymes has expanded tremendously in recent years with the discovery of three entirely different structural classes and with numerous reports, not always quite reliable, of the anticancer properties of L-asparaginases of different origins.",

    "abstract": "Tryptophan is the most prominent amino acid found in proteins, with multiple functional roles. Its side chain is made up of the hydrophobic indole moiety, with two groups that act as donors in hydrogen bonds: the N ɛ —H group, which is a potent donor in canonical hydrogen bonds, and a polarized C δ1 —H group, which is capable of forming weaker, noncanonical hydrogen bonds. Due to adjacent electron-withdrawing moieties, C—H...O hydrogen bonds are ubiquitous in macromolecules, albeit contingent on the polarization of the donor C—H group. Consequently, C α —H groups (adjacent to the carbonyl and amino groups of flanking peptide bonds), as well as the C ɛ1 —H and C δ2 —H groups of histidines (adjacent to imidazole N atoms), are known to serve as donors in hydrogen bonds, for example stabilizing parallel and antiparallel β-sheets. However, the nature and the functional role of interactions involving the C δ1 —H group of the indole ring of tryptophan are not well characterized. Here, data mining of high-resolution ( r ≤ 1.5 Å) crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank was performed and ubiquitous close contacts between the C δ1 —H groups of tryptophan and a range of electronegative acceptors were identified, specifically main-chain carbonyl O atoms immediately upstream and downstream in the polypeptide chain. The stereochemical analysis shows that most of the interactions bear all of the hallmarks of proper hydrogen bonds. At the same time, their cohesive nature is confirmed by quantum-chemical calculations, which reveal interaction energies of 1.5–3.0 kcal mol −1 , depending on the specific stereochemistry.",

    "abstract": "The Azotobacter vinelandii FeSII protein forms an oxygen-resistant complex with the nitrogenase MoFe and Fe proteins. FeSII is an adrenodoxin-type ferredoxin that forms a dimer in solution. Previously, the crystal structure was solved [Schlesier et al. (2016), J. Am. Chem. Soc. 138 , 239–247] with five copies in the asymmetric unit. One copy is a normal adrenodoxin domain that forms a dimer with its crystallographic symmetry mate. The other four copies are in an `open' conformation with a loop flipped out exposing the 2Fe–2S cluster. The open and closed conformations were interpreted as oxidized and reduced, respectively, and the large conformational change in the open configuration allowed binding to nitrogenase. Here, the structure of FeSII was independently solved in the same crystal form. The positioning of the atoms in the unit cell is similar to the earlier report. However, the interpretation of the structure is different. The `open' conformation is interpreted as the product of a crystallization-induced domain swap. The 2Fe–2S cluster is not exposed to solvent, but in the crystal its interacting helix is replaced by the same helix residues from a crystal symmetry mate. The domain swap is complicated, as it is unusual in being in the middle of the protein rather than at a terminus, and it creates arrangements of molecules that can be interpreted in multiple ways. It is also cautioned that crystal structures should be interpreted in terms of the contents of the entire crystal rather than of one asymmetric unit.",

    "abstract": "Molecular replacement (MR) is highly effective for biomolecular crystal structure determination, increasingly so as the database of known structures has increased. For candidates without recognizable similarity to known structures, however, crystal structure analyses have nearly always required experiments for de novo phase evaluation. Now, with the unprecedented accuracy of AlphaFold predictions of protein structures from amino-acid sequences, an appreciable expansion of the reach of MR for proteins is realized. Here, we sought to automate an AlphaFold -guided MR procedure that tailors predictions to the MR problem at hand. We first optimized the reliability cutoff parameters for residue inclusion as tested in application to a previously MR-intractable problem. We then examined cases where AlphaFold by default predicts a conformation alternative to that of the candidate structure, devising tests for MR solution either from domain-specific predictions or from predictions based on diverse sequence subclusters. We tested subclustering procedures on an enzyme system that entails multiple MR-challenging conformations. The overall process as implemented in Phenix automatically surveys a succession of trials of increasing computational complexity until an MR solution is found or the options are exhausted. Validated MR solutions were found for 92% of one set of 158 challenging problems from the PDB and 93% of those from a second set of 215 challenges. Thus, many crystal structure analyses that previously required experimental phase evaluation can now be solved by AlphaFold -guided MR. In effect, this and related MR approaches are de novo phasing methods.",

    "abstract": "Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) usually causes mild upper respiratory infections in heathy adults, but may lead to severe complications or mortality in individuals with weakened immune systems. Virus entry of HCoV-229E is mediated by its spike (S) protein, where the S1 domain facilitates attachment to host cells and the S2 domain is involved in subsequent fusion of the virus and host membranes. During the fusion process, two heptad repeats, HR1 and HR2, in the S2 domain assemble into a six-helix membrane-fusion structure termed the fusion core. Here, the complete fusion-core structure of HCoV-229E has been determined at 1.86 Å resolution, representing the most complete post-fusion conformation thus far among published human alphacoronavirus (α-HCoV) fusion-core structures. The overall structure of the HCoV-229E fusion core is similar to those of SARS, MERS and HCoV-NL63, but the packing of its 3HR1 core differs from those of SARS and MERS in that it contains more noncanonical `x' and `da' layers. Side-by-side electrostatic surface comparisons reveal that the electrostatic surface potentials are opposite in α-HCoVs and β-HCoVs at certain positions and that the HCoV-229E surface also appears to be the most hydrophobic among the various HCoVs. In addition to the highly conserved hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and HR2, some polar and electrostatic interactions are also well preserved across different HCoVs. This study adds to the structural profiling of HCoVs to aid in the structure-based design of pan-coronavirus small molecules or peptides to inhibit viral fusion.",

    "abstract": "Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are a class of copper-dependent enzymes discovered within the last ten years. They oxidatively cleave polysaccharides (chitin, lignocellulose, hemicellulose and starch-derived), presumably making recalcitrant substrates accessible to glycoside hydrolases. Recently, the first crystal structure of an LPMO–substrate complex was reported, giving insights into the interaction of LPMOs with β-linked substrates (Frandsen et al. , 2016). The LPMOs acting on α-linked glycosidic bonds (family AA13) display binding surfaces that are quite different from those of LPMOs that act on β-linked glycosidic bonds (families AA9–AA11), as revealed from the first determined structure (Lo Leggio et al. , 2015), and thus presumably the AA13s interact with their substrate in a distinct fashion. Here, several new structures of the same AA13 enzyme, Aspergillus oryzae AA13, are presented. Crystals obtained in the presence of high zinc-ion concentrations were used, as they can be obtained more reproducibly than those used to refine the deposited copper-containing structure. One structure with an ordered zinc-bound active site was solved at 1.65 Å resolution, and three structures from crystals soaked with maltooligosaccharides in solutions devoid of zinc ions were solved at resolutions of up to 1.10 Å. Despite similar unit-cell parameters, small rearrangements in the crystal packing occur when the crystals are depleted of zinc ions, resulting in a more occluded substrate-binding surface. In two of the three structures maltooligosaccharide ligands are bound, but not at the active site. Two of the structures presented show a His-ligand conformation that is incompatible with metal-ion binding. In one of these structures this conformation is the principal one (80% occupancy), giving a rare atomic resolution view of a substantially misfolded enzyme that is presumably rendered inactive.",

    "abstract": "The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains a growing number of models that have been determined using neutron diffraction or a hybrid method that combines X-ray and neutron diffraction. The advantage of neutron diffraction experiments is that the positions of all atoms can be determined, including H atoms, which are hardly detectable by X-ray diffraction. This allows the determination of protonation states and the assignment of H atoms to water molecules. Because neutrons are scattered differently by hydrogen and its isotope deuterium, neutron diffraction in combination with H/D exchange can provide information on accessibility, dynamics and chemical lability. In this study, the deposited data, models and model-to-data fit for all PDB entries that used neutron diffraction as the source of experimental data have been analysed. In many cases, the reported R work and R free values were not reproducible. In such cases, the model and data files were analysed to identify the reasons for this mismatch. The issues responsible for the discrepancies are summarized and explained. The analysis unveiled limitations to the annotation, deposition and validation of models and data, and a lack of community-wide accepted standards for the description of neutron models and data, as well as deficiencies in current model refinement tools. Most of the issues identified concern the handling of H atoms. Since the primary use of neutron macromolecular crystallography is to locate and directly visualize H atoms, it is important to address these issues, so that the deposited neutron models allow the retrieval of the maximum amount of information with the smallest effort of manual intervention. A path forward to improving the annotation, validation and deposition of neutron models and hybrid X-ray and neutron models is suggested.",

At pressures between 270 and 500 MPa the crystal form containing the open conformation exhibited a phase transition from P 2 1 to C 2. Several structural changes in ecDHFR were observed at high pressure that were also accompanied by structural changes in the NADP + cofactor and the hydration structure. In the crystal form with the closed conformation the M20 loop moved as the pressure changed, with accompanying conformational changes around the active site, including NADP + and folate. These movements were consistent with the suggested hypothesis that movement of the M20 loop was necessary for ecDHFR to catalyze the reaction. In the crystal form with the open conformation the nicotinamide ring of the NADP + cofactor undergoes a large flip as an intermediate step in the reaction, despite being in a crystalline state. Furthermore, observation of the water molecules between Arg57 and folate elucidated an early step in the substrate-binding pathway. These results demonstrate the possibility of using high-pressure protein crystallography as a method to capture high-energy substates or transient structures related to the protein reaction cycle.",

To further enhance the biological effects of SAJ-310, a structure-based approach was employed to modify this compound to specifically inhibit Hb S polymer formation through interactions which perturb the Hb S polymer-stabilizing αF-helix, in addition to primarily increasing the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. Three compounds, TD-7, TD-8 and TD-9, were synthesized and studied for their interactions with hemoglobin at the atomic level, as well as their functional and antisickling activities in vitro . X-ray crystallographic studies with liganded hemoglobin in complex with TD-7 showed the predicted mode of binding, although the interaction with the αF-helix was not as strong as expected. These findings provide important insights and guidance towards the development of molecules that would be expected to bind and make stronger interactions with the αF-helix, resulting in more efficacious novel therapeutics for sickle cell disease.",

Three series of X-ray diffraction data sets were collected with increasing doses of absorbed X-ray radiation from a native S. murashkinskyi laccase crystal and from crystals of complexes of the laccase with chloride and fluoride ions. The data for the native laccase crystal confirmed the previously deduced enzymatic mechanism of molecular oxygen reduction. The structures of the complexes allowed the localization of chloride and fluoride ions in the channel near the T2 copper ion. These ions replace the oxygen ligand of the T2 copper ion in this channel and can play the role of this ligand in the enzymatic reaction. As follows from analysis of the structures from the increasing dose series, the inhibition of laccases by chloride and fluoride anions can be explained by the fact that the binding of these negatively charged ions at the position of the oxygen ligand of the T2 copper ion impedes the reduction of the T2 copper ion.",

This enzyme belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 2 (GH2), similar to the tetrameric and hexameric β-D-galactosidases from Escherichia coli and Arthrobacter sp. C2-2, respectively. It is the second known structure of a cold-active GH2 β-galactosidase, and the first in the form of a functional dimer, which is also present in the asymmetric unit. Cold-adapted β-D-galactosidases have been the focus of extensive research owing to their utility in a variety of industrial technologies. One of their most appealing applications is in the hydrolysis of lactose, which not only results in the production of lactose-free dairy, but also eliminates the `sandy effect' and increases the sweetness of the product, thus enhancing its quality. The determined crystal structure represents the five-domain architecture of the enzyme, with its active site located in close vicinity to the dimer interface. To identify the amino-acid residues involved in the catalytic reaction and to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this atypical β-D-galactosidase, the crystal structure in complex with galactose ( Par βDG–Gal) was also determined. The catalytic site of the enzyme is created by amino-acid residues from the central domain 3 and from domain 4 of an adjacent monomer. The crystal structure of this dimeric β-D-galactosidase reveals significant differences in comparison to other β-galactosidases. The largest difference is in the fifth domain, named Bgal_windup domain 5 in Par βDG, which contributes to stabilization of the functional dimer. The location of this domain 5, which is unique in size and structure, may be one of the factors responsible for the creation of a functional dimer and cold-adaptation of this enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) is a housekeeping enzyme that is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to fungi to mammals and is important for cell-wall synthesis, viability and signalling. PMI is a zinc-dependent enzyme that catalyses the reversible isomerization between mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) and fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), presumably via the formation of a cis-enediol intermediate. The reaction is hypothesized to involve ring opening of M6P, the transfer of a proton from the C2 atom to the C1 atom and between the O1 and O2 atoms of the substrate, followed by ring closure resulting in the product F6P. Several attempts have been made to decipher the role of zinc ions and various residues in the catalytic function of PMI. However, there is no consensus on the catalytic base and the mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. In the present study, based on the structure of PMI from Salmonella typhimurium, site-directed mutagenesis targeting residues close to the bound metal ion and activity studies on the mutants, zinc ions were shown to be crucial for substrate binding. These studies also suggest Lys86 as the most probable catalytic base abstracting the proton in the isomerization reaction. Plausible roles for the highly conserved residues Lys132 and Arg274 could also be discerned based on comparison of the crystal structures of wild-type and mutant PMIs. PMIs from prokaryotes possess a low sequence identity to the human enzyme, ranging between 30% and 40%. Since PMI is important for the virulence of many pathogenic organisms, the identification of catalytically important residues will facilitate its use as a potential antimicrobial drug target.",

    "abstract": "A nonlinear least-squares method for refining a parametric expression describing the estimated errors of reflection intensities in serial crystallographic (SX) data is presented. This approach, which is similar to that used in the rotation method of crystallographic data collection at synchrotrons, propagates error estimates from photon-counting statistics to the merged data. Here, it is demonstrated that the application of this approach to SX data provides better SAD phasing ability, enabling the autobuilding of a protein structure that had previously failed to be built. Estimating the error in the merged reflection intensities requires the understanding and propagation of all of the sources of error arising from the measurements. One type of error, which is well understood, is the counting error introduced when the detector counts X-ray photons. Thus, if other types of random errors (such as readout noise) as well as uncertainties in systematic corrections (such as from X-ray attenuation) are completely understood, they can be propagated along with the counting error, as appropriate. In practice, most software packages propagate as much error as they know how to model and then include error-adjustment terms that scale the error estimates until they explain the variance among the measurements. If this is performed carefully, then during SAD phasing likelihood-based approaches can make optimal use of these error estimates, increasing the chance of a successful structure solution. In serial crystallography, SAD phasing has remained challenging, with the few examples of de novo protein structure solution each requiring many thousands of diffraction patterns. Here, the effects of different methods of treating the error estimates are estimated and it is shown that using a parametric approach that includes terms proportional to the known experimental uncertainty, the reflection intensity and the squared reflection intensity to improve the error estimates can allow SAD phasing even from weak zinc anomalous signal.",

    "abstract": "Phasing by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) from multiple crystallographic data sets can be particularly demanding because of the weak anomalous signal and possible non-isomorphism. The identification and exclusion of non-isomorphous data sets by suitable indicators is therefore indispensable. Here, simple and robust data-selection methods are described. A multi-dimensional scaling procedure is first used to identify data sets with large non-isomorphism relative to clusters of other data sets. Within each cluster that it identifies, further selection is based on the weighted ΔCC 1/2 , a quantity representing the influence of a set of reflections on the overall CC 1/2 of the merged data. The anomalous signal is further improved by optimizing the scaling protocol. The success of iterating the selection and scaling steps was verified by substructure determination and subsequent structure solution. Three serial synchrotron crystallography (SSX) SAD test cases with hundreds of partial data sets and one test case with 62 complete data sets were analyzed. Structure solution was dramatically simplified with this procedure, and enabled solution of the structures after a few selection/scaling iterations. To explore the limits, the procedure was tested with much fewer data than originally required and could still solve the structure in several cases. In addition, an SSX data challenge, minimizing the number of (simulated) data sets necessary to solve the structure, was significantly underbid.",

    "abstract": "The field of electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has advanced quickly in recent years as the result of numerous technological and methodological developments. This has led to an increase in the number of atomic structures determined using this method. Recently, several tools for the analysis of cryo-EM data and models have been developed within the Phenix software package, such as phenix.real_space_refine for the refinement of atomic models against real-space maps. Also, new validation metrics have been developed for low-resolution cryo-EM models. To understand the quality of deposited cryo-EM structures and how they might be improved, models deposited in the Protein Data Bank that have map resolutions of better than 5 Å were automatically re-refined using current versions of Phenix tools. The results are available on a publicly accessible web page (https://cci.lbl.gov/ceres). The implementation of a Cryo-EM Re-refinement System ( CERES ) for the improvement of models deposited in the wwPDB, and the results of the re-refinements, are described. Based on these results, contents are proposed for a `cryo-EM Table 1', which summarizes experimental details and validation metrics in a similar way to `Table 1' in crystallography. The consistent use of robust metrics for the evaluation of cryo-EM models and data should accompany every structure deposition and be reported in scientific publications.",

    "abstract": "MAP kinases act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, regulation of transcription and development. As a member of the MAP kinase family, ERK5 (MAPK7) is involved in the downstream signalling pathways of various cell-surface receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors. In the current study, five structures of the ERK5 kinase domain co-crystallized with ERK5 inhibitors are reported. Interestingly, three of the compounds bind at a novel allosteric binding site in ERK5, while the other two bind at the typical ATP-binding site. Binding of inhibitors at the allosteric site is accompanied by displacement of the P-loop into the ATP-binding site and is shown to be ATP-competitive in an enzymatic assay of ERK5 kinase activity. Kinase selectivity data show that the most potent allosteric inhibitor exhibits superior kinase selectivity compared with the two inhibitors that bind at the canonical ATP-binding site. An analysis of these structures and comparison with both a previously published ERK5–inhibitor complex structure (PDB entry 4b99) and the structures of three other kinases (CDK2, ITK and MEK) in complex with allosteric inhibitors are presented.",

    "abstract": "The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is highly impermeable to hydrophilic molecules of larger than 600 Da, protecting these bacteria from toxins present in the environment. In order to transport nutrients across this impermeable membrane, Gram-negative bacteria utilize a diverse family of outer-membrane proteins called TonB-dependent transporters. The majority of the members of this family transport iron-containing substrates. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that TonB-dependent transporters target chemically diverse substrates. In this work, the structure and phylogenetic distribution of the TonB-dependent transporter YncD are investigated. It is shown that while YncD is present in some enteropathogens, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., it is also widespread in Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria of environmental origin. The structure of YncD was determined, showing that despite a distant evolutionary relationship, it shares structural features with the ferric citrate transporter FecA, including a compact positively charged substrate-binding site. Despite these shared features, it is shown that YncD does not contribute to the growth of E. coli in pure culture under iron-limiting conditions or with ferric citrate as an iron source. Previous studies of transcriptional regulation in E. coli show that YncD is not induced under iron-limiting conditions and is unresponsive to the ferric uptake regulator (Fur). These observations, combined with the data presented here, suggest that YncD is not responsible for the transport of an iron-containing substrate.",

Presented here is a systematic study of the accuracy of models built into cryo-EM maps using ARP / wARP . It is demonstrated that the local resolution is a good indicator of map interpretability, and for the majority of the test cases ARP / wARP correctly builds 90% of main-chain fragments in regions where the local resolution is 4.0 Å or better. It is also demonstrated that the coordinate accuracy for models built into cryo-EM maps is comparable to that of X-ray crystallographic models at similar local cryo-EM and crystallographic resolutions. The model accuracy also correlates with the refined atomic displacement parameters.",

    "abstract": "Cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can produce maps of macromolecules that have resolutions that are sufficiently high that structural details such as chemical modifications, water molecules and bound metal ions can be discerned. However, those accustomed to interpreting the electron-density maps of macromolecules produced by X-ray crystallography need to be careful when assigning features such as these in cryo-EM maps because cations, for example, interact far more strongly with electrons than they do with X-rays. Using simulated electrostatic potential (ESP) maps as a tool led us to re-examine a recent cryo-EM map of the human ribosome, and we realized that some of the ESP peaks originally identified as novel groups covalently bonded to the N7, O6 or O4 atoms of several guanines, adenines or uridines, respectively, in this structure are likely to instead represent Mg 2+ ions coordinated to these atoms, which provide only partial charge compensation compared with Mg 2+ ions located next to phosphate groups. In addition, direct evidence is provided for a variation in the level of 2′- O ribose methylation of nucleotides in the human ribosome. ESP maps can thus help in identifying ions next to nucleotide bases, i.e. at positions that can be difficult to address in cryo-EM maps due to charge effects, which are specifically encountered in cryo-EM. This work is particularly relevant to nucleoprotein complexes and shows that it is important to consider charge effects when interpreting cryo-EM maps, thus opening possibilities for localizing charges in structures that may be relevant for enzymatic mechanisms and drug interactions.",

However, the description of molecular flexibility is instrinsically flawed and in almost all cases, regardless of the experimental method used for structure determination, there remains a strong overfitting bias during molecular model building and refinement. In the worst case this can lead to wholly incorrect structures and thus incorrect biological interpretations. Here, by reparametrizing the description of these complex structures in terms of bonds rather than atomic positions, and by modelling flexibility using a deterministic ensemble of structures, it is demonstrated that structures can be described using fewer parameters than in conventional refinement. The current implementation, applied to X-ray diffraction data, significantly reduces the extent of overfitting, allowing the experimental data to reveal more biological information in electron-density maps.",

An integrated SSX system has been developed comprising ultralow background-scatter sample holders suitable for room and cryogenic temperature crystallographic data collection, a sample-loading station and a humid `gloveless' glovebox. The sample holders incorporate thin-film supports with a variety of designs optimized for different crystal-loading challenges. These holders facilitate the dispersion of crystals and the removal of excess liquid, can be cooled at extremely high rates, generate little background scatter, allow data collection over &gt;90° of oscillation without obstruction or the risk of generating saturating Bragg peaks, are compatible with existing infrastructure for high-throughput cryocrystallography and are reusable. The sample-loading station allows sample preparation and loading onto the support film, the application of time-varying suction for optimal removal of excess liquid, crystal repositioning and cryoprotection, and the application of sealing films for room-temperature data collection, all in a controlled-humidity environment. The humid glovebox allows microscope observation of the sample-loading station and crystallization trays while maintaining near-saturating humidities that further minimize the risks of sample dehydration and damage, and maximize working times. This integrated system addresses common problems in obtaining properly dispersed, properly hydrated and isomorphous microcrystals for fixed-orientation and oscillation data collection. Its ease of use, flexibility and optimized performance make it attractive not just for SSX but also for single-crystal and few-crystal data collection. Fundamental concepts that are important in achieving desired crystal distributions on a sample holder via time-varying suction-induced liquid flows are also discussed.",

The hits of the screening experiment, i.e. small molecules or fragments binding to the target protein, are revealed along with their 3D structural information. Therefore, they can serve as useful starting points for further structure-based hit-to-lead development. However, the progression of fragment hits to tool compounds or even leads is often hampered by a lack of chemical feasibility. As an attractive alternative, compound analogs that embed the fragment hit structurally may be obtained from commercial catalogs. Here, a workflow is reported based on filtering and assessing such potential follow-up compounds by template docking. This means that the crystallographic binding pose was integrated into the docking calculations as a central starting parameter. Subsequently, the candidates are scored on their interactions within the binding pocket. In an initial proof-of-concept study using five starting fragments known to bind to the aspartic protease endothiapepsin, 28 follow-up compounds were selected using the designed workflow and their binding was assessed by crystallography. Ten of these compounds bound to the active site and five of them showed significantly increased affinity in isothermal titration calorimetry of up to single-digit micromolar affinity. Taken together, this strategy is capable of efficiently evolving the initial fragment hits without major synthesis efforts and with full control by X-ray crystallography.",

These areas allow a certain degree of intracrystalline protein flexibility and mobility of solutes. Therefore, knowledge of the geometry of solvent-filled channels and cavities is essential whenever the dynamics inside a crystal are of interest. Especially in soaking experiments for structure-based drug design, ligands must be able to traverse the crystal solvent channels and reach the corresponding binding pockets. Unsuccessful screenings are sometimes attributed to the geometry of the crystal packing, but the underlying causes are often difficult to understand. This work presents LifeSoaks , a novel tool for analyzing and visualizing solvent channels in protein crystals. LifeSoaks uses a Voronoi diagram-based periodic channel representation which can be efficiently computed. The size and location of channel bottlenecks, which might hinder molecular diffusion, can be directly derived from this representation. This work presents the calculated bottleneck radii for all crystal structures in the PDB and the analysis of a new, hand-curated data set of structures obtained by soaking experiments.

New X-ray sources and sample-delivery methods, along with new experiments focused on changes in structure as a function of perturbations, have led to new demands on scaling algorithms. Classically, scaling algorithms use least-squares optimization to fit a model of common error sources to the observed diffraction intensities to force these intensities onto the same empirical scale. Recently, an alternative approach has been demonstrated which uses a Bayesian optimization method, variational inference, to simultaneously infer merged data along with corrections, or scale factors, for the systematic errors. Owing to its flexibility, this approach proves to be advantageous in certain scenarios. This perspective briefly reviews the history of scaling algorithms and contrasts them with variational inference. Finally, appropriate use cases are identified for the first such algorithm, Careless , guidance is offered on its use and some speculations are made about future variational scaling methods.",

DHX9 has recently emerged as a promising target for oncology, but to date no mammalian structures have been published. Here, crystal structures of human, dog and cat DHX9 bound to ADP are reported. The three mammalian DHX9 structures share identical structural folds. Additionally, the overall architecture and the individual domain structures of DHX9 are highly conserved with those of MLE, the Drosophila orthologue of DHX9 previously solved in complex with RNA and a transition-state analogue of ATP. Due to differences in the bound substrates and global domain orientations, the localized loop conformations and occupancy of dsRNA-binding domain 2 (dsRBD2) differ between the mammalian DHX9 and MLE structures. The combined effects of the structural changes considerably alter the RNA-binding channel, providing an opportunity to compare active and inactive states of the helicase. Finally, the mammalian DHX9 structures provide a potential tool for structure-based drug-design efforts.",

    "abstract": "X-ray protein crystallography has, through the determination of the three-dimensional structures of enzymes and their complexes, been essential to the understanding of biological chemistry. However, as X-rays are scattered by electrons, the technique has difficulty locating the presence and position of H atoms (and cannot locate H+ ions), knowledge of which is often crucially important for the understanding of enzyme mechanism. Furthermore, X-ray irradiation, through photoelectronic effects, will perturb the redox state in the crystal. By using single-crystal spectrophotometry, reactions taking place in the crystal can be monitored, either to trap intermediates or follow photoreduction during X-ray data collection. By using neutron crystallography, the positions of H atoms can be located, as it is the nuclei rather than the electrons that scatter neutrons, and the scattering length is not determined by the atomic number. Combining the two techniques allows much greater insight into both reaction mechanism and X-ray-induced photoreduction.",

    "abstract": "The host factor Hfq, as the bacterial branch of the Sm family, is an RNA-binding protein involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA expression and turnover. Hfq facilitates pairing between small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and their corresponding mRNA targets by binding both RNAs and bringing them into close proximity. Hfq homologs self-assemble into homo-hexameric rings with at least two distinct surfaces that bind RNA. Recently, another binding site, dubbed the `lateral rim', has been implicated in sRNA·mRNA annealing; the RNA-binding properties of this site appear to be rather subtle, and its degree of evolutionary conservation is unknown. An Hfq homolog has been identified in the phylogenetically deep-branching thermophile Aquifex aeolicus ( Aae ), but little is known about the structure and function of Hfq from basal bacterial lineages such as the Aquificae. Therefore, Aae Hfq was cloned, overexpressed, purified, crystallized and biochemically characterized. Structures of Aae Hfq were determined in space groups P 1 and P 6, both to 1.5 Å resolution, and nanomolar-scale binding affinities for uridine- and adenosine-rich RNAs were discovered. Co-crystallization with U 6 RNA reveals that the outer rim of the Aae Hfq hexamer features a well defined binding pocket that is selective for uracil. This Aae Hfq structure, combined with biochemical and biophysical characterization of the homolog, reveals deep evolutionary conservation of the lateral RNA-binding mode, and lays a foundation for further studies of Hfq-associated RNA biology in ancient bacterial phyla.",

Exploring the behaviour of diffraction intensities and the associated estimated uncertainties facilitates the discovery of underlying problems and can help users to improve their data acquisition and processing in order to obtain better structural models. The program enables users to inspect the distribution of observed intensities (or amplitudes) against resolution as well as the associated estimated uncertainties (sigmas). It is demonstrated how AUSPEX can be used to visually and automatically detect ice-ring artefacts in integrated X-ray diffraction data. Such artefacts can hamper structure determination, but may be difficult to identify from the raw diffraction images produced by modern pixel detectors. The analysis suggests that a significant portion of the data sets deposited in the PDB contain ice-ring artefacts. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how other problems in experimental X-ray data caused, for example, by scaling and data-conversion procedures can be detected by AUSPEX .",

It has been shown to interact with other proteins, suggesting a role as a calcium sensor. Many of the targets of calbindin-D28K are of therapeutic interest: for example, inositol monophosphatase, the putative target of lithium therapy in bipolar disorder. Presented here is the first crystal structure of human calbindin-D28K. There are significant deviations in the tertiary structure when compared with the NMR structure of rat calbindin-D28K (PDB entry 2g9b), despite 98% sequence identity. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicates that the crystal structure better predicts the properties of calbindin-D28K in solution compared with the NMR structure. Here, the first direct visualization of the calcium-binding properties of calbindin-D28K is presented. Four of the six EF-hands that make up the secondary structure of the protein contain a calcium-binding site. Two distinct conformations of the N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding site were identified using long-wavelength calcium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD). This flexible region has previously been recognized as a protein–protein interaction interface. SAXS data collected in both the presence and absence of calcium indicate that there are no large structural differences in the globular structure of calbindin-D28K between the calcium-loaded and unloaded proteins.",

Domain 1 alone hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates less efficiently. Under high concentrations and over long periods, the full-length enzyme as well as domain 1 catalyses the hydrolysis of the nucleoside triphosphates to the respective nucleoside monophosphates and pyrophosphate. The role of domain 2 appears to be limited to speeding up the reaction. Crystal structures of the apoenzyme and those of ligand-bound enzyme prepared in the presence of 8-oxo-GTP or 8-oxo-dGTP and different concentrations of magnesium were determined. In all of the structures except one, the molecules arrange themselves in a head-to-tail fashion in which domain 1 is brought into contact with domain 2 (trans domain 2) of a neighbouring molecule. The binding site for NTP (site A) is almost exclusively made up of residues from domain 1, while those for NDP (site B) and NMP (site C) are at the interface between domain 1 and trans domain 2 in an unusual instance of intermolecular interactions leading to binding sites. Protein-ligand interactions at site A lead to a proposal for the mechanism of hydrolysis of NTP to NDP and phosphate. A small modification in site A in the crystal which does not exhibit the head-to-tail arrangement appears to facilitate the production of NMP and pyrophosphate from NTP. The two arrangements could be in dynamic equilibrium in the cellular milieu.",

Even minor structural perturbations may have a significant impact on the stability of these macromolecules. Studies carried out in recent decades have led to the convergent view that proteins are endowed with a flexible spine. One of the open issues related to protein local backbone geometry is the identification of the factors that influence the amplitude of the τ (N-Cα-C) angle. Here, statistical analyses performed on an updated ensemble of X-ray protein structures by dissecting the contribution of the major factors that can potentially influence the local backbone geometry of proteins are reported. The data clearly indicate that the local backbone conformation has a prominent impact on the modulation of the τ angle. Therefore, a proper assessment of the impact of the other potential factors can only be appropriately evaluated when small (ϕ, ψ) regions are considered. Here, it is shown that when the contribution of the backbone conformation is removed by considering small (ϕ, ψ) areas, an impact of secondary structure, as defined by DSSP, and/or the residue type on τ is still detectable, although to a limited extent. Indeed, distinct τ-value distributions are detected for Pro/Gly and β-branched (Ile/Val) residues. The key role of the local backbone conformation highlighted here supports the use of variable local backbone geometry in protein refinement protocols.",

Beclin 1 residues 267–284 are required for binding GAPR-1. Here, sequence analyses, structural modeling, mutagenesis combined with pull-down assays, X-ray crystal structure determination and small-angle X-ray scattering were used to investigate the Beclin 1–GAPR-1 interaction. Five conserved residues line an equatorial GAPR-1 surface groove that is large enough to bind a peptide. A model of a peptide comprising Beclin 1 residues 267–284 docked onto GAPR-1, built using the CABS-dock server, indicates that this peptide binds to this GAPR-1 groove. Mutation of the five conserved residues lining this groove, H54A/E86A/G102K/H103A/N138G, abrogates Beclin 1 binding. The 1.27 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of this pentad mutant GAPR-1 was determined. Comparison with the wild-type (WT) GAPR-1 structure shows that the equatorial groove of the pentad mutant is shallower and more positively charged, and therefore may not efficiently bind Beclin 1 residues 267–284, which include many hydrophobic residues. Both WT and pentad mutant GAPR-1 crystallize as dimers, and in each case the equatorial groove of one subunit is partially occluded by the other subunit, indicating that dimeric GAPR-1 is unlikely to bind Beclin 1. SAXS analysis of WT and pentad mutant GAPR-1 indicates that in solution the WT forms monomers, while the pentad mutant is primarily dimeric. Thus, changes in the structure of the equatorial groove combined with the improved dimerization of pentad mutant GAPR-1 are likely to abrogate binding to Beclin 1.",

It is demonstrated that a contour plot based on the parameters of the SIGD can play a role in the validation of macromolecular structures. The dependence of the peak-height distribution on resolution and atomic B values is also analysed. It is demonstrated that the B -value distribution can have a dramatically different effect on peak heights at different resolutions. Consequently, a comparative analysis of the B values of neighbouring atoms must account for resolution. A combination of the SIGD, peak-height distribution and outlier detection was used to identify a number of entries from the PDB that require attention. It is also shown that the presence of a multimodal B -value distribution often indicates that some loops or parts of the molecule have either been mismodelled or have dramatically different mobility, depending on their environment within the crystal. These distributions can also indicate the level of sharpening/blurring used before atomic structure refinement. It is recommended that procedures such as sharpening/blurring should be avoided during refinement, although they can play important roles in map visualization and model building.",

    "abstract": "Gaining an understanding of the protein–ligand complex structure along with the proper protonation and explicit solvent effects can be important in obtaining meaningful results in structure-guided drug discovery and structure-based drug discovery. Unfortunately, protonation and tautomerism are difficult to establish with conventional methods because of difficulties in the experimental detection of H atoms owing to the well known limitations of X-ray crystallography. In the present work, it is demonstrated that semiempirical, quantum-mechanics-based macromolecular crystallographic refinement is sensitive to the choice of a protonation-state/tautomer form of ligands and residues, and can therefore be used to explore potential states. A novel scoring method, called XModeScore , is described which enumerates the possible protomeric/tautomeric modes, refines each mode against X-ray diffraction data with the semiempirical quantum-mechanics (PM6) Hamiltonian and scores each mode using a combination of energetic strain (or ligand strain) and rigorous statistical analysis of the difference electron-density distribution. It is shown that using XModeScore it is possible to consistently distinguish the correct bound protomeric/tautomeric modes based on routine X-ray data, even at lower resolutions of around 3 Å. These X-ray results are compared with the results obtained from much more expensive and laborious neutron diffraction studies for three different examples: tautomerism in the acetazolamide ligand of human carbonic anhydrase II (PDB entries 3hs4 and 4k0s), tautomerism in the 8HX ligand of urate oxidase (PDB entries 4n9s and 4n9m) and the protonation states of the catalytic aspartic acid found within the active site of an aspartic protease (PDB entry 2jjj). In each case, XModeScore applied to the X-ray diffraction data is able to determine the correct protonation state as defined by the neutron diffraction data. The impact of QM-based refinement versus conventional refinement on XModeScore is also discussed.",

These UAAs were genetically incorporated into sfGFP in a solvent-exposed loop region and/or a partially buried site on the β-barrel of the protein. The crystal structures containing the UAAs at these two sites permit the structural implications of UAA incorporation for the native protein structure to be assessed with high resolution and permit a direct correlation between the structure and spectroscopic data to be made.

The cross-talk between these domains occurs via a ten-residue linker. Recent solution studies of DENV NS5 from all four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) showed that NS5 adopts multiple conformations owing to its flexible linker and that DENV-4 NS5 is more compact and less flexible compared with NS5 from DENV-1 to DENV-3 [Saw et al.

Here, using a variety of single, double, triple and quadruple mutants of DENV-4 NS5 combined with solution X-ray scattering studies, insight into the critical residues responsible for the differential flexibility of DENV-4 NS5 is presented. The DENV-4 NS5 mutants K271T and S266N/T267A as well as the deletion mutant ΔS266T267 showed enlarged dimensions and flexibility similar to those of DENV-3 NS5. The data indicate that the residues Lys271, Ser266 and Thr267 are important for the compactness of DENV-4 NS5 and therefore may be critical for the regulation of virus replication. Furthermore, quantitative characterization of the flexibility of these DENV-4 NS5 linker mutants using the ensemble-optimization method revealed that these mutants possess a similar conformational distribution to DENV-3 NS5, confirming that these residues in the linker region cause the higher compactness of DENV-4 NS5.",

As a member of the Hsp90 family, TRAP1 is presumed to be a general chaperone facilitating the late-stage folding of Hsp90 client proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. Interestingly, TRAP1 cannot replace cytosolic Hsp90 in protein folding, and none of the known Hsp90 co-chaperones are found in mitochondria. Thus, the three-dimensional structure of TRAP1 must feature regulatory elements that are essential to the ATPase activity and chaperone function of TRAP1. Here, the crystal structure of a human TRAP1NM dimer is presented, featuring an intact N-domain and M-domain structure, bound to adenosine 5'-β,γ-imidotriphosphate (ADPNP). The crystal structure together with epitope-mapping results shows that the TRAP1 M-domain loop 1 contacts the neighboring subunit and forms a previously unobserved third dimer interface that mediates the specific interaction with mitochondrial Hsp70.",

    "abstract": "During efforts to crystallize the enzyme 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone dioxygenase (DAD) from Alcaligenes sp. 4HAP, a small number of strongly diffracting protein crystals were obtained after two years of crystal growth in one condition. The crystals diffracted synchrotron radiation to almost 1.0 Å resolution and were, until recently, assumed to be formed by the DAD protein. However, when another crystal form of this enzyme was eventually solved at lower resolution, molecular replacement using this new structure as the search model did not give a convincing solution with the original atomic resolution data set. Hence, it was considered that these crystals might have arisen from a protein impurity, although molecular replacement using the structures of common crystallization contaminants as search models again failed. A script to perform molecular replacement using MOLREP in which the first chain of every structure in the PDB was used as a search model was run on a multi-core cluster. This identified a number of prokaryotic phosphate-binding proteins as scoring highly in the MOLREP peak lists. Calculation of an electron-density map at 1.1 Å resolution based on the solution obtained with PDB entry 2q9t allowed most of the amino acids to be identified visually and built into the model. A BLAST search then indicated that the molecule was most probably a phosphate-binding protein from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (UniProt ID B4SL31; gene ID Smal_2208), and fitting of the corresponding sequence to the atomic resolution map fully corroborated this. Proteins in this family have been linked to the virulence of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria and with biofilm formation. The structure of the S. maltophilia protein has been refined to an R factor of 10.15% and an Rfree of 12.46% at 1.1 Å resolution. The molecule adopts the type II periplasmic binding protein (PBP) fold with a number of extensively elaborated loop regions. A fully dehydrated phosphate anion is bound tightly between the two domains of the protein and interacts with conserved residues and a number of helix dipoles.",

Nevertheless, most are only compatible with a single type of sample holder and puck. Recent work aimed at reducing sample-handling efforts and crystal-alignment times at beamlines has resulted in a new generation of compact and precise sample holders for cryocrystallography: miniSPINE and NewPin [see the companion paper by Papp et al. (2017, Acta Cryst. , D 73 , 829–840)]. With full data collection now possible within seconds at most advanced beamlines, and future fourth-generation synchrotron sources promising to extract data in a few tens of milliseconds, the time taken to mount and centre a sample is rate-limiting. In this context, a versatile and fast sample changer, FlexED8, has been developed that is compatible with the highly successful SPINE sample holder and with the miniSPINE and NewPin sample holders. Based on a six-axis industrial robot, FlexED8 is equipped with a tool changer and includes a novel open sample-storage dewar with a built-in ice-filtering system. With seven versatile puck slots, it can hold up to 112 SPINE sample holders in uni-pucks, or 252 miniSPINE or NewPin sample holders, with 36 samples per puck. Additionally, a double gripper, compatible with the SPINE sample holders and uni-pucks, allows a reduction in the sample-exchange time from 40 s, the typical time with a standard single gripper, to less than 5 s. Computer vision-based sample-transfer monitoring, sophisticated error handling and automatic error-recovery procedures ensure high reliability. The FlexED8 sample changer has been successfully tested under real conditions on a beamline.",

    "abstract": "Molecular replacement (MR) is the predominant route to solution of the phase problem in macromolecular crystallography. Although routine in many cases, it becomes more effortful and often impossible when the available experimental structures typically used as search models are only distantly homologous to the target. Nevertheless, with current powerful MR software, relatively small core structures shared between the target and known structure, of 20–40% of the overall structure for example, can succeed as search models where they can be isolated. Manual sculpting of such small structural cores is rarely attempted and is dependent on the crystallographer's expertise and understanding of the protein family in question. Automated search-model editing has previously been performed on the basis of sequence alignment, in order to eliminate, for example, side chains or loops that are not present in the target, or on the basis of structural features ( e.g. solvent accessibility) or crystallographic parameters ( e.g. B factors). Here, based on recent work demonstrating a correlation between evolutionary conservation and protein rigidity/packing, novel automated ways to derive edited search models from a given distant homologue over a range of sizes are presented. A variety of structure-based metrics, many readily obtained from online webservers, can be fed to the MR pipeline AMPLE to produce search models that succeed with a set of test cases where expertly manually edited comparators, further processed in diverse ways with MrBUMP , fail. Further significant performance gains result when the structure-based distance geometry method CONCOORD is used to generate ensembles from the distant homologue. To our knowledge, this is the first such approach whereby a single structure is meaningfully transformed into an ensemble for the purposes of MR. Additional cases further demonstrate the advantages of the approach. CONCOORD is freely available and computationally inexpensive, so these novel methods offer readily available new routes to solve difficult MR cases.",

FXII circulates as a zymogen, which when auto-activated forms factor XIIa (FXIIa). Here, the production of the recombinant FXIIa protease domain (βFXIIaHis) with yields of ∼1-2 mg per litre of insect-cell culture is reported. A second construct utilized an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion (MBP-βFXIIaHis). Crystal structures were determined of MBP-βFXIIaHis in complex with the inhibitor D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) and of βFXIIaHis in isolation. The βFXIIaHis structure revealed that the S2 and S1 pockets were occupied by Thr and Arg residues, respectively, from an adjacent molecule in the crystal. The Thr-Arg sequence mimics the P2-P1 FXIIa cleavage-site residues present in the natural substrates prekallikrein and FXII, and Pro-Arg (from PPACK) mimics the factor XI cleavage site. A comparison of the βFXIIaHis structure with the available crystal structure of the zymogen-like FXII protease revealed large conformational changes centred around the S1 pocket and an alternate conformation for the 99-loop, Tyr99 and the S2 pocket. Further comparison with activated protease structures of factors IXa and Xa, which also have the Tyr99 residue, reveals that a more open form of the S2 pocket only occurs in the presence of a substrate mimetic. The FXIIa inhibitors EcTI and infestin-4 have Pro-Arg and Phe-Arg P2-P1 sequences, respectively, and the interactions that these inhibitors make with βFXIIa are also described. These structural studies of βFXIIa provide insight into substrate and inhibitor recognition and establish a scaffold for the structure-guided drug design of novel antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory agents.",

    "abstract": "Molecular replacement (MR) is the predominant route to solution of the phase problem in macromolecular crystallography. Where the lack of a suitable homologue precludes conventional MR, one option is to predict the target structure using bioinformatics. Such modelling, in the absence of homologous templates, is called ab initio or de novo modelling. Recently, the accuracy of such models has improved significantly as a result of the availability, in many cases, of residue-contact predictions derived from evolutionary covariance analysis. Covariance-assisted ab initio models representing structurally uncharacterized Pfam families are now available on a large scale in databases, potentially representing a valuable and easily accessible supplement to the PDB as a source of search models. Here, the unconventional MR pipeline AMPLE is employed to explore the value of structure predictions in the GREMLIN and PconsFam databases. It was tested whether these deposited predictions, processed in various ways, could solve the structures of PDB entries that were subsequently deposited. The results were encouraging: nine of 27 GREMLIN cases were solved, covering target lengths of 109–355 residues and a resolution range of 1.4–2.9 Å, and with target–model shared sequence identity as low as 20%. The cluster-and-truncate approach in AMPLE proved to be essential for most successes. For the overall lower quality structure predictions in the PconsFam database, remodelling with Rosetta within the AMPLE pipeline proved to be the best approach, generating ensemble search models from single-structure deposits. Finally, it is shown that the AMPLE -obtained search models deriving from GREMLIN deposits are of sufficiently high quality to be selected by the sequence-independent MR pipeline SIMBAD . Overall, the results help to point the way towards the optimal use of the expanding databases of ab initio structure predictions.",

A different approach is required to characterize ubiquitous secondary-structure elements, where flexibility is essential in order to capture small local differences. The ALEPH software is optimized for the analysis and the extraction of small protein folds by relying on their geometry rather than on their sequence. The annotation of the structural variability of a given fold provides valuable information for fragment-based molecular-replacement methods, in which testing alternative model hypotheses can succeed in solving difficult structures when no homology models are available or are successful. ARCIMBOLDO_BORGES combines the use of composite secondary-structure elements as a search model with density modification and tracing to reveal the rest of the structure when both steps are successful. This phasing method relies on general fold libraries describing variations around a given pattern of β-sheets and helices extracted using ALEPH. The program introduces characteristic vectors defined from the main-chain atoms as a way to describe the geometrical properties of the structure. ALEPH encodes structural properties in a graph network, the exploration of which allows secondary-structure annotation, decomposition of a structure into small compact folds, generation of libraries of models representing a variation of a given fold and finally superposition of these folds onto a target structure. These functions are available through a graphical interface designed to interactively show the results of structure manipulation, annotation, fold decomposition, clustering and library generation. ALEPH can produce pictures of the graphs, structures and folds for publication purposes.",

However, no structure of an ASBT has been solved with a substrate bound in its central cavity, so how a substrate binds to ASBT remains to be defined. In this study, molecular docking, structure determination and functional analysis were combined to define and validate the details of substrate binding in ASBT Yf .

The application of the TAAM to these data improves the quality of the electron-density maps and the visibility of H atoms. It also lowers the conventional R factors and improves the atomic displacement parameters and the results of the Hirshfeld rigid-bond test.

However, work with the NONO homodimer has been limited by rapid irreversible sample aggregation. Here, it is reported that L-proline stabilizes purified NONO homodimers, enabling good-quality solution small-angle X-ray structure determination and crystallization. NONO crystallized in the apparent space group P 2 1 with a unique axis ( b ) of 408.9 Å and with evidence of twinning, as indicated by the cumulative intensity distribution L statistic, suggesting the possibility of space group P 1. Structure solution by molecular replacement shows a superhelical arrangement of six NONO homodimers (or 12 in P 1) oriented parallel to the long axis, resulting in extensive noncrystallographic symmetry. Further analysis revealed that the crystal was not twinned, but the collected data suffered from highly overlapping reflections that obscured the L -test. Optimized data collection on a new crystal using higher energy X-rays, a smaller beam width and an increased sample-to-detector distance produced non-overlapping reflections to 2.6 Å resolution.

    "abstract": "Uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases (UGTs) are ubiquitous enzymes that are involved in the glycosylation of small molecules. As glycosylation improves the water solubility and stability of hydrophobic compounds, interest in the use of UGTs for the synthesis of glycosides of poorly soluble compounds is increasing. While sugar-donor recognition in UGTs is conserved with the presence of a plant secondary product glycosyltransferase (PSPG) motif, the basis of the recognition of the sugar acceptor and the regioselectivity of the products is poorly understood owing to low sequence identity around the acceptor-binding region. Pa GT3, a glycosyltransferase from the plant Phytolacca americana , can glycosylate a range of acceptors. To illustrate the structure–function relationship of Pa GT3, its crystal structure was determined. The sugar-donor and sugar-acceptor binding pockets in Pa GT3 were recognized by comparison of its structure with those of other UGTs. The key feature of Pa GT3 was the presence of longer loop regions around the hydrophobic acceptor-binding pocket, which resulted in a flexible and wider acceptor binding pocket. In this study, Pa GT3 crystals were grown by co-crystallization with 18-crown-6 ether or 15-crown-5 ether. The crown-ether molecule in the asymmetric unit was observed to form a complex with a metal ion, which was coordinated on two sides by the main-chain O atoms of Glu238 from two molecules of the protein. The crown ether–metal complex resembles a molecular glue that sticks two molecules of Pa GT3 together to enhance crystal growth. Thus, this result provides an insight into the substrate-recognition strategy in Pa GT3 for the study of glycosyltransferases. Additionally, it is shown that crown ether–metal ion complexes can be used as a molecular glue for the crystallization of proteins.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, numerous fundamental processes are controlled by the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) that regulates cellular actin polymerization, crucial for cell motility, cell–cell adhesion and epithelial differentiation. Actin assembly is triggered by interaction of the small GTPase Rac1 with CYFIP1, a key component of the WRC. Previously known as FAM49B, CYRI-B is a protein that is highly conserved across the Eukaryota and has recently been revealed to be a key regulator of Rac1 activity. Mutation of CYRI-B or alteration of its expression therefore leads to altered actin nucleation dynamics, with impacts on lamellipodia formation, cell migration and infection by intracellular pathogens. In addition, knockdown of CYRI-B expression in cancer cell lines results in accelerated cell proliferation and invasiveness. Here, the structure of Rhincodon typus (whale shark) CYRI-B is presented, which is the first to be reported of any CYRI family member. Solved by X-ray crystallography, the structure reveals that CYRI-B comprises three distinct α-helical subdomains and is highly structurally related to a conserved domain present in CYFIP proteins. The work presented here establishes a template towards a better understanding of CYRI-B biological function.",

    "abstract": "Electron diffraction allows protein structure determination when only nanosized crystals are available. Nevertheless, multiple elastic (or dynamical) scattering, which is prominent in electron diffraction, is a concern. Current methods for modeling dynamical scattering by multi-slice or Bloch wave approaches are not suitable for protein crystals because they are not designed to cope with large molecules. Here, dynamical scattering of nanocrystals of insulin, thermolysin and thaumatin was limited by collecting data from thin crystals. To accurately measure the weak diffraction signal from the few unit cells in the thin crystals, a low-noise hybrid pixel Timepix electron-counting detector was used. The remaining dynamical component was further reduced in refinement using a likelihood-based correction, which was introduced previously for analyzing electron diffraction data of small-molecule nanocrystals and was adapted here for protein crystals. The procedure is shown to notably improve the structural refinement, in one case allowing the location of solvent molecules. It also allowed refinement of the charge states of bound metal atoms, an important element in protein function, through B -factor analysis of the metal atoms and their ligands. These results clearly increase the value of macromolecular electron crystallography as a complementary structural biology technique.",

The mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction of lysozyme was first studied more than 50 years ago; however, it has not yet been fully elucidated and various mechanisms are still being investigated. One reaction system that has commonly been proposed is that the lysozyme intermediate undergoes covalent ligand binding during hydrolysis. However, these findings resulted from experiments performed under laboratory conditions using fluorine-based ligands, which facilitate the formation of covalent bonds between the ligands and the catalytic side chain of lysozyme. More recently, high-resolution X-ray structural analysis was used to study the complex of lysozyme with an N -acetylglucosamine tetramer. As a result, the carboxyl group of Asp52 was found to form a relatively strong hydrogen-bond network and had difficulty binding covalently to C1 of the carbohydrate ring. To confirm this hydrogen-bond network, neutron test measurements were successfully performed to a resolution of better than 1.9 Å.",

    "abstract": "Membrane proteins (MPs) play vital roles in the function of cells and are also major drug targets. Structural information on proteins is vital for understanding their mechanism of function and is critical for the development of drugs. However, obtaining high-resolution structures of membrane proteins, in particular, under native conditions is still a great challenge. In such cases, the low-resolution methods small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) might provide valuable structural information. However, in some cases small-angle scattering (SAS) provides ambiguous ab initio structural information if complementary measurements are not performed and/or a priori information on the protein is not taken into account. Understanding the nature of the limitations may help to overcome these problems. One of the main problems of SAS data analysis of solubilized membrane proteins is the contribution of the detergent belt surrounding the MP. Here, a comprehensive analysis of how the detergent belt contributes to the SAS data of a membrane-protein complex of sensory rhodopsin II with its cognate transducer from Natronomonas pharaonis ( Np SRII– Np HtrII) was performed. The influence of the polydispersity of Np SRII– Np HtrII oligomerization is the second problem that is addressed here. It is shown that inhomogeneity in the scattering length density of the detergent belt surrounding a membrane part of the complex and oligomerization polydispersity significantly impacts on SAXS and SANS profiles, and therefore on 3D ab initio structures. It is described how both problems can be taken into account to improve the quality of SAS data treatment. Since SAS data for MPs are usually obtained from solubilized proteins, and their detergent belt and, to a certain extent, oligomerization polydispersity are sufficiently common phenomena, the approaches proposed in this work might be used in SAS studies of different MPs.",

According to the principles of drug repurposing, the aim was to demonstrate a putative new mechanism of action of clorsulon and thus widen its antiparasitic spectrum.

Recently, beam image-shift electron cryo-tomography (BISECT), a strategy to significantly accelerate the acquisition of tilt series without sacrificing image quality, was introduced. The ability to produce thousands of high-quality tilt series during a single microscope session, however, introduces significant bottlenecks in the downstream data analysis, which has so far relied on specialized pipelines. Here, recent advances in accurate estimation of the contrast transfer function and self-tuning exposure-weighting routines that contribute to improving the resolution and streamlining the structure-determination process using sub-volume averaging are reviewed.

A novel KEase from a Clostridia bacterium (CDAE) was identified to be a D-allulose 3-epimerase and was further characterized as thermostable and metal-dependent. In order to explore its structure-function relationship, the crystal structure of CDAE was determined using X-ray diffraction at 2.10 Å resolution, revealing a homodimeric D-allulose 3-epimerase structure with extensive interactions formed at the dimeric interface that contribute to structure stability. Structural analysis identified the structural features of CDAE, which displays a common (β/α)8-TIM barrel and an ordered Mn2+-binding architecture at the active center, which may explain the positive effects of Mn2+ on the activity and stability of CDAE. Furthermore, comparison of CDAE and other KEase structures revealed several structural differences, highlighting the remarkable differences in enzyme-substrate binding at the O4, O5 and O6 sites of the bound substrate, which are mainly induced by distinct hydrophobic pockets in the active center. The shape and hydrophobicity of this pocket appear to produce the differences in specificity and affinity for substrates among KEase family enzymes. Exploration of the crystal structure of CDAE provides a better understanding of its structure-function relationship, which might provide a basis for molecular modification of CDAE and further provides a reference for other KEases.",

    "abstract": "X-ray crystallography has been invaluable in delivering structural information about proteins. Previously, an approach has been developed that allows high-quality X-ray diffraction data to be obtained from protein crystals at and above room temperature. Here, this previous work is built on and extended by showing that high-quality anomalous signal can be obtained from single protein crystals using diffraction data collected at 220 K up to physiological temperatures. The anomalous signal can be used to directly determine the structure of a protein, i.e. to phase the data, as is routinely performed under cryoconditions. This ability is demonstrated by obtaining diffraction data from model lysozyme, thaumatin and proteinase K crystals, the anomalous signal from which allowed their structures to be solved experimentally at 7.1 keV X-ray energy and at room temperature with relatively low data redundancy. It is also demonstrated that the anomalous signal from diffraction data obtained at 310 K (37°C) can be used to solve the structure of proteinase K and to identify ordered ions. The method provides useful anomalous signal at temperatures down to 220 K, resulting in an extended crystal lifetime and increased data redundancy. Finally, we show that useful anomalous signal can be obtained at room temperature using X-rays of 12 keV energy as typically used for routine data collection, allowing this type of experiment to be carried out at widely accessible synchrotron beamline energies and enabling the simultaneous extraction of high-resolution data and anomalous signal. With the recent emphasis on obtaining conformational ensemble information for proteins, the high resolution of the data allows such ensembles to be built, while the anomalous signal allows the structure to be experimentally solved, ions to be identified, and water molecules and ions to be differentiated. Because bound metal-, phosphorus- and sulfur-containing ions all have anomalous signal, obtaining anomalous signal across temperatures and up to physiological temperatures will provide a more complete description of protein conformational ensembles, function and energetics.",

    "abstract": "Many secreted eukaryotic proteins are N-glycosylated with oligosaccharides composed of a high-mannose N-glycan core and, in the specific case of yeast cell-wall proteins, an extended α-1,6-mannan backbone carrying a number of α-1,2- and α-1,3-mannose substituents of varying lengths. α-Mannosidases from CAZy family GH92 release terminal mannose residues from these N-glycans, providing access for the α-endomannanases, which then degrade the α-mannan backbone. Most characterized GH92 α-mannosidases consist of a single catalytic domain, while a few have extra domains including putative carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). To date, neither the function nor the structure of a multi-domain GH92 α-mannosidase CBM has been characterized. Here, the biochemical investigation and crystal structure of the full-length five-domain GH92 α-1,2-mannosidase from Neobacillus novalis ( Nn GH92) with mannoimidazole bound in the active site and an additional mannoimidazole bound to the N-terminal CBM32 are reported. The structure of the catalytic domain is very similar to that reported for the GH92 α-mannosidase Bt 3990 from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , with the substrate-binding site being highly conserved. The function of the CBM32s and other Nn GH92 domains was investigated by their sequential deletion and suggested that whilst their binding to the catalytic domain was crucial for the overall structural integrity of the enzyme, they appear to have little impact on the binding affinity to the yeast α-mannan substrate. These new findings provide a better understanding of how to select and optimize other multi-domain bacterial GH92 α-mannosidases for the degradation of yeast α-mannan or mannose-rich glycans.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio spp. play a crucial role in the global recycling of the highly abundant recalcitrant biopolymer chitin in marine ecosystems through their ability to secrete chitin-degrading enzymes to efficiently hydrolyse chitinous materials and use them as their major carbon source. In this study, the first crystal structures of a complete four-domain chitin-active AA10 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase from the chitinolytic bacterium Vibrio campbellii type strain ATCC BAA-1116 are reported. The crystal structures of apo and copper-bound Vh LPMO10A were resolved as homodimers with four distinct domains: an N-terminal AA10 catalytic (CatD) domain connected to a GlcNAc-binding (GbpA_2) domain, followed by a module X domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM73). Size-exclusion chromatography and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis confirmed that Vh LPMO10A exists as a monomer in solution. The active site of Vh LPMO10A is located on the surface of the CatD domain, with three conserved residues (His1, His98 and Phe170) forming the copper(II)-binding site. Metal-binding studies using synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence, together with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, gave consistently strong copper(II) signals in the protein samples, confirming that Vh LPMO10A is a copper-dependent enzyme. ITC binding data showed that Vh LPMO10A could bind various divalent cations but bound most strongly to copper(II) ions, with a K d of 0.1 ± 0.01 µ M . In contrast, a K d of 1.9 n M was estimated for copper(I) ions from redox-potential measurements. The presence of ascorbic acid is essential for H 2 O 2 production in the reaction catalysed by Vh LPMO10A. MALDI-TOF MS identified Vh LPMO10A as a C1-specific LPMO, generating oxidized chitooligosaccharide products with different degrees of polymerization (DP2 ox –DP8 ox ). This new member of the chitin-active AA10 LPMOs could serve as a powerful biocatalyst in biofuel production from chitin biomass.",

    "abstract": "Controlled protein assembly and crystallization is necessary as a means of generating diffraction-quality crystals as well as providing a basis for new types of biomaterials. Water-soluble calixarenes are useful mediators of protein crystallization. Recently, it was demonstrated that Ralstonia solanacearum lectin (RSL) co-crystallizes with anionic sulfonato-calix[8]arene (sclx 8 ) in three space groups. Two of these co-crystals only grow at pH ≤ 4 where the protein is cationic, and the crystal packing is dominated by the calixarene. This paper describes a fourth RSL–sclx 8 co-crystal, which was discovered while working with a cation-enriched mutant. Crystal form IV grows at high ionic strength in the pH range 5–6. While possessing some features in common with the previous forms, the new structure reveals alternative calixarene binding modes. The occurrence of C 2 -symmetric assemblies, with the calixarene at special positions, appears to be an important result for framework fabrication. Questions arise regarding crystal screening and exhaustive searching for polymorphs.",

Thanks to techniques such as single-particle analysis and electron tomography, it is possible to image a macromolecule in different states, information that can subsequently be extracted through advanced image-processing methods to build a richer approximation of a conformational landscape. However, the interoperability of all of these algorithms remains a challenging task that is left to users, preventing them from defining a single flexible workflow in which conformational information can be addressed by different algorithms. Therefore, in this work, a new framework integrated into Scipion is proposed called the Flexibility Hub. This framework automatically handles intercommunication between different heterogeneity software, simplifying the task of combining the software into workflows in which the quality and the amount of information extracted from flexibility analysis is maximized.",

    "abstract": "Fixed-target crystallography has become a widely used approach for serial crystallography at both synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources. A plethora of fixed targets have been developed at different facilities and by various manufacturers, with different characteristics and dimensions and with little or no emphasis on standardization. These many fixed targets have good reasons for their design, shapes, fabrication materials and the presence or absence of apertures and fiducials, reflecting the diversity of serial experiments. Given this, it would be a Sisyphean task to design and manufacture a new standard fixed target that would satisfy all possible experimental configurations. Therefore, a simple standardized descriptor to fully describe fixed targets is proposed rather than a standardized device. This descriptor is a dictionary that could be read by fixed-target beamline software and straightforwardly allow data collection from fixed targets new to that beamline. The descriptor would therefore allow a much easier exchange of fixed targets between sources and facilitate the uptake of new fixed targets, benefiting beamlines, users and manufacturers. This descriptor was first presented at, and was developed following, a meeting of representatives from multiple synchrotron and XFEL sources in Hamburg in January 2023.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria use siderophores, outer membrane receptors, inner membrane transporters and substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) to transport transition metals through the periplasm. The SBPs share a similar protein fold that has undergone significant structural evolution to communicate with a variety of differentially regulated transporters in the cell. In Yersinia pestis , the causative agent of plague, YfeA (YPO2439, y1897), an SBP, is important for full virulence during mammalian infection. To better understand the role of YfeA in infection, crystal structures were determined under several environmental conditions with respect to transition-metal levels. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and anomalous X-ray scattering data show that YfeA is polyspecific and can alter its substrate specificity. In minimal-media experiments, YfeA crystals grown after iron supplementation showed a threefold increase in iron fluorescence emission over the iron fluorescence emission from YfeA crystals grown from nutrient-rich conditions, and YfeA crystals grown after manganese supplementation during overexpression showed a fivefold increase in manganese fluorescence emission over the manganese fluorescence emission from YfeA crystals grown from nutrient-rich conditions. In all experiments, the YfeA crystals produced the strongest fluorescence emission from zinc and could not be manipulated otherwise. Additionally, this report documents the discovery of a novel surface metal-binding site that prefers to chelate zinc but can also bind manganese. Flexibility across YfeA crystal forms in three loops and a helix near the buried metal-binding site suggest that a structural rearrangement is required for metal loading and unloading.",

    "abstract": "Neutron crystallography is a powerful method to determine the positions of H atoms in macromolecular structures. However, it is sometimes hard to judge what would constitute a chemically reasonable model, and the geometry of H atoms depends more on the surroundings (for example the formation of hydrogen bonds) than heavy atoms, so that the empirical geometry information for the H atoms used to supplement the experimental data is often less accurate. These problems may be reduced by using quantum-mechanical calculations. A method has therefore been developed to combine quantum-mechanical calculations with joint crystallographic refinement against X-ray and neutron data. A first validation of this method is provided by re-refining the structure of the galectin-3 carbohydrate-recognition domain in complex with lactose. The geometry is improved, in particular for water molecules, for which the method leads to better-resolved hydrogen-bonding interactions. The method has also been applied to the active copper site of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase and shows that the protonation state of the amino-terminal histidine residue can be determined.",

Human phosphoserine phosphatase (hPSP) is a key enzyme in the production of serine by the dephosphorylation of phospho-L-serine. It is directly involved in the biosynthesis of other important metabolites such as glycine and D-serine (a neuromodulator). hPSP is involved in the survival mechanism of cancer cells and has recently been found to be an essential biomarker. Here, three new high-resolution crystal structures of hPSP (1.5–2.0 Å) in complexes with phosphoserine and with serine, which are the substrate and the product of the reaction, respectively, and in complex with a noncleavable substrate analogue (homocysteic acid) are presented. New types of interactions take place between the enzyme and its ligands. Moreover, the loop involved in the open/closed state of the enzyme is fully refined in a totally unfolded conformation. This loop is further studied through molecular-dynamics simulations. Finally, all of these analyses allow a more complete reaction mechanism for this enzyme to be proposed which is consistent with previous publications on the subject.",

Here, a method is presented to screen for conditions that produce microcrystals of membrane proteins in the lipidic cubic phase using a well-based crystallization approach. A key advantage over earlier approaches is that the progress of crystal formation can be easily monitored without interrupting the crystallization process. In addition, the protocol can be scaled up to efficiently produce large quantities of crystals for serial crystallography experiments. Using the well-based crystallization methodology, novel conditions for the growth of showers of microcrystals of three different membrane proteins have been developed.

The binding of this ion produces long-range conformational changes affecting the loop containing Ser60–Asn74. The negatively charged phosphate ion shields the electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged arginine and histidine residues, resulting in higher stability of the phosphate-bound lysozyme. Additionally, a low-humidity orthorhombic variant was obtained at pH 4.5, and comparison with those previously obtained at pH 6.5 and 9.5 shows a 1.5 Å displacement of the fifth α-helix towards the active-site cavity, which might be relevant to protein function. Since lysozyme is broadly used as a model protein in studies related to protein crystallization and amyloid formation, these results indicate that the interaction of some anions must be considered when analysing experiments performed at acidic pH values.",

    "abstract": "Glucuronoxylan endo-β-1,4-xylanases cleave the xylan chain specifically at sites containing 4- O -methylglucuronic acid substitutions. These enzymes have recently received considerable attention owing to their importance in the cooperative hydrolysis of heteropolysaccharides. However, little is known about the hydrolysis of glucuronoxylans in extreme environments. Here, the structure of a thermostable family 30 glucuronoxylan endo-β-1,4-xylanase ( Ct Xyn30A) from Clostridium thermocellum is reported. Ct Xyn30A is part of the cellulosome, a highly elaborate multi-enzyme complex secreted by the bacterium to efficiently deconstruct plant cell-wall carbohydrates. Ct Xyn30A preferably hydrolyses glucuronoxylans and displays maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 70°C. The structure of Ct Xyn30A displays a (β/α) 8 TIM-barrel core with a side-associated β-sheet domain. Structural analysis of the Ct Xyn30A mutant E225A, solved in the presence of xylotetraose, revealed xylotetraose-cleavage oligosaccharides partially occupying subsites −3 to +2. The sugar ring at the +1 subsite is held in place by hydrophobic stacking interactions between Tyr139 and Tyr200 and hydrogen bonds to the OH group of Tyr227. Although family 30 glycoside hydrolases are retaining enzymes, the xylopyranosyl ring at the −1 subsite of Ct Xyn30A-E225A appears in the α-anomeric configuration. A set of residues were found to be strictly conserved in glucuronoxylan endo-β-1,4-xylanases and constitute the molecular determinants of the restricted specificity displayed by these enzymes. Ct Xyn30A is the first thermostable glucuronoxylan endo-β-1,4-xylanase described to date. This work reveals that substrate recognition by both thermophilic and mesophilic glucuronoxylan endo-β-1,4-xylanases is modulated by a conserved set of residues.",

A generic method for introducing Hg atoms into any crystal independent of the presence of free cysteines in the target protein could considerably facilitate the process of obtaining unbiased experimental phases. Nanobodies (single-domain antibodies) have recently been shown to promote the crystallization and structure determination of flexible proteins and complexes. To extend the usability of nanobodies for crystallographic work, variants of the Nb36 nanobody with a single free cysteine at one of four framework-residue positions were developed. These cysteines could be labelled with fluorophores or Hg. For one cysteine variant (Nb36-C85) two nanobody structures were experimentally phased using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) and single isomorphous replacement with anomalous signal (SIRAS), taking advantage of radiation-induced changes in Cys–Hg bonding. Importantly, Hg labelling influenced neither the interaction of Nb36 with its antigen complement C5 nor its structure. The results suggest that Cys–Hg-labelled nanobodies may become efficient tools for obtaining de novo phase information during the structure determination of nanobody–protein complexes.",

Z. variegatus expresses three flavin-dependent monooxygenase ( Zv FMO) isoforms which contribute to a counterstrategy against pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). PAs are protoxic compounds produced by some angiosperm lineages as a chemical defence against herbivores. N -Oxygenation of PAs and the accumulation of PA N -oxides within their haemolymph result in two evolutionary advantages for these insects: (i) they circumvent the defence mechanism of their food plants and (ii) they can use PA N -oxides to protect themselves against predators, which cannot cope with the toxic PAs. Despite a high degree of sequence identity and a similar substrate spectrum, the three Zv FMO isoforms differ greatly in enzyme activity. Here, the crystal structure of the Z. variegatus PA N -oxygenase ( Zv PNO), the most active Zv FMO isoform, is reported at 1.6 Å resolution together with kinetic studies of a second isoform, Zv FMOa. This is the first available crystal structure of an FMO from class B (of six different FMO subclasses, A–F) within the family of flavin-dependent monooxygenases that originates from a more highly developed organism than yeast. Despite the differences in sequence between family members, their overall structure is very similar. This indicates the need for high conservation of the three-dimensional structure for this type of reaction throughout all kingdoms of life. Nevertheless, this structure provides the closest relative to the human enzyme that is currently available for modelling studies. Of note, the crystal structure of Zv PNO reveals a unique dimeric arrangement as well as small conformational changes within the active site that have not been observed before. A newly observed kink within helix α8 close to the substrate-binding path might indicate a potential mechanism for product release. The data show that even single amino-acid exchanges in the substrate-entry path, rather than the binding site, have a significant impact on the specific enzyme activity of the isoforms.",

    "abstract": "Glucoamylases are one of the most important classes of enzymes in the industrial degradation of starch biomass. They consist of a catalytic domain and a carbohydrate-binding domain (CBM), with the latter being important for the interaction with the polymeric substrate. Whereas the catalytic mechanisms and structures of the individual domains are well known, the spatial arrangement of the domains with respect to each other and its influence on activity are not fully understood. Here, the structures of three industrially used fungal glucoamylases, two of which are full length, have been crystallized and determined. It is shown for the first time that the relative orientation between the CBM and the catalytic domain is flexible, as they can adopt different orientations independently of ligand binding, suggesting a role as an anchor to increase the contact time and the relative concentration of substrate near the active site. The flexibility in the orientations of the two domains presented a considerable challenge for the crystallization of the enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The biological conversion of lignocellulosic matter into high-value chemicals or biofuels is of increasing industrial importance as the sector slowly transitions away from nonrenewable sources. Many industrial processes involve the use of cellulolytic enzyme cocktails – a selection of glycoside hydrolases and, increasingly, polysaccharide oxygenases – to break down recalcitrant plant polysaccharides. ORFs from the genome of Teredinibacter turnerae , a symbiont hosted within the gills of marine shipworms, were identified in order to search for enzymes with desirable traits. Here, a putative T. turnerae glycoside hydrolase from family 8, hereafter referred to as TtGH8, is analysed. The enzyme is shown to be active against β-1,4-xylan and mixed-linkage (β-1,3,β-1,4) marine xylan. Kinetic parameters, obtained using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection and 3,5-dinitrosalicyclic acid reducing-sugar assays, show that TtGH8 catalyses the hydrolysis of β-1,4-xylohexaose with a k cat / K m of 7.5 × 10 7 M −1 min −1 but displays maximal activity against mixed-linkage polymeric xylans, hinting at a primary role in the degradation of marine polysaccharides. The three-dimensional structure of TtGH8 was solved in uncomplexed and xylobiose-, xylotriose- and xylohexaose-bound forms at approximately 1.5 Å resolution; the latter was consistent with the greater k cat / K m for hexasaccharide substrates. A 2,5 B boat conformation observed in the −1 position of bound xylotriose is consistent with the proposed conformational itinerary for this class of enzyme. This work shows TtGH8 to be effective at the degradation of xylan-based substrates, notably marine xylan, further exemplifying the potential of T. turnerae for effective and diverse biomass degradation.",

However, nonperiodic atom-centered quantum-chemistry codes do not inherently account for nearest-neighbor interactions of crystallographic symmetry-related copies in a satisfactory way. Here, these nearest-neighbor effects have been included in the model by expanding to a super-cell and then truncating the super-cell to only include residues from neighboring cells that are interacting with the asymmetric unit. In this way, the fragmentation approach can adequately and efficiently include nearest-neighbor effects. It has previously been shown that a moderately sized X-ray structure can be treated using quantum methods if a fragmentation approach is applied. In this study, a target protein (PDB entry 4gif) was partitioned into a number of large fragments. The use of large fragments (typically hundreds of atoms) is tractable when a GPU-based package such as TeraChem is employed or cheaper (semi-empirical) methods are used. The QM calculations were run at the HF-D3/6-31G level. The models refined using a recently developed semi-empirical method (GFN2-xTB) were compared and contrasted. To validate the refinement procedure for a non- P 1 structure, a standard set of crystallographic metrics were used. The robustness of the implementation is shown by refining 13 additional protein models across multiple space groups and a summary of the refinement metrics is presented.",

    "abstract": "Reducing the sample-exchange time is a crucial issue in maximizing the throughput of macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines because the diffraction data collection itself is completed within a minute in the era of pixel-array detectors. To this end, an upgraded sample changer, SPACE-II, has been developed on the basis of the previous model, SPACE (SPring-8 Precise Automatic Cryo-sample Exchanger), at the BL41XU beamline at SPring-8. SPACE-II achieves one sample-exchange step within 16 s, of which its action accounts for only 11 s, because of three features: (i) the implementation of twin arms that enable samples to be exchanged in one cycle of mount-arm action, (ii) the implementation of long-stroke mount arms that allow samples to be exchanged without withdrawal of the detector and (iii) the use of a fast-moving translation and rotation stage for the mount arms. By pre-holding the next sample prior to the sample-exchange sequence, the time was further decreased to 11 s in the case of automatic data collection, of which the action of SPACE-II accounted for 8 s. Moreover, the sample capacity was expanded from four to eight Uni-Pucks. The performance of SPACE-II has been demonstrated in over two years of operation at BL41XU; the average number of samples mounted on the diffractometer in one day was increased from 132 to 185, with an error rate of 0.089%, which counted incidents in which users could not continue with an experiment without recovery work by entering the experimental hutch. On the basis of these results, SPACE-II has been installed at three other MX beamlines at SPring-8 as of July 2019. The fast and highly reliable SPACE-II is now one of the most important pieces of infrastructure for the MX beamlines at SPring-8, providing users with the opportunity to fully make use of limited beamtime with brilliant X-rays.",

More recently, several experiments using different structural biology techniques and approaches have been conducted to try to understand how potassium ions permeate through the selectivity filter of potassium ion channels. Two mechanisms of permeation have been proposed, and each of the two mechanisms is supported by different experiments. The key structural biology experiments conducted so far to try to understand how ion permeation takes place in potassium ion channels are reviewed and discussed. Protein crystallography has made, and continues to make, key contributions in this field, often through the use of anomalous scattering. Other structural biology techniques used to study the contents of the selectivity filter include solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, both of which make clever use of isotopic labeling techniques, while molecular-dynamics simulations of ion flow through the selectivity filter have been enabled by the growing number of potassium ion channel structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank.",

    "abstract": "Structure determination of novel biological macromolecules by X-ray crystallography can be facilitated by the use of small structural fragments, some of only a few residues in length, as effective search models for molecular replacement to overcome the phase problem. Independence from the need for a complete pre-existing model with sequence similarity to the crystallized molecule is the primary appeal of ARCIMBOLDO , a suite of programs which employs this ab initio algorithm for phase determination. Here, the use of ARCIMBOLDO is investigated to overcome the phase problem with the electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) method known as microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). The results support the use of the ARCIMBOLDO_SHREDDER pipeline to provide phasing solutions for a structure of proteinase K from 1.6 Å resolution data using model fragments derived from the structures of proteins sharing a sequence identity of as low as 20%. ARCIMBOLDO_SHREDDER identified the most accurate polyalanine fragments from a set of distantly related sequence homologues. Alternatively, such templates were extracted in spherical volumes and given internal degrees of freedom to refine towards the target structure. Both modes relied on the rotation function in Phaser to identify or refine fragment models and its translation function to place them. Model completion from the placed fragments proceeded through phase combination of partial solutions and/or density modification and main-chain autotracing using SHELXE . The combined set of fragments was sufficient to arrive at a solution that resembled that determined by conventional molecular replacement using the known target structure as a search model. This approach obviates the need for a single, complete and highly accurate search model when phasing MicroED data, and permits the evaluation of large fragment libraries for this purpose.",

MNTs consist of several polypeptide domains (functional modules) for the recognition of a cell-surface internalizable receptor, pH-dependent endosomal escape and subsequent transport into the nucleus through the nuclear pores. MNTs are a promising means for cancer treatment. As has been shown previously, all of the modules of MNTs retain their functionalities. Despite their importance, there is no structural information available about these chimeric polypeptides, which hampers the creation of new MNT variants. Here, a low-resolution 3D structure of an MNT is presented which was obtained by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering coupled to size-exclusion chromatography. The data suggest that the MNT can adopt two main conformations, but in both conformations the protein N- and C-termini are distanced and do not influence each other. The change in the MNT conformation during acidification of the medium was also studied. It was shown that the fraction of the elongated conformation increases upon acidification. The results of this work will be useful for the development of MNTs that are suitable for clinical trials and possible therapeutic applications.",

Strategies for merging data from many samples, which require assessment of sample isomorphism, rely on metrics of variability in unit-cell parameters, anomalous signal correlation and overall data similarity. Local scaling, anomalous signal optimization and data-set weighting, implemented in phenix.scale_and_merge, provide an efficient protocol for merging data from many samples. The protein NS1 was used in a series of trials with data collected from 28 samples for phasing by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction of the native S atoms. The local-scaling, anomalous-optimization protocol produced merged data sets with higher anomalous signal quality indicators than did standard global-scaling protocols. The local-scaled data were also more successful in substructure determination. Merged data quality was assessed for data sets where the multiplicity was reduced in either of two ways: by excluding data from individual crystals (to reduce errors owing to non-isomorphism) or by excluding the last-recorded segments of data from each crystal (to minimize the effects of radiation damage). The anomalous signal was equivalent at equivalent multiplicity for the two procedures, and structure-determination success correlated with anomalous signal metrics. The quality of the anomalous signal was strongly correlated with data multiplicity over a range of 12-fold to 150-fold multiplicity. For the NS1 data, the local-scaling and anomalous-optimization protocol handled sample non-isomorphism and radiation-induced decay equally well.",

    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae TSA2 belongs to the family of typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, a ubiquitously expressed family of redox-active enzymes that utilize a conserved peroxidatic cysteine to reduce peroxides. Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have been shown to be involved in protection against oxidative stress and in hydrogen peroxide signalling. Furthermore, several 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, including S. cerevisiae TSA1 and TSA2, are able to switch to chaperone activity upon hyperoxidation of their peroxidatic cysteine. This makes the sensitivity to hyperoxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine a very important determinant for the cellular function of a peroxiredoxin under different cellular conditions. Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins exist as dimers, and in the course of the reaction the peroxidatic cysteine forms a disulfide with a resolving cysteine located in the C-terminus of its dimeric partner. This requires a local unfolding of the active site and the C-terminus. The balance between the fully folded and locally unfolded conformations is of key importance for the reactivity and sensitivity to hyperoxidation of the different peroxiredoxins. Here, the structure of a C48S mutant of TSA2 from S. cerevisiae that mimics the reduced state of the peroxidatic cysteine has been determined. The structure reveals a novel conformation for the strictly conserved Pro41, which is likely to affect the delicate balance between the fully folded and locally unfolded conformations of the active site, and therefore the reactivity and the sensitivity to hyperoxidation. Furthermore, the structure also explains the observed difference in the pKa values of the peroxidatic cysteines of S. cerevisiae TSA1 and TSA2 despite their very high sequence identity.",

    "abstract": "The fluorescent protein from Dendronephthya sp. (DendFP) is a member of the Kaede-like group of photoconvertible fluorescent proteins with a His62-Tyr63-Gly64 chromophore-forming sequence. Upon irradiation with UV and blue light, the fluorescence of DendFP irreversibly changes from green (506 nm) to red (578 nm). The photoconversion is accompanied by cleavage of the peptide backbone at the C α —N bond of His62 and the formation of a terminal carboxamide group at the preceding Leu61. The resulting double C α =C β bond in His62 extends the conjugation of the chromophore π system to include imidazole, providing the red fluorescence. Here, the three-dimensional structures of native green and photoconverted red forms of DendFP determined at 1.81 and 2.14 Å resolution, respectively, are reported. This is the first structure of photoconverted red DendFP to be reported to date. The structure-based mutagenesis of DendFP revealed an important role of positions 142 and 193: replacement of the original Ser142 and His193 caused a moderate red shift in the fluorescence and a considerable increase in the photoconversion rate. It was demonstrated that hydrogen bonding of the chromophore to the Gln116 and Ser105 cluster is crucial for variation of the photoconversion rate. The single replacement Gln116Asn disrupts the hydrogen bonding of Gln116 to the chromophore, resulting in a 30-fold decrease in the photoconversion rate, which was partially restored by a further Ser105Asn replacement.",

    "abstract": "Crystallographic phasing strategies increasingly require the exploration and ranking of many hypotheses about the number, types and positions of atoms, molecules and/or molecular fragments in the unit cell, each with only a small chance of being correct. Accelerating this move has been improvements in phasing methods, which are now able to extract phase information from the placement of very small fragments of structure, from weak experimental phasing signal or from combinations of molecular replacement and experimental phasing information. Describing phasing in terms of a directed acyclic graph allows graph-management software to track and manage the path to structure solution. The crystallographic software supporting the graph data structure must be strictly modular so that nodes in the graph are efficiently generated by the encapsulated functionality. To this end, the development of new software, Phasertng , which uses directed acyclic graphs natively for input/output, has been initiated. In Phasertng , the codebase of Phaser has been rebuilt, with an emphasis on modularity, on scripting, on speed and on continuing algorithm development. As a first application of phasertng , its advantages are demonstrated in the context of phasertng.xtricorder , a tool to analyse and triage merged data in preparation for molecular replacement or experimental phasing. The description of the phasing strategy with directed acyclic graphs is a generalization that extends beyond the functionality of Phasertng , as it can incorporate results from bioinformatics and other crystallographic tools, and will facilitate multifaceted search strategies, dynamic ranking of alternative search pathways and the exploitation of machine learning to further improve phasing strategies.",

Around 70% of the coronavirus positive-sense single-stranded RNA encodes proteins involved in replication, and these viruses essentially take over the biosynthetic and transport mechanisms to ensure the efficient replication of their genome and trafficking of their virions. Some coronaviruses encode genes for ion-channel proteins – the envelope protein E (orf4a), orf3a and orf8 – which they successfully employ to take control of the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi complex intermediate compartment or ERGIC. The E protein, which is one of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, assembles its transmembrane protomers into homopentameric channels with mild cationic selectivity. Orf3a forms homodimers and homotetramers. Both carry a PDZ-binding domain, lending them the versatility to interact with more than 400 target proteins in infected host cells. Orf8 is a very short 29-amino-acid single-passage transmembrane peptide that forms cation-selective channels when assembled in lipid bilayers. This review addresses the contribution of biophysical and structural biology approaches that unravel different facets of coronavirus ion channels, their effects on the cellular machinery of infected cells and some structure–functional correlations with ion channels of higher organisms.",

    "abstract": "In this contribution, the current protocols for modelling covalent linkages within the CCP 4 suite are considered. The mechanism used for modelling covalent linkages is reviewed: the use of dictionaries for describing changes to stereochemistry as a result of the covalent linkage and the application of link-annotation records to structural models to ensure the correct treatment of individual instances of covalent linkages. Previously, linkage descriptions were lacking in quality compared with those of contemporary component dictionaries. Consequently, AceDRG has been adapted for the generation of link dictionaries of the same quality as for individual components. The approach adopted by AceDRG for the generation of link dictionaries is outlined, which includes associated modifications to the linked components. A number of tools to facilitate the practical modelling of covalent linkages available within the CCP 4 suite are described, including a new restraint-dictionary accumulator, the Make Covalent Link tool and AceDRG interface in Coot , the 3D graphical editor JLigand and the mechanisms for dealing with covalent linkages in the CCP 4 i 2 and CCP 4 Cloud environments. These integrated solutions streamline and ease the covalent-linkage modelling workflow, seamlessly transferring relevant information between programs. Current recommended practice is elucidated by means of instructive practical examples. By summarizing the different approaches to modelling linkages that are available within the CCP 4 suite, limitations and potential pitfalls that may be encountered are highlighted in order to raise awareness, with the intention of improving the quality of future modelled covalent linkages in macromolecular complexes.",

    "abstract": "Fixed-target serial crystallography has become an important method for the study of protein structure and dynamics at synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers. However, sample homogeneity, consumption and the physical stress on samples remain major challenges for these high-throughput experiments, which depend on high-quality protein microcrystals. The batch crystallization procedures that are typically applied require time- and sample-intensive screening and optimization. Here, a simple protein crystallization method inside the features of the HARE serial crystallography chips is reported that circumvents batch crystallization and allows the direct transfer of canonical vapor-diffusion conditions to in-chip crystallization. Based on conventional hanging-drop vapor-diffusion experiments, the crystallization solution is distributed into the wells of the HARE chip and equilibrated against a reservoir with mother liquor. Using this simple method, high-quality microcrystals were generated with sufficient density for the structure determination of four different proteins. A new protein variant was crystallized using the protein concentrations encountered during canonical crystallization experiments, enabling structure determination from ∼55 µg of protein. Additionally, structure determination from intracellular crystals grown in insect cells cultured directly in the features of the HARE chips is demonstrated. In cellulo crystallization represents a comparatively unexplored space in crystallization, especially for proteins that are resistant to crystallization using conventional techniques, and eliminates any need for laborious protein purification. This in-chip technique avoids harvesting the sensitive crystals or any further physical handling of the crystal-containing cells. These proof-of-principle experiments indicate the potential of this method to become a simple alternative to batch crystallization approaches and also as a convenient extension to canonical crystallization screens.",

    "abstract": "The brain-type fatty acid-binding protein FABP7, which is expressed in astrocytes and neural progenitors, is a member of the intracellular lipid-binding protein family. This protein is not only involved in various cellular functions such as metabolism, inflammation and energy homeostasis, but also in diseases such as cognitive disorders and tumors. Structures of unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid (OA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), bound to FABP7 have been elucidated; however, structures of saturated fatty acids bound to FABP7 remain unknown. To better understand fatty acid recognition, here the crystal structure of human brain-type fatty acid-binding protein FABP7 complexed with palmitic acid (PA), a saturated fatty acid, is reported at a resolution of 1.6 Å. The PA bound to the fatty acid-binding pocket of FABP7 assumed a U-shaped conformation. The carboxylate moiety of PA interacted with Tyr129, Arg127 and, via a water bridge, with Arg107 and Thr54, whereas its aliphatic chain was stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with Met21, Leu24, Thr30, Thr37, Pro39, Phe58 and Asp77. Structural comparison showed that PA, OA and DHA exhibited unique binding conformations in the fatty acid-binding pocket, stabilized by distinct amino-acid interactions. The binding of PA to FABP7 exhibits a unique binding conformation when compared with other human FABPs (FABP3-FABP5 and FABP8) expressed in other tissues. Based on the crystal and fatty acid structures, it was suggested that PA, which prefers a linear form in nature, required a greater conformational change in its aliphatic chain to bind to the fatty acid-binding pocket in a U-shaped conformation, compared with the cis configurations of OA or DHA. This, together with the length of the aliphatic chain, was considered to be one of the factors determining the binding affinity of PA to FABP7. These results provide a better understanding of fatty acid recognition by FABP7 and expand the knowledge of the binding of PA to FABPs.",

In this study, the novel α-glucosidase from Weissella cibaria BBK-1 ( Wc AG) was biochemically and structurally characterized. Wc AG belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) and to the neopullanase subfamily. It exhibits distinct hydrolytic activity towards the α-1,4 linkages of short-chain oligosaccharides from the reducing end. The enzyme prefers to hydrolyse maltotriose and acarbose, while it cannot hydrolyse cyclic oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. In addition, Wc AG can cleave pullulan hydrolysates and strongly exhibits transglycosylation activity in the presence of maltose. Size-exclusion chromatography and X-ray crystal structures revealed that Wc AG forms a homodimer in which the N-terminal domain of one monomer is orientated in proximity to the catalytic domain of another, creating the substrate-binding groove. Crystal structures of Wc AG in complexes with maltose, maltotriose and acarbose revealed a remarkable enzyme active site with accessible +2, +1 and −1 subsites, along with an Arg–Glu gate (Arg176–Glu296) in front of the active site. The −2 and −3 subsites were blocked by Met119 and Asn120 from the N-terminal domain of a different subunit, resulting in an extremely restricted substrate preference.",

    "abstract": "Protein-mediated redox reactions play a critical role in many biological processes and often occur at centres that contain metal ions as cofactors. In order to understand the exact mechanisms behind these reactions it is important to not only characterize the three-dimensional structures of these proteins and their cofactors, but also to identify the oxidation states of the cofactors involved and to correlate this knowledge with structural information. The only suitable approach for this based on crystallographic measurements is spatially resolved anomalous dispersion (SpReAD) refinement, a method that has been used previously to determine the redox states of metals in iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins. In this article, the feasibility of this approach for small, non-iron-sulfur redox centres is demonstrated by employing SpReAD analysis to characterize Sulfolobus tokodaii sulerythrin, a ruberythrin-like protein that contains a binuclear metal centre. Differences in oxidation states between the individual iron ions of the binuclear metal centre are revealed in sulerythrin crystals treated with H2O2. Furthermore, data collection at high X-ray doses leads to photoreduction of this metal centre, showing that careful control of the total absorbed dose is a prerequisite for successfully determining the oxidation state through SpReAD analysis.",

Here, a stable complex of cis-acting AT and ACP domains from the ninth module of the salinomycin mPKS was obtained using a maleimide cross-linker and the structure of the complex was determined at 2.6 Å resolution. The crystal structure shows that the AT in combination with the ketosynthase (KS)-to-AT linker forms a C-shaped architecture to embrace the ACP. The large hydrolase subdomain of the AT serves as a major binding platform for the ACP, while the small ferredoxin-like subdomain of the AT and the KS-to-AT linker cooperate with each other to constrain binding of the ACP. The importance of interface residues in cis-acting AT-ACP interactions was confirmed by mutagenesis assays. The interaction mode observed in the cis-acting AT-ACP complex is completely different from those observed in trans-acting AT-ACP complexes, where the ACP primarily contacts the small domain of the AT. The complex structure provides detailed mechanistic insights into AT-ACP recognition in cis-AT mPKSs.",

CbpD has recently been shown to be a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase active on chitin and to contribute substantially to virulence. To date, no structure of this virulence factor has been reported. Its first two domains are homologous to those found in the crystal structure of Vibrio cholerae GbpA, while the third domain is homologous to the NMR structure of the CBM73 domain of Cellvibrio japonicus Cj LPMO10A. Here, the 3.0 Å resolution crystal structure of CbpD solved by molecular replacement is reported, which required ab initio models of each CbpD domain generated by the artificial intelligence deep-learning structure-prediction algorithm RoseTTAFold . The structure of CbpD confirms some previously reported substrate-specificity motifs among LPMOAA10s, while challenging the predictive power of others. Additionally, the structure of CbpD shows that post-translational modifications occur on the chitin-binding surface. Moreover, the structure raises interesting possibilities about how type 2 secretion-system substrates may interact with the secretion machinery and demonstrates the utility of new artificial intelligence protein structure-prediction algorithms in making challenging structural targets tractable.",

Because the signal depends on local features, the signal and noise are analysed in local regions of the cryo-EM reconstruction. The likelihood analysis extends to prediction of the signal that will be achieved in any docking calculation for a model of specified quality and completeness.

By altering the ρ of the target solute and the solvent through judicious incorporation of deuterium, the scattering of desired solute features can be highlighted. Most contrast-variation methods focus on highlighting specific bulk solute elements, but not on how the scattering at specific scattering vectors q , which are associated with specific structural distances, changes with contrast. Indeed, many systems exhibit q -dependent contrast effects. Here, a method is presented for calculating both bulk contrast-match points and q -dependent contrast using 3D models with explicit solute and solvent atoms and SASSENA , an explicit-atom SANS calculator. The method calculates the bulk contrast-match points within 2.4% solvent D 2 O accuracy for test protein–nucleic acid and lipid nanodisc systems. The method incorporates a general model for the incorporation of deuterium at non-exchangeable sites that was derived by performing mass spectrometry on green fluorescent protein. The method also decomposes the scattering profile into its component parts and identifies structural features that change with contrast. The method is readily applicable to a variety of systems, will expand the understanding of q -dependent contrast matching and will aid in the optimization of next-generation neutron scattering experiments.",

Ester bonds are known to exist between glucuronic acid moieties on glucuronoxylan and lignin, and these can be cleaved by glucuronoyl esterases (GEs) from carbohydrate esterase family 15 (CE15). GEs are found in both bacteria and fungi, and some microorganisms also encode multiple GEs, although the reason for this is still not fully clear. The fungus Lentithecium fluviatile encodes three CE15 enzymes, of which two have previously been heterologously produced, although neither was active on the tested model substrate. Here, one of these, Lf CE15C, has been investigated in detail using a range of model and natural substrates and its structure has been solved using X-ray crystallography. No activity could be verified on any tested substrate, but biophysical assays indicate an ability to bind to complex carbohydrate ligands. The structure further suggests that this enzyme, which possesses an intact catalytic triad, might be able to bind and act on more extensively decorated xylan chains than has been reported for other CE15 members. It is speculated that rare glucuronoxylans decorated at the glucuronic acid moiety may be the true targets of Lf CE15C and other CE15 family members with similar sequence characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Atomic model refinement at low resolution is often a challenging task. This is mostly because the experimental data are not sufficiently detailed to be described by atomic models. To make refinement practical and ensure that a refined atomic model is geometrically meaningful, additional information needs to be used such as restraints on Ramachandran plot distributions or residue side-chain rotameric states. However, using Ramachandran plots or rotameric states as refinement targets diminishes the validating power of these tools. Therefore, finding additional model-validation criteria that are not used or are difficult to use as refinement goals is desirable. Hydrogen bonds are one of the important noncovalent interactions that shape and maintain protein structure. These interactions can be characterized by a specific geometry of hydrogen donor and acceptor atoms. Systematic analysis of these geometries performed for quality-filtered high-resolution models of proteins from the Protein Data Bank shows that they have a distinct and a conserved distribution. Here, it is demonstrated how this information can be used for atomic model validation.",

In recent years, high-resolution cryo-EM studies of complex I from various species have greatly enhanced the understanding of the structure and function of this important membrane-protein complex. Less well studied is the structural basis of complex I biogenesis. The assembly of this complex of more than 40 subunits, encoded by nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, is an intricate process that requires at least 20 different assembly factors in humans. These are proteins that are transiently associated with building blocks of the complex and are involved in the assembly process, but are not part of mature complex I. Although the assembly pathways have been studied extensively, there is limited information on the structure and molecular function of the assembly factors. Here, the insights that have been gained into the assembly process using cryo-EM are reviewed.",

Efficient high-throughput screening of batch-grown microcrystals and the determination of ground-state structures from different conditions is thus of considerable value in the early stages of a project. Here, a highly sample-efficient methodology to measure serial crystallography data from microcrystals by raster scanning within standard in situ 96-well crystallization plates is described. Structures were determined from very small quantities of microcrystal suspension and the results were compared with those from other sample-delivery methods. The analysis of a two-dimensional batch crystallization screen using this method is also described as a useful guide for further optimization and the selection of appropriate conditions for scaling up microcrystallization.",

    "abstract": "The detection of specific biological macromolecules in cryogenic electron tomography data is frequently approached by applying cross-correlation-based 3D template matching. To reduce computational cost and noise, high binning is used to aggregate voxels before template matching. This remains a prevalent practice in both practical applications and methods development. Here, the relation between template size, shape and angular sampling is systematically evaluated to identify ribosomes in a ground-truth annotated data set. It is shown that at the commonly used binning, a detailed subtomogram average, a sphere and a heart emoji result in near-identical performance. These findings indicate that with current template-matching practices macromolecules can only be detected with high precision if their shape and size are sufficiently different from the background. Using theoretical considerations, the experimental results are rationalized and it is discussed why primarily low-frequency information remains at high binning and that template matching fails to be accurate because similarly shaped and sized macromolecules have similar low-frequency spectra. These challenges are discussed and potential enhancements for future template-matching methodologies are proposed.",

    "abstract": "The interpretation of cryo-EM maps often includes the docking of known or predicted structures of the components, which is particularly useful when the map resolution is worse than 4 Å. Although it can be effective to search the entire map to find the best placement of a component, the process can be slow when the maps are large. However, frequently there is a well-founded hypothesis about where particular components are located. In such cases, a local search using a map subvolume will be much faster because the search volume is smaller, and more sensitive because optimizing the search volume for the rotation-search step enhances the signal to noise. A Fourier-space likelihood-based local search approach, based on the previously published em_placement software, has been implemented in the new emplace_local program. Tests confirm that the local search approach enhances the speed and sensitivity of the computations. An interactive graphical interface in the ChimeraX molecular-graphics program provides a convenient way to set up and evaluate docking calculations, particularly in defining the part of the map into which the components should be placed.",

    "abstract": "Proteins frequently undergo covalent modification at the post-translational level, which involves the covalent attachment of chemical groups onto amino acids. This can entail the singular or multiple addition of small groups, such as phosphorylation; long-chain modifications, such as glycosylation; small proteins, such as ubiquitination; as well as the interconversion of chemical groups, such as the formation of pyroglutamic acid. These post-translational modifications (PTMs) are essential for the normal functioning of cells, as they can alter the physicochemical properties of amino acids and therefore influence enzymatic activity, protein localization, protein–protein interactions and protein stability. Despite their inherent importance, accurately depicting PTMs in experimental studies of protein structures often poses a challenge. This review highlights the role of PTMs in protein structures, as well as the prevalence of PTMs in the Protein Data Bank, directing the reader to accurately built examples suitable for use as a modelling reference.",

In mammals, TIR domains are found in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic adaptor proteins involved in pro-inflammatory signaling. Previous work revealed that the MAL TIR domain (MAL TIR ) nucleates the assembly of MyD88 TIR into crystalline arrays in vitro . A microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) structure of the MyD88 TIR assembly has previously been solved, revealing a two-stranded higher-order assembly of TIR domains. In this work, it is demonstrated that the TIR domain of TLR2, which is reported to signal as a heterodimer with either TLR1 or TLR6, induces the formation of crystalline higher-order assemblies of MyD88 TIR in vitro , whereas TLR1 TIR and TLR6 TIR do not. Using an improved data-collection protocol, the MicroED structure of TLR2 TIR -induced MyD88 TIR microcrystals was determined at a higher resolution (2.85 Å) and with higher completeness (89%) compared with the previous structure of the MAL TIR -induced MyD88 TIR assembly. Both assemblies exhibit conformational differences in several areas that are important for signaling (for example the BB loop and CD loop) compared with their monomeric structures. These data suggest that TLR2 TIR and MAL TIR interact with MyD88 in an analogous manner during signaling, nucleating MyD88 TIR assemblies unidirectionally.",

Many structures can be solved routinely using raw models, structures processed to remove unreliable parts or models split into distinct structural units. There is therefore an open question around how many and which cases still require experimental phasing methods such as single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD). Here, this question is addressed using a large set of PDB depositions that were solved by SAD. A large majority (87%) could be solved using unedited or minimally edited AF2 predictions. A further 18 (4%) yield straightforwardly to MR after splitting of the AF2 prediction using Slice'N'Dice , although different splitting methods succeeded on slightly different sets of cases. It is also found that further unique targets can be solved by alternative modelling approaches such as ESMFold (four cases), alternative MR approaches such as ARCIMBOLDO and AMPLE (two cases each), and multimeric model building with AlphaFold-Multimer or UniFold (three cases). Ultimately, only 12 cases, or 3% of the SAD-phased set, did not yield to any form of MR tested here, offering valuable hints as to the number and the characteristics of cases where experimental phasing remains essential for macromolecular structure solution.",

Here, using OEC-omit, metal ion-omit and ligand-omit electron-density maps, it is shown that the number of oxygen ligands ranges from three in the functional OEC of monomer B following dark adaption (0F), i.e. in its ground state (PDB entry 6jlj/0F and PDB entry 6jlm/0F), to five for both monomers of PSII in photo-advanced states following exposure to one and two flashes of light. For a significant fraction of the 0F OECs in monomer A , the number is four (PDB entry 6jlj/0F). Following one flash it increases to five (PDB entry 6jlk/1F), where it remains after a second flash (PDB entry 6jlj/2F). Following a third flash (3F), it decreases to three (PDB entry 6jlp/3F), suggesting that an O 2 molecule has been produced. These observations suggest a mechanism for the reaction that transforms the O atoms of the water molecules bound at the O3 and O1 sites of the OEC into O 2 .",

The use of benzoyl-CoA as an endogenous substrate is unusual for type III PKSs. Moreover, sequence analyses indicate that the residues responsible for the functional diversification of type III PKSs are mutated in benzoic acid-specific type III PKSs. In order to gain a better understanding of structure–function relationships within the type III PKS family, the crystal structures of biphenyl synthase from Malus × domestica and benzophenone synthase from Hypericum androsaemum were compared with the structure of an archetypal type III PKS: chalcone synthase from Malus × domestica . Both biphenyl synthase and benzophenone synthase contain mutations that reshape their active-site cavities to prevent the binding of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and to favor the binding of small hydrophobic substrates. The active-site cavities of biphenyl synthase and benzophenone synthase also contain a novel pocket associated with their chain-elongation and cyclization reactions. Collectively, these results illuminate structural determinants of benzoic acid-specific type III PKSs and expand the understanding of the evolution of specialized metabolic pathways in plants.",

Type III pullulan hydrolase from Thermococcus kodakarensis (TK-PUL) possesses both pullulanase and α-amylase activities. Until now, only two enzymes in this class, which are capable of hydrolysing both α-1,4- and α-1,6-glycosidic bonds in pullulan to produce a mixture of maltose, panose and maltotriose, have been described. TK-PUL shows highest activity in the temperature range 95–100°C and has a pH optimum in the range 3.5–4.2. Its unique ability to hydrolyse maltotriose into maltose and glucose has not been reported for other homologous enzymes. The crystal structure of TK-PUL has been determined at a resolution of 2.8 Å and represents the first analysis of a type III pullulan hydrolyse. The structure reveals that the last part of the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain are significantly different from homologous structures. In addition, the loop regions at the active-site end of the central catalytic domain are quite different. The enzyme has a well defined calcium-binding site and possesses a rare vicinal disulfide bridge. The thermostability of TK-PUL and its homologues may be attributable to several factors, including the increased content of salt bridges, helical segments, Pro, Arg and Tyr residues and the decreased content of serine.",

Tp FCC was co-purified and co-crystallized with the dimeric copper-binding protein Tp CopC. The structure of the Tp FCC–( Tp CopC) 2 complex was determined by X-ray diffraction at 2.6 Å resolution. The flavin-binding subunit of Tp FCC is structurally similar to those determined previously, and the structure of the haem-binding subunit is similar to that of the N-terminal domain of dihaem FCCs. According to classification based on amino-acid sequence, Tp CopC belongs to a high-affinity CopC subfamily characterized by the presence of a conserved His1-Xxx-His3 motif at the N-terminus. Apparently, a unique α-helix which is present in each monomer of Tp CopC at the interface with Tp FCC plays a key role in complex formation. The structure of the copper-binding site in Tp CopC is similar to those in other known CopC structures. His3 is not involved in binding to the copper ion and is 6–7 Å away from this ion. Therefore, the His1-Xxx-His3 motif cannot be considered to be a key factor in the high affinity of CopC for copper(II) ions. It is suggested that the Tp FCC–( Tp CopC) 2 heterotetramer may be a component of a large periplasmic complex that is responsible for thiocyanate metabolism.",

In this work, crystallographic structures of the following have been solved: a truncated form of the third PDZ domain of the neuronal postsynaptic density protein 95 from which α3 has been removed, D332P and D332G variants of the protein, and a new crystal form of this domain showing the binding of Asp332 to the carboxylate-binding site of a symmetry-related molecule. Crystals of the wild type and variants were obtained in different space groups, which reflects the conformational plasticity of the domain. Indeed, the overall analysis of these structures suggests that the conformation of the β2-β3 loop is correlated with the fold acquired by α3. The alternate conformation of the β2-β3 loop affects the electrostatics of the carboxylate-binding site and might modulate the binding of different PDZ-binding motifs.",

    "abstract": "Pseudoenzymes have burst into the limelight recently as they provide another dimension to regulation of cellular protein activity. In the eudicot plant lineage, the pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 and its cognate enzyme PDX1.3 interact to regulate vitamin B6 biosynthesis. This partnership is important for plant fitness during environmental stress, in particular heat stress. PDX1.2 increases the catalytic activity of PDX1.3, with an overall increase in vitamin B6 biosynthesis. However, the mechanism by which this is achieved is not known. In this study, the Arabidopsis thaliana PDX1.2-PDX1.3 complex was crystallized in the absence and presence of ligands, and attempts were made to solve the X-ray structures. Three PDX1.2-PDX1.3 complex structures are presented: the PDX1.2-PDX1.3 complex as isolated, PDX1.2-PDX1.3-intermediate (in the presence of substrates) and a catalytically inactive complex, PDX1.2-PDX1.3-K97A. Data were also collected from a crystal of a selenomethionine-substituted complex, PDX1.2-PDX1.3-SeMet. In all cases the protein complexes assemble as dodecamers, similar to the recently reported individual PDX1.3 homomer. Intriguingly, the crystals of the protein complex are statistically disordered owing to the high degree of structural similarity of the individual PDX1 proteins, such that the resulting configuration is a composite of both proteins. Despite the differential methionine content, selenomethionine substitution of the PDX1.2-PDX1.3 complex did not resolve the problem. Furthermore, a comparison of the catalytically competent complex with a noncatalytic complex did not facilitate the resolution of the individual proteins. Interestingly, another catalytic lysine in PDX1.3 (Lys165) that pivots between the two active sites in PDX1 (P1 and P2), and the corresponding glutamine (Gln169) in PDX1.2, point towards P1, which is distinctive to the initial priming for catalytic action. This state was previously only observed upon trapping PDX1.3 in a catalytically operational state, as Lys165 points towards P2 in the resting state. Overall, the study shows that the integration of PDX1.2 into a heteromeric dodecamer assembly with PDX1.3 does not cause a major structural deviation from the overall architecture of the homomeric complex. Nonetheless, the structure of the PDX1.2-PDX1.3 complex highlights enhanced flexibility in key catalytic regions for the initial steps of vitamin B6 biosynthesis. This report highlights what may be an intrinsic limitation of X-ray crystallography in the structural investigation of pseudoenzymes.",

The C-terminal cap features a highly positively charged linear motif which was found to be largely disordered in this structure.

This observation has made CA IX a target for the development of CA isoform-selective inhibitors. To enable structural studies of CA IX–inhibitor complexes using X-ray and neutron crystallography, a CA IX surface variant (CA IX SV ; the catalytic domain with six surface amino-acid substitutions) has been developed that can be routinely crystallized. Here, the preparation of protiated (H/H), H/D-exchanged (H/D) and deuterated (D/D) CA IX SV for crystallographic studies and their structural comparison are described. Four CA IX SV X-ray crystal structures are compared: two H/H crystal forms, an H/D crystal form and a D/D crystal form. The overall active-site organization in each version is essentially the same, with only minor positional changes in active-site solvent, which may be owing to deuteration and/or resolution differences. Analysis of the crystal contacts and packing reveals different arrangements of CA IX SV compared with previous reports. To our knowledge, this is the first report comparing three different deuterium-labelled crystal structures of the same protein, marking an important step in validating the active-site structure of CA IX SV for neutron protein crystallography.",

In order to develop such a system, three crystal structures of designed armadillo-repeat proteins with third-generation N-caps (Y III -type), four or five internal repeats (M-type) and second-generation C-caps (A II -type) were determined at 1.8 Å (His-Y III M 4 A II ), 2.0 Å (His-Y III M 5 A II ) and 1.95 Å (Y III M 5 A II ) resolution and compared with those of variants with third-generation C-caps. All constructs are full consensus designs in which the internal repeats have exactly the same sequence, and hence identical conformations of the internal repeats are expected. The N-cap and internal repeats M 1 to M 3 are indeed extremely similar, but the comparison reveals structural differences in internal repeats M 4 and M 5 and the C-cap. These differences are caused by long-range effects of the C-cap, contacting molecules in the crystal, and the intrinsic design of the repeat. Unfortunately, the rigid-body movement of the C-terminal part impairs the regular arrangement of internal repeats that forms the putative peptide-binding site. The second-generation C-cap improves the packing of buried residues and thereby the stability of the protein. These considerations are useful for future improvements of an armadillo-repeat-based peptide-recognition system.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, the exchange of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm is highly selective and requires specialized soluble transport factors. Many of them belong to the importin-β superfamily, the members of which share an overall superhelical structure owing to the tandem arrangement of a specific motif, the HEAT repeat. This structural organization leads to great intrinsic flexibility, which in turn is a prerequisite for the interaction with a variety of proteins and for its transport function. During the passage from the aqueous cytosol into the nucleus, the receptor passes the gated channel of the nuclear pore complex filled with a protein meshwork of unknown organization, which seems to be highly selective owing to the presence of FG-repeats, which are peptides with hydrophobic patches. Here, the structural changes of free importin-β from a single organism, crystallized in polar (salt) or apolar (PEG) buffer conditions, are reported. This allowed analysis of the structural changes, which are attributable to the surrounding milieu and are not affected by bound interaction partners. The importin-β structures obtained exhibit significant conformational changes and suggest an influence of the polarity of the environment, resulting in an extended conformation in the PEG condition. The significance of this observation is supported by SAXS experiments and the analysis of other crystal structures of importin-β deposited in the Protein Data Bank.",

A crystal structure of the extracellular part of human interferon-γ receptor 2 (IFNγR2) was solved by molecular replacement at 1.8 Å resolution. Similar to other class 2 receptors, IFNγR2 has two fibronectin type III domains. The characteristic structural features of IFNγR2 are concentrated in its N-terminal domain: an extensive π–cation motif of stacked residues KWRWRH, a NAG–W–NAG sandwich (where NAG stands for N -acetyl-D-glucosamine) and finally a helix formed by residues 78–85, which is unique among class 2 receptors. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses showed the importance of N-linked glycosylation to the stability of the protein and confirmed the presence of two disulfide bonds. Structure-based bioinformatic analysis revealed independent evolutionary behaviour of both receptor domains and, together with multiple sequence alignment, identified putative binding sites for interferon-γ and receptor 1, the ligands of IFNγR2.",

    "abstract": "Neutron and X-ray reflectivity of model membranes is increasingly used as a tool for the study of membrane structures and dynamics. As the systems under study become more complex, and as long, all-atom molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of membranes become more available, there is increasing interest in the use of MD simulations in the analysis of reflectometry data from membranes. In order to perform this, it is necessary to produce a model of the complete interface, including not only the MD-derived structure of the membrane, but also the supporting substrate and any other interfacial layers that may be present. Here, it is shown that this is best performed by first producing a model of the occupied volume across the entire interface, and then converting this into a scattering length density (SLD) profile, rather than by splicing together the separate SLD profiles from the substrate layers and the membrane, since the latter approach can lead to discontinuities in the SLD profile and subsequent artefacts in the reflectivity calculation. It is also shown how the MD-derived membrane structure should be corrected to account for lower than optimal coverage and out-of-plane membrane fluctuations. Finally, the method of including the entire membrane structure in the reflectivity calculation is compared with an alternative approach in which the membrane components are approximated by functional forms, with only the component volumes being extracted from the simulation. It is shown that using only the fragment volumes is insufficient for a typical neutron data set of a single deuteration measured at several water contrasts, and that either weighting the model by including more structural information from the fit, or a larger data set involving a range of deuterations, are required to satisfactorily define the problem.",

An exonuclease domain is found in the Arenaviridae nucleoprotein and targets dsRNA specifically. This domain is directly involved in suppression of innate immunity in the host cell. Like most phosphate-processing enzymes, it requires a divalent metal ion such as Mg 2+ (or Mn 2+ ) as a cofactor to catalyse nucleotide-cleavage and nucleotide-transfer reactions. On the other hand, calcium (Ca 2+ ) inhibits this enzymatic activity, in spite of the fact that Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ present comparable binding affinities and biological availabilities. Here, the molecular and structural effects of the replacement of magnesium by calcium and its inhibition mechanism for phosphodiester cleavage, an essential reaction in the viral process of innate immunity suppression, are studied. Biochemical data and high-resolution structures of the Mopeia virus exonuclease domain complexed with each ion are reported for the first time. The consequences of the ion swap for the stability of the protein, the catalytic site and the functional role of a specific metal ion in enabling the catalytic cleavage of a dsRNA substrate are outlined.",

The crystal structure of a fragment encompassing the first four FNIII domains (LARFN1-4) showed a characteristic L shape.

    "abstract": "Crystallographic refinement of macromolecular structures relies on stereochemical restraints to mitigate the typically poor data-to-parameter ratio. For proteins, each amino acid has a unique set of geometry restraints which represent stereochemical information such as bond lengths, valence angles, torsion angles, dihedrals and planes. It has been shown that the geometry in refined structures can differ significantly from that present in libraries; for example, it was recently reported that the guanidinium moiety in arginine is not symmetric. In this work, the asymmetry of the N ɛ —C ζ —N η1 and N ɛ —C ζ —N η2 valence angles in the guanidinium moiety is confirmed. In addition, it was found that the C δ atom can deviate significantly (more than 20°) from the guanidinium plane. This requires the relaxation of the planar restraint for the C δ atom, as it otherwise causes the other atoms in the group to compensate by distorting the guanidinium core plane. A new set of restraints for the arginine side chain have therefore been formulated, and are available in the software package Phenix , that take into account the asymmetry of the group and the planar deviation of the C δ atom. This is an example of the need to regularly revisit the geometric restraint libraries used in macromolecular refinement so that they reflect the best knowledge of the structural chemistry of their components available at the time.",

    "abstract": "Tannases are serine esterases that were first discovered in fungi more than one and half centuries ago. They catalyze the hydrolysis of the gallolyl ester bonds in gallotannins to release gallic acid, which is an important intermediate in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Since their discovery, fungal tannases have found wide industrial applications, although there is scarce knowledge about these enzymes at the molecular level, including their catalytic and substrate-binding sites. While this lack of knowledge hinders engineering efforts to modify the enzymes, many tannases have been isolated from various fungal strains in a search for the desired enzymatic properties. Here, the first crystal structure of a fungal tannase, that from Aspergillus niger , is reported. The enzyme possesses a typical α/β-hydrolase-fold domain with a large inserted cap domain, which together form a bowl-shaped hemispherical shape with a surface concavity surrounded by N-linked glycans. Gallic acid is bound at the junction of the two domains within the concavity by forming two hydrogen-bonding networks with neighbouring residues. One is formed around the carboxyl group of the gallic acid and involves residues from the hydrolase-fold domain, including those from the catalytic triad, which consists of Ser206, His485 and Asp439. The other is formed around the three hydroxyl groups of the compound, with the involvement of residues mainly from the cap domain, including Gln238, Gln239, His242 and Ser441. Gallic acid is bound in a sandwich-like mode by forming a hydrophobic contact with Ile442. All of these residues are found to be highly conserved among fungal and yeast tannases.",

    "abstract": "Microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) has recently emerged as a promising method for macromolecular structure determination in structural biology. Since the first protein structure was determined in 2013, the method has been evolving rapidly. Several protein structures have been determined and various studies indicate that MicroED is capable of (i) revealing atomic structures with charges, (ii) solving new protein structures by molecular replacement, (iii) visualizing ligand-binding interactions and (iv) determining membrane-protein structures from microcrystals embedded in lipidic mesophases. However, further development and optimization is required to make MicroED experiments more accurate and more accessible to the structural biology community. Here, we provide an overview of the current status of the field, and highlight the ongoing development, to provide an indication of where the field may be going in the coming years. We anticipate that MicroED will become a robust method for macromolecular structure determination, complementing existing methods in structural biology.",

New validation routines are also presented, including a metric for Watson–Crick base-pair geometry normality ( Z bpG ). Applying the PDB-REDO pipeline with the new restraint model to the whole Protein Data Bank (PDB) demonstrates an overall positive effect on the quality of nucleic acid-containing structure models. Finally, we discuss examples of improvements in the geometry of specific nucleic acid structures in the PDB. The new PDB-REDO models and pipeline are available at https://pdb-redo.eu/.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a dramatic improvement in the quality and quantity of data derived using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This is also associated with a large increase in the number of atomic models built. Although the best resolutions that are achievable are improving, often the local resolution is variable, and a significant majority of data are still resolved at resolutions worse than 3 Å. Model building and refinement is often challenging at these resolutions, and hence atomic model validation becomes even more crucial to identify less reliable regions of the model. Here, a graphical user interface for atomic model validation, implemented in the CCP-EM software suite, is presented. It is aimed to develop this into a platform where users can access multiple complementary validation metrics that work across a range of resolutions and obtain a summary of evaluations. Based on the validation estimates from atomic models associated with cryo-EM structures from SARS-CoV-2, it was observed that models typically favor adopting the most common conformations over fitting the observations when compared with the model agreement with data. At low resolutions, the stereochemical quality may be favored over data fit, but care should be taken to ensure that the model agrees with the data in terms of resolvable features. It is demonstrated that further re-refinement can lead to improvement of the agreement with data without the loss of geometric quality. This also highlights the need for improved resolution-dependent weight optimization in model refinement and an effective test for overfitting that would help to guide the refinement process.",

    "abstract": "Restraint dictionaries are used during macromolecular structure refinement to encapsulate intramolecular connectivity and geometric information. These dictionaries allow previously determined `ideal' values of features such as bond lengths, angles and torsions to be used as restraint targets. During refinement, restraints influence the model to adopt a conformation that agrees with prior observation. This is especially important when refining crystal structures of glycosylated proteins, as their resolutions tend to be worse than those of nonglycosylated proteins. Pyranosides, the overwhelming majority component in all forms of protein glycosylation, often display conformational errors in crystal structures. Whilst many of these flaws usually relate to model building, refinement issues may also have their root in suboptimal restraint dictionaries. In order to avoid subsequent misinterpretation and to improve the quality of all pyranose monosaccharide entries in the CCP4 Monomer Library, new dictionaries with improved ring torsion restraints, coordinates reflecting the lowest-energy ring pucker and updated geometry have been produced and evaluated. These new dictionaries are now part of the CCP4 Monomer Library and will be released with CCP4 version 8.0.",

To address this issue, Coarse-grained Secondary Structure of RNA ( CSSR ), an algorithm for the assignment of rSS for structures in which nucleobase atomic positions are incomplete, has been developed. Using CSSR , an rSS assignment accuracy of ∼90% is achieved even for RNA structures in which only one backbone atom per nucleotide is known. Thus, CSSR will be useful for the analysis of experimentally determined and computationally predicted RNA 3D structures alike.

    "abstract": "The availability of atomic resolution experimental maps of electrostatic potential from 3D electron diffraction (3D ED) extends the possibility of investigating the electrostatic potential beyond the determination of non-H-atom positions. However, accurate tools to calculate this potential for macromolecules, without the use of expensive quantum calculations, are lacking. The University at Buffalo Data Bank (UBDB) gathers atom types that can be used to calculate accurate electrostatic potential maps via structure-factor calculations. Here, the transferable aspherical atom model (TAAM) is applied with UBDB to investigate theoretically obtained electrostatic potential maps of lysozyme and proteinase K, and compare them with experimental maps from 3D ED. UBDB better reproduces the molecular electrostatic potential of molecules within their entire volume compared with the neutral spherical models used in the popular independent atom model (IAM). Additionally, the theoretical electron-density maps of the studied proteins are shown and compared with the electrostatic potential maps. The atomic displacement parameters ( B factors) may affect the electrostatic potential maps in a different way than in the case of electron-density maps. The computational method presented in this study could potentially facilitate the interpretation of the less resolved regions of cryo-electron microscopy density maps and pave the way for distinguishing between different ions/water molecules in the active sites of macromolecules in high-resolution structures, which is of interest for drug-design purposes.",

Many microorganisms also secrete enzymes that are capable of remodelling or degrading EPS in response to various environmental cues. One key enzyme class is the poly-β-1,6-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (PNAG)-degrading glycoside hydrolases, of which the canonical member is dispersin B (DspB) from CAZy family GH20. We sought to test the hypothesis that PNAG-degrading enzymes would be present across family GH20, resulting in expansion of the sequence and structural space and thus the availability of PNAGases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that several microorganisms contain potential DspB-like enzymes. Six of these were expressed and characterized, and four crystal structures were determined (two of which were in complex with the established GH20 inhibitor 6-acetamido-6-deoxy-castanospermine and one with a bespoke disaccharide β-1,6-linked thiazoline inhibitor). One enzyme expressed rather poorly, which restricted crystal screening and did not allow activity measurements. Using synthetic PNAG oligomers and MALDI-TOF analysis, two of the five enzymes tested showed preferential endo hydrolytic activity. Their sequences, having only 26% identity to the pioneer enzyme DspB, highlight the considerable array of previously unconsidered dispersins in nature, greatly expanding the range of potential dispersin backbones available for societal application and engineering.",

    "abstract": "Green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PCFPs) serve as key players in single-molecule localization super-resolution imaging. As an early engineered variant, mEos3.2 has limited applications, mostly due to its slow maturation rate. The recent advent of a novel variant, pcStar, obtained by the simple mutation of only three amino acids (D28E/L93M/N166G) in mEos3.2, exhibits significantly accelerated maturation and enhanced fluorescent brightness. This improvement represents an important advance in the field of biofluorescence by enabling early detection with reliable signals, essential for labelling dynamic biological processes. However, the mechanism underlying the significant improvement in fluorescent performance from mEos3.2 to pcStar remains elusive, preventing the rational design of more robust variants through mutagenesis. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of mEos3.2 and pcStar in their green states at atomic resolution and performed molecular-dynamics simulations to reveal significant divergences between the two proteins. Our structural and computational analyses revealed crucial features that are distinctively present in pcStar, including the presence of an extra solvent molecule, high conformational stability and enhanced interactions of the chromophore with its surroundings, tighter tertiary-structure packing and dynamic central-helical deformation. Resulting from the triple mutations, all of these structural features are likely to establish a mechanistic link to the greatly improved fluorescent performance of pcStar. The data described here not only provide a good example illustrating how distant amino-acid substitutions can affect the structure and bioactivity of a protein, but also give rise to strategic considerations for the future engineering of more widely applicable PCFPs.",

    "abstract": "The surface protein P113 serves as a membrane-anchored protein that tethers the Plasmodium falciparum RH5 complex, including its associated partners CyRPA and RIPR, to the parasite surface. This anchoring mechanism ensures the proper localization and stabilization of RH5, facilitating its critical interaction with the host erythrocyte receptor basigin during erythrocyte invasion. Here, the helical-rich domain of P113 (residues 311–679) from a Plasmodium species was expressed, purified and crystallized to elucidate its structural and functional characteristics. The recombinant protein, with a molecular weight of approximately 44 kDa, was confirmed to be monomeric in solution. Crystallization in 0.5 m M MES pH 6.0, 22% PEG 3350 yielded high-quality crystals, enabling the determination of the structure of the apo form at 1.7 Å resolution. The structure revealed a predominant α-helical composition, with two distinct left-handed orthogonal four-helix bundles formed by helices α1–α4 and α6–α9 connected by a disordered region. Sequence analysis demonstrated high conservation of P113 across all human-infecting Plasmodium species, including P. vivax , P. malariae , P. falciparum and P. ovale , as well as in Plasmodium species infecting primates and rodents. Protein–protein interaction analysis using the STRING tool identified P113 as a hub protein that interacts with ten proteins, including small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, DNA polymerase delta small subunit and RIPR, which is part of the RH5–CyRPA–RIPR complex. AlphaFold predictions further elucidated the interaction patterns, revealing moderate to strong interaction scores (0.39–0.74) with key partners. Notably, the helical-rich domain of P113 was identified as the critical binding region for PF3D7_0308000, with key interaction sites mapped to residues Asp475, Arg381, Lys386, Asn390, Asp392 and Lys533. These findings provide critical insights into the structural and functional roles of P113 and its interaction network, advancing our understanding of its molecular mechanisms in Plasmodium biology.",

    "abstract": "Common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) encodes three class 2 L-asparaginase enzymes: two potassium-dependent enzymes [PvAIII(K)-1 and PvAIII(K)-2] and a potassium-independent enzyme (PvAIII). Here, we present the crystal structure of PvAIII, which displays a rare P 2 space-group symmetry and a unique pseudosymmetric 4 1 -like double-helical packing. The asymmetric unit contains 32 protein chains (16 αβ units labeled A – P ) organized into two right-handed coiled arrangements, each consisting of four PvAIII (αβ) 2 dimers. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure revealed that this unusual packing originates from three factors: (i) the ability of the PvAIII molecules to form extended intermolecular β-sheets, a feature enabled by the PvAIII sequence and secondary structure, (ii) incomplete degradation of the flexible linker remaining at the C-terminus of α subunits of protein chain C after the autoproteolytic cleavage (maturation) of the PvAIII precursor and (iii) intermolecular entanglement between protein chains from the two helices to create `hydrogen-bond linchpins' that connect adjacent protein chains. The K m value of PvAIII for L-asparagine is approximately five times higher than for β-peptides, suggesting that the physiological role of PvAIII may be more related to the removal of toxic β-peptides than to basic L-asparagine metabolism. A comparison of the active sites of PvAIII and PvAIII(K)-1 shows that the proteins have nearly identical residues in the catalytic center, except for Thr219, which is unique to PvAIII. To test whether the residue type at position 219 affects the enzymatic activity of PvAIII, we designed and produced a T219S mutant. The kinetic parameters determined for L-asparagine hydrolysis indicate that the T/S residue type at position 219 does not affect the L-asparaginase activity of PvAIII.",

Spectroscopic studies performed on dark-adapted PSII samples have led to two mutually incompatible hypotheses about the oxidation states of these manganese ions: Mn(III) 4 or Mn(III) 2 Mn(IV) 2 . It should be possible to determine which is correct crystallographically because they differ in their implications for manganese–ligand bond lengths and coordination geometries. Reported here are the results of a detailed analysis of the electron density in the Mn 4 Ca region of OEC-omit maps derived from a set of published X-ray crystal structures of dark-adapted PSII, the data for which were collected using three different X-ray doses so that the effects of radiation damage could be assessed. This analysis supports the conclusion that Mn(III) 4 is correct and that all of the Mn(III) ions in the OEC are square-pyramidally coordinated, i.e. pentadentate. It is further evident that the oxygen ligand sites in these complexes are not fully occupied, and that occupancies vary from one PSII sample to the next. The average occupancies per oxygen ligand site ranged from 0.74 to 0.86 in the set of PSII samples analyzed here. Because fewer than 1% of the OECs were reported as having been damaged in the lowest dose structure, the oxidation number of the manganese ions in X-ray-naïve, dark-adapted OECs would appear to be Mn(III) 4 . The geometry of the protein component of PSII, which controls inter-manganese distances in the OEC, suggests a reverse four-step/four-chamber combustion engine mechanism for O=O bond formation.",

Using isomorphous crystals of bovine, porcine and human insulin, the existing clustering methods in the multi-crystal processing software xia 2. multiplex were validated and their limits were tested.

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional X-ray mesh (raster) scans are broadly used in macromolecular crystallography to identify positions on the sample holder at which diffraction images can be collected. Based on a single mesh scan, the commonly known method Mesh&amp;Collect allows the collection of small angular wedges of diffraction data from multiple crystals identified in the mesh-scan area. Recently, the capabilities of the method have been extended by using two mesh scans instead of one. The scans are usually performed at orthogonal orientations of the rotation axis, or any other angular difference less than 90° can be used. This allows the more accurate determination, when compared with a single mesh scan, of the 3D centre positions of each crystal contained in the scanned area and gives better estimates of their dimensions and diffraction qualities. We present the upgraded DoubleMesh&amp;Collect method based on the Dozor , Dozor-m 2 and Resheteau software programs which automatically analyse the diffraction images of the two mesh scans. The applicability of the method is demonstrated on several cases, including room-temperature diffraction studies. The problem of cartography of large crystals is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Factor XIIa (FXIIa) is generated from its zymogen factor XII (FXII) by contact with polyanions such as inorganic polyphosphates. FXIIa cleaves the substrates prekallikrein and factor XI, triggering inflammatory cascades and plasma coagulation. From the N-terminus, FXII has fibronectin type II (FnII), epidermal growth factor-1 (EGF1), fibronectin type I (FnI), EGF2 and kringle domains. The N-terminal domains of FXII mediate polyanion and Zn 2+ binding. To understand how ligand binding to polyanions and Zn 2+ is coordinated across multiple domains, we determined the crystal structure of recombinant FXII domains 1–5 (FXII HC5 ) to 3.4 Å resolution. A separate crystal structure of the isolated FXII FnII domain at 1.2 Å resolution revealed two bound Zn 2+ ions. In FXII HC5 a head-to-tail interaction is formed between the FnII and kringle domains, co-localizing the lysine-binding sites of the kringle domain and the cation-binding site of the FnII domain. Two FXII HC5 monomers interlock, burying a large surface area of 2067 Å 2 , such that two kringle domains point outwards separated by a distance of 20 Å. The polyanion-binding site in the EGF1 domain is localized onto a plane together with the FnII and FnI domains. Using native mass spectrometry, we detected a major FXII HC5 monomer peak and a minor dimer peak. Small-angle X-ray scattering and gel-filtration chromatography revealed the presence of monomers and dimers in solution. These FXII N-terminal domain structures provide a holistic framework to understand how the mosaic domain structure of FXII assembles diverse ligand-binding sites in three dimensions.",

    "abstract": "The proteins SFPQ (splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich) and NONO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) are members of the Drosophila behaviour/human splicing (DBHS) protein family, sharing 76% sequence identity in their conserved DBHS domain. These proteins are critical for elements of pre- and post-transcriptional regulation in mammals and are primarily located in paraspeckles: ribonucleoprotein bodies templated by NEAT1 long noncoding RNA. Regions that are structured and predicted to be disordered (IDRs) in DBHS proteins facilitate various interactions, including dimerization, polymerization, nucleic acid binding and liquid–liquid phase separation, all of which have consequences for cell health, the pathology of some neurological diseases and cancer. To date, very limited structural work has been carried out on characterizing the IDRs of the DBHS proteins, largely due to their predicted disordered nature and the fact that this is often a bottleneck for conventional structural techniques. This is a problem worth addressing, as the IDRs have been shown to be critical to the material state of the protein as well as its function. In this study, we used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), together with lysine cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), to investigate the regions of SFPQ flanking the structured DBHS domain and the possibility of dimer partner exchange of full-length proteins. Our results demonstrate experimentally that the N- and C-terminal regions on either side of the folded DBHS domain are long, disordered and flexible in solution. Realistic modelling of disordered chains to fit the scattering data and the compaction of the different protein variants suggests that it is physically possible for the IDRs to be close enough to interact. The mass-spectrometry data additionally indicate that the C-terminal IDR can potentially interact with the folded DBHS domain and also shares some conformational space with the N-terminal IDR. Our small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments reveal that full-length SFPQ is capable of swapping dimer partners with itself, which has implications for our understanding of the combinatorial dimerization of DBHS proteins within cells. Our study provides insight into possible interactions between different IDRs either in cis or in trans and how these may relate to protein function, and the possible impact of mutations in these regions. The dynamic dimer partner exchange of a full-length protein inferred from this study is a phenomenon that is integral to the function of DBHS proteins, allowing changes in gene-regulatory activity by altering levels of the various heterodimers or homodimers.",

This large-scale inverse problem requires the determination of many million degrees of freedom from extremely noisy experimental measurements. Here, we introduce a new approach to probabilistic multi-volume ab initio 3D reconstruction for simultaneous estimation of the relative particle 3D orientations and partitioning of the particles into groups with distinct structural states. To account for further structural variability within the discrete state groups, due to for example regional disorder, flexibility or partial occupancy of associating ligands, we introduce a new method for adaptive non-uniform regularization based on iterated conditional modes (ICMs). Our ICM regularization approach can be viewed as a spatially varying real-space prior that optimizes the connectivity of the reconstructed density map(s). Our method is designed to run in real time as the microscope collects the data, which puts significant constraints on algorithm scalability and flexibility with regard to how new particles are incorporated. We describe the probabilistic optimization and non-uniform regularization theory in detail. Finally, we provide numerous benchmarking examples, both on publicly available standard test data sets and on data sets acquired at our cryo-EM facility at the National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health. The implementation of our new multi-volume ab initio 3D reconstruction approach is part of the SIMPLE software suite, which is provided open source at https://github.com/hael/SIMPLE.",

In addition to visual inspection of such maps and models, quantitative metrics can inform about the reliability of the atomic coordinates, in particular how well the model is supported by the experimentally determined 3DEM map. A recently introduced metric, Q-score, was shown to correlate well with the reported resolution of the map for well fitted models. Here, we present new statistical analyses of Q-score based on its application to ∼10 000 maps and models archived in the EMDB (Electron Microscopy Data Bank) and PDB (Protein Data Bank). Further, we introduce two new metrics based on Q-score to represent each map and model relative to all entries in the EMDB and those with similar resolution. We explore through illustrative examples of proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules how Q-scores can indicate whether the atomic coordinates are well fitted to 3DEM maps and also whether some parts of a map may be poorly resolved due to factors such as molecular flexibility, radiation damage and/or conformational heterogeneity. These examples and statistical analyses provide a basis for how Q-scores can be interpreted effectively in order to evaluate 3DEM maps and atomic coordinate models prior to publication and archiving.",

    "abstract": "β 2 -Microglobulin (β 2 M) is an essential component of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, with a well established canonical role in immune surveillance. Beyond its classical functions, accumulating evidence has highlighted β 2 M as a multifaceted biomarker, with elevated serum levels closely associated with disease burden and prognosis in metabolic disorders, malignancies, autoimmune diseases and central nervous system conditions. In this study, we resolved the crystal structure of human β 2 M in complex with the mouse monoclonal antibody BBM.1 at 2.50 Å resolution using X-ray crystallography. Structural analysis revealed that BBM.1 binds β 2 M through multiple CDRs, recognizing key surface residues including Glu36, Asp38, Lys41, Asn42, Glu44, Arg45, Glu47 and Arg81. The interaction is anchored by a central hydrophobic core formed by Trp32 (light chain), Trp99 (heavy chain) and Ile92 (β 2 M), which is deeply buried in the interface. Surrounding this core is a well organized polar interaction network composed of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, primarily involving β 2 M residues Lys41, Glu44, Arg45 and Glu47. Notably, the Arg45 residue deeply embeds into the antibody-binding pocket, forming several crucial interactions. These findings not only validate previous biochemical and mutational data but also identify new epitope residues, providing a structural foundation for the development and optimization of precision therapeutic strategies targeting β 2 M.",

Here, we have developed a comprehensive validation process that examines the consistency of these parameters by combining high-throughput computational evaluation with manual verification.

These systems maintain proteostasis by facilitating membrane-protein insertion, folding and degradation. To gain structural insights into a putative complex formed by FtsH and YidC, we performed single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy on detergent-solubilized membrane samples, from which FtsH and YidC were purified using Ni-NTA affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Although SDS-PAGE analysis indicated high purity of these proteins, cryo-EM data sets unexpectedly yielded high-resolution structures of ArnA and AcrB at 4.0 and 2.9 Å resolution, respectively. ArnA is a bifunctional enzyme involved in lipid A modification and polymyxin resistance, while AcrB is a multidrug efflux transporter of the AcrAB-TolC system. ArnA and AcrB, known Ni-NTA purification contaminants, were also consistently detected by mass spectrometry in Strep-Tactin affinity-purified samples, validating their presence independently of affinity-tag selection. ArnA, which is typically cytoplasmic, was consistently found in membrane-isolated samples, indicating an association with membrane components. Only 2D class averages corresponding to the cytoplasmic AAA+ domain of FtsH were observed; neither side views of full-length FtsH nor densities corresponding to an intact FtsH-YidC complex could be identified, due to the conformational flexibility of the FtsH complex and its transient interaction with YidC, which limited particle alignment and stable classification in cryo-EM data sets. Two-dimensional class averages revealed additional particles resembling GroEL and cytochrome bo3 oxidase. These results underscore the utility of cryo-EM in uncovering off-target yet structurally well defined complexes, which may reflect physiologically relevant interactions or purification biases during membrane-protein overexpression.",

These predictions, especially for eukaryotic proteins, frequently contain extensive regions predicted below the pLDDT = 70 level, the rule-of-thumb cutoff for high confidence. This work identifies major modes of behavior within low-pLDDT regions through a survey of human proteome predictions provided by the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database. The near-predictive mode resembles folded protein and can be a nearly accurate prediction. Barbed wire is extremely unprotein-like, being recognized by wide looping coils, an absence of packing contacts and numerous signature validation outliers, and it represents a region where the conformation has no predictive value. Pseudostructure presents an intermediate behavior with a misleading appearance of isolated and badly formed secondary-structure-like elements. These prediction modes are compared with annotations of disorder from MobiDB, showing general correlation between barbed wire/pseudostructure and many measures of disorder, an association between pseudostructure and signal peptides, and an association between near-predictive and regions of conditional folding. To enable users to identify these regions within a prediction, a new Phenix tool is developed encompassing the results of this work, including prediction annotation, visual markup and residue selection based on these prediction modes. This tool will help users develop expertise in interpreting difficult AlphaFold predictions and identify the near-predictive regions that can aid in molecular replacement when a prediction does not contain enough high-pLDDT regions.",

    "abstract": "Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) is an enzyme that converts methane into methanol at ambient temperature and pressure. Over the past three decades, the metal content and location of the active site have been highly controversial. Recent single-particle cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have furthered this debate. In this study, three cryo-EM structures (PDB entries 7s4h, 7s4j and 7ev9) are analysed by quantum refinement (QR). This approach augments traditional structural refinement with quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations for a small but interesting part of the protein (in this case, the copper sites). Our results indicate that the bis-His (Cu A ) site is correctly modelled as a mononuclear copper site in all three structures. The His-brace (Cu B ) site is also best modelled as mononuclear in all structures, although it was suggested to be a binuclear site in PDB entry 7ev9. The Cu C site, which is observed only in PDB entry 7s4j, is correctly modelled and is probably reduced in the structure. The Cu D putative active site, observed only in PDB entry 7s4h, is also mononuclear, but a water molecule might at least intermittently coordinate to the copper ion. On the other hand, our study does not find any support for the five additional copper ions suggested to be present in PDB entry 7ev9, including the suggested trinuclear active site and two sites in the so-called copper sponge. Instead, more chemically reasonable structures and better fit to both the cryo-EM and QM data are obtained if these copper ions are replaced with water molecules. This study illustrates the potential of QR as a standard component of cryo-EM studies for metal sites, for which reliable empirical restraints are missing.",

    "abstract": "Real macromolecular crystals can be non-ideal in a myriad of ways. This often creates challenges for structure determination, while also offering opportunities for greater insight into the crystalline state and the dynamic behavior of macromolecules. To evaluate whether different parts of a single crystal of a dynamic protein, EutL, might be informative about crystal and protein polymorphism, a microfocus X-ray synchrotron beam was used to collect a series of 18 separate data sets from non-overlapping regions of the same crystal specimen. A principal component analysis (PCA) approach was employed to compare the structure factors and unit cells across the data sets, and it was found that the 18 data sets separated into two distinct groups, with large R values (in the 40% range) and significant unit-cell variations between the members of the two groups. This categorization mapped the different data-set types to distinct regions of the crystal specimen. Atomic models of EutL were then refined against two different data sets obtained by separately merging data from the two distinct groups. A comparison of the two resulting models revealed minor but discernable differences in certain segments of the protein structure, and regions of higher deviation were found to correlate with regions where larger dynamic motions were predicted to occur by normal-mode molecular-dynamics simulations. The findings emphasize that large spatially dependent variations may be present across individual macromolecular crystals. This information can be uncovered by simultaneous analysis of multiple partial data sets and can be exploited to reveal new insights about protein dynamics, while also improving the accuracy of the structure-factor data ultimately obtained in X-ray diffraction experiments.",

Alternatively, ADPs can be obtained numerically from the parameters of concerted atomic motions corresponding to the TLS matrices.

    "abstract": "Tryptophan indole-lyase (TIL) is a bacterial enzyme which catalyzes the reversible formation of indole and ammonium pyruvate from L-tryptophan. Oxindolyl-L-alanine (OIA) is an inhibitor of TIL, with a K i value of about 5 µ M . The crystal structure of the complex of Proteus vulgaris TIL with OIA has now been determined at 2.1 Å resolution. The ligand forms a closed quinonoid complex with the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor. The small domain rotates about 10° to close the active site, bringing His458 into position to donate a hydrogen bond to Asp133, which also accepts a hydrogen bond from the heterocyclic NH of the inhibitor. This brings Phe37 and Phe459 into van der Waals contact with the aromatic ring of OIA. Mutation of the homologous Phe464 in Escherichia coli TIL to Ala results in a 500-fold decrease in k cat / K m for L-tryptophan, with less effect on the reaction of other nonphysiological β-elimination substrates. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments of F464A TIL show that the mutation has no effect on the formation of quinonoid intermediates. An aminoacrylate intermediate is observed in the reaction of F464A TIL with S -ethyl-L-cysteine and benzimidazole. A model of the L-tryptophan quinonoid complex with PLP in the active site of P. vulgaris TIL shows that there would be a severe clash of Phe459 (∼1.5 Å apart) and Phe37 (∼2 Å apart) with the benzene ring of the substrate. It is proposed that this creates distortion of the substrate aromatic ring out of plane and moves the substrate upwards on the reaction coordinate towards the transition state, thus reducing the activation energy and accelerating the enzymatic reaction.",

    "abstract": "Despite the DNA duplex being central to biological functions, many intricacies of this molecule, including the dynamic nature of mismatched base pairing, are still unknown. The unique conformations adopted by DNA mismatches can provide insight into the forces at play between nucleotides. Moreover, DNA-binding proteins apply their own individualized steric and electrochemical influences on the nucleotides that they interact with, further altering base-pairing conformations. Here, seven X-ray crystallographic structures of the human nuclease apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 1 (APE1) in complex with its substrate target flanked by a 5′ mismatch are reported. The structures reveal how APE1 influences the conformations of a variety of different mismatched base pairs. Purine–purine mismatches containing a guanine are stabilized by a rotation of the guanine residue about the N-glycosidic bond to utilize the Hoogsteen edge for hydrogen bonding. Interestingly, no rotation of adenine, the other purine, is observed. Mismatches involving both purine and pyrimidine bases adopt wobble conformations to accommodate the mismatch. Pyrimidine–pyrimidine mismatches also wobble; however, the smaller profile of a pyrimidine base results in a gap between the Watson–Crick faces that is reduced by a C1′–C1′ compression. These results advance our understanding of mismatched base pairing and the influence of a bound protein.",

    "abstract": "Two of the world's most neglected tropical diseases, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Chagas disease, are caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Trypanosoma . These organisms possess specialized metabolic pathways, frequently distinct from those in humans, which have potential to be exploited as novel drug targets. This study elucidates the structure and function of L-threonine-3-dehydrogenase (TDH) from T. brucei , the causative pathogen of HAT. TDH is a key enzyme in the metabolism of L-threonine, and an inhibitor of TDH has been shown to have trypanocidal activity in the procyclic form of T. brucei . TDH is a nonfunctional pseudogene in humans, suggesting that it may be possible to rationally design safe and specific therapies for trypanosomiasis by targeting this parasite enzyme. As an initial step, the TDH gene from T. brucei was expressed and the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme was solved by X-ray crystallography. In multiple crystallographic structures, T. brucei TDH is revealed to be a dimeric short-chain dehydrogenase that displays a considerable degree of conformational variation in its ligand-binding regions. Geometric simulations of the structure have provided insight into the dynamic behaviour of this enzyme. Furthermore, structures of TDH bound to its natural substrates and known inhibitors have been determined, giving an indication of the mechanism of catalysis of the enzyme. Collectively, these results provide vital details for future drug design to target TDH or related enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The quaternary structure of the redox protein thioredoxin (Trx) has been debated. For bacterial Trx, there is no question regarding its monomeric state. In humans and other eukaryotes, the presence of a cysteine residue at the crystallographic symmetry axis points to the relevance of dimer formation in solution and in vivo. Crystallographic data for shrimp thioredoxin (LvTrx) obtained under different redox conditions reveal a dimeric arrangement mediated by a disulfide bond through residue Cys73 and other hydrophobic interactions located in the crystallographic interface, as reported for human Trx. Through the analysis of five mutants located at the crystallographic interface, this study provides structural and biochemical evidence for the existence in solution of monomeric and dimeric populations of wild-type LvTrx and five mutants. Based on the results of biochemical assays, SAXS studies and the crystallographic structures of three of the studied mutants (Cys73Ser, Asp60Ser and Trp31Ala), it is clear that the Cys73 residue is essential for dimerization. However, its mutation to Ser produces an enzyme which has similar redox activity in vitro to the wild type. A putative regulatory function of dimerization is proposed based on structural analysis. Nonetheless, the biological role of LvTrx dimerization needs to be experimentally unveiled. Additionally, the findings of this work reopen the discussion regarding the existence of similar behaviour in human thioredoxin, which shares a Cys at position 73 with LvTrx, a structural feature that is also present in some Trxs from vertebrates and crustaceans.",

Here, solution X-ray scattering was used to provide insight into the overall structure and flexibility of the entire NS3 and its recombinant helicase and protease domains for Dengue virus serotypes 2 and 4 in solution. The DENV-2 and DENV-4 NS3 forms are elongated and flexible in solution.

Conformational alterations owing to RNA binding are described in the protease domain, which undergoes substantial conformational alterations that are required for the optimal catalysis of bound RNA. Finally, the effects of ATPase inhibitors on the enzymatically active DENV-2 and DENV-4 NS3 and the individual helicases are presented, and insight into the allosteric effect of the inhibitor quercetin is provided.",

The enzyme assembled as a tetramer, with each subunit being composed of N-terminal, C-terminal and large PLP-binding domains. The active-site cavity in the apo structure was much more solvent-accessible than that in the PLP-bound structure. This indicates that a marked structural change occurs around the active site upon binding of PLP that provides a solvent-inaccessible environment for the enzymatic reaction. The main-chain coordinates of the L. buchneri isoleucine 2-epimerase monomer showed a notable similarity to those of α-amino-ℇ-caprolactam racemase from Achromobactor obae and γ-aminobutyrate aminotransferase from Escherichia coli. However, the amino-acid residues involved in substrate binding in those two enzymes are only partially conserved in L. buchneri isoleucine 2-epimerase, which may account for the differences in substrate recognition by the three enzymes. The structures bound with reaction-intermediate analogues (PLP-L-Ile and PLP-D-allo-Ile) and site-directed mutagenesis suggest that L-isoleucine epimerization proceeds through abstraction of the α-hydrogen of the substrate by Lys280, while Asp222 serves as the catalytic residue adding an α-hydrogen to the quinonoid intermediate to form D-allo-isoleucine.",

The map of a ligand-bound human 20S proteasome served as a proof of principle that cryo-EM is emerging as a realistic approach for more general structural studies of protein–ligand interactions, with the potential benefits of extending such studies to complexes that are unfavourable to other methods and allowing structure determination under conditions that are closer to physiological, preserving ligand specificity towards closely related binding sites.

    "abstract": "Most of the sample holders currently used in macromolecular crystallography offer limited storage density and poor initial crystal-positioning precision upon mounting on a goniometer. This has now become a limiting factor at high-throughput beamlines, where data collection can be performed in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, this lack of precision limits the potential benefits emerging from automated harvesting systems that could provide crystal-position information which would further enhance alignment at beamlines. This situation provided the motivation for the development of a compact and precise sample holder with corresponding pucks, handling tools and robotic transfer protocols. The development process included four main phases: design, prototype manufacture, testing with a robotic sample changer and validation under real conditions on a beamline. Two sample-holder designs are proposed: NewPin and miniSPINE. They share the same robot gripper and allow the storage of 36 sample holders in uni-puck footprint-style pucks, which represents 252 samples in a dry-shipping dewar commonly used in the field. The pucks are identified with human- and machine-readable codes, as well as with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. NewPin offers a crystal-repositioning precision of up to 10 µm but requires a specific goniometer socket. The storage density could reach 64 samples using a special puck designed for fully robotic handling. miniSPINE is less precise but uses a goniometer mount compatible with the current SPINE standard. miniSPINE is proposed for the first implementation of the new standard, since it is easier to integrate at beamlines. An upgraded version of the SPINE sample holder with a corresponding puck named SPINEplus is also proposed in order to offer a homogenous and interoperable system. The project involved several European synchrotrons and industrial companies in the fields of consumables and sample-changer robotics. Manual handling of miniSPINE was tested at different institutes using evaluation kits, and pilot beamlines are being equipped with compatible robotics for large-scale evaluation. A companion paper describes a new sample changer FlexED8 (Papp et al., 2017, Acta Cryst., D73, 841-851).",

This study tests whether Hoogsteens or other syn purines are either under-modeled or over-modeled, which are known problems for rare conformations. Candidate purines needing a syn / anti 180° flip were identified by diagnostic patterns of difference electron-density peaks. Manual inspection narrowed 105 flip candidates to 20 convincing cases, all at ≤2.7 Å resolution. Rebuilding and refinement confirmed that 14 of these were authentic purine flips. Seven examples are modeled as Watson–Crick base pairs but should be Hoogsteens (commonest at duplex termini), and three had the opposite issue. Syn / anti flips were also needed for some single-stranded purines. Five of the 20 convincing cases arose from an unmodeled alternate duplex running in the opposite direction. These are in semi-palindromic DNA sequences bound by a homodimeric protein and show flipped-purine-like difference peaks at residues where the palindrome is imperfect. This study documents types of incorrect modeling which are worth avoiding. However, the primary conclusions are that such mistakes are infrequent, the bias towards fitting anti purines is very slight, and the occurrence rate of Hoogsteen base pairs in DNA crystal structures remains unchanged from earlier estimates at ∼0.3%.",

    "abstract": "Cryocooling of macromolecular crystals is commonly employed to limit radiation damage during X-ray diffraction data collection. However, cooling itself affects macromolecular conformation and often damages crystals via poorly understood processes. Here, the effects of cryosolution thermal contraction on macromolecular conformation and crystal order in crystals ranging from 32 to 67% solvent content are systematically investigated. It is found that the solution thermal contraction affects macromolecule configurations and volumes, unit-cell volumes, crystal packing and crystal order. The effects occur through not only thermal contraction, but also pressure caused by the mismatched contraction of cryosolvent and pores. Higher solvent-content crystals are more affected. In some cases the solvent contraction can be adjusted to reduce mosaicity and increase the strength of diffraction. Ice formation in some crystals is found to cause damage via a reduction in unit-cell volume, which is interpreted through solvent transport out of unit cells during cooling. The results point to more deductive approaches to cryoprotection optimization by adjusting the cryosolution composition to reduce thermal contraction-induced stresses in the crystal with cooling.",

In the structures of the complexes obtained with 1 m M α-CD or γ-CD, one molecule of CD was found at carbohydrate-binding module 41 only (CBM41). In the structures of the complexes obtained with 1 m M β-CD or with 10 m M α-CD or γ-CD, two molecules of CD were found at CBM41 and in the active-site cleft, where the hydrophobic residue of Phe746 occupies the inside cavity of the CD rings. In contrast to α-CD and γ-CD, one β-CD molecule was found at the active site only in the presence of 0.1 m M β-CD. These results were coincident with the solution experiments, which showed that β-CD inhibits this enzyme more than a thousand times more potently than α-CD and γ-CD. The strong inhibition of β-CD is caused by the optimized interaction between β-CD and the side chain of Phe746. The increased K i values of the F746A mutant for β-CD supported the importance of Phe746 in the strong interaction of pullulanase with β-CD.",

Given the myriad industrial uses for starch and thus also for α-amylase-catalysed starch degradation and modification, there is considerable interest in how different α-amylases might accommodate these branches, thus impacting on the potential processing of highly branched post-hydrolysis remnants (known as limit dextrins) and societal applications. Here, it was sought to probe the branch-point accommodation of the Alicyclobacillus sp. CAZy family GH13 α-amylase AliC, prompted by the observation of a molecule of glucose in a position that may represent a branch point in an acarbose complex solved at 2.1 A resolution. Limit digest analysis by two-dimensional NMR using both pullulan (a regular linear polysaccharide of α-1,4, α-1,4, α-1,6 repeating trisaccharides) and amylopectin starch showed how the Alicyclo­bacillus sp. enzyme could accept α-1,6 branches in at least the −2, +1 and +2 subsites, consistent with the three-dimensional structures with glucosyl moieties in the +1 and +2 subsites and the solvent-exposure of the −2 subsite 6-hydroxyl group. Together, the work provides a rare insight into branch-point acceptance in these industrial catalysts.",

    "abstract": "Bats have long been observed to be the hosts and the origin of numerous human diseases. Bats, like all mammals, rely on a number of innate immune mechanisms to combat invading pathogens, including the interferon type I, II and III responses. Ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) is a key modulator of these interferon responses. Within these pathways, ISG15 can serve to stabilize host proteins modulating innate immune responses and act as a cytokine. Post-translational modifications of viral proteins introduced by ISG15 have also been observed to directly affect the function of numerous viral proteins. Unlike ubiquitin, which is virtually identical across all animals, comparison of ISG15s across species reveals that they are relatively divergent, with sequence identity dropping to as low as ∼58% among mammals. In addition to serving as an obstacle to the zoonotic transmission of influenza, these ISG15 species–species differences have also long been shown to have an impact on the function of viral deISGylases. Recently, the structure of the first nonhuman ISG15, originating from mouse, suggested that the structures of human ISG15 may not be reflective of other species. Here, the structure of ISG15 from the bat species Myotis davidii solved to 1.37 Å resolution is reported. Comparison of this ISG15 structure with those from human and mouse not only underscores the structural impact of ISG15 species–species differences, but also highlights a conserved hydrophobic motif formed between the two domains of ISG15. Using the papain-like deISGylase from Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as a probe, the biochemical importance of this motif in ISG15–protein engagements was illuminated.",

    "abstract": "3D electron diffraction has reached a stage where the structures of chemical compounds can be solved productively. Instrumentation is lagging behind this development, and to date dedicated electron diffractometers for data collection based on the rotation method do not exist. Current studies use transmission electron microscopes as a workaround. These are optimized for imaging, which is not optimal for diffraction studies. The beam intensity is very high, it is difficult to create parallel beam illumination and the detectors used for imaging are of only limited use for diffraction studies. In this work, the combination of an EIGER hybrid pixel detector with a transmission electron microscope to construct a productive electron diffractometer is described. The construction not only refers to the combination of hardware but also to the calibration of the system, so that it provides rapid access to the experimental parameters that are necessary for processing diffraction data. Until fully integrated electron diffractometers become available, this describes a setup for productive and efficient operation in chemical crystallography.",

    "abstract": "Fragment-based molecular-replacement methods can solve a macromolecular structure quasi-ab initio. ARCIMBOLDO, using a common secondary-structure or tertiary-structure template or a library of folds, locates these with Phaser and reveals the rest of the structure by density modification and autotracing in SHELXE. The latter stage is challenging when dealing with diffraction data at lower resolution, low solvent content, high β-sheet composition or situations in which the initial fragments represent a low fraction of the total scattering or where their accuracy is low. SEQUENCE SLIDER aims to overcome these complications by extending the initial polyalanine fragment with side chains in a multisolution framework. Its use is illustrated on test cases and previously unknown structures. The selection and order of fragments to be extended follows the decrease in log-likelihood gain (LLG) calculated with Phaser upon the omission of each single fragment. When the starting substructure is derived from a remote homolog, sequence assignment to fragments is restricted by the original alignment. Otherwise, the secondary-structure prediction is matched to that found in fragments and traces. Sequence hypotheses are trialled in a brute-force approach through side-chain building and refinement. Scoring the refined models through their LLG in Phaser may allow discrimination of the correct sequence or filter the best partial structures for further density modification and autotracing. The default limits for the number of models to pursue are hardware dependent. In its most economic implementation, suitable for a single laptop, the main-chain trace is extended as polyserine rather than trialling models with different sequence assignments, which requires a grid or multicore machine. SEQUENCE SLIDER has been instrumental in solving two novel structures: that of MltC from 2.7 Å resolution data and that of a pneumococcal lipoprotein with 638 residues and 35% solvent content.",

    "abstract": "Pyruvate kinase is a key regulatory enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway. The crystal structure of Escherichia coli type I pyruvate kinase was first solved in 1995 at 2.5 Å resolution. However, the space group was ambiguous, being either primitive orthorhombic ( P 2 1 2 1 2 1 ) or C -centred orthorhombic ( C 222 1 ). Here, the structure determination and refinement of E. coli type I pyruvate kinase to 2.28 Å resolution are presented. Using the same crystallization conditions as reported previously, the enzyme was found to crystallize in space group P 2 1 . Determination of the space group was complicated owing to anisotropic data, pseudo-translational noncrystallographic symmetry and the pseudo-merohedrally twinned nature of the crystal, which was found to have very close to 50% twinning, leading to apparent orthorhombic symmetry and absences that were not inconsistent with P 2 1 2 1 2 1 . The unit cell contained two tetramers in the asymmetric unit (3720 residues) and, when compared with the orthorhombic structure, virtually all of the residues could be easily modelled into the density. Averaging of reflections into the lower symmetry space group with twinning provided tidier electron density that allowed ∼30 missing residues of the lid domain to be modelled for the first time. Moreover, residues in a flexible loop could be modelled and sulfate molecules are found in the allosteric binding domain, identifying the pocket that binds the allosteric activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in this isozyme for the first time. Lastly, we note the pedagogical benefits of difficult structures to emerging crystallographers.",

    "abstract": "The conformational flexibility of linkage-specific polyubiquitin chains enables ubiquitylated proteins and their receptors to be involved in a variety of cellular processes. Linear or Met1-linked polyubiquitin chains, associated with nondegradational cellular signalling pathways, have been known to adopt multiple conformations from compact to extended conformations. However, the extent of such conformational flexibility remains open. Here, the crystal structure of linear Ub 2 was determined in a more compact conformation than that of the previously known structure (PDB entry 3axc). The two structures differ significantly from each other, as shown by an r.m.s.d. between C α atoms of 3.1 Å. The compactness of the linear Ub 2 structure in comparison with PDB entry 3axc is supported by smaller values of the radius of gyration ( R g ; 18 versus 18.9 Å) and the maximum interatomic distance ( D max ; 55.5 versus 57.8 Å). Extra intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed among polar residues between the distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties seem to contribute to stabilization of the compact conformation of linear Ub 2 . An ensemble of three semi-extended and extended conformations of linear Ub 2 was also observed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis in solution. In addition, the conformational heterogeneity in linear polyubiquitin chains is clearly manifested by SAXS analyses of linear Ub 3 and Ub 4 : at least three distinct solution conformations are observed in each chain, with the linear Ub 3 conformations being compact. The results expand the extent of conformational space of linear polyubiquitin chains and suggest that changes in the conformational ensemble may be pivotal in mediating multiple signalling pathways.",

Computational and X-ray crystallographic studies of two S100B–SBiX complexes are described, and both compounds (apomorphine hydrochloride and ethidium bromide) occupy an area of the S100B hydrophobic cleft which is termed site 3. These data also reveal novel protein–inhibitor interactions which can be used in future drug-design studies to improve SBiX affinity and specificity. Of particular interest, apomorphine hydrochloride showed S100B-dependent killing in melanoma cell assays, although the efficacy exceeds its affinity for S100B and implicates possible off-target contributions.

    "abstract": "Neutron crystallography provides direct visual evidence of the atomic positions of deuterium-exchanged H atoms, enabling the accurate determination of the protonation/deuteration state of hydrated biomolecules. Comparison of two neutron structures of hemoglobins, human deoxyhemoglobin (T state) and equine cyanomethemoglobin (R state), offers a direct observation of histidine residues that are likely to contribute to the Bohr effect. Previous studies have shown that the T-state N-terminal and C-terminal salt bridges appear to have a partial instead of a primary overall contribution. Four conserved histidine residues [αHis72(EF1), αHis103(G10), αHis89(FG1), αHis112(G19) and βHis97(FG4)] can become protonated/deuterated from the R to the T state, while two histidine residues [αHis20(B1) and βHis117(G19)] can lose a proton/deuteron. αHis103(G10), located in the α1:β1 dimer interface, appears to be a Bohr group that undergoes structural changes: in the R state it is singly protonated/deuterated and hydrogen-bonded through a water network to βAsn108(G10) and in the T state it is doubly protonated/deuterated with the network uncoupled. The very long-term H/D exchange of the amide protons identifies regions that are accessible to exchange as well as regions that are impermeable to exchange. The liganded relaxed state (R state) has comparable levels of exchange (17.1% non-exchanged) compared with the deoxy tense state (T state; 11.8% non-exchanged). Interestingly, the regions of non-exchanged protons shift from the tetramer interfaces in the T-state interface (α1:β2 and α2:β1) to the cores of the individual monomers and to the dimer interfaces (α1:β1 and α2:β2) in the R state. The comparison of regions of stability in the two states allows a visualization of the conservation of fold energy necessary for ligand binding and release.",

Structural comparison of the two proteins revealed that the insertion increases the conformational flexibility of the R2 loop. Two citrate molecules originating from the crystallization solution were observed in the active site of the S64A mutant. One citrate molecule makes extensive interactions with active-site residues that are highly conserved among class C β-lactamases, whereas the other one is weakly bound. Based on this structural observation, it is demonstrated that citrate, a primary metabolite that is widely used as a food additive, is a competitive inhibitor of two class C β-lactamases (AmpC BER and CMY-10). Consequently, the data indicate enhancement of the flexibility of the R2 loop as an operative strategy for molecular evolution of extended-spectrum class C β-lactamases, and also suggest that the citrate scaffold is recognized by the active sites of class C β-lactamases.",

Diffraction data were collected from two significantly non-isomorphous crystals in the same monoclinic C2 space group. A correct molecular-replacment solution was obtained by applying a molecular symmetry-constrained systematic search approach that took advantage of the conserved biological symmetry of the F-BAR domains. It is shown that similar approaches can solve other F-BAR structures that were previously determined by experimental phasing.

    "abstract": "The recent division of the large glycoside hydrolase family 43 (GH43) into subfamilies offers a renewed opportunity to develop structure–function studies aimed at clarifying the molecular determinants of substrate specificity in carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. α-L-Arabinofuranosidases (EC 3.2.1.55) remove arabinose side chains from heteropolysaccharides such as xylan and arabinan. However, there is some evidence suggesting that arabinofuranosidases are substrate-specific, being unable to display a debranching activity on different polysaccharides. Here, the structure of Clostridium thermocellum arabinofuranosidase 43A ( Ct Abf43A), which has been shown to act in the removal of arabinose side chains from arabinoxylan but not from pectic arabinan, is reported. Ct Abf43A belongs to GH43 subfamily 16, the members of which have a restricted capacity to attack xylans. The crystal structure of Ct Abf43A comprises a five-bladed β-propeller fold typical of GH43 enzymes. Ct Abf43A displays a highly compact architecture compatible with its high thermostability. Analysis of Ct Abf43A along with the other member of GH43 subfamily 16 with known structure, the Bacillus subtilis arabinofuranosidase BsAXH-m2,3, suggests that the specificity of subfamily 16 for arabinoxylan is conferred by a long surface substrate-binding cleft that is complementary to the xylan backbone. The lack of a curved-shaped carbohydrate-interacting platform precludes GH43 subfamily 16 enzymes from interacting with the nonlinear arabinan scaffold and therefore from deconstructing this polysaccharide.",

Comparison of the scattering of the AtBAM2 tetramer with data collected from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) BAM5, which is also reported to form a tetramer, showed there were differences in the overall assembly.

Crystal structures of a type I pullulanase from Paenibacillus barengoltzii ( Pb PulA) and of Pb PulA in complex with maltopentaose (G5), maltohexaose (G6)/α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) were determined in order to better understand substrate binding to this enzyme. Pb PulA belongs to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 13 subfamily 14 and is composed of three domains (CBM48, A and C). Three carbohydrate-binding sites identified in Pb PulA were located in CBM48, near the active site and in domain C, respectively. The binding site in CBM48 was specific for β-CD, while that in domain C has not been reported for other pullulanases. The domain C binding site had higher affinity for α-CD than for G6; a small motif (FGGEH) seemed to be one of the major determinants for carbohydrate binding in this domain. Structure-based mutations of several surface-exposed aromatic residues in CBM48 and domain C had a debilitating effect on the activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that both CBM48 and domain C play a role in binding substrates. The crystal forms described contribute to the understanding of pullulanase domain–carbohydrate interactions.",

    "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are a well characterized family of metalloenzymes that are highly efficient in facilitating the interconversion between carbon dioxide and bicarbonate. Recently, CA activity has been associated with the LCIB (limiting CO 2 -inducible protein B) protein family, which has been an interesting target in aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms. To gain further insight into the catalytic mechanism of this new group of CAs, the X-ray structure of a highly active LCIB homolog (PtLCIB3) from the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum was determined. The CA activities of PtLCIB3, its paralog PtLCIB4 and a variety of their mutants were also measured. It was discovered that PtLCIB3 has a classic β-CA fold and its overall structure is highly similar to that of its homolog PtLCIB4. Subtle structural alterations between PtLCIB3 and PtLCIB4 indicate that an alternative proton-shuttle cavity could perhaps be one reason for their remarkable difference in CA activity. A potential alternative proton-shuttle route in the LCIB protein family is suggested based on these results.",

While several microchips for macromolecular crystallization have been proposed during the last two decades to partially overcome crystal-manipulation issues, increased background noise originating from the scattering of chip-fabrication materials has so far limited the attainable resolution of diffraction data. Here, the conception and use of low-cost, X-ray-transparent microchips for in situ crystallization and direct data collection, and structure determination at atomic resolution close to 1.0 Å, is presented. The chips are fabricated by a combination of either OSTEMER and Kapton or OSTEMER and Mylar materials for the implementation of counter-diffusion crystallization experiments. Both materials produce a sufficiently low scattering background to permit atomic resolution diffraction data collection at room temperature and the generation of 3D structural models of the tested model proteins lysozyme, thaumatin and glucose isomerase. Although the high symmetry of the three model protein crystals produced almost complete data sets at high resolution, the potential of in-line data merging and scaling of the multiple crystals grown along the microfluidic channels is also presented and discussed.",

A key step in this process is the refinement of the parameters of an initial model, which is most often determined by molecular replacement using another structure which is broadly similar to the structure of interest. In macromolecular crystallography, the resolution of the data is typically insufficient to determine the positional and uncertainty parameters for each individual atom, and so stereochemical information is used to supplement the observational data. Here, a new approach to refinement is evaluated in which a `shift field' is determined which describes changes to model parameters affecting whole regions of the model rather than individual atoms only, with the size of the affected region being a key parameter of the calculation which can be changed in accordance with the resolution of the data. It is demonstrated that this approach can improve the radius of convergence of the refinement calculation while also dramatically reducing the calculation time.",

The DEAH-box ATPase Prp2 plays a crucial role during pre-mRNA splicing as it ensures the catalytic activation of the spliceosome. Despite high structural similarity to other spliceosomal DEAH-box helicases, Prp2 does not seem to function as an RNA helicase, but rather as an RNA-dependent ribonucleoprotein particle-modifying ATPase. Recent crystal structures of the spliceosomal DEAH-box ATPases Prp43 and Prp22, as well as of the related RNA helicase MLE, in complex with RNA have contributed to a better understanding of how RNA binding and processivity might be achieved in this helicase family. In order to shed light onto the divergent manner of function of Prp2, an N-terminally truncated construct of Chaetomium thermophilum Prp2 was crystallized in the presence of ADP-BeF 3 − and a poly-U 12 RNA. The refined structure revealed a virtually identical conformation of the helicase core compared with the ADP-BeF 3 − - and RNA-bound structure of Prp43, and only a minor shift of the C-terminal domains. However, Prp2 and Prp43 differ in the hook-loop and a loop of the helix-bundle domain, which interacts with the hook-loop and evokes a different RNA conformation immediately after the 3′ stack. On replacing these loop residues in Prp43 by the Prp2 sequence, the unwinding activity of Prp43 was abolished. Furthermore, a putative exit tunnel for the γ-phosphate after ATP hydrolysis could be identified in one of the Prp2 structures.",

Here, the amorphous phase densities of aqueous solutions of glycerol and ethylene glycol at T = 77 K have been determined. Densities with accuracies of <0.5% to concentrations as low as 30%(w/v) were determined by rapidly cooling drops with volumes as small as 70 pl, assessing their optical clarity and measuring their buoyancy in liquid nitrogen-argon solutions. The use of these densities in contraction matching of internal solvent to the available solvent spaces is complicated by several factors, most notably the exclusion of cryoprotectants from protein hydration shells and the expected deviation of the contraction behavior of hydration water from bulk water. The present methods and results will assist in developing rational approaches to cryoprotection and an understanding of solvent behavior in protein crystals.",

    "abstract": "During the past decade, the authors have collected a few X-ray diffraction data sets from protein crystals that appeared to be easy cases of molecular replacement but failed to yield structures even after extensive trials. Here, the use of a large-scale molecular replacement method that explores all structurally characterized domains as phasing models to determine the structure corresponding to two data sets collected at 1.9 and 2.3 Å resolution is reported. These two structures were of the same protein independently crystallized in 2007 and 2011. The structures derived are virtually identical and were found to consist of two compact globular domains connected by a hinge. The high resolution of one of these data sets enabled inference of the amino-acid sequence from the electron-density map. The deduced sequence is nearly identical to that of a protein from the multidrug-resistant bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Although the structure of this protein has not been determined previously, it is homologous to the well studied DING proteins which mediate the cellular uptake of phosphate ions. The final electron-density maps from both of the data sets revealed a large density at the interface of the two globular domains that is likely to represent a phosphate ion. Thus, the structure is likely to be that of a phosphate-binding protein encoded by the S. maltophilia genome ( Sm PBP; PDB entry 5j1d). The nature of the phosphate-binding site of Sm PBP closely resembles that of Pseudomonas fluorescens DING ( Pflu DING), which displays remarkable discrimination between the closely similar phosphate and arsenate ions. The results presented here illustrate that routine crystallization trials may occasionally lead to the serendipitous crystallization of a protein of unknown identity and brute-force molecular replacement through `fold space' might allow the identification of the unknown protein.",

    "abstract": "Chondroadherin (CHAD) is a cartilage matrix protein that mediates the adhesion of isolated chondrocytes. Its protein core is composed of 11 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) flanked by cysteine-rich domains. CHAD makes important interactions with collagen as well as with cell-surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans and α2β1 integrins. The integrin-binding site is located in a region of hitherto unknown structure at the C-terminal end of CHAD. Peptides based on the C-terminal human CHAD (hCHAD) sequence have shown therapeutic potential for treating osteoporosis. This article describes a still-unconventional structure solution by phasing with de novo models, the first of a β-rich protein. Structure determination of hCHAD using traditional, though nonsystematic, molecular replacement was unsuccessful in the hands of the authors, possibly owing to a combination of low sequence identity to other LRR proteins, four copies in the asymmetric unit and weak translational pseudosymmetry. However, it was possible to solve the structure by generating a large number of de novo models for the central LRR domain using Rosetta and multiple parallel molecular-replacement attempts using AMPLE. The hCHAD structure reveals an ordered C-terminal domain belonging to the LRRCT fold, with the integrin-binding motif (WLEAK) being part of a regular α-helix, and suggests ways in which experimental therapeutic peptides can be improved. The crystal structure itself and docking simulations further support that hCHAD dimers form in a similar manner to other matrix LRR proteins.",

Deprivation of D-alanine from the teichoic acids of Staphylococcus aureus impairs biofilm and colony formation, induces autolysis and ultimately renders methicillin-resistant S. aureus highly susceptible to antimicrobial agents and host defense peptides. Hence, the D-alanylation pathway has emerged as a promising antibacterial target against drug-resistant S. aureus . D-Alanylation of teichoic acids is mediated via the action of four proteins encoded by the dlt operon, DltABCD, all four of which are essential for the process. In order to develop novel antimicrobial agents against S. aureus , the D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA, which is the first protein in the D-alanylation pathway, was focused on. Here, the crystal structure of DltA from the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain Mu50 is presented, which reveals the unique molecular details of the catalytic center and the role of the P-loop. Kinetic analysis shows that the enantioselectivity of S. aureus DltA is much higher than that of DltA from other species. In the presence of DltC, the enzymatic activity of DltA is increased by an order of magnitude, suggesting a new exploitable binding pocket. This discovery may pave the way for a new generation of treatments for drug-resistant S. aureus .",

As an integral determinant of fungal survival and virulence, the enzymes in this metabolic pathway have been pursued as potential antifungal targets. Guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthase has been identified as an attractive target as it is essential for virulence in the clinically prominent fungal pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. However, a lack of structural information on GMP synthase has hindered drug-design efforts. Here, the first structure of a GMP synthase of fungal origin, that from A. fumigatus (at 2.3 Å resolution), is presented. Structural analysis of GMP synthase shows a distinct absence of the D1 dimerization domain that is present in the human homologue. Interestingly, A. fumigatus GMP synthase adopts a dimeric state, as determined by native mass spectrometry and gel-filtration chromatography, in contrast to the monomeric human homologue. Analysis of the substrate-binding pockets of A. fumigatus GMP synthase reveals key differences in the ATP- and XMP-binding sites that can be exploited for species-specific inhibitor drug design. Furthermore, the inhibitory activities of the glutamine analogues acivicin (IC50 = 16.6 ± 2.4 µM) and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (IC50 = 29.6 ± 5.6 µM) against A. fumigatus GMP synthase are demonstrated.

Here, by solving the crystal structure, it is shown that Mt Glu5 from Meiothermus taiwanensis WR-220, a GH5-family endo-β-1,4-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), has a bipartite architecture consisting of a Cel5A-like catalytic domain with a (β/α) 8 TIM-barrel fold and an inserted CBM29-like noncatalytic domain with a β-jelly-roll fold. Deletion of the CBM significantly reduced the catalytic efficiency of Mt Glu5, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry using inactive mutants of full-length and CBM-deleted Mt Glu5 proteins. Conversely, insertion of the CBM from Mt Glu5 into Tm Cel5A from Thermotoga maritima greatly enhanced the substrate affinity of Tm Cel5A. Bound sugars observed between two tryptophan side chains in the catalytic domains of active full-length and CBM-deleted Mt Glu5 suggest an important stacking force. The synergistic action of the catalytic domain and CBM of Mt Glu5 in binding to single-chain polysaccharides was visualized by substrate modeling, in which additional surface tryptophan residues were identified in a cross-domain groove. Subsequent site-specific mutagenesis results confirmed the pivotal role of several other tryptophan residues from both domains of Mt Glu5 in substrate binding. These findings reveal a way to incorporate a CBM into the catalytic domain of an existing enzyme to make a robust cellulase.",

New variants of EcAIII were studied using structural, biophysical and bioinformatic methods. Activity tests revealed that the L-asparaginase activity is abolished in all analyzed mutants with the absence of Arg207, but some of them retained the ability to undergo the autoproteolytic maturation process. The results of spectroscopic studies and the determined crystal structures showed that the EcAIII fold is flexible enough to accept different types of mutations; however, these mutations may have a diverse impact on the thermal stability of the protein. The conclusions from the experiments are grouped into six lessons focused on (i) the adaptation of the EcAIII fold to new substitutions, (ii) the role of Arg207 in EcAIII activity, (iii) a network of residues necessary for autoprocessing, (iv) the complexity of the autoprocessing reaction, (v) the conformational changes observed in enzymatically inactive variants and (vi) the cooperativity of the EcAIII dimer subunits. Additionally, the structural requirements (pre-maturation checkpoints) that are necessary for the initiation of the autocleavage of Ntn-hydrolases have been classified. The findings reported in this work provide useful hints that should be considered before planning enzyme-engineering experiments aimed at the design of proteins for therapeutic applications. This is especially important for L-asparaginases that can be utilized in leukemia therapy, as alternative therapeutics are urgently needed to circumvent the severe side effects associated with the currently used enzymes.",

Here, the hydration of DNA was analyzed in terms of dinucleotide fragments from an ensemble of 2727 nonredundant DNA chains containing 41 853 dinucleotides and 316 265 associated first-shell water molecules. The dinucleotides were classified into categories based on their 16 sequences and the previously determined structural classes known as nucleotide conformers (NtCs). The construction of hydrated dinucleotide building blocks allowed dinucleotide hydration to be calculated as the probability of water density distributions. Peaks in the water densities, known as hydration sites (HSs), uncovered the interplay between base and sugar-phosphate hydration in the context of sequence and structure. To demonstrate the predictive power of hydrated DNA building blocks, they were then used to predict hydration in an independent set of crystal and NMR structures. In ten tested crystal structures, the positions of predicted HSs and experimental waters were in good agreement (more than 40% were within 0.5 Å) and correctly reproduced the known features of DNA hydration, for example the `spine of hydration' in B-DNA. Therefore, it is proposed that hydrated building blocks can be used to predict DNA hydration in structures solved by NMR and cryo-EM, thus providing a guide to the interpretation of experimental data and computer models. The data for the hydrated building blocks and the predictions are available for browsing and visualization at the website https://watlas.datmos.org/watna/.",

    "abstract": "The alkaline α-galactosidase AtAkαGal3 from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-D-galactose from galacto-oligosaccharides under alkaline conditions. A phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignment classifies AtAkαGal3 as more closely related to the raffinose family of oligosaccharide (RFO) synthases than to the acidic α-galactosidases. Here, thin-layer chromatography is used to demonstrate that AtAkαGal3 exhibits a dual function and is capable of synthesizing stachyose using raffinose, instead of galactinol, as the galactose donor. Crystal structures of complexes of AtAkαGal3 and its D383A mutant with various substrates and products, including galactose, galactinol, raffinose, stachyose and sucrose, are reported as the first representative structures of an alkaline α-galactosidase. The structure of AtAkαGal3 comprises three domains: an N-terminal domain with 13 antiparallel β-strands, a catalytic domain with an (α/β) 8 -barrel fold and a C-terminal domain composed of β-sheets that form two Greek-key motifs. The WW box of the N-terminal domain, which comprises the conserved residues FRSK 75 XW 77 W 78 in the RFO synthases, contributes Trp77 and Trp78 to the +1 subsite to contribute to the substrate-binding ability together with the (α/β) 8 barrel of the catalytic domain. The C-terminal domain is presumably involved in structural stability. Structures of the D383A mutant in complex with various substrates and products, especially the natural substrate/product stachyose, reveal four complete subsites (–1 to +3) at the catalytic site. A functional loop (residues 329–352) that exists in the alkaline α-galactosidase AtAkαGal3 and possibly in RFO synthases, but not in acidic α-galactosidases, stabilizes the stachyose at the +2 and +3 subsites and extends the catalytic pocket for the transferase mechanism. Considering the similarities in amino-acid sequence, catalytic domain and activity between alkaline α-galactosidases and RFO synthases, the structure of AtAkαGal3 might also serve a model for the study of RFO synthases, structures of which are lacking.",

    "abstract": "In macromolecular structure determination using X-ray diffraction from multiple crystals, the presence of different structures (structural polymorphs) necessitates the classification of the diffraction data for appropriate structural analysis. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) is a promising technique that has so far been used to extract isomorphous data, mainly for single-structure determination. Although in principle the use of HCA can be extended to detect polymorphs, the absence of a reference to define the threshold used to group the isomorphous data sets (the `isomorphic threshold') poses a challenge. Here, unit-cell-based and intensity-based HCAs have been applied to data sets for apo trypsin and inhibitor-bound trypsin that were mixed post data acquisition to investigate the efficacy of HCA in classifying polymorphous data sets. Single-step intensity-based HCA successfully classified polymorphs with a certain `isomorphic threshold'. In data sets for several samples containing an unknown degree of structural heterogeneity, polymorphs could be identified by intensity-based HCA using the suggested `isomorphic threshold'. Polymorphs were also detected in single crystals using data collected using the continuous helical scheme. These findings are expected to facilitate the determination of multiple structural snapshots by exploiting automated data collection and analysis.",

    "abstract": "Neutron diffraction is one of the three crystallographic techniques (X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction) used to determine the atomic structures of molecules. Its particular strengths derive from the fact that H (and D) atoms are strong neutron scatterers, meaning that their positions, and thus protonation states, can be derived from crystallographic maps. However, because of technical limitations and experimental obstacles, the quality of neutron diffraction data is typically much poorer (completeness, resolution and signal to noise) than that of X-ray diffraction data for the same sample. Further, refinement is more complex as it usually requires additional parameters to describe the H (and D) atoms. The increase in the number of parameters may be mitigated by using the `riding hydrogen' refinement strategy, in which the positions of H atoms without a rotational degree of freedom are inferred from their neighboring heavy atoms. However, this does not address the issues related to poor data quality. Therefore, neutron structure determination often relies on the presence of an X-ray data set for joint X-ray and neutron (XN) refinement. In this approach, the X-ray data serve to compensate for the deficiencies of the neutron diffraction data by refining one model simultaneously against the X-ray and neutron data sets. To be applicable, it is assumed that both data sets are highly isomorphous, and preferably collected from the same crystals and at the same temperature. However, the approach has a number of limitations that are discussed in this work by comparing four separately re-refined neutron models. To address the limitations, a new method for joint XN refinement is introduced that optimizes two different models against the different data sets. This approach is tested using neutron models and data deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The efficacy of refining models with H atoms as riding or as individual atoms is also investigated.",

The crystallographic data come from the VFe proteins deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with high resolutions of better than 1.35 Å. Calculations show that the formal oxidation state of a P 1+ cluster can be assigned as 2Fe 3+ 6Fe 2+ with high electron delocalization, giving the same oxidation state as that of P N clusters in VFe proteins. Further comprehensive comparisons of the bond distances suggest that the hydroxyl groups of the β-153 serine residues in P 1+ and P N clusters are in the protonated state, where the Fe6 atoms have the same oxidation state as Fe 2+ . During the transition from P N to P 1+ , cleavage of the Fe6—S1 bond is accompanied by the formation of a weak coordination between the Fe6 atom and the hydroxyl group of the β-153 serine residue in the P 1+ cluster of the VFe protein. Similarly, oxidation of P N to P 1+ /P 2+ clusters corresponds to the coordination of Fe6(II) by the hydroxyl group of the β-188 serine residue and of Fe5(II) by the peptide amine group of the α-88 cysteine residue in the MoFe protein of Azotobacter vinelandiis without electron and proton transfers.",

    "abstract": "The contractile machinery of muscle, especially that of skeletal muscle, has a very regular array of contractile protein filaments, and gives rise to a complex and informative diffraction pattern when irradiated with X-rays. However, analyzing these diffraction patterns is often challenging because (i) only rotationally averaged diffraction patterns can be obtained, resulting in a substantial loss of information, and (ii) the contractile machinery contains two different sets of protein filaments (actin and myosin) with different helical symmetries. The reflections originating from them often overlap. These problems may be solved if the real-space 3D structure of the contractile machinery is directly calculated from the diffraction pattern. Here, we demonstrate that by using the conventional phase-retrieval algorithm (hybrid input–output), the real-space 3D structure of the contractile machinery can be effectively restored from a single rotationally averaged 2D diffraction pattern. In this calculation, we used an in silico model of insect flight muscle, which is known for its highly regular structure. We also extended this technique to an experimentally recorded muscle diffraction pattern.",

Despite undertaking thousands of crystallization trials of the humanized 5E5 (h-5E5) Fab in the presence of either the singly or doubly glycosylated peptide antigens corresponding to Tn-MUC1, the Fab is only observed unliganded in the crystal. The conformations of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the combining site on the h-5E5 Fab do not differ significantly from those reported for liganded murine scFv at 3.0 Å resolution. While the affinity of the murine 5E5 has previously been reported as KD = 1.7 nM for the 24-mer Tn-MUC1 peptide PPAHGVT*SAPDTRPAPGS*T*APPAH prepared by in vitro glycosylation of a synthetic 24-mer MUC1 peptide, the KD of the h-5E5 Fab for the shorter doubly glycosylated glycopeptide antigens PAPGS*T*AP and APGS*T*AP was measured here as only 41 and 61 µM, respectively. Interestingly, the single Fab molecule in the asymmetric unit of space group C2 is observed packed head-to-head with a symmetry-related Fab across a crystallographic twofold axis such that a polypeptide loop from the light chain of each Fab is observed to insert into the antigen-binding pocket of the symmetry-related Fab. While this might suggest that binding of the Tn-MUC1 peptides may have been inhibited by a homophilic association, none was detected.

These exopolysaccharides are part of the cell wall and extracellular matrix of microbial communities. Currently, these galactosaminidases are found in three distinct CAZy families: GH114, GH135 and GH166. Despite the widespread occurrence of these enzymes in nearly all bacterial and fungal clades, only limited biochemical and structural data are available for these three groups. To expand our knowledge of endo-galactosaminidases, we selected several sequences predicted to encode endo-galactosaminidases and produced them recombinantly for structural and functional studies. Only very few predicted proteins could be produced in soluble form, and activity against bacterial Pel (pellicle) polysaccharide could only be confirmed for one enzyme. Here, we report the structures of two bacterial and one fungal enzyme. Whereas the fungal enzyme belongs to family GH114, the two bacterial enzymes do not lie in the current GH families but instead define a new family, GH191. During structure solution we realized that crystals of all three enzymes had various defects including twinning and partial disorder, which in the case of a more severe pathology in one of the structures required the design of a specialized refinement/model-building protocol. Comparison of the structures revealed several features that might be responsible for the described activity pattern and substrate specificity compared with other GAG-degrading enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The c-Src SH3 domain is one of the best-characterized modular domains from a biophysical and structural point of view. This SH3 domain displays noncanonical alternative folding, forming 3D domain-swapped oligomers and amyloid fibrils. These features make this small protein an ideal model for studying these phenomena. Residues in the regions that favour unfolding of the monomer and those in the hinge loop have been deeply studied in proteins undergoing 3D domain swapping. To study the role of these residues in the unfolding of the c-Src SH3 domain, we have constructed several chimeric proteins by interchanging residues in the RT and n-Src loops between the c-Src SH3 and Abl SH3 domains. The RT (the region between β1 and β2) and n-Src (the region between β2 and β3) loops create two sides of the shallow hydrophobic groove where proline-rich motif sequences bind to the SH3 domain. In addition to the structural information, we have performed a biophysical characterization of these chimeric constructs. The c-Src SH3 domain bearing the loops of the Abl SH3 shows minor changes in stability. Interestingly, these replacements do not prevent the formation of domain-swapped dimers. However, the interchange of one or two loops within the Abl SH3 domain produces a noticeable reduction in its stability but does not promote the formation of 3D domain-swapped oligomers. Thus, our results indicate that although the composition of the hinge loop is likely to play a role in the interchange of structural elements to form the intertwined dimers, it is not the sole driving force in their formation.",

Prior studies showed that three active-site substitutions in HbHNL conferred weak esterase activity. To investigate how regions beyond the active site influence catalytic efficiency and active-site geometry, we engineered HbHNL variants with increasing numbers of substitutions to match SABP2. Variant HNL16 has all amino acids within 6.5 Å of the active site identical to SABP2, HNL40 those within 10 Å and HNL71 those within 14 Å. HNL16 exhibited poor esterase activity, whereas both HNL40 and HNL71 showed efficient esterase catalysis, demonstrating that residues beyond the immediate active site are critical for functional conversion. X-ray structures of HNL40 and HNL71 reveal a progressive shift in backbone positions toward those of SABP2, with r.m.s.d. values of 0.51 Å (HNL40) and 0.41 Å (HNL71) over the Cα atoms, and even smaller r.m.s.d.s within the active-site region. Both HNL40 and HNL71 show a restored oxyanion hole and an additional tunnel connecting the active site to the protein surface. This work demonstrates the essential role of distant, indirectly acting residues to catalysis in α/β-hydrolase enzymes.",

Although we were unable to obtain CYP105A1-statin complex structures through co-crystallization and standard cryo data collection, we successfully acquired complex structures with mevastatin and simvastatin using room-temperature data collection with a conventional capillary method. We observed that the reduced unit-cell dimensions of the cryo crystals resulted in increased symmetry interactions, which induced cis-trans conversion of the peptide bond between Pro142 and Thr143 and conformational changes in the residues critical for statin binding. It is suggested that these increased symmetry interactions in the cryo crystals lead to dissociation of the statins from the active site of the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Similarity between two periodic functions is commonly assessed by comparing their Fourier coefficients within resolution shells. In particular, this approach is widely used in both crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). The definition of these shells, that is the choice of resolution scale for their boundaries, can be guided by the specific goals of the analysis, by the expected features of the studied functions or simply by convention. In cryoEM, shell boundaries are traditionally defined uniformly in inverse resolution. This convention results in a vast imbalance in the number of Fourier coefficients per shell, which may bias statistical comparisons and can make function plots misleading. Constructing resolution shells with approximately equal numbers of Fourier coefficients can be achieved automatically by defining shell boundaries uniformly on the inverse cubic resolution scale. This transformation effectively zooms into the high-resolution region, which is typically the primary focus of analysis. For Fourier shell correlation (FSC) calculations between half-maps, the characteristic sigmoidal curves were observed to transform into profiles that permit piecewise linear interpolation, which may make FSC analysis more robust.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in electron microscopy (EM) have led to a step change in our ability to solve the structures of previously intractable systems, especially membrane proteins and large protein complexes. This has provided new opportunities in the field of structure-based drug design, with a number of high-profile publications resolving the binding sites of small molecules and peptide inhibitors. There are a number of advantages of EM over the more traditional X-ray crystallographic approach, such as resolving different conformational states and permitting the dynamics of a system to be better resolved when not constrained by a crystal lattice. There are still significant challenges to be overcome using an EM approach, not least the speed of structure determination, difficulties with low-occupancy ligands and the modest resolution that is available. However, with the anticipated developments in the field of EM, the potential of EM to become a key tool for structure-based drug design, often complementing X-ray and NMR studies, seems promising.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) mediates multiple aspects of bacterial physiology through binding to various effectors. In some cases, these effectors are single-domain proteins which only contain a PilZ domain. It remains largely unknown how single-domain PilZ proteins function and regulate their downstream targets. Recently, a single-domain PilZ protein, MapZ (PA4608), was identified to inhibit the activity of the methyltransferase CheR1. Here, crystal structures of the C-terminal domain of CheR1 containing SAH and of CheR1 in complex with c-di-GMP-bound MapZ are reported. It was observed that the binding site of MapZ in CheR1 partially overlaps with the SAH/SAM-binding pocket. Consequently, binding of MapZ blocks SAH/SAM binding. This provides direct structural evidence on the mechanism of inhibition of CheR1 by MapZ in the presence of c-di-GMP.",

    "abstract": "The protein-folding mechanism remains a major puzzle in life science. Purified soluble activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is one of the most difficult proteins to obtain. Starting from inclusion bodies containing a C-terminally truncated version of AID (residues 1–153; AID 153 ), an optimized in vitro folding procedure was derived to obtain large amounts of AID 153 , which led to crystals with good quality and to final structural determination. Interestingly, it was found that the final refolding yield of the protein is proline residue-dependent. The difference in the distribution of cis and trans configurations of proline residues in the protein after complete denaturation is a major determining factor of the final yield. A point mutation of one of four proline residues to an asparagine led to a near-doubling of the yield of refolded protein after complete denaturation. It was concluded that the driving force behind protein folding could not overcome the cis -to- trans proline isomerization, or vice versa , during the protein-folding process. Furthermore, it was found that successful refolding of proteins optimally occurs at high pH values, which may mimic protein folding in vivo . It was found that high pH values could induce the polarization of peptide bonds, which may trigger the formation of protein secondary structures through hydrogen bonds. It is proposed that a hydrophobic environment coupled with negative charges is essential for protein folding. Combined with our earlier discoveries on protein-unfolding mechanisms, it is proposed that hydrogen bonds are a primary driving force for de novo protein folding.",

One limitation of the method is that the dose of individual data sets must be minimized, which in turn leads to data sets with low multiplicity. A solution to this problem is to use data from multiple crystals. However, the resulting signal can be degraded by a lack of isomorphism between crystals. Here, it is shown that serial synchrotron crystallography in combination with selective merging of data sets can be used to determine high-quality phases for insulin and thaumatin, and that the increased multiplicity can greatly enhance the success rate of the experiment.",

A domain swap is observed in the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of doublecortin. As determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, an open conformation is also present in solution. At higher concentrations, higher-order oligomers of the domain are formed. The domain swap and additional interfaces observed in the crystal lattice can explain the formation of doublecortin tetramers or multimers, in line with the analytical ultracentrifugation data. Taken together, the domain swap offers a mechanism for the observed cooperative binding of doublecortin to microtubules. Doublecortin-induced cross-linking of microtubules can be explained by the same mechanism. The effect of several mutations leading to lissencephaly and double-cortex syndrome can be traced to the domain swap and the proposed self-association of doublecortin.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, which is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The survival of M. tuberculosis in host macrophages through long-lasting periods of persistence depends, in part, on breaking down host cell lipids as a carbon source. The critical role of fatty-acid catabolism in this organism is underscored by the extensive redundancy of the genes implicated in β-oxidation (∼100 genes). In a previous study, the enzymology of the M. tuberculosis L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase FadB2 was characterized. Here, the crystal structure of this enzyme in a ligand-free form is reported at 2.1 Å resolution. FadB2 crystallized as a dimer with three unique dimer copies per asymmetric unit. The structure of the monomer reveals a dual Rossmann-fold motif in the N-terminal domain, while the helical C-terminal domain mediates dimer formation. Comparison with the CoA- and NAD + -bound human orthologue mitochondrial hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase shows extensive conservation of the residues that mediate substrate and cofactor binding. Superposition with the multi-catalytic homologue M. tuberculosis FadB, which forms a trifunctional complex with the thiolase FadA, indicates that FadB has developed structural features that prevent its self-association as a dimer. Conversely, FadB2 is unable to substitute for FadB in the tetrameric FadA–FadB complex as it lacks the N-terminal hydratase domain of FadB. Instead, FadB2 may functionally (or physically) associate with the enoyl-CoA hydratase EchA8 and the thiolases FadA2, FadA3, FadA4 or FadA6 as suggested by interrogation of the STRING protein-network database.",

    "abstract": "The lipidation of peptide drugs is one strategy to obtain extended half-lives, enabling once-daily or even less frequent injections for patients. The half-life extension results from a combination of self-association and association with human serum albumin (albumin). The self-association and association with albumin of two insulin analogues, insulin detemir and insulin degludec, were investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) in phenolic buffers. Detemir shows concentration-dependent self-association, with an equilibrium between hexamer, dihexamer, trihexamer and larger species, while degludec appears as a dihexamer independent of concentration. The solution structure of the detemir trihexamer has a bent shape. The stoichiometry of the association with albumin was studied using DLS. For albumin–detemir the molar stoichiometry was determined to be 1:6 (albumin:detemir ratio) and for albumin–degludec it was between 1:6 and 1:12 (albumin:degludec ratio). Batch SAXS measurements of a 1:6 albumin:detemir concentration series revealed a concentration dependence of complex formation. The data allowed the modelling of a complex between albumin and a detemir hexamer and a complex consisting of two albumins binding to opposite ends of a detemir dihexamer. Measurements of size-exclusion chromatography coupled to SAXS revealed a complex between a degludec dihexamer and albumin. Based on the results, equilibria for the albumin–detemir and albumin–degludec mixtures are proposed.",

    "abstract": "CAMP factor is a unique α-helical bacterial toxin that is known for its co-hemolytic activity in combination with staphylococcal sphingomyelinase. It was first discovered in the human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae (also known as group B streptococcus), but homologous genes have been found in many other Gram-positive pathogens. In this study, the efforts that led to the determination of the first structure of a CAMP-family toxin are reported. Initially, it was possible to produce crystals of the native protein which diffracted to near 2.45 Å resolution. However, a series of technical obstacles were encountered on the way to structure determination. Over a period of more than five years, many methods, including selenomethionine labeling, mutations, crystallization chaperones and heavy-atom soaking, were attempted, but these attempts resulted in limited progress. The structure was finally solved using a combination of iodine soaking and molecular replacement using the crystallization chaperone maltose-binding protein (MBP) as a search model. Analysis of native and MBP-tagged CAMP-factor structures identified a conserved interaction interface in the C-terminal domain (CTD). The positively charged surface may be critical for binding to acidic ligands. Furthermore, mutations on the interaction interface at the CTD completely abolished its co-hemolytic activities. This study provides novel insights into the mechanism of the membrane-permeabilizing activity of CAMP factor.",

In order to elucidate the role and the molecular mechanism of XepA and YomS, the crystal structures of these proteins were solved at resolutions of 1.9 and 1.3 Å, respectively. XepA consists of two antiparallel β-sandwich domains connected by a 30-amino-acid linker region. A pentamer of this protein adopts a unique dumbbell-shaped architecture consisting of two discs and a central tunnel. YomS (12.9 kDa per monomer), which is less than half the size of XepA (30.3 kDa), shows homology to the C-terminal part of XepA and exhibits a similar pentameric disc arrangement. Each β-sandwich entity resembles the fold of typical cytoplasmic membrane-binding C2 domains. Only XepA exhibits distinct cytotoxic activity in vivo , suggesting that the N-terminal pentameric domain is essential for this biological activity. The biological and structural data presented here suggest that XepA disrupts the proton motive force of the cytoplasmatic membrane, thus supporting cell lysis.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is the leading cause of death from a single infectious pathogen, with a high prevalence in developing countries in Africa and Asia. There still is a need for the development or repurposing of novel therapies to combat this disease owing to the long-term nature of current therapies and because of the number of reported resistant strains. Here, structures of dihydrofolate reductase from M. tuberculosis (MtDHFR), which is a key target of the folate pathway, are reported in complex with four antifolates, pyrimethamine, cycloguanil, diaverdine and pemetrexed, and its substrate dihydrofolate in order to understand their binding modes. The structures of all of these complexes were obtained in the closed-conformation state of the enzyme and a fine structural analysis indicated motion in key regions of the substrate-binding site and different binding modes of the ligands. In addition, the affinities, through Kd measurement, of diaverdine and methotrexate have been determined; MtDHFR has a lower affinity (highest Kd) for diaverdine than pyrimethamine and trimethoprim, and a very high affinity for methotrexate, as expected. The structural comparisons and analysis described in this work provide new information about the plasticity of MtDHFR and the binding effects of different antifolates.",

    "abstract": "Biomineralization is the process of mineral formation by organisms and involves the uptake of ions from the environment in order to produce minerals, with the process generally being mediated by proteins. Most proteins that are involved in mineral interactions are predicted to contain disordered regions containing large numbers of negatively charged amino acids. Magnetotactic bacteria, which are used as a model system for iron biomineralization, are Gram-negative bacteria that can navigate through geomagnetic fields using a specific organelle, the magnetosome. Each organelle comprises a membrane-enveloped magnetic nanoparticle, magnetite, the formation of which is controlled by a specific set of proteins. One of the most abundant of these proteins is MamC, a small magnetosome-associated integral membrane protein that contains two transmembrane α-helices connected by an ∼21-amino-acid peptide. In vitro studies of this MamC peptide showed that it forms a helical structure that can interact with the magnetite surface and affect the size and shape of the growing crystal. Our results show that a disordered structure of the MamC magnetite-interacting component (MamC-MIC) abolishes its interaction with magnetite particles. Moreover, the size and shape of magnetite crystals grown in in vitro magnetite-precipitation experiments in the presence of this disordered peptide were different from the traits of crystals grown in the presence of other peptides or in the presence of the helical MIC. It is suggested that the helical structure of the MamC-MIC is important for its function during magnetite formation.",

This covalent cross-link has been proposed to modulate the active-site heme towards oxidative catalysis by distorting the heme plane. In this study, the crystal structure of a stable complex of an HAO homologue (KsHAOr) with its diheme cytochrome c redox partner (KsDH) from the anammox bacterium Kuenenia stuttgartiensis was determined. KsHAOr lacks the tyrosine cross-link and is therefore tuned to reductive catalysis. The molecular model of the KsHAOr–KsDH complex at 2.6 Å resolution shows a heterododecameric (α 6 β 6 ) assembly, which was also shown to be the oligomeric state in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation and multi-angle static light scattering. The 60-heme-containing protein complex reveals a unique extended electron transfer pathway and provides deeper insights into catalysis and electron transfer in reductive OCCs.",

    "abstract": "The clostripain-like (C11) family of cysteine proteases are ubiquitously produced by the vast majority of the bacterial strains that make up the human distal gut microbiome. Recent reports show that some C11 proteases promote host immune responses and bacterial pathogenesis, including the induction of neutrophil phagocytosis and the activation of bacterial pathogenic toxins, respectively. The crystal structure of distapain, the only C11 protease predicted within the genome of the commensal bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis , was determined in the inactive zymogen state to 1.65 Å resolution. This is the first C11 protease structure of a zymogen, and the structure helped to uncover key unique conformations among critical active-site residues that are likely to assist in preserving the inactive protease. His135, a member of the catalytic dyad, is repositioned approximately 5.5 Å from the orientation found in active C11 structures and forms a hydrogen bond to Asp180 and a π-stacking interaction with Trp133. The structure sheds light on the potential importance of Asp180 and Trp133, as these residues are highly conserved across C11 proteases. Structure elucidation of C11 proteases will ultimately help to identify new ways to chemically and/or biologically regulate this family of enzymes, which represent potential drug-discovery targets in microbiome-related gastrointestinal diseases.",

In this study, the glycoside hydrolase family 45 (GH45) subfamily B endoglucanase EG27II from the snail Ampullaria crossean was expressed using a Pichia pastoris expression system and the crystal structure of the apo form was determined at 1.00 Å resolution; this is the highest resolution structure of an animal endoglucanase. The results showed that EG27II has a double-ψ six-stranded β-barrel and that the structure of EG27II more closely resembles those of subfamily C enzymes than those of subfamily A enzymes. The structure of EG27II complexed with cellobiose was also determined under cryoconditions and at room temperature at three pH values, pH 4.0, 5.5 and 8.0, and no structural changes were found to be associated with the change in pH. The structural comparison and catalytic activity measurements showed that Asp137 and Asn112 function as the catalytic acid and base, respectively, and that Asp27 is also an important residue for catalysis. These high-resolution structures of EG27II provide a large amount of information for structure-based enzyme modification and cell-surface engineering, which will advance biofuel production using animal-derived cellulases.",

Furthermore, the effects of HuA21 variants with constant domains of different lengths were explored and it was noticed that the deletion of constant domain 1 could improve the inhibition efficacy in a cell-proliferation assay, possibly functioning via increased internalization, which might guide the design of other monoclonal antibodies.",

Here, X-ray structures of the major pilins from Clostridium perfringens strains 13 and SM101 and of sortase from strain SM101 are presented with biochemical analysis to detect the formation of pili in vivo . The major pilin from strain 13 adopts an elongated structure to form noncovalently linked polymeric chains in the crystal, yielding a practical model of the pilus fiber structure. The major pilin from strain SM101 adopts a novel bent structure and associates to form a left-handed twist like an antiparallel double helix in the crystal, which is likely to promote bacterial cell–cell interactions. A modeling study showed that pilin with a bent structure interacts favorably with sortase. The major pilin from strain SM101 was considered to be in an equilibrium state between an elongated and a bent structure through dynamic conformational change, which may be involved in pili-mediated colonization and sortase-mediated polymerization of pili.",

However, this strategy is not always effective, for example when the relationship between sequence and structural similarity fails or when the crystal contents are not those expected. An alternative approach is to identify suitable search models directly from the experimental data. SIMBAD is a sequence-independent MR pipeline that uses either a crystal lattice search or MR functions to directly locate suitable search models from databases. The previous version of SIMBAD used the fast AMoRe rotation-function search. Here, a new version of SIMBAD which makes use of Phaser and its likelihood scoring to improve the sensitivity of the pipeline is presented. It is shown that the additional compute time potentially required by the more sophisticated scoring is counterbalanced by the greater sensitivity, allowing more cases to trigger early-termination criteria, rather than running to completion. Using Phaser solved 17 out of 25 test cases in comparison to the ten solved with AMoRe , and it is shown that use of ensemble search models produces additional performance benefits.",

    "abstract": "The phase problem remains a major barrier to overcome in protein structure solution by X-ray crystallography. In recent years, new molecular-replacement approaches using ab initio models and ideal secondary-structure components have greatly contributed to the solution of novel structures in the absence of clear homologues in the PDB or experimental phasing information. This has been particularly successful for highly α-helical structures, and especially coiled-coils, in which the relatively rigid α-helices provide very useful molecular-replacement fragments. This has been seen within the program AMPLE , which uses clustered and truncated ensembles of numerous ab initio models in structure solution, and is already accomplished for α-helical and coiled-coil structures. Here, an expansion in the scope of coiled-coil structure solution by AMPLE is reported, which has been achieved through general improvements in the pipeline, the removal of tNCS correction in molecular replacement and two improved methods for ab initio modelling. Of the latter improvements, enforcing the modelling of elongated helices overcame the bias towards globular folds and provided a rapid method (equivalent to the time requirements of the existing modelling procedures in AMPLE ) for enhanced solution. Further, the modelling of two-, three- and four-helical oligomeric coiled-coils, and the use of full/partial oligomers in molecular replacement, provided additional success in difficult and lower resolution cases. Together, these approaches have enabled the solution of a number of parallel/antiparallel dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric coiled-coils at resolutions as low as 3.3 Å, and have thus overcome previous limitations in AMPLE and provided a new functionality in coiled-coil structure solution at lower resolutions. These new approaches have been incorporated into a new release of AMPLE in which automated elongated monomer and oligomer modelling may be activated by selecting `coiled-coil' mode.",

DAPK1 is considered to be a therapeutic target for amyloid-β deposition, endometrial adenocarcinomas and acute ischemic stroke. Here, the potent inhibitory activity of the natural anthraquinone purpurin against DAPK1 phosphorylation is shown. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that while the binding affinity of purpurin is similar to that of CPR005231, which is a DAPK1 inhibitor with an imidazopyridazine moiety, the binding of purpurin was more enthalpically favorable. In addition, the inhibition potencies were correlated with the enthalpic changes but not with the binding affinities. Crystallographic analysis of the DAPK1–purpurin complex revealed that the formation of a hydrogen-bond network is likely to contribute to the favorable enthalpic changes and that stabilization of the glycine-rich loop may cause less favorable entropic changes. The present findings indicate that purpurin may be a good lead compound for the discovery of inhibitors of DAPK1, and the observation of enthalpic changes could provide important clues for drug development.",

Analysis of ice diffraction from crystals of three proteins shows that the ice formed within solvent cavities during rapid cooling is comprised of a stacking-disordered mixture of hexagonal and cubic planes, with the cubic plane fraction increasing with increasing cryoprotectant concentration and increasing cooling rate. Building on the work of Thorn and coworkers [Thorn et al. (2017), Acta Cryst. D73, 729-727], a revised metric is defined for detecting ice from deposited protein structure-factor data, and this metric is validated using full-frame diffraction data from the Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography. Using this revised metric and improved algorithms, an analysis of structure-factor data from a random sample of 89 827 PDB entries collected at cryogenic temperatures indicates that roughly 16% show evidence of ice contamination, and that this fraction increases with increasing solvent content and maximum solvent-cavity size. By examining the ice diffraction-peak positions at which structure-factor perturbations are observed, it is found that roughly 25% of crystals exhibit ice with primarily hexagonal character, indicating that inadequate cooling rates and/or cryoprotectant concentrations were used, while the remaining 75% show ice with a stacking-disordered or cubic character.",

    "abstract": "The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rsm22 protein (Sc-Rsm22), encoded by the nuclear RSM22 (systematic name YKL155c ) gene, is a distant homologue of Rsm22 from Trypanosoma brucei (Tb-Rsm22) and METTL17 from mouse (Mm-METTL17). All three proteins have been shown to be associated with mitochondrial gene expression, and Sc-Rsm22 has been documented to be essential for mitochondrial respiration. The Sc-Rsm22 protein comprises a polypeptide of molecular weight 72.2 kDa that is predicted to harbor an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. The precise physiological function of Rsm22-family proteins is unknown, and no structural information has been available for Sc-Rsm22 to date. In this study, Sc-Rsm22 was expressed and purified in monomeric and dimeric forms, their folding was confirmed by circular-dichroism analyses and their low-resolution structures were determined using a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) approach. The solution structure of the monomeric form of Sc-Rsm22 revealed an elongated three-domain arrangement, which differs from the shape of Tb-Rsm22 in its complex with the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit in T. brucei (PDB entry 6sg9). A bioinformatic analysis revealed that the core domain in the middle (Leu117–Asp462 in Sc-Rsm22) resembles the corresponding region in Tb-Rsm22, including a Rossmann-like methyltransferase fold followed by a zinc-finger-like structure. The latter structure is not present in this position in other methyltransferases and is therefore a unique structural motif for this family. The first half of the C-terminal domain is likely to form an OB-fold, which is typically found in RNA-binding proteins and is also seen in the Tb-Rsm22 structure. In contrast, the N-terminal domain of Sc-Rsm22 is predicted to be fully α-helical and shares no sequence similarity with other family members. Functional studies demonstrated that the monomeric variant of Sc-Rsm22 methylates mitochondrial tRNAs in vitro . These data suggest that Sc-Rsm22 is a new and unique member of the RNA methyltransferases that is important for mitochondrial protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Vancomycin has historically been used as a last-resort treatment for serious bacterial infections. However, vancomycin resistance has become widespread in certain pathogens, presenting a serious threat to public health. Resistance to vancomycin is conferred by a suite of resistance genes, the expression of which is controlled by the VanR–VanS two-component system. VanR is the response regulator in this system; in the presence of vancomycin, VanR accepts a phosphoryl group from VanS, thereby activating VanR as a transcription factor and inducing expression of the resistance genes. This paper presents the X-ray crystal structures of full-length VanR from Streptomyces coelicolor in both the inactive and activated states at resolutions of 2.3 and 2.0 Å, respectively. Comparison of the two structures illustrates that phosphorylation of VanR is accompanied by a disorder-to-order transition of helix 4, which lies within the receiver domain of the protein. This transition generates an interface that promotes dimerization of the receiver domain; dimerization in solution was verified using analytical ultracentrifugation. The inactive conformation of the protein does not appear intrinsically unable to bind DNA; rather, it is proposed that in the activated form DNA binding is enhanced by an avidity effect contributed by the receiver-domain dimerization.",

These pursuits often involve the minimization or the complete removal of additives that are commonly used to facilitate proper protein folding and minimize aggregation. Among these admonished additives is glycerol, a widely used osmolyte that aids protein stability. In this work, it is shown that the inclusion of glycerol does not preclude high-resolution structure determination by cryoEM, as demonstrated by an ∼2.3 Å resolution reconstruction of mouse apoferritin (∼500 kDa) and an ∼3.3 Å resolution reconstruction of rabbit muscle aldolase (∼160 kDa) in the presence of 20%(v/v) glycerol. While it was found that generating thin ice that is amenable to high-resolution imaging requires long blot times, the addition of glycerol did not result in increased beam-induced motion or an inability to pick particles. Overall, these findings indicate that glycerol should not be discounted as a cryoEM sample-buffer additive, particularly for large, fragile complexes that are prone to disassembly or aggregation upon its removal.",

This sensor and regulator has been captured bound to lactose and to lactulose as well as in a nominal apo form, and was compared with AraC, another saccharide-binding transcriptional regulator. It is shown that the saccharides bind in the N-terminal region of a jelly-roll fold, but that part of the saccharide is exposed to bulk solvent. This differs from the classical AraC saccharide-binding site, which is mostly sequestered from the bulk solvent. The structures of BgaR bound to lactose and to lactulose highlight how specific and nonspecific interactions lead to a higher binding affinity of BgaR for lactose compared with lactulose.

    "abstract": "The capability to reach wavelengths of up to 3.1 Å at the newly established EMBL P13 beamline at PETRA III, the new third-generation synchrotron at DESY in Hamburg, provides the opportunity to explore very long wavelengths to harness the sulfur anomalous signal for phase determination. Data collection at λ = 2.69 Å (4.6 keV) allowed the crystal structure determination by sulfur SAD phasing of Cdc23(Nterm), a subunit of the multimeric anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). At this energy, Cdc23(Nterm) has an expected Bijvoet ratio〈|Fanom|〉/〈F〉of 2.2%, with 282 residues, including six cysteines and five methionine residues, and two molecules in the asymmetric unit (65.4 kDa; 12 Cys and ten Met residues). Selectively illuminating two separate portions of the same crystal with an X-ray beam of 50 µm in diameter allowed crystal twinning to be overcome. The crystals diffracted to 3.1 Å resolution, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 61.2, c = 151.5 Å, and belonged to space group P43. The refined structure to 3.1 Å resolution has an R factor of 18.7% and an Rfree of 25.9%. This paper reports the structure solution, related methods and a discussion of the instrumentation.",

    "abstract": "Density modification is a general standard technique which may be used to improve electron density derived from experimental phasing and also to refine densities obtained by ab initio approaches. Here, a novel method to expand density modification is presented, termed the Phantom derivative technique, which is based on non-existent structure factors and is of particular interest in molecular replacement. The Phantom derivative approach uses randomly generated ancil structures with the same unit cell as the target structure to create non-existent derivatives of the target structure, called phantom derivatives, which may be used for ab initio phasing or for refining the available target structure model. In this paper, it is supposed that a model electron density is available: it is shown that ancil structures related to the target obtained by shifting the target by origin-permissible translations may be employed to refine model phases. The method enlarges the concept of the ancil, is as efficient as the canonical approach using random ancils and significantly reduces the CPU refinement time. The results from many real test cases show that the proposed methods can substantially improve the quality of electron-density maps from molecular-replacement-based phases.",

P4H is a key player in collagen accumulation, which has implications in fibrotic disorders. The stabilization of collagen triple-helical structure via prolyl hydroxylation is the rate-limiting step in collagen biosynthesis, and therefore P4H has been extensively investigated as a potential therapeutic target of fibrotic disease. Understanding how these enzymes recognize cofactors and substrates is important and will aid in the future design of inhibitors of P4H. In this article, X-ray crystal structures of a metallocofactor- and α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-bound form of P4H from Bacillus anthracis (BaP4H) are reported. Structures of BaP4H were solved at 1.63 and 2.35 Å resolution and contained a cadmium ion and αKG bound in the active site. The αKG–Cd–BaP4H ternary complex reveals conformational changes of conserved residues upon the binding of metal ion and αKG, resulting in a closed active-site configuration required for dioxygen, substrate binding and catalysis.",

I-TASSER-MR has been developed to test whether the success rate for structure determination of distant-homology proteins could be improved by a combination of iterative fragmental structure-assembly simulations with progressive sequence truncation designed to trim regions with high variation. The pipeline was tested on two independent protein sets consisting of 61 proteins from CASP8 and 100 high-resolution proteins from the PDB. After excluding homologous templates, I-TASSER generated full-length models with an average TM-score of 0.773, which is 12% higher than the best threading templates. Using these as search models, I-TASSER-MR found correct MR solutions for 95 of 161 targets as judged by having a TFZ of >8 or with the final structure closer to the native than the initial search models. The success rate was 16% higher than when using the best threading templates. I-TASSER-MR was also applied to 14 protein targets from structure genomics centers. Seven of these were successfully solved by I-TASSER-MR.

Resonet was tested across a compilation of diffraction images from synchrotron experiments and X-ray free-electron laser experiments. Crucially, these models readily execute on graphics processing units and can thus significantly outperform conventional algorithms.

    "abstract": "Fragment-based drug design using X-ray crystallography is a powerful technique to enable the development of new lead compounds, or probe molecules, against biological targets. This study addresses the need to determine fragment binding orientations for low-occupancy fragments with incomplete electron density, an essential step before further development of the molecule. Halogen atoms play multiple roles in drug discovery due to their unique combination of electronegativity, steric effects and hydrophobic properties. Fragments incorporating halogen atoms serve as promising starting points in hit-to-lead development as they often establish halogen bonds with target proteins, potentially enhancing binding affinity and selectivity, as well as counteracting drug resistance. Here, the aim was to unambiguously identify the binding orientations of fragment hits for SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) which contain a combination of sulfur and/or chlorine, bromine and iodine substituents. The binding orientations of carefully selected nsp1 analogue hits were focused on by employing their anomalous scattering combined with Pan-Dataset Density Analysis (PanDDA). Anomalous difference Fourier maps derived from the diffraction data collected at both standard and long-wavelength X-rays were compared. The discrepancies observed in the maps of iodine-containing fragments collected at different energies were attributed to site-specific radiation-damage stemming from the strong X-ray absorption of I atoms, which is likely to cause cleavage of the C-I bond. A reliable and effective data-collection strategy to unambiguously determine the binding orientations of low-occupancy fragments containing sulfur and/or halogen atoms while mitigating radiation damage is presented.",

Traditionally, such a structure determination has been performed with crystallographic or nuclear resonance methods, but during the last decade, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) has become an equally important tool. As the blotting and flash-freezing of the samples can induce conformational changes, external validation tools are required to ensure that the vitrified samples are representative of the solution. Although many validation tools have already been developed, most of them rely on fully resolved atomic models, which prevents early screening of the cryo-TEM maps. Here, a novel and automated method for performing such a validation utilizing small-angle X-ray scattering measurements, publicly available through the new software package AUSAXS, is introduced and implemented. The method has been tested on both simulated and experimental data, where it was shown to work remarkably well as a validation tool. The method provides a dummy atomic model derived from the EM map which best represents the solution structure.",

This is a major bottleneck, since the generation and production of mAbs is time-consuming and expensive. Synthetic antibody fragments (sFabs) generated by phage-display selection offer an alternative with many advantages over Fabs obtained from natural antibodies using hybridoma technology. Unlike mAbs, sFabs are generated using phage display, allowing selection for binding to specific strains or for pan-specificity, for identification of structural epitopes or unique protein conformations and even for complexes. Further, they can easily be produced in Escherichia coli in large quantities and engineered for purposes of detection technologies and other applications. Here, the use of phage-display selection to generate a pan-specific Fab (MJ20), based on a Herceptin Fab scaffold, with the ability to bind selectively and with high affinity to the C-terminal domains of the nucleoproteins (NPs) from all five known strains of the Ebola virus is reported. The high-resolution crystal structure of the complex of MJ20 with the antigen from the Bundibugyo strain of the Ebola virus reveals the basis for pan-specificity and illustrates how the phage-display technology can be used to manufacture suitable Fabs for use in diagnostic or therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Neutron reflectivity (NR) has emerged as a powerful technique to study the structure and behavior of membrane proteins at planar lipid interfaces. Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) remain a significant challenge for NR owing to the difficulty of forming complete bilayers with sufficient protein density for scattering techniques. One strategy to achieve high protein density on a solid substrate is the capture of detergent-stabilized, affinity-tagged IMPs on a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-functionalized self-assembled monolayer (SAM), followed by reconstitution into the lipids of interest. Such protein-tethered bilayer lipid membranes (ptBLMs) have the notable advantage of a uniform IMP orientation on the substrate. Here, NR is used to provide a structural characterization of the ptBLM process from formation of the SAM to capture of the detergent-stabilized IMP and lipid reconstitution. The mitochondrial outer-membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which controls the exchange of bioenergetic metabolites between mitochondria and the cytosol, was used as a model β-barrel IMP. Molecular dynamics simulations were used for comparison with the experimental results and to inform the parameters of the physical models describing the NR data. The detailed structure of the SAM is shown to depend on the density of the NTA chelating groups. The relative content of detergent and protein in surface-immobilized, detergent-stabilized VDAC is measured, while the reconstituted lipid bilayer is shown to be complete to within a few percent, using the known atomic structure of VDAC. Finally, excess lipid above the reconstituted bilayer, which is of consequence for more indirect structural and functional studies, is shown to be present.",

The structure of the obtained models depends on the properties of the lipids used and the final composition of the leaflets, and can be subject to the spontaneous translocation of phospholipids across the bilayer. The effect of phospholipid acyl-chain unsaturation and the presence of steroids in the membrane on the bilayer asymmetry were examined by means of neutron reflectometry. The measurements showed that membrane stability was higher if a zwitterionic, saturated acyl-chain phospholipid is present as the inner leaflet. Furthermore, membrane asymmetry was higher in the case of fully saturated lipid systems. As a result, membrane models consisting of fully saturated acyl chains within the inner leaflet are recommended as the starting point for subsequent studies of antifungal interactions owing to the simplicity of the models and their relative stability, thus allowing better control over the exact lipid composition facing the tested antifungal.",

    "abstract": "3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (3HAO) is an enzyme in the microglial branch of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation. 3HAO is a non-heme iron-containing, ring-cleaving extradiol dioxygenase that catalyzes the addition of both atoms of O2 to the kynurenine pathway metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA) to form quinolinic acid (QUIN). QUIN is a highly potent excitotoxin that has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, making 3HAO a target for pharmacological downregulation. Here, the first crystal structure of human 3HAO with the native iron bound in its active site is presented, together with an additional structure with zinc (a known inhibitor of human 3HAO) bound in the active site. The metal-binding environment is examined both structurally and via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The studies identified Met35 as the source of potential new interactions with substrates and inhibitors, which may prove useful in future therapeutic efforts.",

    "abstract": "Biological chelating molecules called siderophores are used to sequester iron and maintain its ferric state. Bacterial substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) bind iron–siderophore complexes and deliver these complexes to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for import into the cytoplasm, where the iron can be transferred from the siderophore to catalytic enzymes. In Yersinia pestis , the causative agent of plague, the Yersinia iron-uptake (Yiu) ABC transporter has been shown to improve iron acquisition under iron-chelated conditions. The Yiu transporter has been proposed to be an iron–siderophore transporter; however, the precise siderophore substrate is unknown. Therefore, the precise role of the Yiu transporter in Y. pestis survival remains uncharacterized. To better understand the function of the Yiu transporter, the crystal structure of YiuA (YPO1310/y2875), an SBP which functions to present the iron–siderophore substrate to the transporter for import into the cytoplasm, was determined. The 2.20 and 1.77 Å resolution X-ray crystal structures reveal a basic triad binding motif at the YiuA canonical substrate-binding site, indicative of a metal-chelate binding site. Structural alignment and computational docking studies support the function of YiuA in binding chelated metal. Additionally, YiuA contains two mobile helices, helix 5 and helix 10, that undergo 2–3 Å shifts across crystal forms and demonstrate structural breathing of the c-clamp architecture. The flexibility in both c-clamp lobes suggest that YiuA substrate transfer resembles the Venus flytrap mechanism that has been proposed for other SBPs.",

Often, AIMPs contain an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-like domain and a C-terminal OB-fold tRNA-binding domain. Recently, the apicomplexan-specific Plasmodium falciparum p43 protein ( Pf p43) has been annotated as an AIMP and its tRNA binding, tRNA import and membrane association have been characterized. The crystal structures of both the N- and C-terminal domains of the Plasmodium vivax p43 protein ( Pv p43), which is an ortholog of Pf p43, have been resolved. Analyses reveal the overall oligomeric structure of Pv p43 and highlight several notable features that show Pv p43 to be a soluble, cytosolic protein. The dimeric assembly of the N-terminal GST-like domain of Pv p43 differs significantly from canonical GST dimers, and it is tied to the C-terminal tRNA-binding domain via a linker region. This work therefore establishes a framework for dissecting the additional roles of p43 orthologs in eukaryotic multi-protein MARS complexes.",

    "abstract": "The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei is the etiological agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). HAT, together with other neglected tropical diseases, causes serious health and economic issues, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. The classical antifolates targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are ineffective towards trypanosomatid parasites owing to a metabolic bypass by the expression of pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1). The combined inhibition of PTR1 and DHFR activities in Trypanosoma parasites represents a promising strategy for the development of new effective treatments for HAT. To date, only monocyclic and bicyclic aromatic systems have been proposed as inhibitors of T. brucei PTR1 ( Tb PTR1); nevertheless, the size of the catalytic cavity allows the accommodation of expanded molecular cores. Here, an innovative tricyclic-based compound has been explored as a Tb PTR1-targeting molecule and its potential application for the development of a new class of PTR1 inhibitors has been evaluated. 2,4-Diaminopyrimido[4,5- b ]indol-6-ol ( 1 ) was designed and synthesized, and was found to be effective in blocking Tb PTR1 activity, with a K i in the low-micromolar range. The binding mode of 1 was clarified through the structural characterization of its ternary complex with Tb PTR1 and the cofactor NADP(H), which was determined to 1.30 Å resolution. The compound adopts a substrate-like orientation inside the cavity that maximizes the binding contributions of hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions. The binding mode of 1 was compared with those of previously reported bicyclic inhibitors, providing new insights for the design of innovative tricyclic-based molecules targeting Tb PTR1.",

Here, the X-ray crystallographic structure of a GBS BibA fragment (BibA 126–398 ) and a low-resolution small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) structure of the full-length N-terminal domain (BibA 34–400 ) are described. The BibA 126–398 fragment crystal structure displayed a novel and predominantly helical structure. The tertiary arrangement of helices forms four antiparallel three-helix-bundle-motif repeats, with one long helix from a bundle extending into the next. Multiple mutations on recombinant BibA 34–400 delayed the degradation of the protein, and circular dichroism spectroscopy of BibA 34–400 suggested a similar secondary-structure composition to that observed in the crystallized BibA 126–398 fragment. A model was generated for the 92 N-terminal residues (BibA 34–125 ) using structural similarity prediction programs, and a BibA 34–400 model was generated by combining the coordinates of BibA 34–126 and BibA 126–398 . The X-ray structure of BibA 126–398 and the model of BibA 34–400 fitted well into the calculated SAXS envelope. One possible binding site for the BibA N-terminal domain was localized to the N-terminal CCP (complement-control protein) domains of the C4BP α-chain, as indicated by the decreased binding of BibA to a ΔCCP1 C4BP α-chain mutant. In summary, it is suggested that the GBS surface protein BibA, which consists of three antiparallel α-helical-bundle motifs, is unique and belongs to a new class of Gram-positive surface adhesins.",

    "abstract": "Structural studies of glycoproteins and their complexes provide critical insights into their roles in normal physiology and disease. Most glycoproteins contain N-linked glycosylation, a key post-translation modification that critically affects protein folding and stability and the binding kinetics underlying protein interactions. However, N-linked glycosylation is often an impediment to yielding homogeneous protein preparations for structure determination by X-ray crystallography or other methods. In particular, obtaining diffraction-quality crystals of such proteins and their complexes often requires modification of both the type of glycosylation patterns and their extent. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of producing target glycoproteins in the GlycoDelete human embryonic kidney 293 cell line that has been engineered to produce N-glycans as short glycan stumps comprising N -acetylglucosamine, galactose and sialic acid. Protein fragments of human Down syndrome cell-adhesion molecule and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor were obtained from the GlycoDelete cell line for crystallization. The ensuing reduction in the extent and complexity of N -glycosylation in both protein molecules compared with alternative glycoengineering approaches enabled their productive deployment in structural studies by X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, a third successful implementation of the GlycoDelete technology focusing on murine IL-12B is shown to lead to N -glycosylation featuring an immature glycan in diffraction-quality crystals. It is proposed that the GlycoDelete cell line could serve as a valuable go-to option for the production of homogeneous glycoproteins and their complexes for structural studies by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy.",

A long-standing challenge for atomic model refinement has been the production of stereochemically meaningful models for this resolution regime. Here, it is demonstrated that including accurate model geometry restraints derived from ab initio quantum-chemical calculations (HF-D3/6-31G) can improve the refinement of an example structure (chain A of PDB entry 3j63). The robustness of the procedure is tested for additional structures with up to 7000 atoms (PDB entry 3a5x and chain C of PDB entry 5fn5) using the less expensive semi-empirical (GFN1-xTB) model.

    "abstract": "Hsp70 molecular chaperones facilitate protein disaggregation and proper folding through iterative cycles of polypeptide binding and release that are allosterically coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. Hsp70s are ubiquitous and highly conserved across all of life; they bind ATP at an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and client peptides in the substrate-binding domain (SBD). The NBD and SBD are connected by a highly conserved linker segment that is integrated into the NBD when ATP is bound but is flexible when the NBD is nucleotide-free or bound with ADP. Allosteric coupling is lost when the linker is flexible, and the freed SBD binds peptide clients with high affinity. It was recently discovered that Hsp70–ATP is in an equilibrium between a restraining state (R) with little affinity for peptides and a low ATPase activity, and a stimulating state (S) that binds peptides efficiently, but with rapid kinetics, and has a relatively high ATPase activity. While attempting to characterize the S state, crystal structures of DnaK–ATP were obtained that demonstrate intrinsic Hsp70 plasticity that affects binding interactions with substrate peptides. These structures provide insights into intermediate states along transition pathways in the Hsp70 chaperone cycle.",

It results in an optimally thin specimen providing low background while maintaining minute amounts of mother liquor around the crystals. The 2 × 2 mm area enables the deposition of up to several microlitres of liquid. Imaging and visualization of the crystals are straightforward on the highly transparent membrane.

Under zinc-deficient conditions, Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses a pool of metal homeostasis control systems that is complex compared with other Gram-negative bacteria and has only been partially characterized. Here, the structure and zinc-binding properties of the protein PA4063, the first component of the PA4063–PA4066 operon, are described. PA4063 has no homologs in other organisms and is characterized by the presence of two histidine-rich sequences. ITC titration detected two zinc-binding sites with micromolar affinity. Crystallographic characterization, performed both with and without zinc, revealed an α/β-sandwich structure that can be classified as a noncanonical ferredoxin-like fold since it differs in size and topology. The histidine-rich stretches located at the N-terminus and between β3 and β4 are disordered in the apo structure, but a few residues become structured in the presence of zinc, contributing to coordination in one of the two sites. The ability to bind two zinc ions at relatively low affinity, the absence of catalytic cavities and the presence of two histidine-rich loops are properties and structural features which suggest that PA4063 might play a role as a periplasmic zinc chaperone or as a concentration sensor useful for optimizing the response of the pathogen to zinc deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Thyroglobulin is a homodimeric glycoprotein that is essential for the generation of thyroid hormones in vertebrates. Upon secretion into the lumen of follicles in the thyroid gland, tyrosine residues within the protein become iodinated to produce monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). A subset of evolutionarily conserved pairs of DIT (and MIT) residues can then engage in oxidative coupling reactions that yield either thyroxine (T4; produced from coupling of a DIT `acceptor' with a DIT `donor') or triiodothyronine (T3; produced from coupling of a DIT acceptor with an MIT donor). Although multiple iodotyrosine residues have been identified as potential donors and acceptors, the specificity and structural context of the pairings (i.e. which donor is paired with which acceptor) have remained unclear. Here, single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) was used to generate a high-resolution reconstruction of bovine thyroglobulin (2.3 Å resolution in the core region and 2.6 Å overall), allowing the structural characterization of two post-reaction acceptor-donor pairs as well as tyrosine residues modified as MIT and DIT. A substantial spatial separation between donor Tyr149 and acceptor Tyr24 was observed, suggesting that for thyroxine synthesis significant peptide motion is required for coupling at the evolutionarily conserved thyroglobulin amino-terminus.",

The asymmetric unit of the P 2 1 crystal with a pseudohexagonal lattice contains four chimeric duplexes and 16 partial Ba 2+ sites. The chimeric (DNA–RNA) 2 duplexes have novel patterns of hydration and exhibit a high degree of discrete conformational disorder of their sugar-phosphate backbones, which can at least partly be correlated with the fractional occupancies of the barium ions. The crystals of the DNA–RNA chimeric duplex in complex with Ba 2+ ions and also with Sr 2+ ions exhibit complicated twinning, which in combination with structural pseudosymmetry made structure determination difficult. The structure could be successfully solved by molecular replacement in space groups P 1 and P 2 1 but not in orthorhombic or higher symmetry and, after scrupulous twinning and packing analysis, was refined in space group P 2 1 to an R and R free of 11.36 and 16.91%, respectively, using data extending to 1.09 Å resolution. With the crystal structure having monoclinic symmetry, the sixfold crystal twinning is a combination of threefold and twofold rotations. The paper describes the practical aspects of dealing with cases of complicated twinning and pseudosymmetry, and compares the available software tools for the refinement and analysis of such cases.",

Nevertheless, the collection of diffraction data of sufficient quality for experimental phasing is still a difficult and crucial step. Here, some examples of good data-collection practice for projects requiring experimental phasing are presented and recent developments at the ESRF Structural Biology beamlines that have facilitated these are illustrated.",

    "abstract": "Trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase (TreA) belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) and catalyzes the hydrolysis of trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) to yield glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. The products of this reaction can be further metabolized by the energy-generating glycolytic pathway. Here, crystal structures of Bacillus licheniformis TreA ( Bl TreA) and its R201Q mutant complexed with p -nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (R201Q– p PNG) are presented at 2.0 and 2.05 Å resolution, respectively. The overall structure of Bl TreA is similar to those of other GH13 family enzymes. However, detailed structural comparisons revealed that the catalytic site of Bl TreA contains a long loop that adopts a different conformation from those of other GH13 family members. Unlike the homologous regions of Bacillus cereus oligo-1,6-glucosidase ( Bc Ogl) and Erwinia rhapontici isomaltulose synthase (NX-5), the surface potential of the Bl TreA active site exhibits a largely positive charge contributed by the four basic residues His281, His282, Lys284 and Lys292. Mutation of these residues resulted in significant decreases in the enzymatic activity of Bl TreA. Strikingly, the 281 HHLK 284 motif and Lys292 play critical roles in substrate discrimination by Bl TreA.",

    "abstract": "Starch accumulates in the plastids of green plant tissues during the day to provide carbon for metabolism at night. Starch hydrolysis is catalyzed by members of the β-amylase (BAM) family, which in Arabidopsis thaliana (At) includes nine structurally and functionally diverse members. One of these enzymes, AtBAM2, is a plastid-localized enzyme that is unique among characterized β-amylases since it is tetrameric and exhibits sigmoidal kinetics. Sequence alignments show that the BAM domains of AtBAM7, a catalytically inactive, nuclear-localized transcription factor with an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, and AtBAM2 are more closely related to each other than they are to any other AtBAM. Since the BAM2 gene is found in more ancient lineages, it was hypothesized that the BAM7 gene evolved from BAM2 . However, analysis of the genomes of 48 flowering plants revealed 12 species that appear to possess a BAM7 gene but lack a BAM2 gene. Upon closer inspection, these BAM7 proteins have a greater percent identity to AtBAM2 than to AtBAM7, and they share all of the AtBAM2 functional residues that BAM7 proteins normally lack. It is hypothesized that these genes may encode BAM2-like proteins although they are currently annotated as BAM7-like genes. To test this hypothesis, a cDNA for the short form of corn BAM7 (ZmBAM7-S) was designed for expression in Escherichia coli . Small-angle X-ray scattering data indicate that ZmBAM7-S has a tetrameric solution structure that is more similar to that of AtBAM2 than to that of AtBAM1. In addition, partially purified ZmBAM7-S is catalytically active and exhibits sigmoidal kinetics. Together, these data suggest that some BAM7 genes may encode a functional BAM2. Exploring and understanding the β-amylase gene structure could have an impact on the current annotation of genes.",

    "abstract": "One often observes small but measurable differences in the diffraction data measured from different crystals of a single protein. These differences might reflect structural differences in the protein and may reveal the natural dynamism of the molecule in solution. Partitioning these mixed-state data into single-state clusters is a critical step that could extract information about the dynamic behavior of proteins from hundreds or thousands of single-crystal data sets. Mixed-state data can be obtained deliberately (through intentional perturbation) or inadvertently (while attempting to measure highly redundant single-crystal data). To the extent that different states adopt different molecular structures, one expects to observe differences in the crystals; each of the polystates will create a polymorph of the crystals. After mixed-state diffraction data have been measured, deliberately or inadvertently, the challenge is to sort the data into clusters that may represent relevant biological polystates. Here, this problem is addressed using a simple multi-factor clustering approach that classifies each data set using independent observables, thereby assigning each data set to the correct location in conformational space. This procedure is illustrated using two independent observables, unit-cell parameters and intensities, to cluster mixed-state data from chymotrypsinogen (ChTg) crystals. It is observed that the data populate an arc of the reaction trajectory as ChTg is converted into chymotrypsin.",

In determining the structure, several data-filtering strategies were tested for combining observations from the hundreds of crystals that contributed to the final data set. Removing data sets based on the average correlation coefficient among equivalent reflection intensities between a given data set and all others was most effective at improving the data quality and maintaining overall completeness. CRYs are light sensors that undergo conformational photoactivation. Comparisons between the cryogenic and room-temperature CRY structures reveal regions of enhanced mobility at room temperature in loops that have functional importance within the CRY family of proteins. The B factors of the room-temperature structure correlate well with those predicted from molecular-dynamics simulations.",

    "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of the calculation of limited-resolution maps from an atomic model in cryo-electron microscopy and in X-ray and neutron crystallography, including cases where the resolution varies from one molecular region to another. Such maps are necessary in real-space refinement for comparison with the experimental maps. For an appropriate numeric comparison, the calculated maps should reproduce not only the structural features contained in the experimental maps but also the principal map distortions. These model maps can be obtained with no use of Fourier transforms but, similar to density distributions, as a sum of individual atomic contributions. Such contributions, referred to as atomic density images, are atomic densities morphed to reflect distortions of the experimental map, in particular the loss of resolution. They are described by functions composed of a central peak surrounded by Fourier ripples. For practical calculations, atomic images should be cut at some distance. It is shown that to reach a reasonable accuracy such a distance should be significantly larger than the distance customarily applied when calculating density distributions. This is a consequence of the slow rate with which the amplitude of the Fourier ripples decreases. Such a large distance means that at least a few ripples should be included in calculations in order to obtain a map that is sufficiently accurate. Oscillating functions describing these atomic contributions depend, for a given atomic type, on the resolution and on the atomic displacement parameter values. To express both the central peak and the Fourier ripples of the atomic images, these functions are represented by the sums of especially designed terms, each concentrated in a spherical shell and depending analytically on the atomic parameters. In this work, the strength of the dependence of the accuracy of resulting map on the accuracy of the atomic displacement parameters and on the truncation distance, i.e. the number of ripples included in atomic density images, is analyzed. This analysis is completed by practical aspects of the calculation of maps of inhomogeneous resolution. Tests show that the calculation of limited-resolution maps from an atomic model as a sum of atomic contributions requires a large truncation radius extending beyond the central peak of an atomic image and the first Fourier ripples. The article discusses the practical details of such calculations expressing atomic contributions as analytic functions of the atomic coordinates, the atomic displacement parameters and the local resolution.",

Recent progress in serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) using X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) has made it possible to address these issues. In particular, mix-and-inject serial crystallography (MISC) is promising for the direct observation of structural changes associated with ongoing enzymic reactions. In this study, SFX measurements using a liquid-jet system were performed on microcrystals of bacterial copper amine oxidase anaerobically premixed with a substrate amine solution. The structure determined at 1.94 Å resolution indicated that the peptidyl quinone cofactor is in equilibrium between the aminoresorcinol and semiquinone radical intermediates, which accumulate only under anaerobic single-turnover conditions. These results show that anaerobic conditions were well maintained throughout the liquid-jet SFX measurements, preventing the catalytic intermediates from reacting with dioxygen. These results also provide a necessary framework for performing time-resolved MISC to study enzymic reaction mechanisms under anaerobic conditions.",

A comparison of the present AAV4 structure with prior corresponding structures of AAV5, AAV2 and AAV1 in complex with AAVR provides a foundation for understanding why the AAV4-like clade is unable to interact with either PKD1 or PKD2 of AAVR. The conformation of the AAV4 capsid in variable regions I, III, IV and V on the viral surface appears to be sufficiently different from AAV2 to ablate binding with PKD2.

    "abstract": "Structure determination of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is key for the successful development of efficient drugs targeting GPCRs. BRIL is a thermostabilized apocytochrome b 562 (with M7W/H102I/R106L mutations) from Escherichia coli and is often used as a GPCR fusion protein for expression and crystallization. SRP2070Fab, an anti-BRIL antibody Fab fragment, has been reported to facilitate and enhance the crystallization of BRIL-fused GPCRs as a crystallization chaperone. This study was conducted to characterize the high-resolution crystal structure of the BRIL–SRP2070Fab complex. The structure of the BRIL–SRP2070Fab complex was determined at 2.1 Å resolution. This high-resolution structure elucidates the binding interaction between BRIL and SRP2070Fab. When binding to BRIL, SRP2070Fab recognizes conformational epitopes, not linear epitopes, on the surface of BRIL helices III and IV, thereby binding perpendicularly to the helices, which indicates stable binding. Additionally, the packing contacts of the BRIL–SRP2070Fab co-crystal are largely due to SRP2070Fab rather than BRIL. The accumulation of SRP2070Fab molecules by stacking is remarkable and is consistent with the finding that stacking of SRP2070Fab is predominant in known crystal structures of BRIL-fused GPCRs complexed with SRP2070Fab. These findings clarified the mechanism of SRP2070Fab as a crystallization chaperone. Moreover, these data will be useful in the structure-based drug design of membrane-protein drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by Trypanosoma cruzi , whilst leishmaniasis, which is caused by over 20 species of Leishmania , represents a group of NTDs endemic to most countries in the tropical and subtropical belt of the planet. These diseases remain a significant health problem both in endemic countries and globally. These parasites and other trypanosomatids, including T. theileri , a bovine pathogen, rely on cysteine biosynthesis for the production of trypanothione, which is essential for parasite survival in hosts. The de novo pathway of cysteine biosynthesis requires the conversion of O -acetyl-L-serine into L-cysteine, which is catalysed by cysteine synthase (CS). These enzymes present potential for drug development against T. cruzi , Leishmania spp. and T. theileri . To enable these possibilities, biochemical and crystallographic studies of CS from T. cruzi ( Tc CS), L. infantum ( Li CS) and T. theileri ( Tth CS) were conducted. Crystal structures of the three enzymes were determined at resolutions of 1.80 Å for Tc CS, 1.75 Å for Li CS and 2.75 Å for Tth CS. These three homodimeric structures show the same overall fold and demonstrate that the active-site geometry is conserved, supporting a common reaction mechanism. Detailed structural analysis revealed reaction intermediates of the de novo pathway ranging from an apo structure of Li CS and holo structures of both Tc CS and Tth CS to the substrate-bound structure of Tc CS. These structures will allow exploration of the active site for the design of novel inhibitors. Additionally, unexpected binding sites discovered at the dimer interface represent new potential for the development of protein–protein inhibitors.",

However, the substrate-recognition and catalytic mechanism of ME remains unknown. In this study, structures of Runella slithyformis ME ( Rs ME) and its D254A mutant [ Rs ME(D254A)] were determined in their apo forms and as intermediate-analog complexes [ Rs ME–D-glucitol and Rs ME(D254A)–D-glucitol]. Rs ME possesses the (α/α) 6 -barrel of the AGE superfamily members but has a unique pocket-covering long loop (loop α7–α8 ). The Rs ME–D-glucitol structure showed that loop α7–α8 moves towards D-glucitol and closes the active pocket. Trp251 and Asp254 in loop α7–α8 are only conserved in MEs and interact with D-glucitol. Kinetic analyses of the mutants confirmed the importance of these residues for Rs ME activity. Moreover, the structures of Rs ME(D254A) and Rs ME(D254A)–D-glucitol revealed that Asp254 is vital for binding the ligand in a correct conformation and for active-pocket closure. Docking calculations and structural comparison with other 2-epimerases show that the longer loop α7–α8 in Rs ME causes steric hindrance upon binding to disaccharides. A detailed substrate-recognition and catalytic mechanism for monosaccharide-specific epimerization in Rs ME has been proposed.",

The compound is a bis-electrophile that is predicted to form interstrand DNA cross-links in target cells, leading to double-strand DNA breaks. The biosynthesis of colibactin is carried out by a mixed NRPS–PKS assembly line with several noncanonical features. An amidase, ClbL, plays a key role in the pathway, catalyzing the final step in the formation of the pseudodimeric scaffold. ClbL couples α-aminoketone and β-ketothioester intermediates attached to separate carrier domains on the NRPS–PKS assembly. Here, the 1.9 Å resolution structure of ClbL is reported, providing a structural basis for this key step in the colibactin biosynthetic pathway. The structure reveals an open hydrophobic active site surrounded by flexible loops, and comparison with homologous amidases supports its unusual function and predicts macromolecular interactions with pathway carrier-protein substrates. Modeling protein–protein interactions supports a predicted molecular basis for enzyme–carrier domain interactions. Overall, the work provides structural insight into this unique enzyme that is central to the biosynthesis of colibactin.",

Nevertheless, there is currently no commercially available chip (known to the authors) specifically designed for the direct handling of oxygen-sensitive samples. This study presents a methodology employing silicon nitride chips arranged in a `sandwich' configuration, enabling reliable room-temperature data collection from oxygen-sensitive samples. The method involves the utilization of a custom-made 3D-printed assembling tool and a MX sample holder.

    "abstract": "Hydrogen (H) atoms are abundant in macromolecules and often play critical roles in enzyme catalysis, ligand-recognition processes and protein–protein interactions. However, their direct visualization by diffraction techniques is challenging. Macromolecular X-ray crystallography affords the localization of only the most ordered H atoms at (sub-)atomic resolution (around 1.2 Å or higher). However, many H atoms of biochemical significance remain undetectable by this method. In contrast, neutron diffraction methods enable the visualization of most H atoms, typically in the form of deuterium ( 2 H) atoms, at much more common resolution values (better than 2.5 Å). Thus, neutron crystallography, although technically demanding, is often the method of choice when direct information on protonation states is sought. REFMAC 5 from the Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 ( CCP 4) is a program for the refinement of macromolecular models against X-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM data. This contribution describes its extension to include the refinement of structural models obtained from neutron crystallographic data. Stereochemical restraints with accurate bond distances between H atoms and their parent atom nuclei are now part of the CCP 4 Monomer Library, the source of prior chemical information used in the refinement. One new feature for neutron data analysis in REFMAC 5 is refinement of the protium/deuterium ( 1 H/ 2 H) fraction. This parameter describes the relative 1 H/ 2 H contribution to neutron scattering for hydrogen isotopes. The newly developed REFMAC 5 algorithms were tested by performing the (re-)refinement of several entries available in the PDB and of one novel structure (FutA) using either (i) neutron data only or (ii) neutron data supplemented by external restraints to a reference X-ray crystallographic structure. Re-refinement with REFMAC 5 afforded models characterized by R -factor values that are consistent with, and in some cases better than, the originally deposited values. The use of external reference structure restraints during refinement has been observed to be a valuable strategy, especially for structures at medium–low resolution.",

    "abstract": "Model building and refinement, and the validation of their correctness, are very effective and reliable at local resolutions better than about 2.5 Å for both crystallography and cryo-EM. However, at local resolutions worse than 2.5 Å both the procedures and their validation break down and do not ensure reliably correct models. This is because in the broad density at lower resolution, critical features such as protein backbone carbonyl O atoms are not just less accurate but are not seen at all, and so peptide orientations are frequently wrongly fitted by 90–180°. This puts both backbone and side chains into the wrong local energy minimum, and they are then worsened rather than improved by further refinement into a valid but incorrect rotamer or Ramachandran region. On the positive side, new tools are being developed to locate this type of pernicious error in PDB depositions, such as CaBLAM , EMRinger , Pperp diagnosis of ribose puckers, and peptide flips in PDB-REDO , while interactive modeling in Coot or ISOLDE can help to fix many of them. Another positive trend is that artificial intelligence predictions such as those made by AlphaFold 2 contribute additional evidence from large multiple sequence alignments, and in high-confidence parts they provide quite good starting models for loops, termini or whole domains with otherwise ambiguous density.",

Here, crystal structures of cyanase from Escherichia coli were determined in the native form and in complexes with cyanate, bicarbonate and intermediates at 1.5–1.9 Å resolution using synchrotron X-rays and an X-ray free-electron laser. Cyanate and bicarbonate interact with the highly conserved Arg96, Ser122 and Ala123 in the active site. In the presence of a mixture of cyanate and bicarbonate, three different electron densities for intermediates were observed in the cyanase structures. Moreover, the observed electron density could explain the dynamics of the substrate or product. In addition to conformational changes in the substrate-binding pocket, dynamic movement of Leu151 was observed, which functions as a gate for the passage of substrates or products.

The variants were complexed with the reaction product fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). The Thr84Ala mutant is inactive, while the Thr84Ser mutant has a lower catalytic activity. The structures reveal the presence of a 222 tetramer, similar to those described for fructose-1,6/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase from Synechocystis (strain 6803) as well as the equivalent enzyme from Thermosynechococcus elongatus . This homotetramer corresponds to a homologous oligomer that is present but not described in the crystal structure of FBPaseII from Escherichia coli and is probably conserved in all FBPaseIIs. The constellation of amino-acid residues in the active site of FBPaseII from M. tuberculosis ( Mt FBPaseII) is conserved and is analogous to that described previously for the E. coli enzyme. Moreover, the structure of the active site of the partially active (Thr84Ser) variant and the analysis of the kinetics are consistent with the previously proposed catalytic mechanism. The presence of metabolites in the crystallization medium (for example citrate and malonate) and in the corresponding crystal structures of Mt FBPaseII, combined with their observed inhibitory effect, could suggest the existence of an uncharacterized inhibition of this class of enzymes besides the allosteric inhibition by adenosine monophosphate observed for the Synechocystis enzyme. The structural and functional insights derived from the structure of Mt FBPaseII will provide critical information for the design of lead inhibitors, which will be used to validate this target for future chemical intervention.",

In this study, the dynamics of the active site and the communication paths between the substrates, ATP and TMP, are reported for thymidylate kinase from Thermus thermophilus. Conformational changes upon ligand binding and the path for communication between the substrates and the protein are important in understanding the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. High-resolution X-ray crystal structures of thymidylate kinase in apo and ligand-bound states were solved. This is the first report of structures of binary and ternary complexes of thymidylate kinase with its natural substrates ATP and ATP-TMP, respectively. Distinct conformations of the active-site residues, the P-loop and the LID region observed in the apo and ligand-bound structures revealed that their concerted motion is required for the binding and proper positioning of the substrate TMP. Structural analyses provide an insight into the mode of substrate binding at the active site. The residues involved in communication between the substrates were identified through network analysis using molecular-dynamics simulations. The residues identified showed high sequence conservation across species. Biochemical analyses show that mutations of these residues either resulted in a loss of activity or affected the thermal stability of the protein. Further, molecular-dynamics analyses of mutants suggest that the proper positioning of TMP is important for catalysis. These data also provide an insight into the phosphoryl-transfer mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Neutron macromolecular crystallography (NMX) has the potential to provide the experimental input to address unresolved aspects of transport mechanisms and protonation in membrane proteins. However, despite this clear scientific motivation, the practical challenges of obtaining crystals that are large enough to make NMX feasible have so far been prohibitive. Here, the potential impact on feasibility of a more powerful neutron source is reviewed and a strategy for obtaining larger crystals is formulated, exemplified by the calcium-transporting ATPase SERCA1. The challenges encountered at the various steps in the process from crystal nucleation and growth to crystal mounting are explored, and it is demonstrated that NMX-compatible membrane-protein crystals can indeed be obtained.",

    "abstract": "N -Acetylglucosamine 2-epimerases (AGEs) catalyze the interconversion of N -acetylglucosamine and N -acetylmannosamine. They can be used to perform the first step in the synthesis of sialic acid from N -acetylglucosamine, which makes the need for efficient AGEs a priority. This study presents the structure of the AGE from Nostoc sp. KVJ10 collected in northern Norway, referred to as nAGE10. It is the third AGE structure to be published to date, and the first one in space group P 4 2 2 1 2. The nAGE10 monomer folds as an (α/α) 6 barrel in a similar manner to that of the previously published AGEs, but the crystal did not contain the dimers that have previously been reported. The previously proposed `back-to-back' assembly involved the face of the AGE monomer where the barrel helices are connected by small loops. Instead, a `front-to-front' dimer was found in nAGE10 involving the long loops that connect the barrel helices at this end. This assembly is also present in the other AGE structures, but was attributed to crystal packing, even though the `front' interface areas are larger and are more conserved than the `back' interface areas. In addition, the front-to-front association allows a better explanation of the previously reported observations considering surface cysteines. Together, these results indicate that the `front-to-front' dimer is the most probable biological assembly for AGEs.",

The enzyme has become of acute interest given the intimate role of O-GlcNAcylation in tau modification and stability; small-molecular inhibitors of human O-GlcNAcase are under clinical assessment for the treatment of tauopathies. Given the importance of structure-based and mechanism-based inhibitor design for O-GlcNAcase, it was sought to test whether different crystal forms of the human enzyme could be achieved by surface mutagenesis. Guided by surface-entropy reduction, a Glu602Ala/Glu605Ala variant [on the Gly11–Gln396/Lys535–Tyr715 construct; Roth et al. (2017), Nature Chem. Biol. 13 , 610–612] was obtained which led to a new crystal form of the human enzyme. An increase in crystal contacts stabilized disordered regions of the protein, enabling 88% of the structure to be modelled; only 83% was possible for the wild-type construct. Although the binding of the C-terminus was consistent with the wild type, Lys713 in monomer A was bound in the −1 subsite of the symmetry-related monomer A and the active sites of the B monomers were vacant. The new crystal form presents an opportunity for enhanced soaking experiments that are essential to understanding the binding mechanism and substrate specificity of O-GlcNAcase.",

    "abstract": "Harnessing the anomalous signal from macromolecular crystals with volumes of less than 10 000 µm 3 for native phasing requires careful experimental planning. The type of anomalous scatterers that are naturally present in the sample, such as sulfur, phosphorus and calcium, will dictate the beam energy required and determine the level of radiation sensitivity, while the crystal size will dictate the beam size and the sample-mounting technique, in turn indicating the specifications of a suitable beamline. On the EMBL beamline P13 at PETRA III, Mesh&amp;Collect data collection from concanavalin A microcrystals with linear dimensions of ∼20 µm or less using an accordingly sized microbeam at a wavelength of 1.892 Å (6.551 keV, close to the Mn edge at 6.549 keV) increases the expected Bijvoet ratio to 2.1% from an expected 0.7% at 12.6 keV (Se K edge), thus allowing experimental phase determination using the anomalous signal from naturally present Mn 2+ and Ca 2+ ions. Dozens of crystals were harvested and flash-cryocooled in micro-meshes, rapidly screened for diffraction (less than a minute per loop) and then used for serial Mesh&amp;Collect collection of about 298 partial data sets (10° of crystal rotation per sample). The partial data sets were integrated and scaled. A genetic algorithm for combining partial data sets was used to select those to be merged into a single data set. This final data set showed high completeness, high multiplicity and sufficient anomalous signal to locate the anomalous scatterers, and provided phasing information which allowed complete auto-tracing of the polypeptide chain. To allow the complete experiment to run in less than 2 h, a practically acceptable time frame, the diffractometer and detector had to run together with limited manual intervention. The combination of several cutting-edge components allowed accurate anomalous signal to be measured from small crystals.",

    "abstract": "Data pathologies caused by effects such as diffraction anisotropy and translational noncrystallographic symmetry (tNCS) can dramatically complicate the solution of the crystal structures of macromolecules. Such problems were encountered in determining the structure of a mutant form of Rab27a, a member of the Rab GTPases. Mutant Rab27a constructs that crystallize in the free form were designed for use in the discovery of drugs to reduce primary tumour invasiveness and metastasis. One construct, hRab27a Mut , crystallized within 24 h and diffracted to 2.82 Å resolution, with a unit cell possessing room for a large number of protein copies. Initial efforts to solve the structure using molecular replacement by Phaser were not successful. Analysis of the data set revealed that the crystals suffered from both extreme anisotropy and strong tNCS. As a result, large numbers of reflections had estimated standard deviations that were much larger than their measured intensities and their expected intensities, revealing problems with the use of such data at the time in Phaser . By eliminating extremely weak reflections with the largest combined effects of anisotropy and tNCS, these problems could be avoided, allowing a molecular-replacement solution to be found. The lessons that were learned in solving this structure have guided improvements in the numerical analysis used in Phaser , particularly in identifying diffraction measurements that convey very little information content. The calculation of information content could also be applied as an alternative to ellipsoidal truncation. The post-mortem analysis also revealed an oversight in accounting for measurement errors in the fast rotation function. While the crystal of mutant Rab27a is not amenable to drug screening, the structure can guide new modifications to obtain more suitable crystal forms.",

This acetylation inactivates spermidine, reducing the polyamine toxicity that tends to occur under certain chemical and physical stresses. The structure of the SpeG protein from Vibrio cholerae has been characterized: while the monomer possesses a structural fold similar to those of other Gcn5-related N -acetyltransferase superfamily members, its dodecameric structure remains exceptional. In this paper, structural analyses of SpeG isolated from Escherichia coli are described. Like V. cholerae SpeG, E. coli SpeG forms dodecamers, as revealed by two crystal structures of the ligand-free E. coli SpeG dodecamer determined at 1.75 and 2.9 Å resolution. Although both V. cholerae SpeG and E. coli SpeG can adopt an asymmetric open dodecameric state, solution analysis showed that the oligomeric composition of ligand-free E. coli SpeG differs from that of ligand-free V. cholerae SpeG. Based on these data, it is proposed that the equilibrium balance of SpeG oligomers in the absence of ligands differs from one species to another and thus might be important for SpeG function.",

    "abstract": "In the structural biology of bacterial substrate-binding proteins (SBPs), a growing number of comparisons between substrate-bound and substrate-free forms of metal atom-binding (cluster A-I) SBPs have revealed minimal structural differences between forms. These observations contrast with SBPs that bind substrates such as amino acids or nucleic acids and may undergo &gt;60° rigid-body rotations. Substrate transfer in these SBPs is described by a Venus flytrap model, although this model may not apply to all SBPs. In this report, structures are presented of substrate-free (apo) and reconstituted substrate-bound (holo) YfeA, a polyspecific cluster A-I SBP from Yersinia pestis . It is demonstrated that an apo cluster A-I SBP can be purified by fractionation when co-expressed with its cognate transporter, adding an alternative strategy to the mutagenesis or biochemical treatment used to generate other apo cluster A-I SBPs. The apo YfeA structure contains 111 disordered protein atoms in a mobile helix located in the flexible carboxy-terminal lobe. Metal binding triggers a 15-fold reduction in the solvent-accessible surface area of the metal-binding site and reordering of the 111 protein atoms in the mobile helix. The flexible lobe undergoes a 13.6° rigid-body rotation that is driven by a spring-hammer metal-binding mechanism. This asymmetric rigid-body rotation may be unique to metal atom-binding SBPs ( i.e. clusters A-I, A-II and D-IV).",

    "abstract": "Substantial advances have been made in the computational design of protein interfaces over the last 20 years. However, the interfaces targeted by design have typically been stable and high-affinity. Here, we report the development of a generic computational design method to stabilize the weak interactions at crystallographic interfaces. Initially, we analyzed structures reported in the Protein Data Bank to determine whether crystals with more stable interfaces result in higher resolution structures. We found that for 22 variants of a single protein crystallized by a single individual, the Rosetta -calculated `crystal score' correlates with the reported diffraction resolution. We next developed and tested a computational design protocol, seeking to identify point mutations that would improve resolution in a highly stable variant of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase). Using a protocol based on fixed protein backbones, only one of the 11 initial designs crystallized, indicating modeling inaccuracies and forcing us to re-evaluate our strategy. To compensate for slight changes in the local backbone and side-chain environment, we subsequently designed on an ensemble of minimally perturbed protein backbones. Using this strategy, four of the seven designed proteins crystallized. By collecting diffraction data from multiple crystals per design and solving crystal structures, we found that the designed crystals improved the resolution modestly and in unpredictable ways, including altering the crystal space group. Post hoc , in silico analysis of the three observed space groups for SNase showed that the native space group was the lowest scoring for four of six variants (including the wild type), but that resolution did not correlate with crystal score, as it did in the preliminary results. Collectively, our results show that calculated crystal scores can correlate with reported resolution, but that the correlation is absent when the problem is inverted. This outcome suggests that more comprehensive modeling of the crystallographic state is necessary to design high-resolution protein crystals from poorly diffracting crystals.",

    "abstract": "Although often presented as taking single `snapshots' of the conformation of a protein, X-ray crystallography provides an averaged structure over time and space within the crystal. The important but difficult task of characterizing structural ensembles in crystals is typically limited to small conformational changes, such as multiple side-chain conformations. A crystallographic method was recently introduced that utilizes residual electron and anomalous density (READ) to characterize structural ensembles encompassing large-scale structural changes. Key to this method is an ability to accurately measure anomalous signals and distinguish them from noise or other anomalous scatterers. This report presents an optimized data-collection and analysis strategy for partially occupied iodine anomalous signals. Using the long-wavelength-optimized beamline I23 at Diamond Light Source, the ability to accurately distinguish the positions of anomalous scatterers with occupancies as low as ∼12% is demonstrated. The number and positions of these anomalous scatterers are consistent with previous biophysical, kinetic and structural data that suggest that the protein Im7 binds to the chaperone Spy in multiple partially occupied conformations. Finally, READ selections demonstrate that re-measured data using the new protocols are consistent with the previously characterized structural ensemble of the chaperone Spy with its client Im7. This study shows that a long-wavelength beamline results in easily validated anomalous signals that are strong enough to be used to detect and characterize highly disordered sections of crystal structures.",

    "abstract": "Tryptophan synthase catalyzes the last two steps of tryptophan biosynthesis in plants, fungi and bacteria. It consists of two protein chains, designated α and β, encoded by trpA and trpB genes, that function as an αββα complex. Structural and functional features of tryptophan synthase have been extensively studied, explaining the roles of individual residues in the two active sites in catalysis and allosteric regulation. TrpA serves as a model for protein-folding studies. In 1969, Jackson and Yanofsky observed that the typically monomeric TrpA forms a small population of dimers. Dimerization was postulated to take place through an exchange of structural elements of the monomeric chains, a phenomenon later termed 3D domain swapping. The structural details of the TrpA dimer have remained unknown. Here, the crystal structure of the Streptococcus pneumoniae TrpA homodimer is reported, demonstrating 3D domain swapping in a TIM-barrel fold for the first time. The N-terminal domain comprising the H0–S1–H1–S2 elements is exchanged, while the hinge region corresponds to loop L2 linking strand S2 to helix H2′. The structural elements S2 and L2 carry the catalytic residues Glu52 and Asp63. As the S2 element is part of the swapped domain, the architecture of the catalytic apparatus in the dimer is recreated from two protein chains. The homodimer interface overlaps with the α–β interface of the tryptophan synthase αββα heterotetramer, suggesting that the 3D domain-swapped dimer cannot form a complex with the β subunit. In the crystal, the dimers assemble into a decamer comprising two pentameric rings.",

This makes information gain a natural criterion for deciding which data can legitimately be omitted from likelihood calculations. Many existing methods use an approximation for the effects of measurement error that breaks down for very weak and poorly measured data. For such methods a different (higher) information threshold is appropriate compared with methods that account well for even large measurement errors. Concerns are raised about a current trend to deposit data that have been corrected for anisotropy, sharpened and pruned without including the original unaltered measurements. If not checked, this trend will have serious consequences for the reuse of deposited data by those who hope to repeat calculations using improved new methods.",

PATZ1 exerts its activity through an N-terminal BTB domain that mediates dimerization and co-repressor interactions and a C-terminal zinc-finger motif-containing domain that mediates DNA binding. Here, the crystal structures of the murine and zebrafish PATZ1 BTB domains are reported at 2.3 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively.

Analysis of the lateral groove revealed a large acidic patch in this region, which contrasts with the previously resolved basic co-repressor binding interface of BCL6. A large 30-amino-acid glycine- and alanine-rich central loop, which is unique to mammalian PATZ1 amongst all ZBTB proteins, could not be resolved, probably owing to its flexibility. Molecular-dynamics simulations suggest a contribution of this loop to modulation of the mammalian BTB dimerization interface.",

For the enzyme Xcc4156 from Xanthomonas campestris , the structure of a complex with the cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and a bromide ion would be of particular interest as this enzyme exclusively brominates model substrates in vitro . Apo Xcc4156 crystals diffracted to 1.6 Å resolution. The structure revealed an open substrate-binding site lacking the loop regions that close off the active site and contribute to substrate binding in tryptophan halogenases. Therefore, Xcc4156 might accept larger substrates, possibly even peptides. Soaking of apo Xcc4156 crystals with FAD led to crumbling of the intergrown crystals. Around half of the crystals soaked with FAD did not diffract, while in the others there was no electron density for FAD. The FAD-binding loop, which changes its conformation between the apo and the FAD-bound form in related enzymes, is involved in a crystal contact in the apo Xcc4156 crystals. The conformational change that is predicted to occur upon FAD binding would disrupt this crystal contact, providing a likely explanation for the destruction of the apo crystals in the presence of FAD. Soaking with only bromide did not result in bromide bound to the catalytic halide-binding site. Simultaneous soaking with FAD and bromide damaged the crystals more severely than soaking with only FAD. Together, these latter two observations suggest that FAD and bromide bind to Xcc4156 with positive cooperativity. Thus, apo Xcc4156 crystals provide functional insight into FAD and bromide binding, even though neither the cofactor nor the halide is visible in the structure.",

In this article, crystal structures are presented of the L29C mutant of Homo sapiens CRABPI in complex with naturally occurring fatty acids (1.64 Å resolution) and with the synthetic retinoid DC645 (2.41 Å resolution), and of CRABPII in complex with the ligands DC479 (1.80 Å resolution) and DC645 (1.71 Å resolution). DC645 and DC479 are two potential drug compounds identified in a recent synthetic retinoid development program. In particular, DC645 has recently been shown to have disease-modifying capabilities in neurodegenerative disease models by activating both genomic and nongenomic signalling pathways. These co-crystal structures demonstrate a canonical binding behaviour akin to that exhibited with all- trans -retinoic acid and help to explain how the compounds are able to exert an influence on part of the retinoid signalling cascade.",

    "abstract": "The products of alginate degradation, alginate oligosaccharides (AOS), have potential applications in many areas, including functional foods and marine drugs. Enzyme-based approaches using alginate lyases have advantages in the preparation of well defined AOS and have attracted much attention in recent years. However, a lack of structural insight into the whole substrate-binding cleft for most known alginate lyases severely hampers their application in the industrial generation of well defined AOS. To solve this issue, AlyF was co-crystallized with the long alginate oligosaccharide G6 (L-hexaguluronic acid hexasodium salt), which is the longest bound substrate in all solved alginate lyase complex structures. AlyF formed interactions with G6 from subsites −3 to +3 without additional substrate-binding site interactions, suggesting that the substrate-binding cleft of AlyF was fully occupied by six sugars, which was further confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry analyses. More importantly, a combination of structural comparisons and mutagenetic analyses determined that three key loops (loop 1, Lys215–Glu236; loop 2, Gln402–Ile416; loop 3, Arg334–Gly348) mainly function in binding long substrates (degree of polymerization of &gt;4). The potential flexibility of loop 1 and loop 2 might enable the substrate to continue to enter the cleft after binding to subsites +1 to +3; loop 3 stabilizes and orients the substrate at subsites −2 and −3. Taken together, these results provide the first possible alginate lyase–substrate binding profile for long-chain alginates, facilitating the rational design of new enzymes for industrial purposes.",

    "abstract": "P II proteins are ubiquitous signaling proteins that are involved in the regulation of the nitrogen/carbon balance in bacteria, archaea, and some plants and algae. Signal transduction via P II proteins is modulated by effector molecules and post-translational modifications in the P II T-loop. Whereas the binding of ADP, ATP and the concomitant binding of ATP and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) engender two distinct conformations of the T-loop that either favor or disfavor the interaction with partner proteins, the structural consequences of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, uridylylation and adenylylation are far less well understood. In the present study, crystal structures of the P II protein GlnK from Corynebacterium glutamicum have been determined, namely of adenylylated GlnK (adGlnK) and unmodified unadenylylated GlnK (unGlnK). AdGlnK has been proposed to act as an inducer of the transcription repressor AmtR, and the adenylylation of Tyr51 in GlnK has been proposed to be a prerequisite for this function. The structures of unGlnK and adGlnK allow the first atomic insights into the structural implications of the covalent attachment of an AMP moiety to the T-loop. The overall GlnK fold remains unaltered upon adenylylation, and T-loop adenylylation does not appear to interfere with the formation of the two major functionally important T-loop conformations, namely the extended T-loop in the canonical ADP-bound state and the compacted T-loop that is adopted upon the simultaneous binding of Mg-ATP and 2OG. Thus, the P II -typical conformational switching mechanism appears to be preserved in GlnK from C. glutamicum , while at the same time the functional repertoire becomes expanded through the accommodation of a peculiar post-translational modification.",

At SPring-8, the feasibility of the fixed-target approach was examined by collecting data using a 2D raster scan combined with goniometer rotation. Results at cryogenic temperatures demonstrated that rotation is effective for efficient data collection in SSX and the method was named serial synchrotron rotation crystallography (SS-ROX). To use this method for room-temperature (RT) data collection, a humid air and glue-coating (HAG) method was developed in which data were collected from polyvinyl alcohol-coated microcrystals fixed on a loop under humidity-controlled air. The performance and the RT data-collection strategy for micro-crystallography were evaluated using microcrystals of lysozyme. Although a change in unit-cell dimensions of up to 1% was observed during data collection, the impact on data quality was marginal. A comparison of data obtained at various absorbed doses revealed that absorbed doses of up to 210 kGy were tolerable in both global and local damage. Although this limits the number of photons deposited on each crystal, increasing the number of merged images improved the resolution. On the basis of these results, an equation was proposed that relates the achievable resolution to the total photon flux used to obtain a data set.",

Because Betacoronavirus PLPs have been well characterized, it was sought to determine how PLP2 from the alphacoronavirus PEDV differentiates itself from its related counterparts. PEDV PLP2 was first biochemically characterized, and a 3.1 Å resolution crystal structure of PEDV PLP2 bound to Ub was then solved, providing insight into how Alphacoronavirus PLPs bind to their preferred substrate, Ub. It was found that PEDV PLP2 is a deubiquitinase and readily processes a variety of di-Ub linkages, in comparison with its Betacoronavirus counterparts, which have a narrower range of di-Ub activity but process both Ub and ISG15.",

    "abstract": "The thermophilic fungus Malbranchea cinnamomea contains a host of enzymes that enable its ability as an efficient degrader of plant biomass and that could be mined for industrial applications. This thermophilic fungus has been studied and found to encode eight lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) from auxiliary activity family 9 (AA9), which collectively possess different substrate specificities for a range of plant cell-wall-related polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. To gain greater insight into the molecular determinants defining the different specificities, structural studies were pursued and the structure of McAA9F was determined. The enzyme contains the immunoglobulin-like fold typical of previously solved AA9 LPMO structures, but contains prominent differences in the loop regions found on the surface of the substrate-binding site. Most significantly, McAA9F has a broad substrate specificity, with activity on both crystalline and soluble polysaccharides. Moreover, it contains a small loop in a region where a large loop has been proposed to govern specificity towards oligosaccharides. The presence of the small loop leads to a considerably flatter and more open surface that is likely to enable the broad specificity of the enzyme. The enzyme contains a succinimide residue substitution, arising from intramolecular cyclization of Asp10, at a position where several homologous members contain an equivalent residue but cyclization has not previously been observed. This first structure of an AA9 LPMO from M. cinnamomea aids both the understanding of this family of enzymes and the exploration of the repertoire of industrially relevant lignocellulolytic enzymes from this fungus.",

    "abstract": "The mutual penetration of electron densities between two interacting molecules complicates the computation of an accurate electrostatic interaction energy based on a pseudo-atom representation of electron densities. The numerical exact potential and multipole moment (nEP/MM) method is time-consuming since it performs a 3D integration to obtain the electrostatic energy at short interaction distances. Nguyen et al. [(2018), Acta Cryst. A74, 524-536] recently reported a fully analytical computation of the electrostatic interaction energy (aEP/MM). This method performs much faster than nEP/MM (up to two orders of magnitude) and remains highly accurate. A new program library, Charger, contains an implementation of the aEP/MM method. Charger has been incorporated into the MoProViewer software. Benchmark tests on a series of small molecules containing only C, H, N and O atoms show the efficiency of Charger in terms of execution time and accuracy. Charger is also powerful in a study of electrostatic symbiosis between a protein and a ligand. It determines reliable protein-ligand interaction energies even when both contain S atoms. It easily estimates the individual contribution of every residue to the total protein-ligand electrostatic binding energy. Glutathione transferase (GST) in complex with a benzophenone ligand was studied due to the availability of both structural and thermodynamic data. The resulting analysis highlights not only the residues that stabilize the ligand but also those that hinder ligand binding from an electrostatic point of view. This offers new perspectives in the search for mutations to improve the interaction between the two partners. A proposed mutation would improve ligand binding to GST by removing an electrostatic obstacle, rather than by the traditional increase in the number of favourable contacts.",

In this study, a technique for determining the deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) contrast map in neutron macromolecular crystallography is developed and evaluated using ribonuclease A. The contrast map between the D2O-solvent and H2O-solvent crystals is calculated in real space, rather than in reciprocal space as performed in previous neutron D/H contrast crystallography. The present technique can thus utilize all of the amplitudes of the neutron structure factors for both D2O-solvent and H2O-solvent crystals. The neutron D/H contrast maps clearly demonstrate the powerful detectability of H/D exchange in proteins. In fact, alternative protonation states and alternative conformations of hydroxyl groups are observed at medium resolution (1.8 Å). Moreover, water molecules can be categorized into three types according to their tendency towards rotational disorder. These results directly indicate improvement in the neutron crystal structure analysis. This technique is suitable for incorporation into the standard structure-determination process used in neutron protein crystallography; consequently, more precise and efficient determination of the D-atom positions is possible using a combination of this D/H contrast technique and standard neutron structure-determination protocols.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial genus Mycobacterium includes important pathogens, most notably M. tuberculosis , which infects one-quarter of the entire human population, resulting in around 1.4 million deaths from tuberculosis each year. Mycobacteria, and the closely related corynebacteria, synthesize a class of abundant glycolipids, the phosphatidyl- myo -inositol mannosides (PIMs). PIMs serve as membrane anchors for hyperglycosylated species, lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which are surface-exposed and modulate the host immune response. Previously, in studies using the model species Corynebacterium glutamicum , NCgl2760 was identified as a novel membrane protein that is required for the synthesis of full-length LM and LAM. Here, the first crystal structure of its ortholog in Mycobacterium smegmatis , MSMEG_0317, is reported at 1.8 Å resolution. The structure revealed an elongated β-barrel fold enclosing two distinct cavities and one α-helix extending away from the β-barrel core, resembling a `cone with a flake' arrangement. Through xenon derivatization and structural comparison with AlphaFold 2-derived predictions of the M. tuberculosis homolog Rv0227c, structural elements were identified that may undergo conformational changes to switch from `closed' to `open' conformations, allowing cavity access. An AlphaFold 2-derived NCgl2760 model predicted a smaller β-barrel core with an enclosed central cavity, suggesting that all three proteins, which were collectively termed LmcA, may have a common mechanism of ligand binding through these cavities. These findings provide new structural insights into the biosynthetic pathway for a family of surface lipoglycans with important roles in mycobacterial pathogenesis.",

Here, a novel model-refinement strategy centred around the technique is outlined and its utility is demonstrated by analysing data series from several SEC–SAXS experiments on phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs. Using this method, a single model was globally refined against many frames from the same data series, thereby capturing the frame-to-frame tendencies of the irradiated sample. These are compared with models refined in the traditional manner, in which refinement is based on the average profile of a set of consecutive frames from the same data series without an in-depth comparison of individual frames. This is considered to be an attractive model-refinement scheme as it considerably lowers the total number of parameters refined from the data series, produces tendencies that are automatically consistent between frames, and utilizes a considerably larger portion of the recorded data than is often performed in such experiments. Additionally, a method is outlined for correcting a measured UV absorption signal by accounting for potential peak broadening by the experimental setup.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-EM images have extremely low signal-to-noise levels because biological macromolecules are highly radiation-sensitive, requiring low-dose imaging, and because the molecules are poor in contrast. Confident recovery of the signal requires the averaging of many images, the iterative optimization of parameters and the introduction of much prior information. Poor parameter estimates, overfitting and variations in signal strength and resolution across the resulting reconstructions remain frequent issues. Because biological samples are real-space phenomena, exhibiting local variations, real-space measures can be both more reliable and more appropriate than Fourier-space measures. Real-space measures can be calculated separately over each differing region of an image or volume. Real-space filters can be applied according to the local need. Powerful prior information, not available in Fourier space, can be introduced in real space. Priors can be applied in real space in ways that Fourier space precludes. The treatment of biological phenomena remains highly dependent on spatial frequency, however, which would normally be handled in Fourier space. We believe that measures and filters based around real-space operations on extracted frequency bands, i.e. a series of band-pass filtered real-space volumes, and over real-space densities of striding (sequentially increasing or decreasing) resolution through Fourier space are the best way to address this and will perform better than global Fourier-space-based approaches. Future developments in image processing within the field are generally expected to be based on a mixture of both rationally designed and deep-learning approaches, and to incorporate novel prior information from developments such as AlphaFold . Regardless of approach, it is clear that `locality', through real-space measures, filters and processing, will become central to image processing.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of crystal defects induced by irradiation, such as X-rays, charged particles and neutrons, is important for understanding radiation damage and the associated generation of defects. Radiation damage to protein crystals has been measured using various methods. Until now, these methods have focused on decreased diffraction intensity, volume expansion of unit cells and specific damage to side chains. Here, the direct observation of specific crystal defects, such as dislocations, induced by X-ray irradiation of protein crystals at room temperature is reported. Dislocations are induced even by low absorbed doses of X-ray irradiation. This study revealed that for the same total absorbed dose, the formation of defects appears to critically depend on the dose rate. The relationship between dislocation energy and dose energy was analyzed based on dislocation theory associated with elasticity theory for crystalline materials. This demonstration of the crystal defects induced by X-ray irradiation could help to understand the underlying mechanisms of X-ray-induced radiation damage.",

The enzyme, termed Hjc_15-6, is encoded in the genome of phage Tth15-6, which infects Thermus thermophilus . Hjc_15-6 was heterologously produced in Escherichia coli and high yields of soluble and biologically active recombinant enzyme were obtained in both complex and defined media. Amino-acid sequence and structure comparison suggested that the enzyme belongs to a group of enzymes classified as archaeal Holliday junction-resolving enzymes, which are typically divalent metal ion-binding dimers that are able to cleave X-shaped dsDNA–Holliday junctions (Hjs). The crystal structure of Hjc_15-6 was determined to 2.5 Å resolution using the selenomethionine single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. To our knowledge, this is the first crystal structure of an Hj-resolving enzyme originating from a bacteriophage that can be classified as an archaeal type of Hj-resolving enzyme. As such, it represents a new fold for Hj-resolving enzymes from phages. Characterization of the structure of Hjc_15-6 suggests that it may form a dimer, or even a homodimer of dimers, and activity studies show endonuclease activity towards Hjs. Furthermore, based on sequence analysis it is proposed that Hjc_15-6 has a three-part catalytic motif corresponding to E–SD–EVK, and this motif may be common among other Hj-resolving enzymes originating from thermophilic bacteriophages.",

    "abstract": "The ease with which racemic mixtures crystallize compared with the equivalent chiral systems is routinely taken advantage of to produce crystals of small molecules. However, biological macromolecules such as DNA and proteins are naturally chiral, and thus the limited range of chiral space groups available hampers the crystallization of such molecules. Inspiring work over the past 15 years has shown that racemic mixtures of proteins, which were made possible by impressive advances in protein chemical synthesis, can indeed improve the success rate of protein crystallization experiments. More recently, the racemic crystallization approach was extended to include nucleic acids as a possible aid in the determination of enantiopure DNA crystal structures. Here, findings are reported that suggest that the benefits may extend beyond this. Two racemic crystal structures of the DNA sequence d(CCCGGG) are described which were found to fold into A-form DNA. This form differs from the Z-form DNA conformation adopted by the chiral equivalent in the solid state, suggesting that the use of racemates may also favour the emergence of new conformations. Importantly, the racemic mixture forms interactions in the solid state that differ from the chiral equivalent (including the formation of racemic pseudo-helices), suggesting that the use of racemic DNA mixtures could provide new possibilities for the design of precise self-assembled nanomaterials and nanostructures.",

    "abstract": "Hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) is an enzymatic protein with two acidic amino acids, Glu35 and Asp52, in its active site. Glu35 acts as a proton donor to the substrate and Asp52 interacts with the positively charged substrate, suggesting different protonation states of these residues. However, neutron crystallographic studies thus far have not provided a consistent picture of the protonation states of these residues. Only one study succeeded in observing the active protonation states of Glu35 and Asp52 in the triclinic crystal system. However, their active states in the most widely studied tetragonal crystal system are still unknown. The application of the D/H contrast technique in neutron crystallography improves the ability to locate exchangeable D/H atoms in proteins. In the present study, D2O and H2O solvent crystals were prepared. Each neutron data set was collected for only five days by combining a time-of-flight diffractometer (iBIX) and the spallation neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex. The D/H contrast map provided better visualization of the D/H atoms in HEWL than the conventional neutron scattering length density map. The neutron D/H contrast map demonstrated the alternative protonation of the OE1 and OE2 atoms in the carboxyl group of Glu35. This alternative protonation occurs in the absence of a substrate, where high selectivity of the protonation site does not occur. In this case, only the OE1-HE1 bond attacks the substrate in an equilibrium between OE1-HE1 and OE2-HE2, or the H+ ion of the OE2-HE2 bond moves to the OE1 atom just before or after substrate binding to initiate the catalytic reaction. In contrast, the carboxyl group of Asp52 is not protonated. Protonation of the carboxyl group was not observed for other Asp and Glu residues. These results are consistent with results from NMR spectroscopy and explain the protonation states at the active site in the apo form of HEWL.",

    "abstract": "A remarkable number of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other as yet unmonitored lineages harbor amino-acid substitutions with the potential to modulate the interface between the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its receptor ACE2. The naturally occurring Q498Y substitution, which is present in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, has drawn the attention of several investigations. While computational predictions and in vitro binding studies suggest that Q498Y increases the binding affinity of the spike protein for ACE2, experimental in vivo models of infection have shown that a triple mutant carrying the Q498Y replacement is fatal in mice. To accurately characterize the binding kinetics of the RBD Q498Y-ACE2 interaction, biolayer interferometry analyses were performed. A significant enhancement of the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity relative to a reference SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern carrying three simultaneous replacements was observed. In addition, the RBD Q498Y mutant bound to ACE2 was crystallized. Compared with the structure of its wild-type counterpart, the RBD Q498Y-ACE2 complex reveals the conservation of major hydrogen-bond interactions and a more populated, nonpolar set of contacts mediated by the bulky side chain of Tyr498 that collectively lead to this increase in binding affinity. In summary, these studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of a relevant mutation present in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants which might lead to stronger host-pathogen interactions.",

In Escherichia coli , there are two homodimeric elongating KSs, FabB and FabF, which possess overlapping substrate selectivity. However, FabB is essential for the biosynthesis of the unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) required for cell survival in the absence of exogenous UFAs. Additionally, FabB has reduced activity towards substrates longer than 12 C atoms, whereas FabF efficiently catalyses the elongation of saturated C14 and unsaturated C16:1 acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) complexes. In this study, two cross-linked crystal structures of FabB in complex with ACPs functionalized with long-chain fatty-acid cross-linking probes that approximate catalytic steps were solved. Both homodimeric structures possess asymmetric substrate-binding pockets suggestive of cooperative relationships between the two FabB monomers when engaged with C14 and C16 acyl chains. In addition, these structures capture an unusual rotamer of the active-site gating residue, Phe392, which is potentially representative of the catalytic state prior to substrate release. These structures demonstrate the utility of mechanism-based cross-linking methods to capture and elucidate conformational transitions accompanying KS-mediated catalysis at near-atomic resolution.",

Due to their low molecular weight, such hits tend to have low, often unquantifiable, affinity for their target, complicating the twin challenges of validating the hits as authentic solution-phase ligands of the target and identifying the `best' hit(s) for further elaboration. In this article, approaches that address these challenges are assessed. Using retrospective analysis of a recent ATAD2 hit-identification campaign, alongside other examples of successful fragment-screening campaigns, it is suggested that hit validation and prioritization are best achieved by a `triangulation' approach in which the results of multiple available biochemical and biophysical techniques are correlated to develop qualitative structure–activity relationships (SARs). Such qualitative SARs may indeed be the only means by which to navigate a project through the tunnel of uncertainty that prevails before on-scale biophysical, biochemical and/or biological measurements become possible.",

    "abstract": "Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a hereditary cardiodegenerative and neurodegenerative disease that affects 1 in 50 000 Americans. FRDA arises from either a cellular inability to produce sufficient quantities or the production of a nonfunctional form of the protein frataxin, a key molecule associated with mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biosynthesis. Within the mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly pathway, frataxin serves as an allosteric regulator for cysteine desulfurase, the enzyme that provides sulfur for [2Fe–2S] cluster assembly. Frataxin is a known iron-binding protein and is also linked to the delivery of ferrous ions to the scaffold protein, the ISC molecule responsible for the direct assembly of [2Fe–2S] clusters. The goal of this report is to provide structural details of the Drosophila melanogaster frataxin ortholog (Dfh), using both X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, in order to provide the foundational insight needed to understand the structure–function correlation of the protein. Additionally, NMR iron(II) titrations were used to provide metal contacts on the protein to better understand how it binds iron and aids its delivery to the ISC scaffold protein. Here, the structural and functional similarities of Dfh to its orthologs are also outlined. Structural data show that bacterial, yeast, human and Drosophila frataxins are structurally similar, apart from a structured C-terminus in Dfh that is likely to aid in protein stability. The iron-binding location on helix 1 and strand 1 of Dfh is also conserved across orthologs.",

    "abstract": "Refinement is a critical step in the determination of a model which explains the crystallographic observations and thus best accounts for the missing phase components. The scattering density is usually described in terms of atomic parameters; however, in macromolecular crystallography the resolution of the data is generally insufficient to determine the values of these parameters for individual atoms. Stereochemical and geometric restraints are used to provide additional information, but produce interrelationships between parameters which slow convergence, resulting in longer refinement times. An alternative approach is proposed in which parameters are not attached to atoms, but to regions of the electron-density map. These parameters can move the density or change the local temperature factor to better explain the structure factors. Varying the size of the region which determines the parameters at a particular position in the map allows the method to be applied at different resolutions without the use of restraints. Potential applications include initial refinement of molecular-replacement models with domain motions, and potentially the use of electron density from other sources such as electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) as the refinement model.",

One classic example of such an enzyme is cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MS). MS is a large modular protein that utilizes an SN2-type mechanism to catalyze the chemically challenging methyl transfer from the tertiary amine (N5) of methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine in order to form methionine. Despite over half a century of study, many questions remain about how folate-dependent methyltransferases, and MS in particular, function. Here, the structure of the folate-binding (Fol) domain of MS from Thermus thermophilus is reported in the presence and absence of methyltetrahydrofolate. It is found that the methyltetrahydrofolate-binding environment is similar to those of previously described methyltransferases, highlighting the conserved role of this domain in binding, and perhaps activating, the methyltetrahydrofolate substrate. These structural studies further reveal a new distinct and uncharacterized topology in the C-terminal region of MS Fol domains. Furthermore, it is found that in contrast to the canonical TIM-barrel β8α8 fold found in all other folate-binding domains, MS Fol domains exhibit a unique β8α7 fold. It is posited that these structural differences are important for MS function.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplasmas are wall-less phytopathogenic bacteria that produce devastating effects in a wide variety of plants. Reductive evolution has shaped their genome, with the loss of many genes, limiting their metabolic capacities. Owing to the high concentration of C 4 compounds in plants, and the presence of malic enzyme (ME) in all phytoplasma genomes so far sequenced, the oxidative decarboxylation of L-malate might represent an adaptation to generate energy. Aster yellows witches'-broom ( Candidatus Phytoplasma) ME (AYWB-ME) is one of the smallest of all characterized MEs, yet retains full enzymatic activity. Here, the crystal structure of AYWB-ME is reported, revealing a unique fold that differs from those of `canonical' MEs. AYWB-ME is organized as a dimeric species formed by intertwining of the N-terminal domains of the protomers. As a consequence of such structural differences, key catalytic residues such as Tyr36 are positioned in the active site of each protomer but are provided by the other protomer of the dimer. A Tyr36Ala mutation abolishes the catalytic activity, indicating the key importance of this residue in the catalytic process but not in the dimeric assembly. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that larger MEs (large-subunit or chimeric MEs) might have evolved from this type of smaller scaffold by gaining small sequence cassettes or an entire functional domain. The Candidatus Phytoplasma AYWB-ME structure showcases a novel minimal structure design comprising a fully functional active site, making this enzyme an attractive starting point for rational genetic design.",

    "abstract": "In mycobacteria, the ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase MabA (designated FabG in other bacteria) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of β-ketoacyl-ACP substrates to β-hydroxyacyl-ACP products. This first reductive step in the fatty-acid biosynthesis elongation cycle is essential for bacteria, which makes MabA/FabG an interesting drug target. To date, however, very few molecules targeting FabG have been discovered and MabA remains the only enzyme of the mycobacterial type II fatty-acid synthase that lacks specific inhibitors. Despite the existence of several MabA/FabG crystal structures, the structural rearrangement that occurs upon cofactor binding is still not fully understood. Therefore, unlocking this knowledge gap could help in the design of new inhibitors. Here, high-resolution crystal structures of MabA from Mycobacterium smegmatis in its apo, NADP + -bound and NADPH-bound forms are reported. Comparison of these crystal structures reveals the structural reorganization of the lid region covering the active site of the enzyme. The crystal structure of the apo form revealed numerous residues that trigger steric hindrance to the binding of NADPH and substrate. Upon NADPH binding, these residues are pushed away from the active site, allowing the enzyme to adopt an open conformation. The transition from an NADPH-bound to an NADP + -bound form is likely to facilitate release of the product. These results may be useful for subsequent rational drug design and/or for in silico drug-screening approaches targeting MabA/FabG.",

The recruitment and activation of Mek1 require the phosphorylation of the chromosome axis protein Hop1 at Thr318 (pT318), which is necessary for recognition by the Mek1 FHA domain. Here, crystal structures of the Mek1 FHA domain in the apo state and in complex with the Hop1 pT318 peptide are presented, demonstrating that the hydrophobic residues Phe320 and Val321 at the pT+2 and pT+3 positions in the ligand contribute to the preferential recognition. It was further found that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Mek1 FHA binds both pT15 in its N-terminal SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD) and pT270 in the Hop1 SCD. The results revealed the structural basis for the preferential recognition of phosphorylated Hop1 by Mek1 in S. cerevisiae and facilitate the understanding of the interaction between the S. pombe Mek1 FHA domain and its binding targets.",

    "abstract": "LexA is a protein that is involved in the SOS response. The protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its mutants have been biochemically characterized and the structures of their catalytic segments have been determined. The protein is made up of an N-terminal segment, which includes the DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal segment encompassing much of the catalytic domain. The two segments are defined by a cleavage site. Full-length LexA, the two segments, two point mutants involving changes in the active-site residues (S160A and K197A) and another mutant involving a change at the cleavage site (G126D) were cloned and purified. The wild-type protein autocleaves at basic pH, while the mutants do not. The wild-type and the mutant proteins dimerize and bind DNA with equal facility. The C-terminal segment also dimerizes, and it also shows a tendency to form tetramers. The C-terminal segment readily crystallized. The crystals obtained from attempts involving the full-length protein and its mutants contained only the C-terminal segment including the catalytic core and a few residues preceding it, in a dimeric or tetrameric form, indicating protein cleavage during the long period involved in crystal formation. Modes of tetramerization of the full-length protein similar to those observed for the catalytic core are feasible. A complex of M. tuberculosis LexA and the cognate SOS box could be modeled in which the mutual orientation of the two N-terminal domains differs from that in the Escherichia coli LexA–DNA complex. These results represent the first thorough characterization of M. tuberculosis LexA and provide definitive information on its structure and assembly. They also provide leads for further exploration of this important protein.",

Here, it is demonstrated that Zn 2+ ions coordinated to the N7 atom of guanine bases generate sufficient anomalous signal for single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing of DNA crystal structures. Using zinc SAD, three crystal structures of double-stranded DNA oligomers, 5′-AGGGATCCCT-3′, 5′-GGGATCCC-3′ and 5′-GAGGCCTC-3′, were determined. By determining the crystal structure of one of these oligomers, GAGGCCTC, in the presence of Mg 2+ instead of Zn 2+ , it was demonstrated that Zn 2+ is not structurally perturbing. These structures allowed the analysis of structural changes in the DNA on the binding of analogues of the natural product mithramycin to two of these oligomers, AGGGATCCCT and GAGGCCTC. Zinc SAD may become a routine approach for determining the crystal structures of nucleic acids and their complexes with small molecules.",

This sensor and regulator has been captured bound to lactose and to lactulose as well as in a nominal apo form, and was compared with AraC, another saccharide-binding transcriptional regulator. It is shown that the saccharides bind in the N-terminal region of a jelly-roll fold, but that part of the saccharide is exposed to bulk solvent. This differs from the classical AraC saccharide-binding site, which is mostly sequestered from the bulk solvent. The structures of BgaR bound to lactose and to lactulose highlight how specific and nonspecific interactions lead to a higher binding affinity of BgaR for lactose compared with lactulose. Moreover, solving multiple structures of BgaR in different space groups, both bound to saccharides and unbound, verified that the dimer interface along a C-terminal helix is similar to the dimer interface observed in AraC.",

Through interacting with extracellular matrix components and growth factors via one of their four domains, the CCN proteins are involved in critical biological processes such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, bone development, fibrogenesis and tumorigenesis. Here, the crystal structure of the thrombospondin module 1 (TSP1) domain of CCN3 (previously known as Nov) is presented, which shares a similar three-stranded fold with the thrombospondin type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1 and spondin-1, but with variations in the disulfide connectivity. Moreover, the CCN3 TSP1 domain lacks the typical π-stacked ladder of charged and aromatic residues on one side of the domain that is seen in other TSP1 domains. Using conservation analysis among orthologous domains, it is shown that a charged cluster in the centre of the domain is the most conserved site and this cluster is predicted to be a potential functional epitope for heparan sulfate binding. This variant TSP1 domain has also been used to revise the sequence determinants of TSP1 domains and to derive improved Pfam sequence profiles for the identification of novel TSP1 domains in more than 10 000 proteins across diverse phyla.",

Inherited deficiencies in GBA cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD). Consequently, GBA is of considerable medical interest, with continuous advances in the development of inhibitors, chaperones and activity-based probes. The development of new GBA inhibitors requires a source of active protein; however, the majority of structural and mechanistic studies of GBA today rely on clinical enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) formulations, which are incredibly costly and are often difficult to obtain in adequate supply. Here, the production of active crystallizable GBA in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system is reported, providing a nonclinical source of recombinant GBA with comparable activity and biophysical properties to ERT preparations. Furthermore, a novel crystal form of GBA is described which diffracts to give a 0.98 Å resolution unliganded structure. A structure in complex with the inactivator 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-glucopyranoside was also obtained, demonstrating the ability of this GBA formulation to be used in ligand-binding studies. In light of its purity, stability and activity, the GBA production protocol described here should circumvent the need for ERT formulations for structural and biochemical studies and serve to support GD research.",

The motor assembles transiently at the portal protein vertex of an empty precursor capsid to power the energy-dependent packaging of viral DNA. Both the ATPase and nuclease activities associated with genome packaging reside in TerL. Structural studies of TerL from bacteriophage P22 have been hindered by the conformational flexibility of this enzyme and its susceptibility to proteolysis. Here, an unbiased, synthetic phage-display Fab library was screened and a panel of high-affinity Fabs against P22 TerL were identified. This led to the discovery of a recombinant antibody fragment, Fab4, that binds a 33-amino-acid α-helical hairpin at the N-terminus of TerL with an equilibrium dissociation constant K d of 71.5 n M . A 1.51 Å resolution crystal structure of Fab4 bound to the TerL epitope (TLE) together with a 1.15 Å resolution crystal structure of the unliganded Fab4, which is the highest resolution ever achieved for a Fab, elucidate the principles governing the recognition of this novel helical epitope. TLE adopts two different conformations in the asymmetric unit and buries as much as 1250 Å 2 of solvent-accessible surface in Fab4. TLE recognition is primarily mediated by conformational changes in the third complementarity-determining region of the Fab4 heavy chain (CDR H3) that take place upon epitope binding. It is demonstrated that TLE can be introduced genetically at the N-terminus of a target protein, where it retains high-affinity binding to Fab4.",

As almost half of the experiments leading to structures deposited in the SASBDB database used scavengers, finding potent scavengers would be advantageous for many experiments. Here, four compounds, three nucleosides and one nitrogenous base, are presented which can act as very effective radical-scavenging additives and increase the critical dose by up to 20 times without altering the stability or reducing the contrast of the tested protein solutions. The efficacy of these scavengers is higher than those commonly used in the field to date, as verified for lysozyme solutions at various concentrations from 7.0 to 0.5 mg ml −1 . The compounds are also very efficient at mitigating radiation damage to four proteins with molecular weights ranging from 7 to 240 kDa and pH values from 3 to 8, with the extreme case being catalase at 6.7 mg ml −1 , with a scavenging factor exceeding 100. These scavengers can therefore be instrumental in expanding BioSAXS to low-molecular-weight and low-concentration protein samples that were previously inaccessible owing to poor data quality. It is also demonstrated that an increase in the critical dose in standard BioSAXS experiments leads to an increment in the retrieved information, in particular at higher angles, and thus to higher resolution of the model.",

    "abstract": "X-ray crystallography is the main source of atomistic information on the structure of proteins. Normal crystal structures are obtained as a compromise between the X-ray scattering data and a set of empirical restraints that ensure chemically reasonable bond lengths and angles. However, such restraints are not always available or accurate for nonstandard parts of the structure, for example substrates, inhibitors and metal sites. The method of quantum refinement, in which these empirical restraints are replaced by quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations, has previously been suggested for small but interesting parts of the protein. Here, this approach is extended to allow for multiple conformations in the QM region by performing separate QM calculations for each conformation. This approach is shown to work properly and leads to improved structures in terms of electron-density maps and real-space difference density Z-scores. It is also shown that the quality of the structures can be gauged using QM strain energies. The approach, called ComQumX-2QM, is applied to the P-cluster in two different crystal structures of the enzyme nitrogenase, i.e. an Fe8S7Cys6 cluster, used for electron transfer. One structure is at a very high resolution (1.0 Å) and shows a mixture of two different oxidation states, the fully reduced PN state (Fe82+, 20%) and the doubly oxidized P2+ state (80%). In the original crystal structure the coordinates differed for only two iron ions, but here it is shown that the two states also show differences in other atoms of up to 0.7 Å. The second structure is at a more modest resolution, 2.1 Å, and was originally suggested to show only the one-electron oxidized state, P1+. Here, it is shown that it is rather a 50/50% mixture of the P1+ and P2+ states and that many of the Fe-Fe and Fe-S distances in the original structure were quite inaccurate (by up to 0.8 Å). This shows that the new ComQumX-2QM approach can be used to sort out what is actually seen in crystal structures with dual conformations and to give locally improved coordinates.",

    "abstract": "Tomato plants express acidic leucine aminopeptidase (LAP-A) in response to various environmental stressors. LAP-A not only functions as a peptidase for diverse peptide substrates, but also displays chaperone activity. A K354E mutation has been shown to abolish the peptidase activity but to enhance the chaperone activity of LAP-A. To better understand this moonlighting function of LAP-A, the crystal structure of the K354E mutant was determined at 2.15 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the K354E mutation destabilizes an active-site loop and causes significant rearrangement of active-site residues, leading to loss of the catalytic metal-ion coordination required for the peptidase activity. Although the mutant was crystallized in the same hexameric form as wild-type LAP-A, gel-filtration chromatography revealed an apparent shift from the hexamer to lower-order oligomers for the K354E mutant, showing a mixture of monomers to trimers in solution. In addition, surface-probing assays indicated that the K354E mutant has more accessible hydrophobic areas than wild-type LAP-A. Consistently, computational thermodynamic estimations of the interfaces between LAP-A monomers suggest that increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces occurs upon hexamer breakdown. These results suggest that the K354E mutation disrupts the active-site loop, which also contributes to the hexameric assembly, and destabilizes the hexamers, resulting in much greater hydrophobic areas accessible for efficient chaperone activity than in the wild-type LAP-A.",

    "abstract": "Ab initio phasing by direct computational methods in low-resolution X-ray crystallography is a long-standing challenge. A common approach is to consider it as two subproblems: sampling of phase space and identification of the correct solution. While the former is amenable to a myriad of search algorithms, devising a reliable target function for the latter problem remains an open question. Here, recent developments in CrowdPhase, a collaborative online game powered by a genetic algorithm that evolves an initial population of individuals with random genetic make-up (i.e. random phases) each expressing a phenotype in the form of an electron-density map, are presented. Success relies on the ability of human players to visually evaluate the quality of these maps and, following a Darwinian survival-of-the-fittest concept, direct the search towards optimal solutions. While an initial study demonstrated the feasibility of the approach, some important crystallographic issues were overlooked for the sake of simplicity. To address these, the new CrowdPhase includes consideration of space-group symmetry, a method for handling missing amplitudes, the use of a map correlation coefficient as a quality metric and a solvent-flattening step. Performances of this installment are discussed for two low-resolution test cases based on bona fide diffraction data.",

    "abstract": "Calmodulin (CaM) is the primary calcium signaling protein in eukaryotes and has been extensively studied using various biophysical techniques. Prior crystal structures have noted the presence of ambiguous electron density in both hydrophobic binding pockets of Ca 2+ -CaM, but no assignment of these features has been made. In addition, Ca 2+ -CaM samples many conformational substates in the crystal and accurately modeling the full range of this functionally important disorder is challenging. In order to characterize these features in a minimally biased manner, a 1.0 Å resolution single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data set was measured for selenomethionine-substituted Ca 2+ -CaM. Density-modified electron-density maps enabled the accurate assignment of Ca 2+ -CaM main-chain and side-chain disorder. These experimental maps also substantiate complex disorder models that were automatically built using low-contour features of model-phased electron density. Furthermore, experimental electron-density maps reveal that 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) is present in the C-terminal domain, mediates a lattice contact between N-terminal domains and may occupy the N-terminal binding pocket. The majority of the crystal structures of target-free Ca 2+ -CaM have been derived from crystals grown using MPD as a precipitant, and thus MPD is likely to be bound in functionally critical regions of Ca 2+ -CaM in most of these structures. The adventitious binding of MPD helps to explain differences between the Ca 2+ -CaM crystal and solution structures and is likely to favor more open conformations of the EF-hands in the crystal.",

In Gram-positive bacteria and eukaryotes, zinc-dependent deoxycytidylate deaminases (dCDs) catalyze the conversion of dCMP to dUMP. The activity of dCD is allosterically activated by dCTP and inhibited by dTTP. Here, the crystal structure of Streptococcus mutans dCD (SmdCD) complexed with dTTP is presented at 2.35 Å resolution, thereby solving the first pair of activator-bound and inhibitor-bound structures from the same species to provide a more definitive description of the allosteric mechanism. In contrast to the dTTP-bound dCD from the bacteriophage S-TIM5 (S-TIM5-dCD), dTTP-bound SmdCD adopts an inactive conformation similar to the apo form. A structural comparison suggests that the distinct orientations of the triphosphate group in S-TIM5-dCD and SmdCD are a result of the varying protein binding environment. In addition, calorimetric data establish that the modulators bound to dCD can be mutually competitively replaced. The results reveal the mechanism underlying its regulator-specific activity and might greatly enhance the understanding of the allosteric regulation of other dCDs.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of vertebrates required a key development in supramolecular evolution: internally mineralized collagen fibrils. In bone, collagen molecules and mineral crystals form a nanocomposite material comparable to cast iron in tensile strength, but several times lighter and more flexible. Current understanding of the internal nanoscale structure of collagen fibrils, derived from studies of rat tail tendon (RTT), does not explain how nucleation and growth of mineral crystals can occur inside a collagen fibril. Experimental obstacles encountered in studying bone have prevented a solution to this problem for several decades. This report presents a lateral packing model for collagen molecules in bone fibrils, based on the unprecedented observation of multiple resolved equatorial reflections for bone tissue using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS; ∼1 nm resolution). The deduced structure for pre-mineralized bone fibrils includes features that are not present in RTT: spatially discrete microfibrils. The data are consistent with bone microfibrils similar to pentagonal Smith microfibrils, but are not consistent with the (nondiscrete) quasi-hexagonal microfibrils reported for RTT. These results indicate that collagen fibrils in bone and tendon differ in their internal structure in a manner that allows bone fibrils, but not tendon fibrils, to internally mineralize. In addition, the unique pattern of collagen cross-link types and quantities in mineralized tissues can be can be accounted for, in structural/functional terms, based on a discrete microfibril model.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, many Dsb-family proteins play diverse roles in the conversion between the oxidized and reduced states of cysteine residues of substrate proteins. Most Dsb enzymes catalyze disulfide formation in periplasmic or secreted substrate proteins. Recently, a DsbM protein has been found in a Gram-negative bacterium, and was characterized as a cytosolic Dsb member with the conserved CXXC motif on the basis of sequence homology to the Dsb-family proteins. The protein was implicated in the reduction of the cytoplasmic redox-sensor protein OxyR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, crystal structures of DsbM from P. aeruginosa are presented, revealing that it consists of a modified thioredoxin domain containing the CXXC motif and a lid domain surrounding the CXXC motif. In a glutathione-linked structure, a glutathione molecule is linked to the CXXC motif of DsbM and is bound in an elongated cavity region in the thioredoxin domain, which is also suited for substrate peptide binding. A striking structural similarity to a human glutathione S-transferase was found in the glutathione-binding pocket. Further, biochemical evidence is presented suggesting that DsbM is directly involved in the reduction of the disulfide of Cys199 and Cys208 in OxyR, resulting in the acceleration of OxyR reduction in the absence of reactive oxygen species stress. These findings may help to expand the understanding of the diverse roles of redox-related proteins that contain the CXXC motif.",

FBPase is a homotetramer of 222 symmetry with a major and a minor dimer interface. The dimers connected via the minor interface can rotate with respect to each other, leading to the inactive T-state and active R-state conformations of FBPase. Here, the first crystal structure of human liver FBPase in the R-state conformation is presented, determined at a resolution of 2.2 Å in a tetragonal setting that exhibits an unusual arrangement of noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) elements. Self-Patterson function analysis and various intensity statistics revealed the presence of pseudo-translation and the absence of twinning. The space group is P41212, but structure determination was also possible in space groups P43212, P4122 and P4322. All solutions have the same arrangement of three C2-symmetric dimers spaced by 1/3 along an NCS axis parallel to the c axis located at (1/4, 1/4, z), which is therefore invisible in a self-rotation function analysis. The solutions in the four space groups are related to one another and emulate a body-centred lattice. If all NCS elements were crystallographic, the space group would be I4122 with a c axis three times shorter and a single FBPase subunit in the asymmetric unit. I4122 is a minimal, non-isomorphic supergroup of the four primitive tetragonal space groups, explaining the space-group ambiguity for this crystal.",

Prior to its incorporation into the spliceosome, U6 is bound by the protein Prp24, which facilitates unwinding of the U6 internal stem-loop (ISL) so that it can pair with U4 snRNA. A previously reported crystal structure of the `core' of the U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) contained an ISL-stabilized A62G mutant of U6 bound to all four RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains of Prp24 [Montemayor et al. (2014), Nature Struct. Mol. Biol. 21 , 544–551]. The structure revealed a novel topology containing interlocked rings of protein and RNA that was not predicted by prior biochemical and genetic data. Here, the crystal structure of the U6 snRNP core with a wild-type ISL is reported. This complex crystallized in a new space group, apparently owing in part to the presence of an intramolecular cross-link in RRM1 that was not observed in the previously reported U6-A62G structure. The structure exhibits the same protein–RNA interface and maintains the unique interlocked topology. However, the orientation of the wild-type ISL is altered relative to the A62G mutant structure, suggesting inherent structural dynamics that may facilitate its pairing with U4. Consistent with their similar architectures in the crystalline state, the wild-type and A62G variants of U6 exhibit similar Prp24-binding affinities and electrophoretic mobilities when analyzed by gel-shift assay.",

Calmodulin (CaM) is perhaps the best-studied archetype of these flexible proteins: while there are currently ∼450 structures of significant sequence similarity available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), novel conformations of CaM and complexes thereof continue to be reported. Here, the details of the solution of a novel peptide-CaM complex structure by MR are presented, in which only one MR solution of marginal quality was found despite the use of 120 different search models, an exclusivity enhanced by the presence of a high degree of hemihedral twinning (overall refined twin fraction = 0.43). Ambiguities in the initial MR electron-density maps were overcome by using MR-SAD: phases from the MR partial model were used to identify weak anomalous scatterers (calcium, sulfur and chloride), which were in turn used to improve the phases, automatically rebuild the structure and resolve sequence ambiguities. Retrospective analysis of consecutive wedges of the original data sets showed twin fractions ranging from 0.32 to 0.55, suggesting that the data sets were variably twinned. Despite these idiosyncrasies and obstacles, the data themselves and the final model were of high quality and indeed showed a novel, nearly right-angled conformation of the bound peptide.",

FVIIa binds three Mg2+ ions and four Ca2+ ions in the GLA domain, one Ca2+ ion in the EGF1 domain and one Ca2+ ion in the protease domain. Further, FVIIa contains an Na+ site in the protease domain. Since Na+ and water share the same number of electrons, Na+ sites in proteins are difficult to distinguish from waters in X-ray structures. Here, to verify the Na+ site in FVIIa, the structure of the FVIIa-soluble tissue factor (TF) complex was solved at 1.8 Å resolution containing Mg2+, Ca2+ and Rb+ ions. In this structure, Rb+ replaced two Ca2+ sites in the GLA domain and occupied three non-metal sites in the protease domain. However, Rb+ was not detected at the expected Na+ site. In kinetic experiments, Na+ increased the amidolytic activity of FVIIa towards the synthetic substrate S-2288 (H-D-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide) by ∼20-fold; however, in the presence of Ca2+, Na+ had a negligible effect. Ca2+ increased the hydrolytic activity of FVIIa towards S-2288 by ∼60-fold in the absence of Na+ and by ∼82-fold in the presence of Na+. In molecular-dynamics simulations, Na+ stabilized the two Na+-binding loops (the 184-loop and 220-loop) and the TF-binding region spanning residues 163-180. Ca2+ stabilized the Ca2+-binding loop (the 70-loop) and Na+-binding loops but not the TF-binding region. Na+ and Ca2+ together stabilized both the Na+-binding and Ca2+-binding loops and the TF-binding region. Previously, Rb+ has been used to define the Na+ site in thrombin; however, it was unsuccessful in detecting the Na+ site in FVIIa. A conceivable explanation for this observation is provided.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped RNA virus. One of the hallmarks of HCV infection is a rearrangement of the host cell membranes, known as the `membranous web'. Full-field cryo soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) in the water-window energy range (284–543 eV) was performed on the MISTRAL beamline to investigate, in whole unstained cells, the morphology of the membranous rearrangements induced in HCV replicon-harbouring cells in conditions close to the living physiological state. All morphological alterations could be reverted by a combination of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, which are clinically approved antivirals (direct-acting antivirals; DAAs) for HCV infection. Correlatively combining cryo-SXT and 2D synchrotron-based infrared microscopy provides critical information on the chemical nature of specific infection-related structures, which allows specific patterns of the infection process or the DAA-mediated healing process to be distinguished.",

As such, macromolecular refinement is one of the most complex optimization problems in wide use. Macromolecular refinement programs have to deal with the complex relationship between the parameters of the atomic model and the experimental data, as well as a large number of types of prior knowledge about chemical structure. This paper draws attention to areas of unfinished business in the field of macromolecular refinement. In it, we describe ten refinement topics that we think deserve attention and discuss directions leading to macromolecular refinement software that would make the best use of modern computer resources to meet the needs of structural biologists of the twenty-first century.",

Such a structure determination may be difficult if there are large-scale structural differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins. In this manuscript, an interesting case is presented of the unintentional crystallization of a contaminant protein which shared some structural features with the presumed target protein, leading to difficulties in obtaining a completely satisfactory molecular-replacement structure solution. It was not immediately evident that the initial structure solution was incorrect owing to the poor quality of the X-ray diffraction data and low resolution. The structure was subsequently determined by improving the quality of the data and following a sequence-independent MarathonMR protocol. The structure corresponded to that of glycerol dehydrogenase, which crystallized as a contaminant, instead of the presumed mutant of a survival protein encoded by Salmonella typhimurium . The reasons why a solution that appeared to be reasonable was obtained with an incorrect protein model are discussed. The results presented here show that a degree of caution is warranted when handling large-scale structure-determination projects.",

Here, the use of cadmium ions as a suitable anomalous scatterer at the standard wavelength of 1 Å is demonstrated. The structures of three different proteins were determined using cadmium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing. Owing to the strong anomalous signal, the structure of lysozyme could be automatically phased and built using a very low anomalous multiplicity (1.1) and low-completeness (77%) data set. Additionally, it is shown that cadmium ions can easily substitute divalent ions in ATP–divalent cation complexes. This property could be generally applied for phasing experiments of a wide range of nucleotide-binding proteins. Improvements in crystal growth and quality, good anomalous signal at standard wavelengths ( i.e. no need to change photon energy) and rapid phasing and refinement using a single data set are benefits that should allow cadmium ions to be widely used for experimental phasing.",

Here, the crystal structure of the C-terminal SH3 domain of myosin IB from Entamoeba histolytica ( Eh MySH3) is reported at a resolution of 1.7 Å in native and PEG-bound states. Comparisons with other structures indicated that the PEG molecules occupy protein–protein interaction pockets similar to those occupied by the peptides in other peptide-bound SH3-domain structures. Also, analysis of the PEG-bound Eh MySH3 structure led to the recognition of two additional pockets, apart from the conventional polyproline and specificity pockets, that are important for ligand interaction. Molecular-docking studies combined with various comparisons revealed structural similarity between Eh MySH3 and the SH3 domain of β-Pix, and this similarity led to the prediction that Eh MySH3 preferentially binds targets containing type II-like P XX P motifs. These studies expand the understanding of the Eh MySH3 domain and provide extensive structural knowledge, which is expected to help in predicting the interacting partners which function together with myosin IB during phagocytosis in E. histolytica infections.",

Phase extension and refinement is therefore a necessary step: its success or failure can make the difference between solution and nonsolution of the crystal structure. Today phase refinement is trusted to electron-density modification (EDM) techniques, and in practice to dual-space methods which try, via suitable constraints in direct and in reciprocal space, to generate higher quality electron-density maps. The most popular EDM approaches, denoted here as mainstream methods, are usually part of packages which assist crystallographers in all of the structure-solution steps from initial phasing to the point where the molecular model perfectly fits the known features of protein chemistry. Other phase-refinement approaches that are based on different sources of information, denoted here as out-of-mainstream methods, are not frequently employed. This paper aims to show that mainstream and out-of-mainstream methods may be combined and may lead to dramatic advances in the present state of the art. The statement is confirmed by experimental tests using molecular-replacement, SAD-MAD and ab initio techniques.",

    "abstract": "Cryogenic temperatures slow down secondary radiation damage during data collection from macromolecular crystals. In 1973, cooling at high pressure was identified as a method for cryopreserving crystals in their mother liquor [Thomanek et al. (1973). Acta Cryst. A 29 , 263–265]. Results from different groups studying different crystal systems indicated that the approach had merit, although difficulties in making the process work have limited its widespread use. Therefore, a simplified and reliable technique has been developed termed high-pressure cooling (HPC). An essential requirement for HPC is to protect crystals in capillaries. These capillaries form part of new sample holders with SPINE standard dimensions. Crystals are harvested with the capillary, cooled at high pressure (220 MPa) and stored in a cryovial. This system also allows the usage of the standard automation at the synchrotron. Crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme and concanavalin A have been successfully cryopreserved and yielded data sets to resolutions of 1.45 and 1.35 Å, respectively. Extensive work has been performed to define the useful working range of HPC in capillaries with 250 µm inner diameter. Three different 96-well crystallization screens that are most frequently used in our crystallization facility were chosen to study the formation of amorphous ice in this cooling setup. More than 89% of the screening solutions were directly suitable for HPC. This achievement represents a drastic improvement for crystals that suffered from cryoprotection or were not previously eligible for cryoprotection.",

Using kinetic inhibition studies and mass spectrometry, it is shown that enzyme variants of FSAA and TalB that exhibit D-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase activity are inhibited covalently and irreversibly by D-tagatose 6-phosphate (D-T6P), whereas no inhibition was observed for wild-type transaldolase B from E. coli . The crystal structure of the variant TalB F178Y with bound sugar phosphate was solved to a resolution of 1.46 Å and revealed a novel mode of covalent inhibition. The sugar is bound covalently via its C2 atom to the ∊-NH 2 group of the active-site residue Lys132. It is neither bound in the open-chain form nor as the closed-ring form of D-T6P, but has been converted to β-D-galactofuranose 6-phosphate (D-G6P), a five-membered ring structure. The furanose ring of the covalent adduct is formed via a Heyns rearrangement and subsequent hemiacetal formation. This reaction is facilitated by Tyr178, which is proposed to act as acid–base catalyst. The crystal structure of the inhibitor complex is compared with the structure of the Schiff-base intermediate of TalB E96Q formed with the substrate D-fructose 6-phosphate determined to a resolution of 2.20 Å. This comparison highlights the differences in stereochemistry at the C4 atom of the ligand as an essential determinant for the formation of the inhibitor adduct in the active site of the enzyme.",

They have also shown that DNA is a flexible molecule, with some sequences capable of adopting two different structures. Here, the first example is presented of a DNA fragment that can assume three different and distinct conformations in crystals. The decanucleotide d(GCATGCATGC) was previously reported to assume a single-stranded double-fold structure. In one of the two crystal structures described here the decamer assumes both the double-fold conformation and, simultaneously, the more conventional B-type double-helical structure. In the other crystal the sequence assumes the A-type double-helical conformation. These results, taken together with CD spectra, which were recorded as the decamer was titrated against four metal ions and spermine, indicate that the molecule may exist as a mixed population of structures in solution. Small differences in the environmental conditions, such as the concentration of metal ion, may decide which of these crystallizes out. The results also support the idea that it may be possible for DNA to change its structure to suit the binding requirements of proteins or drugs.",

NAD(H) kinases and NADP(H) phosphatases are two key players in this pathway. Despite structural evidence demonstrating the existence and mode of action of NAD(H) kinases, the specific annotation and the mode of action of NADP(H) phosphatases remains obscure. Here, structural evidence supporting the alternative role of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) as an NADP(H) phosphatase is reported. Crystal structures of staphylococcal dual-specific IMPase/NADP(H) phosphatase (SaIMPase-I) in complex with the substrates D- myo -inositol-1-phosphate and NADP + have been solved. The structure of the SaIMPase-I–Ca 2+ –NADP + ternary complex reveals the catalytic mode of action of NADP(H) phosphatase. Moreover, structures of SaIMPase-I–Ca 2+ –substrate complexes have reinforced the earlier proposal that the length of the active-site-distant helix α4 and its preceding loop are the predisposing factors for the promiscuous substrate specificity of SaIMPase-I. Altogether, the evidence presented suggests that IMPase-family enzymes with a shorter α4 helix could be potential candidates for previously unreported NADP(H) phosphatase activity.",

Here, crystal structures of BPGM with 2-PG in the presence and absence of 3-phosphoglycerate are reported at 2.25 and 2.48 Å resolution, respectively. Structure analysis revealed a new binding site for 2-PG at the dimer interface for the first time, in addition to the expected active-site binding. Also, conformational non-equivalence of the two active sites was observed as one of the sites was found in an open conformation, with the residues at the active-site entrance, including Arg100, Arg116 and Arg117, and the C-terminus disordered. The kinetic result is consistent with the binding of 2-PG to an allosteric or noncatalytic site as well as the active site.

The dominant methods typically exploit an expensive global search on each image to estimate the missing orientations. Here, a novel end-to-end supervised learning method is introduced to directly recover the missing orientations from 2D cryo-EM images. A neural network is used to approximate the mapping from images to orientations. A robust loss function is proposed for optimizing the parameters of the network, which can handle both asymmetric and symmetric 3D structures.

    "abstract": "The introduction of disulfide bonds into periplasmic proteins is a critical process in many Gram-negative bacteria. The formation and regulation of protein disulfide bonds have been linked to the production of virulence factors. Understanding the different pathways involved in this process is important in the development of strategies to disarm pathogenic bacteria. The well characterized disulfide bond-forming (DSB) proteins play a key role by introducing or isomerizing disulfide bonds between cysteines in substrate proteins. Curiously, the suppressor of copper sensitivity C proteins (ScsCs), which are part of the bacterial copper-resistance response, share structural and functional similarities with DSB oxidase and isomerase proteins, including the presence of a catalytic thioredoxin domain. However, the oxidoreductase activity of ScsC varies with its oligomerization state, which depends on a poorly conserved N-terminal domain. Here, the structure and function of Caulobacter crescentus ScsC (CcScsC) have been characterized. It is shown that CcScsC binds copper in the copper(I) form with subpicomolar affinity and that its isomerase activity is comparable to that of Escherichia coli DsbC, the prototypical dimeric bacterial isomerase. It is also reported that CcScsC functionally complements trimeric Proteus mirabilis ScsC (PmScsC) in vivo , enabling the swarming of P. mirabilis in the presence of copper. Using mass photometry and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) the protein is demonstrated to be trimeric in solution, like PmScsC, and not dimeric like EcDsbC. The crystal structure of CcScsC was also determined at a resolution of 2.6 Å, confirming the trimeric state and indicating that the trimerization results from interactions between the N-terminal α-helical domains of three CcScsC protomers. The SAXS data analysis suggested that the protomers are dynamic, like those of PmScsC, and are able to sample different conformations in solution.",

    "abstract": "The resistance of bacteria to β-lactam antibiotics is primarily caused by the production of β-lactamases. Here, novel crystal structures of the native β-lactamase TEM-171 and two complexes with the widely used inhibitor tazobactam are presented, alongside complementary data from UV spectroscopy and fluorescence quenching. The six chemically identical β-lactamase molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit displayed different degrees of disorder. The tazobactam intermediate was covalently bound to the catalytic Ser70 in the trans -enamine configuration. While the conformation of tazobactam in the first complex resembled that in published β-lactamase–tazobactam structures, in the second complex, which was obtained after longer soaking of the native crystals in the inhibitor solution, a new and previously unreported tazobactam conformation was observed. It is proposed that the two complexes correspond to different stages along the deacylation path of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. The results provide a novel structural basis for the rational design of new β-lactamase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus is one of few extant Limulus species, which date back to ∼250 million years ago under the conservation of a common Bauplan documented by fossil records. It possesses the only proteolytic blood-coagulation and innate immunity system outside vertebrates and is a model organism for the study of the evolution and function of peptidases. The astacins are a family of metallopeptidases that share a central ∼200-residue catalytic domain (CD), which is found in &gt;1000 species across holozoans and, sporadically, bacteria. Here, the zymogen of an astacin from L. polyphemus was crystallized and its structure was solved. A 34-residue, mostly unstructured pro-peptide (PP) traverses, and thus blocks, the active-site cleft of the CD in the opposite direction to a substrate. A central `PP motif' (F 35 -E-G-D-I 39 ) adopts a loop structure which positions Asp38 to bind the catalytic metal, replacing the solvent molecule required for catalysis in the mature enzyme according to an `aspartate-switch' mechanism. Maturation cleavage of the PP liberates the cleft and causes the rearrangement of an `activation segment'. Moreover, the mature N-terminus is repositioned to penetrate the CD moiety and is anchored to a buried `family-specific' glutamate. Overall, this mechanism of latency is reminiscent of that of the other three astacins with known zymogenic and mature structures, namely crayfish astacin, human meprin β and bacterial myroilysin, but each shows specific structural characteristics. Remarkably, myroilysin lacks the PP motif and employs a cysteine instead of the aspartate to block the catalytic metal.",

These proteins can counteract each other, thus allowing tight regulation of the transcription of the corresponding genes, where tight repression is often linked to DNA looping or cross-linking. Here, the tetramerization domain of the bacterial gene repressor Rco from Bacillus subtilis plasmid pLS20 (Rco pLS20 ) has been identified and its structure is shown to share high similarity to the tetramerization domain of the well known p53 family of human tumor suppressors, despite lacking clear sequence homology. In Rco pLS20 , this tetramerization domain is responsible for inducing DNA looping, a process that involves multiple tetramers. In accordance, it is shown that Rco pLS20 can form octamers. This domain was named TetD loop and its occurrence was identified in other Bacillus species. The TetD loop fold was also found in the structure of a transcriptional repressor from Salmonella phage SPC32H. It is proposed that the TetD loop fold has evolved through divergent evolution and that the TetD loop originates from a common ancestor predating the occurrence of multicellular life.",

The enzymes both catalyze phosphorolytic cleavage of xylulose 5-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate in the first reaction step, but possess different substrate specificity in the second reaction step, where phosphoketolase and transketolase utilize inorganic phosphate (P i ) and D-ribose 5-phosphate, respectively, as the acceptor substrate. Structures of Bifidobacterium longum phosphoketolase holoenzyme and its complex with a putative inhibitor, phosphoenolpyruvate, were determined at 2.5 Å resolution by serial femtosecond crystallography using an X-ray free-electron laser. In the complex structure, phosphoenolpyruvate was present at the entrance to the active-site pocket and plugged the channel to thiamine diphosphate. The phosphate-group position of phosphoenolpyruvate coincided well with those of xylulose 5-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate in the structures of their complexes with transketolase. The most striking structural change was observed in a loop consisting of Gln546-Asp547-His548-Asn549 (the QN-loop) at the entrance to the active-site pocket. Contrary to the conformation of the QN-loop that partially covers the entrance to the active-site pocket (`closed form') in the known crystal structures, including the phosphoketolase holoenzyme and its complexes with reaction intermediates, the QN-loop in the current ambient structures showed a more compact conformation with a widened entrance to the active-site pocket (`open form'). In the phosphoketolase reaction, the `open form' QN-loop may play a role in providing the binding site for xylulose 5-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate in the first step, and the `closed form' QN-loop may help confer specificity for P i in the second step.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of enzymes known as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs; Vaaje-Kolstad et al., 2005, 2010), which catalyze the oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds in polysaccharides, has changed our understanding of how nature deals with recalcitrant polysaccharide-rich co-polymeric structures such as plant cell walls.LPMOs have received ample attention in the context of their use for more efficient enzymatic saccharification of chitin-or cellulose-rich biomass (Chylenski et al., 2019).Interestingly, these abundant enzymes are also encountered in environments where degradation of biomass does not seem pertinent.Furthermore, multiple studies have revealed links between LPMOs and microbial pathogenicity (Vandhana et al., 2022), for example GbpA in Vibrio cholerae (Kirn et al., 2005;Stauder et al., 2012;Wong et al., 2012) and CbpD in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Askarian et al., 2021).These latter LPMOs are multi-domain enzymes, starting with a catalytic LPMO domain and ending with a chitin-binding module belonging to family CBM73.In between, they have one or two additional domains with essentially unknown function, the first one of which is called Gbp_A2.The second of these domains resembles the FimC chaperone involved in pili formation in Gram-negative bacteria and is here referred to as Module X.Many carbohydrate-active enzymes, such as cellulases and chitinases, comprise a catalytic domain and one or more substrate-binding domains that are connected by flexible linkers.Crystal structures of such intrinsically flexible multi-domain proteins are very rare.In this issue, Zhou et al. present the crystal structure of a complete four-domain GbpA homologue (Zhou et al., 2023), VhLPMO10A, produced by Vibrio campbellii (also known as Vibrio harveyi), an abundant pathogen in marine ecosystems (Zhang et al., 2020).The previously published structure of GbpA (Wong et al., 2012) lacks the Cterminal CBM73, whereas the structure of CbpD (Dade et al., 2022) lacks both Module X(which is absent in this protein) and the CBM73.Important structural features that cannot be easily predicted by state-of-the-art AI algorithms are for example the multimerization state and inter-domain orientations in multi-domain structures.By combining X-ray data with SEC and SAXS data, Zhou et al. provide insights in these matters that may give hints to protein function.Based on the data presented, the authors conclude that VhLPMO10A is a monomeric protein with an elongated form, similar to what has been observed for GbpA and CbpD, also using SAXS analysis.Of note, the paper also provides the first crystal structure of a CBM73, for which, so far, only an NMR structure was available (Madland et al., 2021).The linkers connecting the domains are rather short (10, 8 and 18 residues, respectively) and contain few glycines (one, zero and two, respectively), suggesting that they are not very flexible, which may have helped in obtaining crystals.The longest linker, connecting the CBM73 to the other three domains, has typical features of an extended linker, with low sequence complexity and abundance of proline (four) and glutamate (four).Indeed, based on various observations, including lacking electron density for the CBM73 in one of the VhLPMO10A monomers in the asymmetric unit, Zhou et al. conclude that the CBM moves rather freely and independent of the rest of the protein, as has also been observed in NMR studies of a CBM-containing cellulose-active LPMO (Courtade et al., 2018).The other three domains may have more fixed orientations relative to each other and their orientation is also similar to that observed for GbpA.Still, for both proteins, SAXS data show a solution structure that is more elongated than",

It catalyzes the opening of the 5-nitrosalicylate aromatic ring, a key step in the degradation pathway. Besides 5-nitrosalicylate, the enzyme is also active towards 5-chlorosalicylate. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the enzyme was solved at 2.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement using a model from the AI program AlphaFold . The enzyme crystallized in the monoclinic space group P 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 50.42, b = 143.17, c = 60.07 Å, β = 107.3°. 5NSDO belongs to the third class of ring-cleaving dioxygenases. Members of this family convert para -diols or hydroxylated aromatic carboxylic acids and belong to the cupin superfamily, which is one of the most functionally diverse protein classes and is named on the basis of a conserved β-barrel fold. 5NSDO is a tetramer composed of four identical subunits, each folded as a monocupin domain. The iron(II) ion in the enzyme active site is coordinated by His96, His98 and His136 and three water molecules with a distorted octahedral geometry. The residues in the active site are poorly conserved compared with other dioxygenases of the third class, such as gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase and salicylate 1,2-dioxygenase. Comparison with these other representatives of the same class and docking of the substrate into the active site of 5NSDO allowed the identification of residues which are crucial for the catalytic mechanism and enzyme selectivity.",

    "abstract": "The constant selection and propagation of multi-resistant Plasmodium sp. parasites require the identification of new antimalarial candidates involved in as-yet untargeted metabolic pathways. Subtilisin-like protease 1 (SUB1) belongs to a new generation of drug targets because it plays a crucial role during egress of the parasite from infected host cells at different stages of its life cycle. SUB1 is characterized by an unusual pro-region that tightly interacts with its cognate catalytic domain, thus precluding 3D structural analysis of enzyme–inhibitor complexes. In the present study, to overcome this limitation, stringent ionic conditions and controlled proteolysis of recombinant full-length P. vivax SUB1 were used to obtain crystals of an active and stable catalytic domain (PvS1 Cat ) without a pro-region. High-resolution 3D structures of PvS1 Cat , alone and in complex with an α-ketoamide substrate-derived inhibitor (MAM-117), showed that, as expected, the catalytic serine of SUB1 formed a covalent bond with the α-keto group of the inhibitor. A network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions stabilized the complex, including at the P1′ and P2′ positions of the inhibitor, although P′ residues are usually less important in defining the substrate specificity of subtilisins. Moreover, when associated with a substrate-derived peptidomimetic inhibitor, the catalytic groove of SUB1 underwent significant structural changes, particularly in its S4 pocket. These findings pave the way for future strategies for the design of optimized SUB1-specific inhibitors that may define a novel class of antimalarial candidates.",

    "abstract": "The term robustness in statistics refers to methods that are generally insensitive to deviations from model assumptions. In other words, robust methods are able to preserve their accuracy even when the data do not perfectly fit the statistical models. Robust statistical analyses are particularly effective when analysing mixtures of probability distributions. Therefore, these methods enable the discretization of X-ray serial crystallography data into two probability distributions: a group comprising true data points (for example the background intensities) and another group comprising outliers (for example Bragg peaks or bad pixels on an X-ray detector). These characteristics of robust statistical analysis are beneficial for the ever-increasing volume of serial crystallography (SX) data sets produced at synchrotron and X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources. The key advantage of the use of robust statistics for some applications in SX data analysis is that it requires minimal parameter tuning because of its insensitivity to the input parameters. In this paper, a software package called Robust Gaussian Fitting library ( RGFlib ) is introduced that is based on the concept of robust statistics. Two methods are presented based on the concept of robust statistics and RGFlib for two SX data-analysis tasks: (i) a robust peak-finding algorithm and (ii) an automated robust method to detect bad pixels on X-ray pixel detectors.",

The effect of density modification on the starting maps from either source is illustrated in the case of SHELXE . The different modes in which the program can run are reviewed; these include less well known uses such as reading external phase values and weights or phase distributions encoded in Hendrickson–Lattman coefficients. Typically in SHELXE , initial phases are calculated from experimental data, from a partial model or map, or from a combination of both sources. The initial phase set is improved and extended by density modification and, if the resolution of the data and the type of structure permits, polyalanine tracing. As a feature to systematically eliminate model bias from phases derived from predicted models, the trace can be set to exclude the area occupied by the starting model. The trace now includes an extension into the gamma position or hydrophobic and aromatic side chains if a sequence is provided, which is performed in every tracing cycle. Once a correlation coefficient of over 30% between the structure factors calculated from such a trace and the native data indicates that the structure has been solved, the sequence is docked in all model-building cycles and side chains are fitted if the map supports it. The extensions to the tracing algorithm brought in to provide a complete model are discussed. The improvement in phasing performance is assessed using a set of tests.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has identified a potential role of the hyaluronic acid receptor stabilin-2 (Stab2) in cancer metastasis. Stab2 belongs to a group of scavenger receptors and is responsible for the clearance of more than ten ligands, including hyaluronic acid (HA). In vivo experiments on mice have shown that the absence of Stab2, or its blocking by an antibody, effectively opposes cancer metastasis, which is accompanied by an increase in the level of circulating HA. Knowledge of ligand recognition and signal transduction by Stab2 is limited and no three-dimensional structures of any protein fragments of this receptor have been solved to date. Here, a high-resolution X-ray structure of the seventh FAS1 domain of Stab2 is reported. This structure provides the first insight into the Stab2 structure.",

    "abstract": "A new type of mask-selection criterion is suggested for mask-based phasing. In this phasing approach, a large number of connected molecular masks are randomly generated. Structure-factor phases corresponding to a trial mask are accepted as an admissible solution of the phase problem if the mask satisfies some specified selection rules that are key to success. The admissible phase sets are aligned and averaged to give a preliminary solution of the phase problem. The new selection rule is based on the likelihood of the generated mask. It is defined as the probability of reproducing the observed structure-factor magnitudes by placing atoms randomly into the mask. While the result of the direct comparison of mask structure-factor magnitudes with observed ones using a correlation coefficient is highly dominated by a few very strong low-resolution reflections, a new method gives higher weight to relatively weak high-resolution reflections that allows them to be phased accurately. This mask-based phasing procedure with likelihood-based selection has been applied to simulated single-particle diffraction data of the photosystem II monomer. The phase set obtained resulted in a 16 Å resolution Fourier synthesis (more than 4000 reflections) with 98% correlation with the exact phase set and 69% correlation for about 2000 reflections in the highest resolution shell (20–16 Å). This work also addresses another essential problem of phasing methods, namely adequate estimation of the resolution achieved. A model-trapping analysis of the phase sets obtained by the mask-based phasing procedure suggests that the widely used `50% shell correlation' criterion may be too optimistic in some cases.",

    "abstract": "Suppressor of copper sensitivity protein C from Proteus mirabilis (PmScsC) is a homotrimeric disulfide isomerase that plays a role in copper tolerance, which is a key virulence trait of this uropathogen. Each protomer of the enzyme has an N-terminal trimerization stem (59 residues) containing a flexible linker (11 residues) connected to a thioredoxin-fold-containing catalytic domain (163 residues). Here, two PmScsC variants, PmScsCΔN and PmScsCΔLinker, are characterized. PmScsCΔN is an N-terminally truncated form of the protomer with two helices of the trimerization stem removed, generating a protein with dithiol oxidase rather than disulfide isomerase activity. The crystal structure of PmScsCΔN reported here reveals, as expected, a monomer that is structurally similar to the catalytic domain of native PmScsC. The second variant, PmScsCΔLinker, was designed to remove the 11-amino-acid linker, and it is shown that it generates a protein that has neither disulfide isomerase nor dithiol oxidase activity. The crystal structure of PmScsCΔLinker reveals a trimeric arrangement, with the catalytic domains packed together very closely. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis found that native PmScsC is predominantly trimeric in solution even at low concentrations, whereas PmScsCΔLinker exists as an equilibrium between monomeric, dimeric and trimeric states, with the monomeric form dominating at low concentrations. These findings increase the understanding of disulfide isomerase activity, showing how (i) oligomerization, (ii) the spacing between and (iii) the dynamic motion of catalytic domains in PmScsC all contribute to its native function.",

    "abstract": "Pyrrolidone-carboxylate peptidase (PCP) catalyzes the removal of an unusual amino acid, L-pyroglutamate (pG), from the N-termini of peptides and proteins. It has implications in the functional regulation of different peptides in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the pG-recognition mechanism of the PCP enzyme remains largely unknown. Here, crystal structures of PCP I from Deinococcus radiodurans (PCPdr) are reported in pG-free and pG-bound forms at resolutions of 1.73 and 1.55 Å, respectively. Four protomers in PCPdr form a tetrameric structure. The residues responsible for recognizing the pG residue are mostly contributed by a flexible loop (loop A) that is present near the active site. These residues are conserved in all known PCPs I, including those from mammals. Phe9 and Phe12 of loop A form stacking interactions with the pyrrolidone ring of pG, while Asn18 forms a hydrogen bond to OE of pG. The main chain of a nonconserved residue, Leu71, forms two hydrogen bonds to NH and OE of pG. Thus, pG is recognized in the S1 substrate subsite of the enzyme by both van der Waals and polar interactions, which provide specificity for the pG residue of the peptide. In contrast to previously reported PCP I structures, the PCPdr tetramer is in a closed conformation with an inaccessible active site. The structures show that the active site can be accessed by the substrates via disordering of loop A. This disordering could also prevent product inhibition by releasing the bound pG product from the S1 subsite, thus allowing the enzyme to engage a fresh substrate.",

In support of differential functions for the OLF propeller, the available crystal structures reveal that only some OLF domains harbor an internal calcium-binding site with ligands derived from a triad of residues. For the myocilin OLF domain (myoc-OLF), ablation of the ion-binding site (triad Asp, Asn, Asp) by altering the coordinating residues affects the stability and overall structure, in one case leading to misfolding and glaucoma. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a variety of triads with possible ion-binding characteristics lurking in OLF domains in invertebrate chordates such as Arthropoda (Asp–Glu–Ser), Nematoda (Asp–Asp–His) and Echinodermata (Asp–Glu–Lys). To test ion binding and to extend the observed connection between ion binding and distal structural rearrangements, consensus triads from these phyla were installed in the myoc-OLF. All three protein variants exhibit wild-type-like or better stability, but their calcium-binding properties differ, concomitant with new structural deviations from wild-type myoc-OLF. Taken together, the results indicate that calcium binding is not intrinsically destabilizing to myoc-OLF or required to observe a well ordered side helix, and that ion binding is a differential feature that may underlie the largely elusive biological function of OLF propellers.",

The N-terminal domain of the Sonic Hedgehog protein (Shh-N) is the essential signaling molecule in the Hedgehog pathway. In this role Shh-N interacts with its cognate membrane receptor Patched, as well as the regulatory proteins HHIP and CDO, by utilizing interfaces harboring one or more divalent ions. Here, the crystal structure of human Shh-N is presented at 1.43 Å resolution, representing a landmark in the characterization of this protein. The structure reveals that the conserved Zn 2+ -binding site adopts an atypical octahedral coordination geometry, whereas an adjacent binding site, normally occupied by binuclear Ca 2+ , has been supplanted by a single octahedrally bound Mg 2+ . Both divalent sites are compared with those in previous Shh-N structures, which demonstrates a significant degree of plasticity of the Shh-N protein in terms of divalent ion binding. The presence of a high Mg 2+ concentration in the crystallization medium appears to have influenced metal loading at both metal ion-binding sites. These observations have technical and design implications for efforts focused on the development of inhibitors that target Shh-N-mediated protein–protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Good prior estimates of the effective root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the atomic coordinates of the model and the target optimize the signal in molecular replacement, thereby increasing the success rate in difficult cases. Previous studies using protein structures solved by X-ray crystallography as models showed that optimal error estimates (refined after structure solution) were correlated with the sequence identity between the model and target, and with the number of residues in the model. Here, this work has been extended to find additional correlations between parameters of the model and the target and hence improved prior estimates of the coordinate error. Using a graph database, a curated set of 6030 molecular-replacement calculations using models that had been solved by X-ray crystallography was analysed to consider about 120 model and target parameters. Improved estimates were achieved by replacing the sequence identity with the Gonnet score for sequence similarity, as well as by considering the resolution of the target structure and the MolProbity score of the model. This approach was extended by analysing 12 610 additional molecular-replacement calculations where the model was determined by NMR. The median r.m.s.d. between pairs of models in an ensemble was found to be correlated with the estimated r.m.s.d. to the target. For models solved by NMR, the overall coordinate error estimates were larger than for structures determined by X-ray crystallography, and were more highly correlated with the number of residues.",

    "abstract": "Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is a prokaryotic pathogen that colonizes the respiratory ciliated epithelial cells in swine. Infected animals suffer respiratory lesions, causing major economic losses in the porcine industry. Characterization of the immunodominant membrane-associated proteins from M. hyopneumoniae may be instrumental in the development of new therapeutic approaches. Here, the crystal structure of P46, one of the main surface-antigen proteins, from M. hyopneumoniae is presented and shows N- and C-terminal α/β domains connected by a hinge. The structures solved in this work include a ligand-free open form of P46 (3.1 Å resolution) and two ligand-bound structures of P46 with maltose (2.5 Å resolution) and xylose (3.5 Å resolution) in open and closed conformations, respectively. The ligand-binding site is buried in the cleft between the domains at the hinge region. The two domains of P46 can rotate with respect to each other, giving open or closed alternative conformations. In agreement with this structural information, sequence analyses show similarities to substrate-binding members of the ABC transporter superfamily, with P46 facing the extracellular side as a functional subunit. In the structure with xylose, P46 was also bound to a high-affinity ( K d = 29 n M ) Fab fragment from a monoclonal antibody, allowing the characterization of a structural epitope in P46 that exclusively involves residues from the C-terminal domain. The Fab structure in the complex with P46 shows only small conformational rearrangements in the six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) with respect to the unbound Fab (the structure of which is also determined in this work at 1.95 Å resolution). The structural information that is now available should contribute to a better understanding of sugar nutrient intake by M. hyopneumoniae . This information will also allow the design of protocols and strategies for the generation of new vaccines against this important swine pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) are NADPH/NADP + -dependent oxidoreductase enzymes that metabolize an aldehyde/ketone to the corresponding alcohol. AKR4C14 from rice exhibits a much higher efficiency in metabolizing malondialdehyde (MDA) than do the Arabidopsis enzymes AKR4C8 and AKR4C9, despite sharing greater than 60% amino-acid sequence identity. This study confirms the role of rice AKR4C14 in the detoxification of methylglyoxal and MDA, and demonstrates that the endogenous contents of both aldehydes in transgenic Arabidopsis ectopically expressing AKR4C14 are significantly lower than their levels in the wild type. The apo structure of indica rice AKR4C14 was also determined in the absence of the cofactor, revealing the stabilized open conformation. This is the first crystal structure in AKR subfamily 4C from rice to be observed in the apo form (without bound NADP + ). The refined AKR4C14 structure reveals a stabilized open conformation of loop B, suggesting the initial phase prior to cofactor binding. Based on the X-ray crystal structure, the substrate- and cofactor-binding pockets of AKR4C14 are formed by loops A, B, C and β1α1. Moreover, the residues Ser211 and Asn220 on loop B are proposed as the hinge residues that are responsible for conformational alteration while the cofactor binds. The open conformation of loop B is proposed to involve Phe216 pointing out from the cofactor-binding site and the opening of the safety belt. Structural comparison with other AKRs in subfamily 4C emphasizes the role of the substrate-channel wall, consisting of Trp24, Trp115, Tyr206, Phe216, Leu291 and Phe295, in substrate discrimination. In particular, Leu291 could contribute greatly to substrate selectivity, explaining the preference of AKR4C14 for its straight-chain aldehyde substrate.",

Most of the associated hypermethioninemic conditions are inherited as autosomal recessive traits; however, dominant inheritance of hypermethioninemia is caused by an Arg264His (R264H) mutation. This mutation has been confirmed in a screening programme of newborns as the most common mutation in babies with IPH. Arg264 makes an inter-subunit salt bridge located at the dimer interface where the active site assembles. Here, it is demonstrated that the R264H mutation results in greatly reduced MAT activity, while retaining its ability to dimerize, indicating that the lower activity arises from alteration at the active site. The first crystallographic structure of the apo form of the wild-type MATαl enzyme is provided, which shows a tetrameric assembly in which two compact dimers combine to form a catalytic tetramer. In contrast, the crystal structure of the MATαl R264H mutant reveals a weaker dimeric assembly, suggesting that the mutation lowers the affinity for dimer-dimer interaction. The formation of a hetero-oligomer with the regulatory MATβV1 subunit or incubation with a quinolone-based compound (SCR0911) results in the near-full recovery of the enzymatic activity of the pathogenic mutation R264H, opening a clear avenue for a therapeutic solution based on chemical interventions that help to correct the defect of the enzyme in its ability to metabolize methionine.",

Here, as an example, the solution of the structure of a bacteriophage portal using a partial 30% model built into a 7.8 Å resolution cryo-EM map is shown. Inspection of the self-rotation function allowed the correct oligomerization state to be determined, and density-modification procedures using rotation matrices and a mask based on the cryo-EM structure were critical for solving the structure. A workflow is described that may be applicable to similar cases and this strategy is compared with direct use of the cryo-EM map for molecular replacement.",

    "abstract": "Crystal structures of hemoglobin (Hb) from two flightless birds, ostrich (Struthio camelus) and turkey (Meleagris gallopova), were determined. The ostrich Hb structure was solved to a resolution of 2.22 Å, whereas two forms of turkey Hb were solved to resolutions of 1.66 Å (turkey monoclinic structure; TMS) and 1.39 Å (turkey orthorhombic structure; TOS). Comparison of the amino-acid sequences of ostrich and turkey Hb with those from other avian species revealed no difference in the number of charged residues, but variations were observed in the numbers of hydrophobic and polar residues. Amino-acid-composition-based computation of various physical parameters, in particular their lower inverse transition temperatures and higher average hydrophobicities, indicated that the structures of ostrich and turkey Hb are likely to be highly ordered when compared with other avian Hbs. From the crystal structure analysis, the liganded state of ostrich Hb was confirmed by the presence of an oxygen molecule between the Fe atom and the proximal histidine residue in all four heme regions. In turkey Hb (both TMS and TOS), a water molecule was bound instead of an oxygen molecule in all four heme regions, thus confirming that they assumed the aqua-met form. Analysis of tertiary- and quaternary-structural features led to the conclusion that ostrich oxy Hb and turkey aqua-met Hb adopt the R-/RH-state conformation.",

Altering the amino acids in the chromophore or the nearby region has resulted in numerous GFP variants with differing photophysical properties. To further examine the effect of small atomic changes in the chromophore on the structure and photophysical properties of GFP, the hydroxyl group of the chromophore tyrosine was replaced with a nitro or a cyano group. The structures and spectrophotometric properties of these superfolder GFP (sfGFP) variants with the unnatural amino acids (UAAs) 4-nitro-L-phenylalanine or 4-cyano-L-phenylalanine were explored. Notably, the characteristic 487 nm absorbance band of wild-type (wt) sfGFP is absent in both unnatural amino-acid-containing protein constructs (Tyr66pNO 2 Phe-sfGFP and Tyr66pCNPhe-sfGFP). Consequently, neither Tyr66pNO 2 Phe-sfGFP nor Tyr66pCNPhe-sfGFP exhibited the characteristic emission of wt sfGFP centered at 511 nm when excited at 487 nm. Tyr66pNO 2 Phe-sfGFP appeared orange due to an absorbance band centered at 406 nm that was not present in wt sfGFP, while Tyr66pCNPhe-sfGFP appeared colorless with an absorbance band centered at 365 nm. Mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography confirmed the presence of a fully formed chromophore and no significant structural changes in either of these UAA-containing protein constructs, signaling that the change in the observed photophysical properties of the proteins is the result of the presence of the UAA in the chromophore.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of ligands bound to proteins is an important task in medicinal chemistry and drug design. However, the dominant technique for determining protein–ligand structures, X-ray crystallography, does not fully account for dynamics and cannot accurately describe the movements of ligands in protein binding sites. In this article, an alternative method, ensemble refinement, is used on six protein–ligand complexes with the aim of understanding the conformational diversity of ligands in protein crystal structures. The results show that ensemble refinement sometimes indicates that the flexibility of parts of the ligand and some protein side chains is larger than that which can be described by a single conformation and atomic displacement parameters. However, since the electron-density maps are comparable and R free values are slightly increased, the original crystal structure is still a better model from a statistical point of view. On the other hand, it is shown that molecular-dynamics simulations and automatic generation of alternative conformations in crystallographic refinement confirm that the flexibility of these groups is larger than is observed in standard refinement. Moreover, the flexible groups in ensemble refinement coincide with groups that give high atomic displacement parameters or non-unity occupancy if optimized in standard refinement. Therefore, the conformational diversity indicated by ensemble refinement seems to be qualitatively correct, indicating that ensemble refinement can be an important complement to standard crystallographic refinement as a tool to discover which parts of crystal structures may show extensive flexibility and therefore are poorly described by a single conformation. However, the diversity of the ensembles is often exaggerated (probably partly owing to the rather poor force field employed) and the ensembles should not be trusted in detail.",

In vitro refolding is commonly used for the recovery of recombinant proteins that are expressed in the form of inclusion bodies and is of central interest in terms of the folding pathways that occur in vivo. Here, biophysical data are reported for in vitro-refolded hydrogenated hen egg-white lysozyme, in combination with atomic resolution X-ray diffraction analyses, which allowed detailed comparisons with native hydrogenated and refolded perdeuterated lysozyme. Distinct folding modes are observed for the hydrogenated and perdeuterated refolded variants, which are determined by conformational changes to the backbone structure of the Lys97–Gly104 flexible loop. Surprisingly, the structure of the refolded perdeuterated protein is closer to that of native lysozyme than that of the refolded hydrogenated protein. These structural differences suggest that the observed decreases in thermal stability and enzymatic activity in the refolded perdeuterated and hydrogenated proteins are consequences of the macromolecular deuteration effect and of distinct folding dynamics, respectively. These results are discussed in the context of both in vitro and in vivo folding, as well as of lysozyme amyloidogenesis.",

The former lacks the capacity to capture the overall local ultrastructure, while the latter requires rigorous sample preparation that can lead to potential artefacts, and only delivers relatively small volumes of imaging data at the thinnest areas of a cell. In this work, a correlative approach utilizing in situ super-resolution fluorescence imaging and cryo X-ray tomography was used to image bundles of actin filaments deep inside cells under near-native conditions. In this case, fluorescence 3D imaging localized the actin bundles within the intracellular space, while X-ray tomograms of the same areas provided detailed views of the local ultrastructure. Using this new approach, actin trails connecting vesicles in the perinuclear area and hotspots of actin presence within and around multivesicular bodies were observed. The characteristic prevalence of filamentous actin in cytoplasmic extensions was also documented.",

Patients with genetic deficiency in HsADA1 suffer from severe combined immunodeficiency, and HsADA1 is a therapeutic target in hairy cell leukemias. Historically, insights into the catalytic mechanism and the structural attributes of HsADA1 have been derived from studies of its homologs from Bos taurus (BtADA) and Mus musculus (MmADA). Here, the structure of holo HsADA1 is presented, as well as biochemical characterization that confirms its high activity and shows that it is active across a broad pH range. Structurally, holo HsADA1 adopts a closed conformation distinct from the open conformation of holo BtADA. Comparison of holo HsADA1 and MmADA reveals that MmADA also adopts a closed conformation. These findings challenge previous assumptions gleaned from BtADA regarding the conformation of HsADA1 that may be relevant to its immunological interactions, particularly its ability to bind adenosine receptors. From a broader perspective, the structural analysis of HsADA1 presents a cautionary tale for reliance on homologs to make structural inferences relevant to applications such as protein engineering or drug development.",

    "abstract": "The family B DNA polymerase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis ( Pc -polymerase) consists of 783 amino acids and is magnesium-ion dependent. It has an optimal pH of 8.5, an optimal temperature of 75°C and a half-life of 4.5 h at 95°C, giving it greater thermostability than the widely used Taq DNA polymerase. The enzyme is also capable of PCR-amplifying larger DNA fragments of up to 7.5 kb in length. It was shown to have functional, error-correcting 3′–5′ exonuclease activity, as do the related high-fidelity DNA polymerases from Pyrococcus furiosus , Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 and Thermococcus gorgonarius , which have extensive commercial applications. Pc -polymerase has a quite low sequence identity of approximately 37% to these enzymes, which, in contrast, have very high sequence identity to each other, suggesting that the P. calidifontis enzyme is distinct. Here, the structure determination of Pc -polymerase is reported, which has been refined to an R factor of 24.47% and an R free of 28.81% at 2.80 Å resolution. The domains of the enzyme are arranged in a circular fashion to form a disc with a narrow central channel. One face of the disc has a number of connected crevices in it, which allow the protein to bind duplex and single-stranded DNA. The central channel is thought to allow incoming nucleoside triphosphates to access the active site. The enzyme has a number of unique structural features which distinguish it from other archaeal DNA polymerases and may account for its high processivity. A model of the complex with the primer-template duplex of DNA indicates that the largest conformational change that occurs upon DNA binding is the movement of the thumb domain, which rotates by 7.6° and moves by 10.0 Å. The surface potential of the enzyme is dominated by acidic groups in the central region of the molecule, where catalytic magnesium ions bind at the polymerase and exonuclease active sites. The outer regions are richer in basic amino acids that presumably interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA. The large number of salt bridges may contribute to the high thermal stability of this enzyme.",

Here, crystal structures of the NgR LRR with a longer C-terminal segment and a native disulfide pattern are presented. An additional C-terminal loop proximal to the C-terminal LRR cap is stabilized by two newly formed disulfide bonds, but is otherwise mostly unstructured in the absence of any stabilizing interactions. NgR crystallized in six unique crystal forms, three of which share a crystal-packing interface. NgR crystal-packing interfaces from all eight unique crystal forms are compared in order to explore how NgR could self-interact on the neuronal plasma membrane.",

A comparison of the structures of the mutant and the wild-type enzyme showed that one dimer in the mutant hexamer differs from all other dimers in the mutant and wild-type SoUP (both in the free form and in complex with uridine). The key difference is the `maximum open' state of one of the subunits comprising this dimer, which has not been observed previously for uridine phosphorylases. Some conformational features of the SoUP dimer that provide access of the substrate into the active site are revealed.

    "abstract": "Molecular averaging, including noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging, is a powerful method for ab initio phase determination and phase improvement. Applications of the cross-crystal averaging (CCA) method have been shown to be effective for phase improvement after initial phasing by molecular replacement, isomorphous replacement, anomalous dispersion or combinations of these methods. Here, a two-step process for phase determination in the X-ray structural analysis of a new coat protein from a betanodavirus, Grouper nervous necrosis virus , is described in detail. The first step is ab initio structure determination of the T = 3 icosahedral virus-like particle using NCS averaging (NCSA). The second step involves structure determination of the protrusion domain of the viral molecule using cross-crystal averaging. In this method, molecular averaging and solvent flattening constrain the electron density in real space. To quantify these constraints, a new, simple and general indicator, free fraction (ff), is introduced, where ff is defined as the ratio of the volume of the electron density that is freely changed to the total volume of the crystal unit cell. This indicator is useful and effective to evaluate the strengths of both NCSA and CCA. Under the condition that a mask (envelope) covers the target molecule well, an ff value of less than 0.1, as a new rule of thumb, gives sufficient phasing power for the successful construction of new structures.",

    "abstract": "The crystal structure of the natural nonapeptide antibiotic helioferin has been determined and refined to 0.9 Å resolution. Helioferin consists of helioferin A and B, which contain 2-(2'-aminopropyl)aminoethanol (Apae) and 2-[(2'-aminopropyl)methylamino]ethanol (Amae) at their respective alkanolamine termini. In addition, helioferin contains the unusual amino-acid residues α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) and (2S,4S,6S)-2-amino-6-hydroxy-4-methyl-8-oxodecanoic acid (Ahmod). The amino-terminus is capped with 2-methyl-n-1-octanoic acid (M8a). The peptide crystallizes with a 1:1 molar ratio of helioferin A and B in the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 34.711, b = 10.886, c = 17.150 Å, β = 93.05°. The peptide backbone folds in a regular right-handed α-helical conformation, with eight intramolecular hydrogen bonds, all but one forming 5→1 interactions. The two aliphatic chains of the fatty-acyl (M8a) and the second residue (Ahmod) extend out of the α-helical structure in opposite directions and lead to a corkscrew-like shape of the peptide molecule. Halogen anions (Cl- and F-) have been co-crystallized with the peptide molecules, implying a positive charge at the aminoalcohol end of the peptide. In the tightly packed crystal the helices are linked head to tail via the anions by electrostatic, hydrogen-bond and van der Waals interactions, forming continuous helical rods. Two nonparallel rods (forming an angle of 118°) interact directly via hydrogen bonds and via the anions, forming a double layer. Successive double layers are held together only via van der Waals contacts. The helical axes of successive double layers are also related by an angle of 118°. The structure of helioferin reported here and the previously determined structure of the homologous leucinostatin A have a total straight length of about 21 Å, indicating a different membrane-modifying bioactivity from that of long-chain, amphiphilic peptaibols.",

Small-molecule inhibitors that target Mt DTBS provide a route towards new therapeutics for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is an inhibitor of Mt DTBS; however, structural studies into its mechanism of inhibition have been unsuccessful owing to competitive binding to the enzyme by crystallographic precipitants such as citrate and sulfate. Here, a crystallographic technique termed precipitant–ligand exchange has been developed to exchange protein-bound precipitants with ligands of interest. Proof of concept for the exchange method was demonstrated using cytidine triphosphate (CTP), which adopted the same binding mechanism as that obtained with traditional crystal-soaking techniques. Precipitant–ligand exchange also yielded the previously intractable structure of Mt DTBS in complex with ADP solved to 2.4 Å resolution. This result demonstrates the utility of precipitant–ligand exchange, which may be widely applicable to protein crystallography.",

Like most other wHTH orthologs, AbfR2 is dimeric in solution as well as in its 2.45 Å resolution crystal structure. Given the presence of three independent AbfR2 dimers in the asymmetric unit, the crystal structure shows a considerable degree of conformational variation within the dimer, the antiparallel orientations of which are stabilized by coiled-coil interaction between H4 helices. Conserved anchor interactions between helices H0 and H4 of AbfR2 further contribute to dimer stabilization.

The archetypal DSB machinery from Escherichia coli K-12 consists of a dithiol-oxidizing redox-relay pair (DsbA/B), a disulfide-isomerizing redox-relay pair (DsbC/D) and the specialist reducing enzymes DsbE and DsbG that also interact with DsbD. By contrast, the Gram-negative bacterium Wolbachia pipientis encodes just three DSB enzymes. Two of these, α-DsbA1 and α-DsbB, form a redox-relay pair analogous to DsbA/B from E. coli . The third enzyme, α-DsbA2, incorporates a DsbA-like sequence but does not interact with α-DsbB. In comparison to other DsbA enzymes, α-DsbA2 has ∼50 extra N-terminal residues (excluding the signal peptide). The crystal structure of α-DsbA2ΔN, an N-terminally truncated form in which these ∼50 residues are removed, confirms the DsbA-like nature of this domain. However, α-DsbA2 does not have DsbA-like activity: it is structurally and functionally different as a consequence of its N-terminal residues. Firstly, α-DsbA2 is a powerful disulfide isomerase and a poor dithiol oxidase: i.e. its role is to shuffle rather than to introduce disulfide bonds. Moreover, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) of α-DsbA2 reveals a homotrimeric arrangement that differs from those of the other characterized bacterial disulfide isomerases DsbC from Escherichia coli (homodimeric) and ScsC from Proteus mirabilis (PmScsC; homotrimeric with a shape-shifter peptide). α-DsbA2 lacks the shape-shifter motif and SAXS data suggest that it is less flexible than PmScsC. These results allow conclusions to be drawn about the factors that are required for functionally equivalent disulfide isomerase enzymatic activity across structurally diverse protein architectures.",

However, the mechanisms that regulate the conversion of spider silk proteins (spidroins) from highly soluble dope into silk are not completely understood. The N-terminal domain (NT) of Euprosthenops australis dragline silk protein undergoes conformational and quaternary-structure changes from a monomer at a pH above 7 to a homodimer at lower pH values. Conversion from the monomer to the dimer requires the protonation of three conserved glutamic acid residues, resulting in a low-pH `locked' dimer stabilized by symmetric electrostatic interactions at the poles of the dimer. The detailed molecular events during this transition are still unresolved. Here, a 2.1 Å resolution crystal structure of an NT T61A mutant in an alternative, asymmetric, dimer form in which the electrostatic interactions at one of the poles are dramatically different from those in symmetrical dimers is presented. A similar asymmetric dimer structure from dragline silk of Nephila clavipes has previously been described. It is suggested that asymmetric dimers represent a conserved intermediate state in spider silk formation, and a revised `lock-and-trigger' mechanism for spider silk formation is presented.",

Earlier versions of AMPLE enabled the trialling of a library of ideal helices, which worked well for largely helical proteins at suitable resolutions. Here, the performance of libraries of helical ensembles created by clustering helical segments is explored. The impacts of different B -factor treatments and different degrees of structural heterogeneity are explored. A 30% increase in the number of solutions obtained by AMPLE was observed when using this new set of ensembles compared with the performance with ideal helices. The boost in performance was notable across three different fold classes: transmembrane, globular and coiled-coil structures. Furthermore, the increased effectiveness of these ensembles was coupled to a reduction in the time required by AMPLE to reach a solution. AMPLE users can now take full advantage of this new library of search models by activating the `helical ensembles' mode.",

    "abstract": "Nairoviruses are arthropod-borne viruses with a nearly global geographical distribution. Several are known causative agents of human disease, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which has a case fatality rate that can exceed 30%. Nairoviruses encode an ovarian tumour domain protease (OTU) that can suppress the innate immune response by reversing post-translational modifications by ubiquitin (Ub) and/or interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). As a result, the OTU has been identified as a potential target for the development of CCHFV therapeutics. Despite sharing the same general fold, nairoviral OTUs show structural and enzymatic diversity. The CCHFV OTU, for example, possesses activity towards both Ub and ISG15, while the Hazara virus (HAZV) OTU interacts exclusively with Ub. Virology studies focused on the OTU have mostly been restricted to CCHFV, which requires BSL-4 containment facilities. Although HAZV has been proposed as a BSL-2 alternative, differences in the engagement of substrates by CCHFV and HAZV OTUs may present complicating factors when trying to model one using the other. To understand the molecular underpinnings of the differences in activity, a 2.78 Å resolution crystal structure of HAZV OTU bound to Ub was solved. Using structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis, HAZV OTUs were engineered with altered or eliminated deubiquitinase activity, including one with an exclusive activity for ISG15. Additionally, analysis of the structure yielded insights into the difference in inhibition observed between CCHFV and HAZV OTUs with a Ub-based inhibitor. These new insights present opportunities to utilize HAZV as a model system to better understand the role of the OTU in the context of infection.",

MFE1 is a monomeric enzyme that has five domains. The N-terminal part (domains A and B) adopts the crotonase fold and the C-terminal part (domains C, D and E) adopts the HAD fold. A new crystal form of MFE1 has captured a conformation in which both active sites are noncompetent. This structure, at 1.7 Å resolution, shows the importance of the interactions between Phe272 in domain B (the linker helix; helix H10 of the crotonase fold) and the beginning of loop 2 (of the crotonase fold) in stabilizing the competent ECH active-site geometry. In addition, protein crystallographic binding studies using optimized crystal-treatment protocols have captured a structure with both the 3-ketodecanoyl-CoA product and NAD + bound in the HAD active site, showing the interactions between 3-ketodecanoyl-CoA and residues of the C, D and E domains. Structural comparisons show the importance of domain movements, in particular of the C domain with respect to the D/E domains and of the A domain with respect to the HAD part. These comparisons suggest that the N-terminal part of the linker helix, which interacts tightly with domains A and E, functions as a hinge region for movement of the A domain with respect to the HAD part.",

It has been proposed that the underlying mechanism for transport by ASBT is an elevator-style alternating-access model, which was deduced mainly by comparing high-resolution structures of two bacterial ASBT homologs (ASBT NM from Neisseria meningitides and ASBT Yf from Yersinia frederiksenii ) in different conformations. However, one important issue is that the only outward-facing structure (PDB entry 4n7x) was obtained with an Na + -binding site mutant of ASBT Yf , which severely cripples its transport function, and therefore the physiological relevance of the conformation in PDB entry 4n7x requires further careful evaluation. Here, another crystal structure is reported of ASBT Yf that was captured in a state closely resembling the conformation in PDB entry 4n7x using an engineered disulfide bridge. The introduced cysteine mutations avoided any proposed Na + - or substrate-binding residues, and the resulting mutant retained both structural and functional integrity and behaved similarly to wild-type ASBT Yf . These data support the hypothesis that the PDB entry 4n7x-like structure represents a functional outward-facing conformation of ASBT Yf in its transport cycle.",

Understanding how interdomain interactions in Ncb5or facilitate the shuttling of electrons from NAD(P)H to heme, and how the process compares with the microsomal b5 (Cyb5A) and b5R (Cyb5R3) system, is of interest. A high-resolution structure of the b5 domain (PDB entry 3lf5) has previously been reported, which exhibits substantial differences in comparison to Cyb5A. The structural characterization of a construct comprising the naturally fused CS and b5R domains with bound FAD and NAD+ (PDB entry 6mv1) or NADP+ (PDB entry 6mv2) is now reported. The structures reveal that the linker between the CS and b5R cores is more ordered than predicted, with much of it extending the β-sandwich motif of the CS domain. This limits the flexibility between the two domains, which recognize one another via a short β-sheet motif and a network of conserved side-chain hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and cation-π interactions. Notable differences in FAD-protein interactions in Ncb5or and Cyb5R3 provide insight into the selectivity for docking of their respective b5 redox partners. The structures also afford a structural explanation for the unusual ability of Ncb5or to utilize both NADH and NADPH, and represent the first examples of native, fully oxidized b5R family members in which the nicotinamide ring of NAD(P)+ resides in the active site. Finally, the structures, together with sequence alignments, show that the b5R domain is more closely related to single-domain Cyb5R proteins from plants, fungi and some protists than to Cyb5R3 from animals.",

To investigate the function of family members in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the structure of the C-terminal ectodomain from Rv2874, one of three CcdA-family members present in the genome, was determined. The crystal structure, which was refined at 1.9 Å resolution with R = 0.195 and Rfree = 0.219, reveals the predicted thioredoxin-like domain with its conserved Cys-X-X-Cys active-site motif. Unexpectedly, this domain is combined with a second domain with a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) fold, this being the first reported example of a CBM in association with a thioredoxin-like domain fold. A cavity in the CBM adjacent to the thioredoxin active site suggests a likely carbohydrate-binding site, representing a broadening of the substrate range for CcdA-family members and an expansion of the thioredoxin-domain functionality to carbohydrate modification.",

However, anomalous SAXS is seldom used for protein research due to practical difficulties, such as a lack of generic multivalent metal-binding tags and the challenges of measuring weak anomalous signal at the metal absorption edge. This pilot feasibility study suggests that weak K -edge anomalous SAXS signal can be obtained from transition metals bound to terminally located histidine tags of small proteins. The measured anomalous signal can provide information about the distribution of all metal–protein distances in the complex. Such an anomalous SAXS signal can assist in the modeling and validation of structured or unstructured proteins in solution and may potentially become a new addition to the repertoire of techniques in integrative structural biology.",

    "abstract": "Xylan is a major constituent of plant cell walls and is a potential source of biomaterials, and the derived oligosaccharides have been shown to have prebiotic effects. Xylans can be highly substituted with different sugar moieties, which pose steric hindrance to the xylanases that catalyse the hydrolysis of the xylan backbone. One such substituent is α-D-glucuronic acid, which is linked to the O2′ position of the β-1,4 D-xylopyranoses composing the main chain of xylans. The xylan-specific α-glucuronidases from glycoside hydrolase family 115 (GH115) specifically catalyse the removal of α-D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) or methylated GlcA (MeGlcA). Here, the molecular basis by which the bacterial GH115 member wtsAgu115A interacts with the main chain of xylan and the indirect involvement of divalent ions in the formation of the Michaelis–Menten complex are described. A crystal structure at 2.65 Å resolution of wtsAgu115A originating from a metagenome from an anaerobic digester fed with wastewater treatment sludge was determined in complex with xylohexaose, and Asp303 was identified as the likely general acid. The residue acting as the general base could not be identified. However, a proton wire connecting the active site to the metal site was observed and hence a previous hypothesis suggesting a Grotthuss-like mechanism cannot be rejected. Only a single molecule was found in the asymmetric unit. However, wtsAgu115A forms a dimer with a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal lattice. The xylohexaose moieties of the xylohexaose are recognized by residues from both protomers, thus creating a xylohexaose recognition site at the dimer interface. The dimer was confirmed by analytical size-exclusion chromatography in solution. Kinetic analysis with aldouronic acids resulted in a Hill coefficient of greater than 2, suggesting cooperativity between the two binding sites. Three Ca 2+ ions were identified in the wtsAgu115A structures. One Ca 2+ ion is of particular interest as it is coordinated by the residues of the loops that also interact with the substrate. Activity studies showed that the presence of Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ resulted in a higher activity towards aldouronic acids, while the less restrictive coordination geometry of Ca 2+ resulted in a decrease in activity.",

The crystallographic community has many decades of tradition linking articles with the underpinning data, and is admired across all sciences accordingly. Crystallography has always been at the forefront of harnessing new technology in the service of consensus. Technology has provided new vast data-archiving opportunities, allowing the preservation of raw diffraction data, along with article and database depositions of a model's coordinates and associated structure factors. The raw diffraction data, which can now be preserved, are the ground truth from which all subsequent workflows develop. Journal editorial boards provide a practical forum for setting the criteria to decide if a study's files are truly the version of record. Within that, reality involves a variance of reasonable workflows. But what is a reasonable variance? Workflows must be detailed carefully by authors in explaining what they have done. There is a great, and increasing, diversity of macromolecular crystallography analyses, and yet an increased constraint on how much can be written in an article about the workflow used. Raw data provide the ultimate reproducibility evidence. A part of reproducibility and replicability is using an agreed vocabulary; the meaning of words such as precision and accuracy and, more recently, the confidence of a protein structure prediction should feature in approaching `truth'.",

LpqY, a substrate-binding protein from the SugABC transporter, acts as the primary receptor for the recognition of trehalose, leading to its transport across the cell membrane. Since trehalose is crucial for the survival and virulence of Mtb, trehalose receptors should serve as important targets for novel drug design against tuberculosis. In order to comprehend the detailed architecture and substrate specificity, the first crystal structures of both apo and trehalose-bound forms of M. tuberculosis LpqY (Mtb-LpqY) are presented here at 2.2 and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively. The structure exhibits an N-lobe and C-lobe and is predominantly composed of a globular α/β domain connected by a flexible hinge region concealing a deep binding cleft. Although the trehalose-bound form of Mtb-LpqY revealed an open ligand-bound conformation, the glucose moieties of trehalose are seen to be strongly held in place by direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds within the binding cavity, producing a K d of 6.58 ± 1.21 µ M . These interactions produce a distinct effect on the stereoselectivity for the α-1,1-glycosidic linkage of trehalose. Consistent with the crystal structure, molecular-dynamics simulations further validated Asp43, Asp97 and Asn151 as key residues responsible for strong and stable interactions throughout a 1 µs time frame, thus capturing trehalose in the binding cavity. Collectively, the results provide detailed insights into how the structure and dynamics of Mtb-LpqY enable it to specifically bind trehalose in a relaxed conformation state.",

    "abstract": "Protein crystals grown in microfluidic droplets have been shown to be an effective and robust platform for storage, transport and serial crystallography data collection with a minimal impact on diffraction quality. Single macromolecular microcrystals grown in nanolitre-sized droplets allow the very efficient use of protein samples and can produce large quantities of high-quality samples for data collection. However, there are challenges not only in growing crystals in microfluidic droplets, but also in delivering the droplets into X-ray beams, including the physical arrangement, beamline and timing constraints and ease of use. Here, the crystallization of two human gut microbial hydrolases in microfluidic droplets is described: a sample-transport and data-collection approach that is inexpensive, is convenient, requires small amounts of protein and is forgiving. It is shown that crystals can be grown in 50–500 pl droplets when the crystallization conditions are compatible with the droplet environment. Local and remote data-collection methods are described and it is shown that crystals grown in microfluidics droplets and housed as an emulsion in an Eppendorf tube can be shipped from the US to the UK using a FedEx envelope, and data can be collected successfully. Details of how crystals were delivered to the X-ray beam by depositing an emulsion of droplets onto a silicon fixed-target serial device are provided. After three months of storage at 4°C, the crystals endured and diffracted well, showing only a slight decrease in diffracting power, demonstrating a suitable way to grow crystals, and to store and collect the droplets with crystals for data collection. This sample-delivery and data-collection strategy allows crystal droplets to be shipped and set aside until beamtime is available.",

The nucleoprotein exists in an `open' or a `closed' conformation. In the case of the closed conformation the flexible N-terminal arm folds over the RNA-binding cleft, preventing RNA adsorption. In the open conformation the arm is extended in such a way that both RNA adsorption and N polymerization are possible. In this article, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering were used to study the N protein of Toscana virus complexed with a single-chain camelid antibody (VHH) and it is shown that in the presence of the antibody the nucleoprotein is unable to achieve a functional assembly to form a ribonucleoprotein complex.",

    "abstract": "Catalase is an antioxidant enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) into molecular oxygen and water. In all monofunctional catalases the pathway that H 2 O 2 takes to the catalytic centre is via the `main channel'. However, the structure of this channel differs in large-subunit and small-subunit catalases. In large-subunit catalases the channel is 15 Å longer and consists of two distinct parts, including a hydrophobic lower region near the heme and a hydrophilic upper region where multiple H 2 O 2 routes are possible. Conserved glutamic acid and threonine residues are located near the intersection of these two regions. Mutations of these two residues in the Scytalidium thermophilum catalase had no significant effect on catalase activity. However, the secondary phenol oxidase activity was markedly altered, with k cat and k cat / K m values that were significantly increased in the five variants E484A, E484I, T188D, T188I and T188F. These variants also showed a lower affinity for inhibitors of oxidase activity than the wild-type enzyme and a higher affinity for phenolic substrates. Oxidation of heme b to heme d did not occur in most of the studied variants. Structural changes in solvent-chain integrity and channel architecture were also observed. In summary, modification of the main-channel gate glutamic acid and threonine residues has a greater influence on the secondary activity of the catalase enzyme, and the oxidation of heme b to heme d is predominantly inhibited by their conversion to aliphatic and aromatic residues.",

Actinobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , use the LMW thiol mycothiol (MSH) to buffer the intracellular redox environment. The NADPH-dependent FAD-containing oxidoreductase mycothiol disulfide reductase (Mtr) is known to reduce oxidized mycothiol disulfide (MSSM) to MSH, which is crucial to maintain the cellular redox balance. In this work, the first crystal structures of Mtr are presented, expanding the structural knowledge and understanding of LMW thiol reductases. The structural analyses and docking calculations provide insight into the nature of Mtrs, with regard to the binding and reduction of the MSSM substrate, in the context of related oxidoreductases. The putative binding site for MSSM suggests a similar binding to that described for the homologous glutathione reductase and its respective substrate glutathione disulfide, but with distinct structural differences shaped to fit the bulkier MSSM substrate, assigning Mtrs as uniquely functioning reductases. As MSH has been acknowledged as an attractive antitubercular target, the structural findings presented in this work may contribute towards future antituberculosis drug development.",

    "abstract": "Type VII secretion (T7S) systems, also referred to as ESAT-6 secretion (ESX) systems, are molecular machines that have gained great attention due to their implications in cell homeostasis and in host–pathogen interactions in mycobacteria. The latter include important human pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), the etiological cause of human tuberculosis, which constitutes a pandemic accounting for more than one million deaths every year. The ESX-5 system is exclusively found in slow-growing pathogenic mycobacteria, where it mediates the secretion of a large family of virulence factors: the PE and PPE proteins. The secretion driving force is provided by EccC 5 , a multidomain ATPase that operates using four globular cytosolic domains: an N-terminal domain of unknown function (EccC 5 DUF ) and three FtsK/SpoIIIE ATPase domains. Recent structural and functional studies of ESX-3 and ESX-5 systems have revealed EccC DUF to be an ATPase-like fold domain with potential ATPase activity, the functionality of which is essential for secretion. Here, the crystal structure of the Mtb EccC 5 DUF domain is reported at 2.05 Å resolution, which reveals a nucleotide-free structure with degenerated cis -acting and trans -acting elements involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. This crystallographic study, together with a biophysical assessment of the interaction of Mtb EccC 5 DUF with ATP/Mg 2+ , supports the absence of ATPase activity proposed for this domain. It is shown that this degeneration is also present in DUF domains from other ESX and ESX-like systems, which are likely to exhibit poor or null ATPase activity. Moreover, based on an in silico model of the N-terminal region of Mtb EccC 5 DUF , it is hypothesized that Mtb EccC 5 DUF is a degenerated ATPase domain that may have retained the ability to hexamerize. These observations draw attention to DUF domains as structural elements with potential implications in the opening and closure of the membrane pore during the secretion process via their involvement in inter-protomer interactions.",

    "abstract": "For cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of beam-sensitive biological specimens, a planar sample geometry is typically used. As the sample is tilted, the effective thickness of the sample along the direction of the electron beam increases and the signal-to-noise ratio concomitantly decreases, limiting the transfer of information at high tilt angles. In addition, the tilt range where data can be collected is limited by a combination of various sample-environment constraints, including the limited space in the objective lens pole piece and the possible use of fixed conductive braids to cool the specimen. Consequently, most tilt series are limited to a maximum of ±70°, leading to the presence of a missing wedge in Fourier space. The acquisition of cryo-ET data without a missing wedge, for example using a cylindrical sample geometry, is hence attractive for volumetric analysis of low-symmetry structures such as organelles or vesicles, lysis events, pore formation or filaments for which the missing information cannot be compensated by averaging techniques. Irrespective of the geometry, electron-beam damage to the specimen is an issue and the first images acquired will transfer more high-resolution information than those acquired last. There is also an inherent trade-off between higher sampling in Fourier space and avoiding beam damage to the sample. Finally, the necessity of using a sufficient electron fluence to align the tilt images means that this fluence needs to be fractionated across a small number of images; therefore, the order of data acquisition is also a factor to consider. Here, an n -helix tilt scheme is described and simulated which uses overlapping and interleaved tilt series to maximize the use of a pillar geometry, allowing the entire pillar volume to be reconstructed as a single unit. Three related tilt schemes are also evaluated that extend the continuous and classic dose-symmetric tilt schemes for cryo-ET to pillar samples to enable the collection of isotropic information across all spatial frequencies. A fourfold dose-symmetric scheme is proposed which provides a practical compromise between uniform information transfer and complexity of data acquisition.",

X-ray crystal structure snapshots of the backbone pilin LrpA were captured in two atypical bent conformations leading to a zigzag morphology in the LrpCBA pilus structure. Small-angle X-ray scattering and structural analysis revealed that LrpA also adopts the typical linear conformation, resulting in an elongated pilus morphology. Various conformational analyses and biophysical experiments helped to demonstrate that a hinge region located at the end of the flexible N-terminal domain of LrpA facilitates a new closure-and-twist motion for assembling dynamic pili during the assembly process and host attachment. Further, the incongruent combination of flexible domain-driven conformational dynamics and rigid isopeptide bond-driven stability observed in the LrpCBA pilus might also extend to the sortase-dependent pili of other bacteria colonizing a host.",

    "abstract": "The formation of a vitrified thin film embedded with randomly oriented macromolecules is an essential prerequisite for cryogenic sample electron microscopy. Most commonly, this is achieved using the plunge-freeze method first described nearly 40 years ago. Although this is a robust method, the behaviour of different macromolecules shows great variation upon freezing and often needs to be optimized to obtain an isotropic, high-resolution reconstruction. For a macromolecule in such a film, the probability of encountering the air–water interface in the time between blotting and freezing and adopting preferred orientations is very high. 3D reconstruction using preferentially oriented particles often leads to anisotropic and uninterpretable maps. Currently, there are no general solutions to this prevalent issue, but several approaches largely focusing on sample preparation with the use of additives and novel grid modifications have been attempted. In this study, the effect of physical and chemical factors on the orientations of macromolecules was investigated through an analysis of selected well studied macromolecules, and important parameters that determine the behaviour of proteins on cryo-EM grids were revealed. These insights highlight the nature of the interactions that cause preferred orientations and can be utilized to systematically address orientation bias for any given macromolecule and to provide a framework to design small-molecule additives to enhance sample stability and behaviour.",

The workflow from crystallization and crystal treatment to deposition and publication is well defined, and therefore an electronic laboratory information management system (LIMS) is well suited to management of the data. Completion of the project requires key information on all the steps being available and this information should also be made available according to the FAIR principles. As crystallized samples are typically shipped between facilities, a key feature to be captured in the LIMS is the exchange of metadata between the crystallization facility of the home laboratory and, for example, synchrotron facilities. On completion, structures are deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the LIMS can include the PDB code in its database, completing the chain of custody from crystallization to structure deposition and publication.

Biodegradation is an ideal solution for remediating bioplastic waste as it does not require the high temperatures necessary for thermal degradation and does not introduce additional pollutants into the environment. Numerous organisms can scavenge for bioplastics, such as polylactic acid (PLA) or poly-( R )-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), which they can use as an energy source. Recently, a promiscuous PHBase from the thermophilic soil bacterium Lihuaxuella thermophila ( Lt PHBase) was identified. Lt PHBase can accommodate many substrates, including PHB granules and films and PHB block copolymers, as well as the unrelated polymers polylactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL). Lt PHBase uses the expected Ser–His–Asp catalytic triad for hydrolysis at an optimal enzyme activity near 70°C. Here, the 1.75 Å resolution crystal structure of apo Lt PHBase is presented and its chemical stability is profiled. Knowledge of its substrate preferences was extended to different-sized PHB granules. It is shown that Lt PHBase is highly resistant to unfolding, with barriers typical for thermophilic enzymes, and shows a preference for low-molecular-mass PHB granules. These insights have implications for the long-term potential of Lt PHBase as an industrial PHB hydrolase and shed light on the evolutionary role that this enzyme plays in bacterial metabolism.",

However, accurate modelling of their coordination environments remains a challenge due to the complexity and diversity of metal-coordination geometries. To address this, a method is presented for extracting and analysing coordination information, including bond lengths and angles, from the Crystallography Open Database. By using these data, comprehensive descriptions of metal-containing components are generated. A stereochemical information generator for a particular component within a specific macromolecule leverages an example PDB/mmCIF file containing the component to account for the actual surrounding environment. A matching process has been developed and implemented to align the derived metal structures with idealized coordinates from a coordination geometry library. Additionally, various strategies, depending on the quality of the matches, were employed to compile distance and angle statistics for the refinement of macromolecular structures. The developed methods were implemented in a new program, MetalCoord , that classifies and utilizes the metal-coordination geometry. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms was tested using metal-containing components from the PDB. As a result, metal-containing components from the CCP 4 monomer library have been updated. The updated monomer dictionaries, in concert with the derived restraints, can be used in most structural biology computations, including macromolecular crystallography, single-particle cryo-EM and even molecular mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Polyamines are important regulators in all living organisms and are implicated in essential biological processes including cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses an spuABCDEFGHI gene cluster that is involved in the metabolism and uptake of two polyamines: spermidine and putrescine. In the proposed γ-glutamylation–putrescine metabolism pathway, SpuA hydrolyzes γ-glutamyl-γ-aminobutyrate (γ-Glu-GABA) to glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In this study, crystal structures of P. aeruginosa SpuA are reported, confirming it to be a member of the class I glutamine amidotransferase (GAT) family. Activity and substrate-binding assays confirm that SpuA exhibits a preference for γ-Glu-GABA as a substrate. Structures of an inactive H221N mutant were determined with bound glutamate thioester intermediate or glutamate product, thus delineating the active site and substrate-binding pocket and elucidating the catalytic mechanism. The crystal structure of another bacterial member of the class I GAT family from Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (MsGATase) in complex with glutamine was determined for comparison and reveals a binding site for glutamine. Activity assays confirm that MsGATase has activity for glutamine as a substrate but not for γ-Glu-GABA. The work reported here provides a starting point for further investigation of polyamine metabolism in P. aeruginosa .",

    "abstract": "The initiation of infection of host tissues by Staphylococcus aureus requires a family of staphylococcal adhesive proteins containing serine–aspartate repeat (SDR) domains, such as ClfA. The O-linked glycosylation of the long-chain SDR domain mediated by SdgB and SdgA is a key virulence factor that protects the adhesive SDR proteins against host proteolytic attack in order to promote successful tissue colonization, and has also been implicated in staphylococcal agglutination, which leads to sepsis and an immunodominant epitope for a strong antibody response. Despite the biological significance of these two glycosyltransferases involved in pathogenicity and avoidance of the host innate immune response, their structures and the molecular basis of their activity have not been investigated. This study reports the crystal structures of SdgB and SdgA from S. aureus as well as multiple structures of SdgB in complex with its substrates (for example UDP, N -acetylglucosamine or SDR peptides), products (glycosylated SDR peptides) or phosphate ions. Together with biophysical and biochemical analyses, this structural work uncovered the novel mechanism by which SdgB and SdgA carry out the glycosyl-transfer process to the long SDR region in SDR proteins. SdgB undergoes dynamic changes in its structure such as a transition from an open to a closed conformation upon ligand binding and takes diverse forms, both as a homodimer and as a heterodimer with SdgA. Overall, these findings not only elucidate the putative role of the three domains of SdgB in recognizing donor and acceptor substrates, but also provide new mechanistic insights into glycosylation of the SDR domain, which can serve as a starting point for the development of antibacterial drugs against staphylococcal infections.",

    "abstract": "The predictive power of simulation has become embedded in the infrastructure of modern economies. Computer-aided design is ubiquitous throughout industry. In aeronautical engineering, built infrastructure and materials manufacturing, simulations are routinely used to compute the performance of potential designs before construction. The ability to predict the behaviour of products is a driver of innovation by reducing the cost barrier to new designs, but also because radically novel ideas can be piloted with relatively little risk. Accurate weather forecasting is essential to guide domestic and military flight paths, and therefore the underpinning simulations are critical enough to have implications for national security. However, in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries, the application of computer simulations remains limited by the capabilities of the technology with respect to the complexity of molecular biology and human physiology. Over the last 30 years, molecular-modelling tools have gradually gained a degree of acceptance in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug discovery has begun to benefit from physics-based simulations. While such simulations have great potential for improved molecular design, much scepticism remains about their value. The motivations for such reservations in industry and areas where simulations show promise for efficiency gains in preclinical research are discussed. In this, the first of two complementary papers, the scientific and technical progress that needs to be made to improve the predictive power of biomolecular simulations, and how this might be achieved, is firstly discussed (Part 1). In Part 2, the status of computer simulations in pharma is contrasted with aerodynamics modelling and weather forecasting, and comments are made on the cultural changes needed for equivalent computational technologies to become integrated into life-science industries.",

    "abstract": "Akkermansia muciniphila , an anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium, is a major intestinal commensal bacterium that can modulate the host immune response. It colonizes the mucosal layer and produces nutrients for the gut mucosa and other commensal bacteria. It is believed that mucin desulfation is the rate-limiting step in the mucin-degradation process, and bacterial sulfatases that carry out mucin desulfation have been well studied. However, little is known about the structural characteristics of A. muciniphila sulfatases. Here, the crystal structure of the premature form of the A. muciniphila sulfatase AmAS was determined. Structural analysis combined with docking experiments defined the critical active-site residues that are responsible for catalysis. The loop regions I–V were proposed to be essential for substrate binding. Structure-based sequence alignment and structural superposition allow further elucidation of how different subclasses of formylglycine-dependent sulfatases (FGly sulfatases) adopt the same catalytic mechanism but exhibit diverse substrate specificities. These results advance the understanding of the substrate-recognition mechanisms of A. muciniphila FGly-type sulfatases. Structural variations around the active sites account for the different substrate-binding properties. These results will enhance the understanding of the roles of bacterial sulfatases in the metabolism of glycans and host–microbe interactions in the human gut environment.",

    "abstract": "The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an essential multi-protein complex in eukaryotes. CSN is a master regulator of intracellular protein degradation, controlling the vast family of cullin–RING ubiquitin (E3) ligases (CRLs). Important in many cellular processes, CSN has prominent roles in DNA repair, cell-cycle control and differentiation. The recent crystal structure of human CSN provides insight into its exquisite regulation and functionality [Lingaraju et al. (2014), Nature (London) , 512 , 161–165]. Structure determination was complicated by low-resolution diffraction from crystals affected by twinning and rotational pseudo-symmetry. Crystal instability and non-isomorphism strongly influenced by flash-cooling, radiation damage and difficulty in obtaining heavy-atom derivatives, were overcome. Many different subunits of the same fold class were distinguished at low resolution aided by combinatorial selenomethionine labelling. As an example of how challenging projects can be approached, the structure determination of CSN is described as it unfolded using cluster-compound MIRAS phasing, MR-SAD with electron-density models and cross-crystal averaging exploiting non-isomorphism among unit-cell variants of the same crystal form.",

This may include severe anisotropy, poor spot shape, poor to moderate-resolution diffraction, crystal twinning, translational pseudo-symmetry and poor uptake of heavy atoms for derivatization. Such challenges must be circumvented by adaptations in the approach to crystallization and/or phasing. Here, an example of a protein that exhibited all of the above-mentioned complications is presented. Bestrophin-1 is a eukaryotic calcium-activated chloride channel, the structure of which was recently determined in complex with monoclonal antibody fragments using SAD phasing with tantalum bromide clusters (Ta6Br12·Br2). Some of the obstacles to obtaining improved diffraction and phasing for this particular channel are discussed, as well as the approach and adaptations that were key to determining the structure.",

    "abstract": "To obtain an electron-density map from a macromolecular crystal the phase-problem needs to be solved, which often involves the use of heavy-atom derivative crystals and concomitantly the determination of the heavy atom substructure. This is customarily done by direct methods or Patterson-based approaches, which however may fail when only poorly diffracting derivative crystals are available, as often the case for e.g. membrane proteins. Here we present an approach for heavy atom site identification based on a Molecular Replacement Parameter Matrix (MRPM) search. It involves an n-dimensional search to test a wide spectrum of molecular replacement parameters, such as clusters of different conformations. The result is scored by the ability to identify heavy-atom positions, from anomalous difference Fourier maps, that allow meaningful phases to be determined. The strategy was successfully applied in the determination of a membrane protein structure, the CopA Cu+-ATPase, when other methods had failed to resolve the heavy atom substructure. MRPM is particularly suited for proteins undergoing large conformational changes where multiple search models should be generated, and it enables the identification of weak but correct molecular replacement solutions with maximum contrast to prime experimental phasing efforts.",

Since the oligonucleotide contained the enantiomeric 2′-deoxy-L-ribose, the Z-DNA duplex is right-handed, as confirmed by the ultrahigh-resolution crystal structure determined at 0.69 Å resolution. Although the X-ray diffraction data were collected at a very short wavelength (0.7085 Å), where the anomalous signal of the P and K atoms is very weak, the signal was sufficiently outstanding to clearly indicate the wrong hand when the structure was mistakenly solved assuming the presence of 2′-deoxy-D-ribose. The electron density clearly shows the entire cadaverinium dication, which has an occupancy of 0.53 and interacts with one Z-DNA duplex. The K + cation, with an occupancy of 0.32, has an irregular coordination sphere that is formed by three OP atoms of two symmetry-related Z-DNA duplexes and one O5′ hydroxyl O atom, and is completed by three water sites, one of which is twofold disordered. The K + site is complemented by a partial water molecule, the hydrogen bonds of which have the same lengths as the K—O bonds. The sugar-phosphate backbone assumes two conformations, but the base pairs do not show any sign of disorder.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, iterative projection algorithms, an effective approach to recovering phases from a single intensity measurement, have found application in protein crystallography to directly surmount the `phase problem'. However, previous studies have always assumed that some prior knowledge constraints ( i.e. a low-resolution envelope about the protein structure in the crystal cell or histogram matching requiring a similar density distribution to the target crystal) must be known for successful phase retrieval, thus hindering its widespread application. In this study, a novel phase-retrieval workflow is proposed that eliminates the need for a reference density distribution by utilizing low-resolution diffraction data in phasing algorithms. The approach involves randomly assigning one out of 12 possible phases at 30° intervals (or two for centric reflections) to produce an initial envelope, which is then refined through density modification after each run of phase retrieval. To evaluate the success of the phase-retrieval procedure, information entropy is introduced as a new metric. This approach was validated using ten protein structures with high solvent content, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Muramidases (also known as lysozymes) hydrolyse the peptidoglycan component of the bacterial cell wall and are found in many glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. Similar to other glycoside hydrolases, muramidases sometimes have noncatalytic domains that facilitate their interaction with the substrate. Here, the identification, characterization and X-ray structure of a novel fungal GH24 muramidase from Trichophaea saccata is first described, in which an SH3-like cell-wall-binding domain (CWBD) was identified by structure comparison in addition to its catalytic domain. Further, a complex between a triglycine peptide and the CWBD from T. saccata is presented that shows a possible anchor point of the peptidoglycan on the CWBD. A `domain-walking' approach, searching for other sequences with a domain of unknown function appended to the CWBD, was then used to identify a group of fungal muramidases that also contain homologous SH3-like cell-wall-binding modules, the catalytic domains of which define a new GH family. The properties of some representative members of this family are described as well as X-ray structures of the independent catalytic and SH3-like domains of the Kionochaeta sp., Thermothielavioides terrestris and Penicillium virgatum enzymes. This work confirms the power of the module-walking approach, extends the library of known GH families and adds a new noncatalytic module to the muramidase arsenal.",

Preliminary biochemical and biophysical assays and antifungal susceptibility testing with a variety of classical antifolates were also performed, highlighting the enzyme-inhibition rates and the inhibition of yeast growth.

    "abstract": "4-Amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase (ADCS), a chorismate-utilizing enzyme, is composed of two subunits: PabA and PabB. PabA is a glutamine amidotransferase that hydrolyzes glutamine into glutamate and ammonia. PabB is an aminodeoxychorismate synthase that converts chorismate to 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate (ADC) using the ammonia produced by PabA. ADCS functions under allosteric regulation between PabA and PabB. However, the allosteric mechanism remains unresolved because the structure of the PabA–PabB complex has not been determined. Here, the crystal structure and characterization of PapA from Streptomyces venezuelae (SvPapA), a bifunctional enzyme comprising the PabA and PabB domains, is reported. SvPapA forms a unique dimer in which PabA and PabB domains from different monomers complement each other and form an active structure. The chorismate-bound structure revealed that recognition of the C1 carboxyl group by Thr501 and Gly502 of the 498-PIKTG-502 motif in the PabB domain is essential for the catalytic Lys500 to reach the C2 atom, a reaction-initiation site. SvPapA demonstrated ADCS activity in the presence of Mg 2+ when glutamate or NH + 4 was used as the amino donor. The crystal structure indicated that the Mg 2+ -binding position changed depending on the binding of chorismate. In addition, significant structural changes were observed in the PabA domain depending on the presence or absence of chorismate. This study provides insights into the structural factors that are involved in the allosteric regulation of ADCS.",

As part of an effort to understand the structural and functional relationships between ZMPSTE24 and soluble zinc metalloproteases, the inhibition of ZMPSTE24 by phosphoramidon [ N -(α-rhamnopyranosyl-oxyhydroxyphosphinyl)-Leu-Trp], a transition-state analog and competitive inhibitor of multiple soluble zinc metalloproteases, especially gluzincins, has been characterized functionally and structurally. The functional results, the determination of preliminary IC 50 values by the use of an intramolecular quenched-fluorescence fluorogenic peptide assay, indicate that phosphoramidon inhibits ZMPSTE24 in a manner consistent with competitive inhibition. The structural results, a 3.85 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of a ZMPSTE24–phosphoramidon complex, indicate that the overall binding mode observed between phosphoramidon and soluble gluzincins is conserved. Based on the structural data, a significantly lower potency than that observed for soluble gluzincins such as thermolysin and neprilysin is predicted. These results strongly suggest a close relationship between soluble gluzincins and the integral membrane protein zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24.",

    "abstract": "Detergent micelles can solubilize membrane proteins, but there is always a need for a pool of free detergent at the critical micellar concentration to maintain the micelle–monomer equilibrium. Amphipol polymeric surfactants (APols) have been developed to replace conventional detergents in membrane-protein studies, but the role of free amphipol is unclear. It has previously been shown that the removal of free APol causes monodisperse outer membrane protein F (OmpF) to form long filaments. However, any remaining APol could not be resolved using electron microscopy. Here, small-angle neutron scattering with isotope contrast matching was used to separately determine the distributions of membrane protein and amphipol in a mixed sample. The data showed that after existing free amphipol had been removed from monodisperse complexes, a new equilibrium was established between protein–amphipol filaments and a pool of newly liberated free amphipol. The filaments consisted of OmpF proteins surrounded by a belt of Apol, whilst free oblate spheroid micelles of Apol were also present. No indications of long-range order were observed, suggesting a lack of defined structure in the filaments.",

    "abstract": "The haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily is one of the largest known groups of enzymes and the majority of its members catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphoric acid monoesters into a phosphate ion and an alcohol. Despite the fact that sequence similarity between HAD phosphatases is generally very low, the members of the family possess some characteristic features, such as a Rossmann-like fold, HAD signature motifs or the requirement for Mg 2+ ion as an obligatory cofactor. This study focuses on a new hypothetical HAD phosphatase from Thermococcus thioreducens . The protein crystallized in space group P 2 1 2 1 2, with unit-cell parameters a = 66.3, b = 117.0, c = 33.8 Å, and the crystals contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The protein structure was determined by X-ray crystallography and was refined to 1.75 Å resolution. The structure revealed a putative active site common to all HAD members. Computational docking into the crystal structure was used to propose substrates of the enzyme. The activity of this thermophilic enzyme towards several of the selected substrates was confirmed at temperatures of 37°C as well as 60°C.",

    "abstract": "Theoretically, crystals with supercells exist at a unique crossroads where they can be considered as either a large unit cell with closely spaced reflections in reciprocal space or a higher dimensional superspace with a modulation that is commensurate with the supercell. In the latter case, the structure would be defined as an average structure with functions representing a modulation to determine the atomic location in 3D space. Here, a model protein structure and simulated diffraction data were used to investigate the possibility of solving a real incommensurately modulated protein crystal using a supercell approximation. In this way, the answer was known and the refinement method could be tested. Firstly, an average structure was solved by using the `main' reflections, which represent the subset of the reflections that belong to the subcell and in general are more intense than the `satellite' reflections. The average structure was then expanded to create a supercell and refined using all of the reflections. Surprisingly, the refined solution did not match the expected solution, even though the statistics were excellent. Interestingly, the corresponding superspace group had multiple 3D daughter supercell space groups as possibilities, and it was one of the alternate daughter space groups that the refinement locked in on. The lessons learned here will be applied to a real incommensurately modulated profilin–actin crystal that has the same superspace group.",

    "abstract": "When protein crystals are abruptly cooled, the unit-cell, protein and solvent-cavity volumes all contract, but the volume of bulk-like internal solvent may expand. Outflow of this solvent from the unit cell and its accumulation in defective interior crystal regions has been suggested as one cause of the large increase in crystal mosaicity on cooling. It is shown that when apoferritin crystals are abruptly cooled to temperatures between 220 and 260 K, the unit cell contracts, solvent is pushed out and the mosaicity grows. On temperature-dependent timescales of 10 to 200 s, the unit-cell and solvent-cavity volume then expand, solvent flows back in, and the mosaicity and B factor both drop. Expansion and reordering at fixed low temperature are associated with small-amplitude but large-scale changes in the conformation and packing of apoferritin. These results demonstrate that increases in mosaicity on cooling arise due to solvent flows out of or into the unit cell and to incomplete, arrested relaxation of protein conformation. They indicate a critical role for time in variable-temperature crystallographic studies, and the feasibility of probing interactions and cooperative conformational changes that underlie cold denaturation in the presence of liquid solvent at temperatures down to ∼200 K.",

    "abstract": "Afamin, which is a human blood plasma glycoprotein, a putative multifunctional transporter of hydrophobic molecules and a marker for metabolic syndrome, poses multiple challenges for crystallographic structure determination, both practically and in analysis of the models. Several hundred crystals were analysed, and an unusual variability in cell volume and difficulty in solving the structure despite an ∼34% sequence identity with nonglycosylated human serum albumin indicated that the molecule exhibits variable and context-sensitive packing, despite the simplified glycosylation in insect cell-expressed recombinant afamin. Controlled dehydration of the crystals was able to stabilize the orthorhombic crystal form, reducing the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit from the monoclinic form and changing the conformational state of the protein. An iterative strategy using fully automatic experiments available on MASSIF-1 was used to quickly determine the optimal protocol to achieve the phase transition, which should be readily applicable to many types of sample. The study also highlights the drawback of using a single crystallographic structure model for computational modelling purposes given that the conformational state of the binding sites and the electron density in the binding site, which is likely to result from PEGs, greatly varies between models. This also holds for the analysis of nonspecific low-affinity ligands, where often a variety of fragments with similar uncertainty can be modelled, inviting interpretative bias. As a promiscuous transporter, afamin also seems to bind gadoteridol, a magnetic resonance imaging contrast compound, in at least two sites. One pair of gadoteridol molecules is located near the human albumin Sudlow site, and a second gadoteridol molecule is located at an intermolecular site in proximity to domain IA. The data from the co-crystals support modern metrics of data quality in the context of the information that can be gleaned from data sets that would be abandoned on classical measures.",

Molecular-replacement pipelines within CCP4i2 are presented to illustrate the more commonly used processes. Previous knowledge of the biology and structure of TFP pilins, particularly the presence of a long, N-terminal α-helix required for pilus formation, allowed informed decisions to be made during the structure-determination strategy. The PilA1 structure was finally successfully determined using ARCIMBOLDO and the ab initio MR strategy used is described.",

However, DcsB hydrolyzes N ω -hydroxy-L-arginine, but not L-arginine, to supply hydroxyurea for the biosynthesis of D-CS. Here, the crystal structure of DcsB was determined at a resolution of 1.5 Å using anomalous scattering from the manganese ions. In the crystal structure, DscB generates an artificial dimer created by the open and closed forms. Gel-filtration analysis demonstrated that DcsB is a monomeric protein, unlike arginase, which forms a trimeric structure. The active center containing the binuclear manganese cluster differs between DcsB and arginase. In DcsB, one of the ligands of the Mn A ion is a cysteine, while the corresponding residue in arginase is a histidine. In addition, DcsB has no counterpart to the histidine residue that acts as a general acid/base during the catalytic reaction of arginase. The present study demonstrates that DcsB has a unique active site that differs from that of arginase.",

    "abstract": "The genus Xanthomonas comprises several cosmopolitan plant-pathogenic bacteria that affect more than 400 plant species, most of which are of economic interest. Citrus canker is a bacterial disease that affects citrus species, reducing fruit yield and quality, and is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xac). The Xac3819 gene, which has previously been reported to be important for citrus canker infection, encodes an uncharacterized glutathione S -transferase (GST) of 207 amino-acid residues in length (XacGST). Bacterial GSTs are implicated in a variety of metabolic processes such as protection against chemical and oxidative stresses. XacGST shares high sequence identity (45%) with the GstB dehalogenase from Escherichia coli O6:H1 strain CFT073 (EcGstB). Here, XacGST is reported to be able to conjugate glutathione (GSH) with bromoacetate with a K m of 6.67 ± 0.77 m M , a k cat of 42.69 ± 0.32 s −1 and a k cat / K m of 6.40 ± 0.72 m M −1 s −1 under a saturated GSH concentration (3.6 m M ). These values are comparable to those previously reported for EcGstB. In addition, crystal structures of XacGST were determined in the apo form (PDB entry 6nxv) and in a GSH-bound complex (PDB entry 6nv6). XacGST has a canonical GST-like fold with a conserved serine residue (Ser12) at the GSH-binding site near the N-terminus, indicating XacGST to be a serine-type GST that probably belongs to the theta-class GSTs. GSH binding stabilizes a loop of about 20 residues containing a helix that is disordered in the apo XacGST structure.",

    "abstract": "CXCL13 is the cognate chemokine agonist of CXCR5, a class A G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is essential for proper humoral immune responses. Using a `methionine scanning' mutagenesis method on the N-terminus of CXCL13, which is the chemokine signaling region, it was shown that minor length alterations and side-chain substitutions still result in CXCR5 activation. This observation indicates that the orthosteric pocket of CXCR5 can tolerate these changes without severely affecting the activity. The introduction of bulk on the ligand was well tolerated by the receptor, whereas a loss of contacts was less tolerated. Furthermore, two crystal structures of CXCL13 mutants were solved, both of which represent the first uncomplexed structures of the human protein. These structures were stabilized by unique interactions formed by the N-termini of the ligands, indicating that CXCL13 exhibits substantial N-terminal flexibility while the chemokine core domain remains largely unchanged. Additionally, it was observed that CXCL13 harbors a large degree of flexibility in the C-terminal extension of the ligand. Comparisons with other published structures of human and murine CXCL13 validate the relative rigidity of the core domain as well as the N- and C-terminal mobilities. Collectively, these mutants and their structures provide the field with additional insights into how CXCL13 interacts with CXCR5.",

The enzymes that facilitate these reactions assist in the survival of the bacterium across a range of environmental niches, and they may also be suitable for use in industrial processes. SmoS is a dehydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidation of the commonly occurring sugar alcohols sorbitol and galactitol to fructose and tagatose, respectively, using NAD + as a cofactor. The main objective of this study was to evaluate SmoS using biochemical techniques. The nucleotide sequence was codon-optimized for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Gold cells and the protein was subsequently overexpressed and purified. Size-exclusion chromatography and X-ray diffraction experiments suggest that SmoS is a tetramer. SmoS was crystallized, and crystals obtained in the absence of substrate diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution and those of a complex with sorbitol diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution. SmoS was characterized kinetically and shown to have a preference for sorbitol despite having a higher affinity for galactitol. Computational ligand-docking experiments suggest that tagatose binds the protein in a more energetically favourable complex than fructose, which is retained in the active site over a longer time frame following oxidation and reduces the rate of the reaction. These results supplement the inventory of biomolecules with potential for industrial applications and enhance the understanding of metabolism in the model organism S. meliloti .",

The solvent channels of some protein crystals are large enough to allow the incorporation of macromolecules, but soaking of protein guests into protein crystals has not been reported. Such protein host crystals (here given the name hostals) incorporating guest proteins may be useful for a wide range of applications in biotechnology, for example as cargo systems or for diffraction studies analogous to the crystal sponge method. The present study takes advantage of crystals of the Escherichia coli tryptophan repressor protein (ds-TrpR) that are extensively domain-swapped and suitable for incorporating guest proteins by diffusion, as they are robust and have large solvent channels. Confocal fluorescence microscopy is used to follow the migration of cytochrome c and fluorophore-labeled calmodulin into the solvent channels of ds-TrpR crystals. The guest proteins become uniformly distributed in the crystal within weeks and enriched within the solvent channels. X-ray diffraction studies on host crystals with high concentrations of incorporated guests demonstrate that diffraction limits of ∼2.5 Å can still be achieved. Weak electron density is observed in the solvent channels, but the guest-protein structures could not be determined by conventional crystallographic methods. Additional approaches that increase the ordering of guests in the host crystal are discussed that may support protein structure determination using the hostal system in the future. This host system may also be useful for biotechnological applications where crystallographic order of the guest is not required.",

    "abstract": "The canonical O-mannosylation pathway in humans is essential for the functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. Disruption of this post-translational modification pathway leads to congenital muscular dystrophies. The first committed step in the construction of a functional matriglycan structure involves the post-translational modification of α-dystroglycan. This is essential for binding extracellular matrix proteins and arenaviruses, and is catalyzed by β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (POMGNT2). While another glycosyl transferase, β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGNT1), has been shown to be promiscuous in extending O-mannosylated sites, POMGNT2 has been shown to display significant primary amino-acid selectivity near the site of O-mannosylation. Moreover, several single point mutations in POMGNT2 have been identified in patients with assorted dystroglycanopathies such as Walker-Warburg syndrome and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. To gain insight into POMGNT2 function in humans, the enzyme was expressed as a soluble, secreted fusion protein by transient infection of HEK293 suspension cultures. Here, crystal structures of POMGNT2 (amino-acid residues 25-580) with and without UDP bound are reported. Consistent with a novel fold and a unique domain organization, no molecular-replacement model was available and phases were obtained through crystallization of a selenomethionine variant of the enzyme in the same space group.

After the conversion of UDP- N -acetylglucosamine (UNAG) to UDP- N -acetylmuramic acid (UNAM) by the MurA and MurB enzymes, an amino acid is added to UNAM by UDP- N -acetylmuramic acid L-alanine ligase (MurC). As peptidoglycan is an essential component of the bacterial cell wall, the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis represent promising targets for the development of novel antibacterial drugs. Here, the crystal structure of Mycobacterium bovis MurC ( Mb MurC) is reported, which exhibits a three-domain architecture for the binding of UNAM, ATP and an amino acid as substrates, with a nickel ion at the domain interface. The ATP-binding loop adopts a conformation that is not seen in other MurCs. In the UNAG-bound structure of Mb MurC, the substrate mimic interacts with the UDP-binding domain of Mb MurC, which does not invoke rearrangement of the three domains. Interestingly, the glycine-rich loop of the UDP-binding domain of Mb MurC interacts through hydrogen bonds with the glucose moiety of the ligand, but not with the pyrophosphate moiety. These findings suggest that UNAG analogs might serve as potential candidates for neutralizing the catalytic activity of bacterial MurC.",

    "abstract": "It is important to reveal the exact cause of poor diffractivity in protein crystals in order to determine the accurate structure of protein molecules. It is shown that there is a large amount of local strain in subgrains of glucose isomerase crystals even though the overall crystal quality is rather high, as shown by clear equal-thickness fringes in X-ray topography. Thus, a large stress is exerted on the subgrains of protein crystals, which could significantly lower the resistance of the crystals to radiation damage. It is also demonstrated that this local strain can be reduced through the introduction of dislocations in the crystal. This suggests that the introduction of dislocations in protein crystals can be effective in enhancing the crystal quality of subgrains of protein crystals. By exploiting this effect, the radiation damage in subgrains could be decreased, leading to the collection of X-ray diffraction data sets with high diffractivity.",

This study describes the structural basis for the action of the GH20 β- N -acetylglucosaminidase ( Vh GlcNAcase) in chitin metabolism by Vibrio campbellii (formerly V. harveyi ) strain ATCC BAA-1116. Crystal structures of wild-type Vh GlcNAcase in the absence and presence of the sugar ligand, and of the unliganded D437A mutant, were determined. Vh GlcNAcase contains three distinct domains: an N-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain linked to a small α+β domain and a C-terminal (β/α) 8 catalytic domain. The active site of Vh GlcNAcase has a narrow, shallow pocket that is suitable for accommodating a small chitooligosaccharide. Vh GlcNAcase is a monomeric enzyme of 74 kDa, but its crystal structures show two molecules of enzyme per asymmetric unit, in which Gln16 at the dimeric interface of the first molecule partially blocks the entrance to the active site of the neighboring molecule. The GlcNAc unit observed in subsite −1 makes exclusive hydrogen bonds to the conserved residues Arg274, Tyr530, Asp532 and Glu584, while Trp487, Trp546, Trp582 and Trp505 form a hydrophobic wall around the −1 GlcNAc. The catalytic mutants D437A/N and E438A/Q exhibited a drastic loss of GlcNAcase activity, confirming the catalytic role of the acidic pair (Asp437–Glu438).",

    "abstract": "Src kinase belongs to the family of Src-related nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Because of its physiological role in cell growth and proliferation, its activity is strictly controlled by several mechanisms. Nevertheless, in viral Src kinase (v-Src) some of these mechanisms fail, and its uncontrolled activity is responsible for the occurrence of cancer. Here, the crystal structures of three SH3-domain mutants of v-Src were determined to unveil the effects of these oncogenic mutations in this regulatory domain. Mutations in the n-Src and distal loops have a low impact on the overall structure of the domain and its capacity to form intertwined dimers. However, mutations in the RT loop compromise the stability of the domain and make the protein very prone to aggregation. Additionally, these mutations prevent the formation of intertwined dimers. The results show a synergistic effect between mutations in the RT loop and those in the n-Src and distal loops. Analysis of the structures of the v-Src SH3-domain mutants and the closed inactive conformation of cellular Src kinase (c-Src) point to a loss of the interactions that are required to establish the compact inactive form of the kinase. Nevertheless, an analysis of structures of the c-Src SH3 domain complexed with class I and II peptides points to minor changes in the interactions between the v-Src SH3 domain and these peptides. In this way, the structures reported here indicate that mutations in the RT loop might impair the kinase regulation mechanism without affecting the recognition of short proline-rich motifs in the target proteins of the kinase, thus explaining the oncogenic behaviour of the protein.",

    "abstract": "Anthrax infection is associated with severe illness and high mortality. Protective antigen (PA) is the central component of the anthrax toxin, which is one of two major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis , the causative agent of anthrax disease. Upon endocytosis, PA opens a pore in the membranes of endosomes, through which the cytotoxic enzymes of the toxin are extruded. The PA pore is formed by a cooperative conformational change in which the membrane-penetrating loops of PA associate, forming a hydrophobic rim that pierces the membrane. Due to its crucial role in anthrax progression, PA is an important target for monoclonal antibody-based therapy. cAb29 is a highly effective neutralizing antibody against PA. Here, the cryo-EM structure of PA in complex with the Fab portion of cAb29 was determined. It was found that cAb29 neutralizes the toxin by clamping the membrane-penetrating loop of PA to the static surface-exposed loop of the D3 domain of the same subunit, thereby preventing pore formation. These results provide the structural basis for the antibody-based neutralization of PA and bring into focus the membrane-penetrating loop of PA as a target for the development of better anti-anthrax vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Protein crystallization has for decades been a critical and restrictive step in macromolecular structure determination via X-ray diffraction. Crystallization typically involves a multi-stage exploration of the available chemical space, beginning with an initial sampling (screening) followed by iterative refinement (optimization). Effective screening is important for reducing the number of optimization rounds required, reducing the cost and time required to determine a structure. Here, an initial screen (Shotgun II) derived from analysis of the up-to-date Protein Data Bank (PDB) is proposed and compared with the previously derived (2014) Shotgun I screen. In an update to that analysis, it is clarified that the Shotgun approach entails finding the crystallization conditions that cover the most diverse space of proteins by sequence found in the PDB, which can be mapped to the well known maximum coverage problem in computer science. With this realization, it was possible to apply a more effective algorithm for selecting conditions. In-house data demonstrate that compared with alternatives, the Shotgun I screen has been remarkably successful over the seven years that it has been in use, indicating that Shotgun II is also likely to be a highly effective screen.",

The GH26 β-mannanase KMAN from Klebsiella oxytoca KUB-CW2-3 shares 49–72% amino-acid sequence similarity with β-mannanases from other sources. The crystal structure of KMAN at a resolution of 2.57 Å revealed an open cleft-shaped active site. The enzyme structure is based on a (β/α) 8 -barrel architecture, which is a typical characteristic of clan A glycoside hydrolase enzymes. The putative catalytic residues Glu183 and Glu282 are located on the loop connected to β-strand 4 and at the end of β-strand 7, respectively. KMAN digests linear MOS with a degree of polymerization (DP) of between 4 and 6, with high catalytic efficiency ( k cat / K m ) towards DP6 (2571.26 min −1 m M −1 ). The predominant end products from the hydrolysis of locust bean gum, konjac glucomannan and linear MOS are mannobiose and mannotriose. It was observed that KMAN requires at least four binding sites for the binding of substrate molecules and hydrolysis. Molecular docking of mannotriose and galactosyl-mannotetraose to KMAN confirmed its mode of action, which prefers linear substrates to branched substrates.",

For crystals grown in lipidic cubic phase (LCP), an extruder is commonly used to pass a stream of microcrystals through the X-ray beam; however, the sample quantities required for this method may be difficult to produce for many membrane proteins. A more sample-efficient environment was created using two layers of low X-ray transmittance polymer films to mount crystals of the archaerhodopsin-3 (AR3) photoreceptor and room-temperature diffraction data were acquired. By using transparent and opaque polymer films, two structures, one corresponding to the desensitized, dark-adapted (DA) state and the other to the ground or light-adapted (LA) state, were solved to better than 1.9 Å resolution. All of the key structural features of AR3 were resolved, including the retinal chromophore, which is present as the 13- cis isomer in the DA state and as the all- trans isomer in the LA state. The film-sandwich sample environment enables diffraction data to be recorded at room temperature in both illuminated and dark conditions, which more closely approximate those in vivo . This simple approach is applicable to a wide range of membrane proteins crystallized in LCP and light-sensitive samples in general at synchrotron and laboratory X-ray sources.",

    "abstract": "Disulfide-bond-forming proteins (Dsbs) play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria. Disulfide-bond-forming protein A (DsbA) catalyzes the formation of the disulfide bonds necessary for the activity and stability of multiple substrate proteins, including many virulence factors. Hence, DsbA is an attractive target for the development of new drugs to combat bacterial infections. Here, two fragments, bromophenoxy propanamide (1) and 4-methoxy-N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide (2), were identified that bind to DsbA from the pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis. The crystal structures of oxidized B. pseudomallei DsbA (termed BpsDsbA) co-crystallized with 1 or 2 show that both fragments bind to a hydrophobic pocket that is formed by a change in the side-chain orientation of Tyr110. This conformational change opens a `cryptic' pocket that is not evident in the apoprotein structure. This binding location was supported by 2D-NMR studies, which identified a chemical shift perturbation of the Tyr110 backbone amide resonance of more than 0.05 p.p.m. upon the addition of 2 mM fragment 1 and of more than 0.04 p.p.m. upon the addition of 1 mM fragment 2. Although binding was detected by both X-ray crystallography and NMR, the binding affinity (Kd) for both fragments was low (above 2 mM), suggesting weak interactions with BpsDsbA. This conclusion is also supported by the crystal structure models, which ascribe partial occupancy to the ligands in the cryptic binding pocket. Small fragments such as 1 and 2 are not expected to have a high energetic binding affinity due to their relatively small surface area and the few functional groups that are available for intermolecular interactions. However, their simplicity makes them ideal for functionalization and optimization. The identification of the binding sites of 1 and 2 to BpsDsbA could provide a starting point for the development of more potent novel antimicrobial compounds that target DsbA and bacterial virulence.",

The peptidases of F. nucleatum can digest exogenous peptides into amino acids to satisfy its nutrient requirements. Here, a putative F. nucleatum peptidase, termed S9Cfn, which belongs to the S9C peptidase family was identified. Enzymatic activity assays combined with mass-spectrometric analysis revealed that S9Cfn is a carboxypeptidase, but not an aminopeptidase as previously annotated. The crystal structure of the S9Cfn tetramer was solved at 2.6 Å resolution and was found to contain a pair of oligomeric pores in the center. Structural analysis, together with site-directed mutagenesis and enzymatic activity assays, revealed a substrate-entrance tunnel that extends from each oligomeric pore to the catalytic triad, adjacent to which three conserved arginine residues are responsible for substrate binding. Moreover, comparison with other S9 peptidase structures indicated drastic conformational changes of the oligomeric pores during the catalytic cycle. Together, these findings increase the knowledge of this unique type of tetrameric carboxypeptidase and provide insight into the homeostatic control of microbiota in the human oral cavity.",

    "abstract": "MalE is a maltose/maltodextrin-binding protein (MBP) that plays a critical role in most bacterial maltose/maltodextrin-transport systems. Previously reported wild-type MBPs are monomers comprising an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD), and maltose-like molecules are recognized between the NTD and CTD and transported to the cell system. Because MBP does not undergo artificial dimerization, it is widely used as a tag for protein expression and purification. Here, the crystal structure of a domain-swapped dimeric MalE from Salmonella enterica (named SeMalE) in complex with maltopentaose is reported for the first time, and its structure is distinct from typical monomeric MalE family members. In the domain-swapped dimer, SeMalE comprises two subdomains: the NTD and CTD. The NTD and CTD of one molecule of SeMalE interact with the CTD and NTD of the partner molecule, respectively. The domain-swapped dimeric conformation was stabilized by interactions between the NTDs, CTDs and linkers from two SeMalE molecules. Additionally, a maltopentaose molecule was found to be located at the interface between the NTD and CTD of different SeMalE molecules. These results provide new insights that will improve the understanding of maltodextrin-binding MalE proteins.",

They are potential pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the catalytic and substrate-regulatory mechanisms of a novel bacterial POP from Microbulbifer arenaceous (MaPOP) were investigated. The crystal structure revealed that the catalytic triad of MaPOP was covered by the central tunnel of an unusual β-propeller domain. The tunnel not only provided the sole access to the active site for oligopeptides, but also protected large structured peptides or proteins from accidental proteolysis. The enzyme was able to cleave angiotensin I specifically at the carboxyl side of the internal proline residue, but could not hydrolyze long-chain bovine insulin B in vitro. Like the ligand-free structure, MaPOP bound to the transition-state analog inhibitor ZPR was also in a closed state, which was not modulated by the common `latching loop' found in other POPs. The substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism of MaPOP reported here may represent a common mechanism for all POPs. These results may facilitate a better understanding of the catalytic behavior of POPs under physiological conditions.",

Yeast Sfh2 is a PITP that transfers PI and squalene without phosphatidylcholine transfer activity. To investigate the structural determinants for ligand specificity and transport in Sfh2, crystal structures of Sfh2 in complex with PI and squalene were determined at 1.5 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively. The inositol head group of PI is recognized by highly conserved residues around the pocket entrance. The acyl chains of PI bind into a large hydrophobic cavity. Squalene is accommodated in the bottom of the cavity entirely by hydrophobic interactions. The binding of PI and squalene are mutually exclusive due to their overlapping binding sites, correlating with the role in lipid exchange. The binding mode of PI is well conserved in Sfh family proteins. However, squalene binding is unique to the Sfh2 homolog due to the specific hydrophobic residues forming a shape-complementary binding pocket. Recombinant apo Sfh2 forms a homodimer in vitro by the hydrophobic interaction of the gating α10-α11 helices in an open conformation. Ligand binding closes the lid and dissociates the dimer into monomers. This study reveals the structural determinants for the recognition of the conserved PI and a secondary ligand, squalene, and provides implications for the lipid-transfer function of Sfh2.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial nitroreductases (NRs) NfsB and NfsA are conserved homodimeric FMN-dependent flavoproteins that are responsible for the reduction of nitroaromatic substrates. Berberine (BBR) is a plant-derived isoquinoline alkaloid with a large conjugated ring system that is widely used in the treatment of various diseases. It was recently found that the gut microbiota convert BBR into dihydroberberine (dhBBR, the absorbable form) mediated by bacterial NRs. The molecular basis for the transformation of BBR by the gut microbiota remains unclear. Here, kinetic studies showed that NfsB from Escherichia coli (EcNfsB), rather than EcNfsA, is responsible for the conversion of BBR to dhBBR in spite of a low reaction rate. The crystal structure of the EcNfsB–BBR complex showed that BBR binds into the active pocket at the dimer interface, and its large conjugated plane stacks above the plane of the FMN cofactor in a nearly parallel orientation. BBR is mainly stabilized by π-stacking interactions with both neighboring aromatic residues and FMN. Structure-based mutagenesis studies further revealed that the highly conserved Phe70 and Phe199 are important residues for the conversion of BBR. The structure revealed that the C6 atom of BBR (which receives the hydride) is ∼7.5 Å from the N5 atom of FMN (which donates the hydride), which is too distant for hydride transfer. Notably, several well ordered water molecules make hydrogen-bond/van der Waals contacts with the N1 atom of BBR in the active site, which probably donate protons in conjunction with electron transfer from FMN. The structure–function studies revealed the mechanism for the recognition and binding of BBR by bacterial NRs and may help to understand the conversion of BBR by the gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) harbors diverse substrate specificities and modes of action, exhibiting notable molecular adaptations to cope with the stereochemical complexity imposed by glycosides and carbohydrates such as cellulose, xyloglucan, mixed-linkage β-glucan, laminarin, (hetero)xylan, (hetero)mannan, galactan, chitosan, N-glycan, rutin and hesperidin. GH5 has been divided into subfamilies, many with higher functional specificity, several of which have not been characterized to date and some that have yet to be discovered with the exploration of sequence/taxonomic diversity. In this work, the current GH5 subfamily inventory is expanded with the discovery of the GH5_57 subfamily by describing an endo-β-mannanase (CapGH5_57) from an uncultured Bacteroidales bacterium recovered from the capybara gut microbiota. Biochemical characterization showed that CapGH5_57 is active on glucomannan, releasing oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization from 2 to 6, indicating it to be an endo-β-mannanase. The crystal structure, which was solved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction, revealed a massively redesigned catalytic interface compared with GH5 mannanases. The typical aromatic platforms and the characteristic α-helix-containing β6–α6 loop in the positive-subsite region of GH5_7 mannanases are absent in CapGH5_57, generating a large and open catalytic interface that might favor the binding of branched substrates. Supporting this, CapGH5_57 contains a tryptophan residue adjacent and perpendicular to the cleavage site, indicative of an anchoring site for a substrate with a substitution at the −1 glycosyl moiety. Taken together, these results suggest that despite presenting endo activity on glucomannan, CapGH5_57 may have a new type of substituted heteromannan as its natural substrate. This work demonstrates the still great potential for discoveries regarding the mechanistic and functional diversity of this large and polyspecific GH family by unveiling a novel catalytic interface sculpted to recognize complex heteromannans, which led to the establishment of the GH5_57 subfamily.",

With the increased availability of cryo-electron microscopes, the preparation of high-quality samples has become a bottleneck in the cryo-EM structure-determination pipeline. Macromolecules can be damaged during the purification or preparation of vitrified samples for cryo-EM, making them prone to binding to the grid support, to aggregation or to the adoption of preferential orientations at the air–water interface. Here, it is shown that coating cryo-EM grids with a negatively charged polyelectrolyte, such as single-stranded DNA, before applying the sample reduces the aggregation of macromolecules and improves their distribution. The single-stranded DNA-coated grids enabled the determination of high-resolution structures from samples that aggregated on conventional grids. The polyelectrolyte coating reduces the diffusion of macromolecules and thus may limit the negative effects of the contact of macromolecules with the grid support and blotting paper, as well as of the shear forces on macromolecules during grid blotting. Coating grids with polyelectrolytes can readily be employed in any laboratory dealing with cryo-EM sample preparation, since it is fast, simple, inexpensive and does not require specialized equipment.",

    "abstract": "Oxygenic phototrophs perform carbon fixation through the Calvin–Benson cycle. Different mechanisms adjust the cycle and the light-harvesting reactions to rapid environmental changes. Photosynthetic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme in the cycle. In land plants, different photosynthetic GAPDHs exist: the most abundant isoform is formed by A 2 B 2 heterotetramers and the least abundant by A 4 homotetramers. Regardless of the subunit composition, GAPDH is the major consumer of photosynthetic NADPH and its activity is strictly regulated. While A 4 -GAPDH is regulated by CP12, AB-GAPDH is autonomously regulated through the C-terminal extension (CTE) of its B subunits. Reversible inhibition of AB-GAPDH occurs via the oxidation of a cysteine pair located in the CTE and the substitution of NADP(H) with NAD(H) in the cofactor-binding site. These combined conditions lead to a change in the oligomerization state and enzyme inhibition. SEC–SAXS and single-particle cryo-EM analysis were applied to reveal the structural basis of this regulatory mechanism. Both approaches revealed that spinach (A 2 B 2 ) n -GAPDH oligomers with n = 1, 2, 4 and 5 co-exist in a dynamic system. B subunits mediate the contacts between adjacent tetramers in A 4 B 4 and A 8 B 8 oligomers. The CTE of each B subunit penetrates into the active site of a B subunit of the adjacent tetramer, which in turn moves its CTE in the opposite direction, effectively preventing the binding of the substrate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate in the B subunits. The whole mechanism is made possible, and eventually controlled, by pyridine nucleotides. In fact, NAD(H), by removing NADP(H) from A subunits, allows the entrance of the CTE into the active site of the B subunit, hence stabilizing inhibited oligomers.",

This is the first structure of a DNA polymerase originating from a group of related thermophilic bacteriophages infecting Thermus thermophilus , including phages G20c, TSP4, P74-26, P23-45 and phiFA and the novel phage Tth15-6. Sequence and structural analysis of PolI_G20c revealed a 3′–5′ exonuclease domain and a DNA polymerase domain, and activity screening confirmed that both domains were functional. No functional 5′–3′ exonuclease domain was present. Structural analysis also revealed a novel specific structure motif, here termed SβαR, that was not previously identified in any polymerase belonging to the DNA polymerases I (or the DNA polymerase A family). The SβαR motif did not show any homology to the sequences or structures of known DNA polymerases. The exception was the sequence conservation of the residues in this motif in putative DNA polymerases encoded in the genomes of a group of thermophilic phages related to Thermus phage G20c. The structure of PolI_G20c was determined with the aid of another structure that was determined in parallel and was used as a model for molecular replacement. This other structure was of a 3′–5′ exonuclease termed ExnV1. The cloned and expressed gene encoding ExnV1 was isolated from a thermophilic virus metagenome that was collected from several hot springs in Iceland. The structure of ExnV1, which contains the novel SβαR motif, was first determined to 2.19 Å resolution. With these data at hand, the structure of PolI_G20c was determined to 2.97 Å resolution. The structures of PolI_G20c and ExnV1 are most similar to those of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (PDB entry 2kzz) from Escherichia coli , DNA polymerase I from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (PDB entry 1knc) and Taq polymerase (PDB entry 1bgx) from Thermus aquaticus .",

These studies, which were tailored to favor growth on targeted feedstocks, have already been shown to identify cellulases with considerable thermal tolerance. The amino-acid sequence of J30 shows comparably low identity to those of previously analyzed enzymes. As an enzyme that combines a well measurable activity with a relatively low optimal temperature (50°C) and a modest thermal tolerance, it offers the potential for structural optimization aimed at increased stability. Here, the crystal structure of wild-type J30 is presented along with that of a designed triple-mutant variant with improved characteristics for industrial applications. Through the introduction of a structural Zn 2+ site, the thermal tolerance was increased by more than 10°C and was paralleled by an increase in the catalytic optimum temperature by more than 5°C.",

Often, however, it is not obvious in advance whether a particular sample will scatter strongly enough to give useful data to draw conclusions under practically achievable solution conditions. Conformational changes that appear to be large may not always produce scattering curves that are distinguishable from each other at realistic concentrations and exposure times. Emerging technologies such as time-resolved SAXS (TR-SAXS) pose additional challenges owing to small beams and short sample path lengths. Beamline optics vary in brilliance and degree of background scatter, and major upgrades and improvements to sources promise to expand the reach of these methods. Computations are developed to estimate BioSAXS sample intensity at a more detailed level than previous approaches, taking into account flux, energy, sample thickness, window material, instrumental background, detector efficiency, solution conditions and other parameters. The results are validated with calibrated experiments using standard proteins on four different beamlines with various fluxes, energies and configurations. The ability of BioSAXS to statistically distinguish a variety of conformational movements under continuous-flow time-resolved conditions is then computed on a set of matched structure pairs drawn from the Database of Macromolecular Motions (http://molmovdb.org). The feasibility of experiments is ranked according to sample consumption, a quantity that varies by over two orders of magnitude for the set of structures. In addition to photon flux, the calculations suggest that window scattering and choice of wavelength are also important factors given the short sample path lengths common in such setups.",

Mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses three putative HtrAs: HtrA1 (Rv1223), HtrA2 (Rv0983) and HtrA3 (Rv0125). Each has a cytoplasmic region, a transmembrane helix and a periplasmic region. Here, the crystal structure of the periplasmic region consisting of a protease domain (PD) and a PDZ domain from an M. tuberculosis HtrA1 mutant ( m HtrA1 S387A ) is reported at 2.7 Å resolution. Although the m HtrA1 S387A PD shows structural features similar to those of other HtrAs, its loops, particularly L3 and LA, display different conformations. Loop L3 communicates between the PDs of the trimer and the PDZ domains and undergoes a transition from an active to an inactive conformation, as reported for an equivalent HtrA (DegS). Loop LA, which is responsible for higher oligomer formation owing to its length (50 amino acids) in DegP, is very short in m HtrA1 S387A (five amino acids), as in m HtrA2 (also five amino acids), and therefore lacks essential interactions for the formation of higher oligomers. Notably, a well ordered loop known as the insertion clamp in the PDZ domain interacts with the protease domain of the adjacent molecule, which possibly aids in the stabilization of a trimeric functional unit of this enzyme. The three-dimensional structure of m HtrA1 S387A presented here will be useful in the design of enzyme-specific antituberculosis inhibitors.",

B. burgdorferi encodes at least 140 lipoproteins located on the outer or inner membrane, thus facing the surroundings or the periplasmic space, respectively. However, most of the predicted lipoproteins are of unknown function, and only a few proteins are known to be essential for the persistence and virulence of the pathogen. One such protein is the periplasmic BB0323, which is indispensable for B. burgdorferi to cause Lyme disease and the function of which is associated with cell fission and outer membrane integrity. After expression and transport to the periplasm, BB0323 is cleaved into C-terminal and N-terminal domains by the periplasmic serine protease BB0104. The resulting N-terminal domain is sufficient to ensure the survival of B. burgdorferi throughout the mouse–tick infection cycle. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of BB0323 was determined at 2.35 Å resolution. The overall fold of the protein belongs to the spectrin superfamily, with the characteristic interconnected triple-helical bundles known as spectrin repeats that function as linkers between different cell components in other organisms. Overall, the reported three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of BB0323 not only reveals the molecular details of a protein that is essential for B. burgdorferi membrane integrity, cell fission and infectivity, but also suggests that spectrin repeats in bacteria are not limited to the EzrA proteins.",

Mason–Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) is unique among retroviruses as its protease is also stable in the monomeric form, as confirmed by an existing crystal structure of a 13 kDa variant of the protein (M-PMV PR) and its previous biochemical characterization. In the present work, two mutants of M-PMV PR, D26N and C7A/D26N/C106A, were crystallized in complex with a peptidomimetic inhibitor and one mutant (D26N) was crystallized without the inhibitor. The crystal structures were solved at resolutions of 1.6, 1.9 and 2.0 Å, respectively. At variance with the previous study, all of the new structures have the canonical dimeric form of retroviral proteases. The protomers within a dimer differ mainly in the flap-loop region, with the most extreme case observed in the apo structure, in which one flap loop is well defined while the other flap loop is not defined by electron density. The presence of the inhibitor molecules in the complex structures was assessed using polder maps, but some details of their conformations remain ambiguous. In all of the presented structures the active site contains a water molecule buried deeply between the Asn26-Thr27-Gly28 triads of the protomers. Such a water molecule is completely unique not only in retropepsins but also in aspartic proteases in general. The C7A and C106A mutations do not influence the conformation of the protein. The Cys106 residue is properly placed at the homodimer interface area for a disulfide cross-link, but the reducing conditions of the crystallization experiment prevented S—S bond formation.

    "abstract": "The Y128F single mutant of p -hydroxymandelate oxidase (Hmo) is capable of oxidizing mandelate to benzoate via a four-electron oxidative decarboxylation reaction. When benzoylformate (the product of the first two-electron oxidation) and hydrogen peroxide (an oxidant) were used as substrates the reaction did not proceed, suggesting that free hydrogen peroxide is not the committed oxidant in the second two-electron oxidation. How the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-dependent four-electron oxidation reaction takes place remains elusive. Structural and biochemical explorations have shed new light on this issue. 15 high-resolution crystal structures of Hmo and its mutants liganded with or without a substrate reveal that oxidized FMN (FMN ox ) possesses a previously unknown electrophilic/nucleophilic duality. In the Y128F mutant the active-site perturbation ensemble facilitates the polarization of FMN ox to a nucleophilic ylide, which is in a position to act on an α-ketoacid, forming an N5-acyl-FMN red dead-end adduct. In four-electron oxidation, an intramolecular disproportionation reaction via an N5-alkanol-FMN red C′α carbanion intermediate may account for the ThDP/PLP/NADPH-independent oxidative decarboxylation reaction. A synthetic 5-deaza-FMN ox cofactor in combination with an α-hydroxyamide or α-ketoamide biochemically and structurally supports the proposed mechanism.",

It has been revisited in the light of a new probabilistic approach which is able to directly derive conditional distribution functions without passing through a previous calculation of the joint probability distributions. The conditional distributions take into account various types of prior information: in the rotation step the prior information may concern a non-oriented model molecule alone or together with one or more located model molecules. The formulae thus obtained are used to derive figures of merit for recognizing the correct orientation in the rotation step and the correct location in the translation step. The phases obtained by this new version of REMO09 are used as a starting point for a pipeline which in its first step extends and refines the molecular-replacement phases, and in its second step creates the final electron-density map which is automatically interpreted by CAB, an automatic model-building program for proteins and DNA/RNA structures.",

Previously, crystal structures of the matured and active Esp have been determined. Interestingly, many of the staphylococcal glutamyl endopeptidase zymogens, including V8 from Staphylococcus aureus and Esp from S. epidermidis , contain unusually long pro-peptide segments; however, their function is not known. With the aim of elucidating the function of these pro-peptide segments, crystal structures of the Esp zymogen (Pro-Esp) and its variants were determined. It was observed that the N-terminus of the Pro-Esp crystal structure is flexible and is not associated with the main body of the enzyme, unlike in the known active Esp structure. In addition, the loops that border the putative substrate-binding pocket of Pro-Esp are flexible and disordered; the structural components that are responsible for enzyme specificity and efficiency in serine proteases are disordered in Pro-Esp. However, the N-terminal locked Pro-Esp variants exhibit a rigid substrate-binding pocket similar to the active Esp structure and regain activity. These structural studies highlight the role of the N-terminus in stabilizing the structural components responsible for the activity and specificity of staphylococcal glutamyl endopeptidases.",

TRX from the extremely halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 (HsTRX-A), which has the highest acidic residue content [(Asp + Glu)/(Arg + Lys + His) = 9.0] among known TRXs, was chosen to elucidate the catalytic mechanism and evolutionary characteristics associated with haloadaptation. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the main-chain structure of HsTRX-A is similar to those of homologous TRXs; for example, the root-mean-square deviations on Cα atoms were <2.3 Å for extant archaeal TRXs and <1.5 Å for resurrected Precambrian TRXs. A unique water network was located near the active-site residues (Cys45 and Cys48) in HsTRX-A, which may enhance the proton transfer required for the reduction of substrates under a high-salt environment. The high density of negative charges on the molecular surface (3.6 × 10-3 e Å-2) should improve the solubility and haloadaptivity. Moreover, circular-dichroism measurements and enzymatic assays using a mutant HsTRX-A with deletion of the long flexible N-terminal region (Ala2-Pro17) revealed that Ala2-Pro17 improves the structural stability and the enzymatic activity of HsTRX-A under high-salt environments (>2 M NaCl). The elongation of the N-terminal region in HsTRX-A accompanies the increased hydrophilicity and acidic residue content but does not affect the structure of the active site. These observations offer insights into molecular evolution for haloadaptation and potential applications in halophilic protein-related biotechnology.",

They possess a common fold hallmarked by three α-helices that surround a covalently attached heme. An intriguing feature of many monoheme c -type cytochromes is their capacity to form oligomers by exchanging at least one of their α-helices, which is often referred to as 3D domain swapping. Here, the crystal structure of NirC, a c -type cytochrome co-encoded with other proteins involved in nitrite reduction by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , has been determined. The crystals diffracted anisotropically to a maximum resolution of 2.12 Å (spherical resolution of 2.83 Å) and initial phases were obtained by Fe-SAD phasing, revealing the presence of 11 NirC chains in the asymmetric unit. Surprisingly, these protomers arrange into one monomer and two different types of 3D domain-swapped dimers, one of which shows pronounced asymmetry. While the simultaneous observation of monomers and dimers probably reflects the interplay between the high protein concentration required for crystallization and the structural plasticity of monoheme c -type cytochromes, the identification of conserved structural motifs in the monomer together with a comparison with similar proteins may offer new leads to unravel the unknown function of NirC.",

The presence of an unprecedented number of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes with industrial appeal such as epoxide hydrolases (EHs) reveals its resourceful microscopic machinery. The whole-genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. CBMAI 2042, an endophytic actinobacterium isolated from Citrus sinensis branches, was explored by genome mining, and a putative α/β-epoxide hydrolase named B1EPH2 and encoded by 344 amino acids was selected for functional and structural studies. The crystal structure of B1EPH2 was obtained at a resolution of 2.2 Å and it was found to have a similar fold to other EHs, despite its hexameric quaternary structure, which contrasts with previously solved dimeric and monomeric EH structures. While B1EPH2 has a high sequence similarity to EHB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis , its cavity is similar to that of human EH. A group of 12 aromatic and aliphatic racemic epoxides were assayed to determine the activity of B1EPH2; remarkably, this enzyme was able to hydrolyse all the epoxides to the respective 1,2-diols, indicating a wide-range substrate scope acceptance. Moreover, the ( R )- and ( S )-enantiomers of styrene oxide, epichlorohydrin and 1,2-epoxybutane were used to monitor enantiopreference.

E. fetida possesses two isoforms of α-amylase (Ef-Amy I and II) to digest raw starch. Ef-Amy I retains its catalytic activity at temperatures below 10°C. To identify the molecular properties of Ef-Amy I, X-ray crystal structures were determined of the wild type and of the inactive E249Q mutant. Ef-Amy I has structural similarities to mammalian α-amylases, including the porcine pancreatic and human pancreatic α-amylases. Structural comparisons of the overall structures as well as of the Ca 2+ -binding sites of Ef-Amy I and the mammalian α-amylases indicate that Ef-Amy I has increased structural flexibility and more solvent-exposed acidic residues. These structural features of Ef-Amy I may contribute to its observed catalytic activity at low temperatures, as many cold-adapted enzymes have similar structural properties. The structure of the substrate complex of the inactive mutant of Ef-Amy I shows that a maltohexaose molecule is bound in the active site and a maltotetraose molecule is bound in the cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains. The recognition of substrate molecules by Ef-Amy I exhibits some differences from that observed in structures of human pancreatic α-amylase. This result provides insights into the structural modulation of the recognition of substrates and inhibitors.",

Here, structures of lysozyme in complex with bromophenol blue obtained by soaking orthorhombic and tetragonal crystals in a saturated solution of the dye at different pH values from 5.0 to 7.5 are reported. Two different binding sites can be found in the lysozyme–bromophenol blue crystals: binding site I is located near the amino- and carboxyl-termini, while binding site II is located adjacent to helices α1 (residues 4–15) and α3 (residues 88–100). In the orthorhombic crystals soaked at pH 7.0, binding of the dye takes place in both sites without significant changes in the unit cell. However, soaking tetragonal crystals with bromophenol blue results in two different complexes. Crystals soaked at pH 5.5 (HEWL-T1) show a single dye molecule bound to site II, and the crystals belong to space group P 4 3 2 1 2 without significant changes in the unit cell ( a = b = 78.50, c = 37.34 Å). On the other hand, crystals soaked at pH 6.5 in the presence of imidazole (HEWL-T2) show up to eight molecules of the dye bound to site II, and display changes in space group ( P 2 1 2 1 2 1 ) and unit cell ( a = 38.00, b = 76.65, c = 84.86 Å). In all of the structures, the dye molecules are placed at the surface of the protein near to positively charged residues accessible through the main solvent channels of the crystal. Differences in the arrangement of the dye molecules at the surface of the protein suggest that the binding is not specific and is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions.",

    "abstract": "The structure and function of proteins are strongly affected by the surrounding solvent water, for example through hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic effect. These interactions depend not only on the position, but also on the orientation, of the water molecules around the protein. Therefore, it is often vital to know the detailed orientations of the surrounding ordered water molecules. Such information can be obtained by neutron crystallography. However, it is tedious and time-consuming to determine the correct orientation of every water molecule in a structure (there are typically several hundred of them), which is presently performed by manual evaluation. Here, a method has been developed that reliably automates the orientation of a water molecules in a simple and relatively fast way. Firstly, a quantitative quality measure, the real-space correlation coefficient, was selected, together with a threshold that allows the identification of water molecules that are oriented. Secondly, the refinement procedure was optimized by varying the refinement method and parameters, thus finding settings that yielded the best results in terms of time and performance. It turned out to be favourable to employ only the neutron data and a fixed protein structure when reorienting the water molecules. Thirdly, a method has been developed that identifies and reorients inadequately oriented water molecules systematically and automatically. The method has been tested on three proteins, galectin-3C, rubredoxin and inorganic pyrophosphatase, and it is shown that it yields improved orientations of the water molecules for all three proteins in a shorter time than manual model building. It also led to an increased number of hydrogen bonds involving water molecules for all proteins.",

    "abstract": "Adenylate-forming enzymes (AFEs) are a mechanistic superfamily of proteins that are involved in many cellular roles. In the biosynthesis of benzoxazole antibiotics, an AFE has been reported to play a key role in the condensation of cyclic molecules. In the biosynthetic gene cluster for the benzoxazole AJI9561, AjiA1 catalyzes the condensation of two 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) molecules using ATP as a co-substrate. Here, the enzymatic activity of AjiA1 is reported together with a structural analysis of its apo form. The structure of AjiA1 was solved at 2.0 Å resolution and shows a conserved fold with other AFE family members. AjiA1 exhibits activity in the presence of 3-HAA ( K m = 77.86 ± 28.36, k cat = 0.04 ± 0.004) and also with the alternative substrate 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA; K m = 22.12 ± 31.35, k cat = 0.08 ± 0.005). The structure of AjiA1 in the apo form also reveals crucial conformational changes that occur during the catalytic cycle of this enzyme which have not been described for any other AFE member. Consequently, the results shown here provide insights into this protein family and a new subgroup is proposed for enzymes that are involved in benzoxazole-ring formation.",

    "abstract": "Succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) catalyzes the only step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that leads to substrate-level phosphorylation. Some forms of SCS are specific for ADP/ATP or for GDP/GTP, while others can bind all of these nucleotides, generally with different affinities. The theory of `gatekeeper' residues has been proposed to explain the nucleotide-specificity. Gatekeeper residues lie outside the binding site and create specific electrostatic interactions with incoming nucleotides to determine whether the nucleotides can enter the binding site. To test this theory, the crystal structure of the nucleotide-binding domain in complex with Mg2+-ADP was determined, as well as the structures of four proteins with single mutations, K46βE, K114βD, V113βL and L227βF, and one with two mutations, K46βE/K114βD. The crystal structures show that the enzyme is specific for ADP/ATP because of interactions between the nucleotide and the binding site. Nucleotide-specificity is provided by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the adenine base and Gln20β, Gly111β and Val113β. The O atom of the side chain of Gln20β interacts with N6 of ADP, while the side-chain N atom interacts with the carbonyl O atom of Gly111β. It is the different conformations of the backbone at Gln20β, of the side chain of Gln20β and of the linker that make the enzyme ATP-specific. This linker connects the two subdomains of the ATP-grasp fold and interacts differently with adenine and guanine bases. The mutant proteins have similar conformations, although the L227βF mutant shows structural changes that disrupt the binding site for the magnesium ion. Although the K46βE/K114βD double mutant of Blastocystis hominis SCS binds GTP better than ATP according to kinetic assays, only the complex with Mg2+-ADP was obtained.",

For a SAD experiment using a derivative with introduced heavy atoms, it is difficult to completely exclude crystals of the native protein from the sample. In this paper, simulations were performed to study how the inclusion of native crystals in the derivative sample could affect the result of SAD phasing and how the post-experimental purification proposed by Zhang et al. [(2015), Acta Cryst. D 71 , 2513–2518] could be used to remove the impurities. A gadolinium derivative of lysozyme and the corresponding native protein were used in the test. Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) diffraction snapshots were generated by CrystFEL . SHELXC / D , Phaser , DM , ARP / wARP and REFMAC were used for automatic structure solution. It is shown that a small amount of impurities (snapshots from native crystals) in the set of derivative snapshots can strongly affect the SAD phasing results. On the other hand, post-experimental purification can efficiently remove the impurities, leading to results similar to those from a pure sample.",

Determining the structure of the complex formed by B and the N-terminal region of C was challenging owing to its large size, the non-isomorphism of different crystals and their sensitivity to radiation damage. A native data set was collected to 2.5 Å resolution and a non-isomorphous Ta6Br12-derivative data set was collected that showed strong anomalous signal at low resolution. The tantalum-cluster sites could be found, but the anomalous signal did not extend to a high enough resolution to allow model building. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-derivatized protein crystals were produced, but the high number (60) of SeMet sites and the sensitivity of the crystals to radiation damage made phasing using the SAD or MAD methods difficult. Multiple SeMet data sets were combined to provide 30-fold multiplicity, and the low-resolution phase information from the Ta6Br12 data set was transferred to this combined data set by cross-crystal averaging. This allowed the Se atoms to be located in an anomalous difference Fourier map; they were then used in Auto-Rickshaw for multiple rounds of autobuilding and MRSAD.",

    "abstract": "X-ray crystallography promises direct insights into electron-density changes that lead to and arise from structural changes such as electron and proton transfer and the formation, rupture and isomerization of chemical bonds. The ultrashort pulses of hard X-rays produced by free-electron lasers present an exciting opportunity for capturing ultrafast structural events in biological macromolecules within femtoseconds after photoexcitation. However, shot-to-shot fluctuations, which are inherent to the very process of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) that generates the ultrashort X-ray pulses, are a major source of noise that may conceal signals from structural changes. Here, a new approach is proposed to angularly split a single SASE pulse and to produce a temporal delay of picoseconds between the split pulses. These split pulses will allow the probing of two distinct states before and after photoexcitation triggered by a laser pulse between the split X-ray pulses. The split pulses originate from a single SASE pulse and share many common properties; thus, noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations is self-canceling. The unambiguous interpretation of ultrafast structural changes would require diffraction data at atomic resolution, as these changes may or may not involve any atomic displacement. This approach, in combination with the strategy of serial crystallography, offers a solution to study ultrafast dynamics of light-initiated biochemical reactions or biological processes at atomic resolution.",

Studying reaction intermediates, such as the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (GEI) and the Michaelis complex, could provide valuable information to better understand the molecular factors governing the catalytic mechanism. Here, the GEI structure of RBcel1, an endo-1,4-β-glucanase of the GH5 family endowed with transglycosylase activity, is reported. It is the first structure of a GH5 enzyme covalently bound to a natural oligosaccharide with the two catalytic glutamate residues present. The structure of the variant RBcel1_E135A in complex with cellotriose is also reported, allowing a description of the entire binding cleft of RBcel1. Taken together, the structures deliver different snapshots of the double-displacement mechanism. The structural analysis revealed a significant movement of the nucleophilic glutamate residue during the reaction. Enzymatic assays indicated that, as expected, the acid/base glutamate residue is crucial for the glycosylation step and partly contributes to deglycosylation. Moreover, a conserved tyrosine residue in the −1 subsite, Tyr201, plays a determinant role in both the glycosylation and deglycosylation steps, since the GEI was trapped in the RBcel1_Y201F variant. The approach used to obtain the GEI presented here could easily be transposed to other retaining GHs in clan GH-A.",

Two categories, `classic' and `G1' β-bulges, are distinguished by their dihedral angles: 1,2-α R β R (classic) or 1,2-α L β R (G1). It had previously been observed that G1 β-bulges are most often found as components of two quite distinct composite structures, suggesting that a basis for further differentiation might exist. Here, it is shown that two subtypes of G1 β-bulges, G1α and G1β, may be distinguished by their conformation (α R or β R ) at residue `0' of the second strand. β-Bulges that are constituents of the composite structure named the β-bulge loop are of the G1α type, whereas those that are constituents of the composite structure named β-link here are of the G1β type. A small proportion of G1β β-bulges, but not G1α β-bulges, occur in other contexts. There are distinctive differences in amino-acid composition and sequence pattern between these two types of G1 β-bulge which may have practical application in protein design.",

    "abstract": "Biotin protein ligase catalyses the post-translational modification of biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domains, a modification that is crucial for the function of several carboxylases. It is a two-step process that results in the covalent attachment of biotin to the ɛ-amino group of a conserved lysine of the BCCP domain of a carboxylase in an ATP-dependent manner. In Leishmania , three mitochondrial enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase and propionyl-CoA carboxylase, depend on biotinylation for activity. In view of the indispensable role of the biotinylating enzyme in the activation of these carboxylases, crystal structures of L. major biotin protein ligase complexed with biotin and with biotinyl-5′-AMP have been solved. L. major biotin protein ligase crystallizes as a unique dimer formed by cross-handshake interactions of the hinge region of the two monomers formed by partial unfolding of the C-terminal domain. Interestingly, the substrate (BCCP domain)-binding site of each monomer is occupied by its own C-terminal domain in the dimer structure. This was observed in all of the crystals that were obtained, suggesting a closed/inactive conformation of the enzyme. Size-exclusion chromatography studies carried out using high protein concentrations (0.5 m M ) suggest the formation of a concentration-dependent dimer that exists in equilibrium with the monomer.",

In plants, the WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) family of transcription factors function as central organizers of several developmental programs ranging from embryo patterning to meristematic stem-cell maintenance through transcriptional activation and repression mechanisms. The Medicago truncatula STENOFOLIA ( STF ) gene is a master regulator of leaf-blade lateral development. Here, the crystal structure of the homeodomain (HD) of STF (STF-HD) in complex with its promoter DNA is reported at 2.1 Å resolution. STF-HD binds DNA as a tetramer, enclosing nearly the entire bound DNA surface. The STF-HD tetramer is partially stabilized by docking of the C-terminal tail of one protomer onto a conserved hydrophobic surface on the head of another protomer in a head-to-tail manner. STF-HD specifically binds TGA motifs, although the promoter sequence also contains TAAT motifs. Helix α3 not only serves a canonical role as a base reader in the major groove, but also provides DNA binding in the minor groove through basic residues located at its C-terminus. The structural and functional data in planta reported here provide new insights into the DNA-binding mechanisms of plant-specific HDs from the WOX family of transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus gordonii is a member of the viridans streptococci and is an early colonizer of the tooth surface. Adherence to the tooth surface is enabled by proteins present on the S. gordonii cell surface, among which SspB belongs to one of the most well studied cell-wall-anchored adhesin families: the antigen I/II (AgI/II) family. The C-terminal region of SspB consists of three tandemly connected individual domains that display the DEv-IgG fold. These C-terminal domains contain a conserved Ca 2+ -binding site and isopeptide bonds, and they adhere to glycoprotein 340 (Gp340; also known as salivary agglutinin, SAG). Here, the structural and functional characterization of the C 123 SspB domain at 2.7 Å resolution is reported. Although the individual C-terminal domains of Streptococcus mutans AgI/II and S. gordonii SspB show a high degree of both sequence and structural homology, superposition of these structures highlights substantial differences in their electrostatic surface plots, and this can be attributed to the relative orientation of the individual domains (C 1 , C 2 and C 3 ) with respect to each other and could reflect their specificity in binding to extracellular matrix molecules. Studies further confirmed that affinity for Gp340 or its scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains requires two of the three domains of C 123 SspB , namely C 12 or C 23 , which is different from AgI/II. Using protein–protein docking studies, models for this observed functional difference between C 123 SspB and C 123 AgI/II in their binding to SRCR 1 are presented.",

Although homospermidine synthase (HSS) is part of the polyamine metabolism in various strains of P. aeruginosa, neither its role nor its structure has been examined so far. The reaction mechanism of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent bacterial HSS has previously been characterized based on crystal structures of Blastochloris viridis HSS (BvHSS). This study presents the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa HSS (PaHSS) in complex with its substrate putrescine. A high structural similarity between PaHSS and BvHSS with conservation of the catalytically relevant residues is demonstrated, qualifying BvHSS as a model for mechanistic studies of PaHSS. Following this strategy, crystal structures of single-residue variants of BvHSS are presented together with activity assays of PaHSS, BvHSS and BvHSS variants. For efficient homospermidine production, acidic residues are required at the entrance to the binding pocket (`ionic slide') and near the active site (`inner amino site') to attract and bind the substrate putrescine via salt bridges. The tryptophan residue at the active site stabilizes cationic reaction components by cation-π interaction, as inferred from the interaction geometry between putrescine and the indole ring plane. Exchange of this tryptophan for other amino acids suggests a distinct catalytic requirement for an aromatic interaction partner with a highly negative electrostatic potential. These findings substantiate the structural and mechanistic knowledge on bacterial HSS, a potential target for antibiotic design.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are macromolecules that perform essential biological functions which depend on their three-dimensional structure. Determining this structure involves complex laboratory and computational work. For the computational work, multiple software pipelines have been developed to build models of the protein structure from crystallographic data. Each of these pipelines performs differently depending on the characteristics of the electron-density map received as input. Identifying the best pipeline to use for a protein structure is difficult, as the pipeline performance differs significantly from one protein structure to another. As such, researchers often select pipelines that do not produce the best possible protein models from the available data. Here, a software tool is introduced which predicts key quality measures of the protein structures that a range of pipelines would generate if supplied with a given crystallographic data set. These measures are crystallographic quality-of-fit indicators based on included and withheld observations, and structure completeness. Extensive experiments carried out using over 2500 data sets show that the tool yields accurate predictions for both experimental phasing data sets (at resolutions between 1.2 and 4.0 Å) and molecular-replacement data sets (at resolutions between 1.0 and 3.5 Å). The tool can therefore provide a recommendation to the user concerning the pipelines that should be run in order to proceed most efficiently to a depositable model.",

To counteract CRISPR–Cas systems, phages and viruses have evolved to possess multiple anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that can inhibit the host CRISPR–Cas system via different strategies. The expression of acr genes is controlled by anti-CRISPR-associated (Aca) proteins that bind to an upstream promoter and regulate the expression of acr genes during transcription. Although the role of Aca as a transcriptional repressor has been demonstrated, the mechanism of action of Aca has not been determined. Here, the molecular mechanism underlying the Aca2-mediated transcriptional control of acr genes was elucidated by determining the crystal structure of Aca2 from Oceanimonas smirnovii at a high resolution of 1.92 Å. Aca2 forms a dimer in solution, and dimerization of Aca2 is critical for specific promoter binding. The promoter-binding strategy of dimeric Aca2 was also revealed by performing mutagenesis studies.

    "abstract": "CAB, a recently described automated model-building (AMB) program, has been modified to work effectively with nucleic acids. To this end, several new algorithms have been introduced and the libraries have been updated. To reduce the input average phase error, ligand heavy atoms are now located before starting the CAB interpretation of the electron-density maps. Furthermore, alternative approaches are used depending on whether the ligands belong to the target or to the model chain used in the molecular-replacement step. Robust criteria are then applied to decide whether the AMB model is acceptable or whether it must be modified to fit prior information on the target structure. In the latter case, the model chains are rearranged to fit prior information on the target chains. Here, the performance of the new AMB program CAB applied to various nucleic acid structures is discussed. Other well documented programs such as Nautilus, ARP/wARP and phenix.autobuild were also applied and the experimental results are described.",

    "abstract": "Nanotechnology is currently imparting a number of changes on our lives through its application in electronics, the automotive industry, life sciences, pharmaceuticals, aesthetic products etc.One of the major fields that is benefitting from the advent of nanotechnology is medicine, which is transforming rapidly to improve our quality of life.By using advanced nanotechnology in the medical field, scientists are trying to solve many unsolved problems that currently exist in the understanding and treatment of cancer.Scientists from many fields have joined together to develop the new interdisciplinary field known as bionanotechnolgy to create drugs that can target cancer cells selectively by sparing healthy normal cells.In the past decade there has been a spurt in research to develop nanodrugs to kill cancer cells selectively by using drugs with delivery vehicles such as polymeric nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, gold/silver nanoparticles, lipids and carbon nanomaterials, separately or in combination.For doctors to identify tumour cells, they also need very good diagnostic techniques.Nanotechnology is proving to be ideal to support this field by providing many diagnostic nanotools such as quantum dots, magnetic nanomaterials, nanobubbles, upconversion nanomaterials etc.A new term in advanced tumour therapy is 'theranostics' which combines therapy and diagnosis.This field has immense potential and provides vast possibilities for using many nanomaterials in combination for the purpose of theranostics.Although this field is currently in its infancy, many researchers are working in this area and many more researchers are joining the field, having discovered its huge potential.Even at this early stage of development, theranostics has made large advances and promises a number of possibilities to eradicate tumours and improve the quality of life in the near future.Although this field is highly promising, the lack of detailed and basic information for new researchers interested in joining the field has proved to be a big hurdle.The book Nanomaterials for Tumor Targeting Theranostics: A Proactive Clinical Perspective solves this problem to a large extent.This book provides a detailed account of a lot of the materials and techniques used in the theranostics field.The editors have made a very good attempt to cover almost all areas of theranostics and that has made this book excellent for enthusiastic persons, beginners as well as current researchers, to use as a resource book.The references used in the book are up to date and hence advanced researchers can use these references to improve their knowledge and to delve deeper into these techniques to discover new products with the potential to provide a complete cure for the menace of cancer.The book comprises 14 well written chapters.Chapter 1 Nanomaterials as Therapeutic/ Imaging Agent Delivery Vehicles for Tumor Targeting Theranostics gives a very good basic understanding about the field of theranostics and introduces many nanomaterials and different techniques.Chapter 2 Basics of Theranostics in Tumor introduces different nanoplatforms, nanoprobes, nanocarriers etc., as well as discussing the safety issues and future directions.From Chapter 3 onwards this book gives an in depth discussion about each and every material used in the theranostics field.This chapter Magnetic Nanomaterials for Tumor Targeting Theranostics provides detailed information about paramagnetic and superparamagnetic nanomaterials that are used in this field.Chapter 4 Quantum Dots (QDs) for Tumor Targeting Theranostics gives very good information about the use of these materials and their advantages regarding diagnosis compared to",

    "abstract": "An alternative rational approach to improve protein crystals by using single-site mutation of surface residues is proposed based on the results of a statistical analysis using a compiled data set of 918 independent crystal structures, thereby reflecting not only the entropic effect but also other effects upon protein crystallization. This analysis reveals a clear difference in the crystal-packing propensity of amino acids depending on the secondary-structural class. To verify this result, a systematic crystallization experiment was performed with the biotin carboxyl carrier protein from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 ( Ph BCCP). Six single-site mutations were examined: Ala138 on the surface of a β-sheet was mutated to Ile, Tyr, Arg, Gln, Val and Lys. In agreement with prediction, it was observed that the two mutants (A138I and A138Y) harbouring the residues with the highest crystal-packing propensities for β-sheet at position 138 provided better crystallization scores relative to those of other constructs, including the wild type, and that the crystal-packing propensity for β-sheet provided the best correlation with the ratio of obtaining crystals. Two new crystal forms of these mutants were obtained that diffracted to high resolution, generating novel packing interfaces with the mutated residues (Ile/Tyr). The mutations introduced did not affect the overall structures, indicating that a β-sheet can accommodate a successful mutation if it is carefully selected so as to avoid intramolecular steric hindrance. A significant negative correlation between the ratio of obtaining amorphous precipitate and the crystal-packing propensity was also found.",

    "abstract": "Molecular replacement (MR) has commonly been employed to derive the phase information in protein crystal X-ray diffraction, but its success rate decreases rapidly when the search model is dissimilar to the target. MR-REX has been developed to perform an MR search by replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations, which enables cooperative rotation and translation searches and simultaneous clash and occupancy optimization. MR-REX was tested on a set of 1303 protein structures of different accuracies and successfully placed 699 structures at positions that have an r.m.s.d. of below 2 Å to the target position, which is 10% higher than was obtained by Phaser . However, cases studies show that many of the models for which Phaser failed and MR-REX succeeded can be solved by Phaser by pruning them and using nondefault parameters. The factors effecting success and the parts of the methodology which lead to success are studied. The results demonstrate a new avenue for molecular replacement which outperforms (and has results that are complementary to) the state-of-the-art MR methods, in particular for distantly homologous proteins.",

In contrast to the mechanism of nitrite reduction, that of dioxygen reduction is poorly understood. Here, results from anaerobic synchrotron-radiation crystallography (SRX) and aerobic in-house radiation crystallography (iHRX) with a CuNIR from the thermophile Geobacillus thermodenitrificans ( Gt NIR) support the hypothesis that the dioxygen present in an aerobically manipulated crystal can bind to the catalytic type 2 copper (T2Cu) site of Gt NIR during SRX experiments. The anaerobic SRX structure showed a dual conformation of one water molecule as an axial ligand in the T2Cu site, while previous aerobic SRX Gt NIR structures were refined as diatomic molecule-bound states. Moreover, an SRX structure of the C135A mutant of Gt NIR with peroxide bound to the T2Cu atom was determined. The peroxide molecule was mainly observed in a side-on binding manner, with a possible minor end-on conformation. The structures provide insights into dioxygen chemistry in CuNIRs and hence help to unmask the other face of CuNIRs.",

    "abstract": "The core of β-lactam antibiotics originates from amino acids of primary metabolism in certain microorganisms. β-Lactam-producing bacteria, including Streptomyces clavuligerus, synthesize the precursor of the amino acid α-aminoadipic acid by the catabolism of lysine in two steps. The second reaction, the oxidation of piperideine-6-carboxylate (or its open-chain form α-aminoadipate semialdehyde) to α-aminoadipic acid, is catalysed by the NAD+-dependent enzyme piperideine-6-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P6CDH). This structural study, focused on ligand binding and catalysis, presents structures of P6CDH from S. clavuligerus in its apo form and in complexes with the cofactor NAD+, the product α-aminoadipic acid and a substrate analogue, picolinic acid. P6CDH adopts the common aldehyde dehydrogenase fold, consisting of NAD-binding, catalytic and oligomerization domains. The product binds in the oxyanion hole, close to the catalytic residue Cys299. Clear density is observed for the entire cofactor, including the nicotinamide riboside, in the binary complex. NAD+ binds in an extended conformation with its nicotinamide ring overlapping with the binding site of the carboxylate group of the product, implying that the conformation of the cofactor may change during catalysis. The binding site of the substrate analogue overlaps with that of the product, suggesting that the cyclic form of the substrate, piperideine-6-carboxylate, may be accepted as a substrate by the enzyme. The catalytic mechanism and the roles of individual residues are discussed in light of these results.",

In fact, it has been reported that some deuterated proteins show different physical and chemical properties to their protiated counterparts. Consequently, it is important to investigate protonation states around the active site when using deuterated proteins. Here, hydrogen isotope effects on the S65T/F99S/M153T/V163A variant of green fluorescent protein (GFP), in which the deprotonated B form is dominant at pH 8.5, were investigated. The pH/pD dependence of the absorption and fluorescence spectra indicates that the protonation state of the chromophore is the same in protiated GFP in H 2 O and protiated GFP in D 2 O at pH/pD 8.5, while the p K a of the chromophore became higher in D 2 O. Indeed, X-ray crystallographic analyses at sub-ångström resolution revealed no apparent changes in the protonation state of the chromophore between the two samples. However, detailed comparisons of the hydrogen OMIT maps revealed that the protonation state of His148 in the vicinity of the chromophore differed between the two samples. This indicates that protonation states around the active site should be carefully adjusted to be the same as those of the protiated protein when neutron crystallographic analyses of proteins are performed.",

This catalytic water molecule is essential in the acylation and deacylation parts of the reaction mechanism through which Toho-1 inactivates specific antibiotics and provides resistance to its expressing bacterial strains. To investigate the function of Glu166 in the acylation part of the catalytic mechanism, neutron and X-ray crystallographic studies were performed on a Glu166Gln mutant. The structure of this class A β-lactamase mutant provides several insights into its previously reported reduced drug-binding kinetic rates. A joint refinement of both X-ray and neutron diffraction data was used to study the effects of the Glu166Gln mutation on the active site of Toho-1. This structure reveals that while the Glu166Gln mutation has a somewhat limited impact on the positions of the conserved amino acids within the active site, it displaces the catalytic water molecule from the active site. These subtle changes offer a structural explanation for the previously observed decreases in the binding of non-β-lactam inhibitors such as the recently developed diazobicyclooctane inhibitor avibactam.",

    "abstract": "Archaea are uniquely adapted to thrive in harsh environments, and one of these adaptations involves the archaeal membrane lipids, which are characterized by their isoprenoid alkyl chains connected via ether linkages to glycerol 1-phosphate. The membrane lipids of the thermophilic and acidophilic euryarchaeota Thermoplasma volcanium are exclusively glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers. The first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway of these archaeal lipids is the formation of the ether linkage between glycerol 1-phosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and is catalyzed by the enzyme geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase (GGGPS). The 1.72 Å resolution crystal structure of GGGPS from T. volcanium (TvGGGPS) in complex with glycerol and sulfate is reported here. The crystal structure reveals TvGGGPS to be a dimer, which is consistent with the absence of the aromatic anchor residue in helix α5a that is required for hexamerization in other GGGPS homologs; the hexameric quaternary structure in GGGPS is thought to provide thermostability. A phylogenetic analysis of the Euryarchaeota and a parallel ancestral state reconstruction investigated the relationship between optimal growth temperature and the ancestral sequences. The presence of an aromatic anchor residue is not explained by temperature as an ecological parameter. An examination of the active site of the TvGGGPS dimer revealed that it may be able to accommodate longer isoprenoid substrates, supporting an alternative pathway of isoprenoid membrane-lipid synthesis.",

The results show that integrating these pipelines can lead to significant improvements in structure completeness and R free . In particular, running Phenix AutoBuild after Buccaneer improved structure completeness for 29% and 75% of the data sets that were examined at the original resolution and at a simulated lower resolution, respectively, compared with running Phenix AutoBuild on its own.

This is the first structure of a plant NPP in solution that has been reported to date. It is shown that the ELNPP sequence is highly conserved in many other plant species. Of note, the catalytic domains of these plant NPPs have the same highly conserved PDE-domain organization as mammalian NPPs. Moreover, ELNPP is a dimer in solution and this oligomerization state is likely to be common to other plant enzymes.",

Here, the method has been further developed and an MSCS data-handling pipeline is presented that uses the Detection of Related Solvent Positions ( DRoP ) program to improve data quality. DRoP is used to selectively model conserved water molecules, so that an advanced stage of structural refinement is reached quickly. This allows the placement of organic molecules more accurately and convergence on high-quality maps and structures. This pipeline was applied to the chromatin-associated protein barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), resulting in structural models with better than average statistics. DRoP and Phenix Structure Comparison were used to characterize the data sets and to identify a binding site that overlaps with the interaction site of BAF with emerin. The conserved water-mediated networks identified by DRoP suggested a mechanism by which water molecules are used to drive the binding of DNA. Normalized and differential B -factor analysis is shown to be a valuable tool to characterize the effects of specific solvents on defined regions of BAF. Specific solvents are identified that cause stabilization of functionally important regions of the protein. This work presents tools and a standardized approach for the analysis and comprehension of MSCS data sets.",

The active-site Ni–Fe complex of the aerobically purified enzyme shows its inactive oxidized form, which can be reactivated through reduction by hydrogen. Here, in order to understand how the oxidized form is reactivated by hydrogen and further to directly evaluate the bridging of a hydride ligand in the reduced form of the Ni–Fe complex, a neutron structure determination was undertaken on single crystals grown in a hydrogen atmosphere. Cryogenic crystallography is being introduced into the neutron diffraction research field as it enables the trapping of short-lived intermediates and the collection of diffraction data to higher resolution. To optimize the cooling of large crystals under anaerobic conditions, the effects on crystal quality were evaluated by X-rays using two typical methods, the use of a cold nitrogen-gas stream and plunge-cooling into liquid nitrogen, and the former was found to be more effective in cooling the crystals uniformly than the latter. Neutron diffraction data for the reactivated enzyme were collected at the Japan Photon Accelerator Research Complex under cryogenic conditions, where the crystal diffracted to a resolution of 2.0 Å. A neutron diffraction experiment on the reduced form was carried out at Oak Ridge National Laboratory under cryogenic conditions and showed diffraction peaks to a resolution of 2.4 Å.",

However, the regulatory mechanism and dynamics of the complex remain elusive. Here, the crystal structure of the VASH1–SVBP complex and a molecular-dynamics simulation study are reported. The overall structure of the complex was similar to previously reported structures. Importantly, however, the structure revealed a domain-swapped heterotetramer that was formed between twofold symmetry-related molecules. This heterotetramerization was stabilized by the mutual exchange of ten conserved N-terminal residues from the VASH1 structural core, which was intramolecular in other structures. Interestingly, a comparison of this region with previously reported structures revealed that the patterns of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions vary. In the molecular-dynamics simulations, differences were found between the heterotetramer and heterodimer, where the fluctuation of the N-terminal region in the heterotetramer was suppressed. Thus, heterotetramer formation and flexibility of the N-terminal region may be important for enzyme activity and regulation.",

Comparisons exploiting AChBP as a surrogate for α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) suggest that the key interactions are conserved. The ligands interact with the same residues as the archetypal nAChR agonist nicotine yet display greater affinity, thereby rationalizing their in vivo activity as potent antagonists of nicotine-induced antinociception. An oxyanion-binding site is formed on the periphery of the AChBP orthosteric site by Lys42, Asp94, Glu170 and Glu210. These residues are highly conserved in the human α4, β2 and α7 nAChR sequences. However, specific sequence differences are discussed that could contribute to nAChR subtype selectivity and in addition may represent a point of allosteric modulation. The ability to engage with this peripheral site may explain, in part, the function of a subset of ligands to act as agonists of α7 nAChR.",

There are a diverse range of enzymes which interact with these sugars throughout the tree of life. They can act as receptors for influenza and specific betacoronaviruses in viral binding and their cleavage is important in virion release. Sialic acids are also exploited by both commensal and pathogenic bacteria for nutrient acquisition. A common modification of sialic acid is 9- O -acetylation, which can limit the action of sialidases. Some bacteria, including human endosymbionts, employ esterases to overcome this modification. However, few bacterial sialic acid 9- O -acetylesterases (9- O -SAEs) have been structurally characterized. Here, the crystal structure of a 9- O -SAE from Phocaeicola vulgatus (PvSAE) is reported. The structure of PvSAE was determined to resolutions of 1.44 and 2.06 Å using crystals from two different crystallization conditions. Structural characterization revealed PvSAE to be a dimer with an SGNH fold, named after the conserved sequence motif of this family, and a Ser–His–Asp catalytic triad. These structures also reveal flexibility in the most N-terminal α-helix, which provides a barrier to active-site accessibility. Biochemical assays also show that PvSAE deacetylates both mucin and the acetylated chromophore para -nitrophenyl acetate. This structural and biochemical characterization of PvSAE furthers the understanding of 9- O -SAEs and may aid in the discovery of small molecules targeting this class of enzyme.",

In all previous structures of full-length InlB or an InlB construct lacking the GW domains (InlB 392 ), there was no interpretable electron density for the B repeat. Here, three InlB 392 crystal structures in which the B repeat is resolved are described. These are the first structures to reveal the relative orientation of the internalin domain and the B repeat. A wild-type structure and two structures of the T332E variant together contain five crystallographically independent molecules. Surprisingly, the threonine-to-glutamate substitution in the B repeat substantially improved the crystallization propensity and crystal quality of the T332E variant. The internalin domain and B repeat are quite rigid internally, but are flexibly linked to each other. The new structures show that inter-domain flexibility is the most likely cause of the missing electron density for the B repeat in previous InlB structures. A potential binding groove between B-repeat strand β2 and an adjacent loop forms an important crystal contact in all five crystallographically independent chains. This region may represent a hydrophobic `sticky patch' that supports protein–protein interactions. This assumption agrees with the previous finding that all known inactivating point mutations in the B repeat lie within strand β2. The groove formed by strand β2 and the adjacent loop may thus represent a functionally important protein–protein interaction site in the B repeat.",

Because of its remarkable physicochemical properties, BC has attracted attention for the development and manufacture of biomedical and industrial materials. In the BC production system, the enzyme endo-β-1,4-glucanase, which belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 8 (GH8), acts as a cleaner by trimming disordered cellulose fibers to produce high-quality BC. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the endo-β-1,4-glucanase would help in developing a reasonable biosynthesis of BC. Nevertheless, all of the steps in the reaction of this endo-β-1,4-glucanase are not clear. This study confirms the BC hydrolytic activity of the endo-β-1,4-glucanase from the BC-producing bacterium Enterobacter sp. CJF-002 ( Eb BcsZ) and reports crystal structures of Eb BcsZ. Unlike in previously reported GH8 endo-β-1,4-glucanase structures, here the base catalyst was mutated (D242A) and the structure of this mutant bound to cellooligosaccharide [ Eb BcsZ(D242A) CPT ] was analyzed. The Eb BcsZ(D242A) CPT structure showed two cellooligosaccharides individually bound to the plus and minus subsites of Eb BcsZ. The glucosyl unit in subsite −1 presented a distorted 5 S 1 conformation, a novel snapshot of a state immediately after scissile-bond cleavage. In combination with previous studies, the reaction process of endo-β-1,4-glucanase is described and the β-1,4-glucan-trimming mechanism of Eb BcsZ is proposed. The Eb BcsZ(D242A) CPT structure also showed an additional β-1,4-glucan binding site on the Eb BcsZ surface, which may help to accept the substrate.",

    "abstract": "Transglycosylating glycoside hydrolases (GHs) offer great potential for the enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides. Although knowledge is progressing, there is no unique strategy to improve the transglycosylation yield. Obtaining efficient enzymatic tools for glycan synthesis with GHs remains dependent on an improved understanding of the molecular factors governing the balance between hydrolysis and transglycosylation. This enzymatic and structural study of RBcel1, a transglycosylase from the GH5_5 subfamily isolated from an uncultured bacterium, aims to unravel such factors. The size of the acceptor and donor sugars was found to be critical since transglycosylation is efficient with oligosaccharides at least the size of cellotetraose as the donor and cellotriose as the acceptor. The reaction pH is important in driving the balance between hydrolysis and transglycosylation: hydrolysis is favored at pH values below 8, while transglycosylation becomes the major reaction at basic pH. Solving the structures of two RBcel1 variants, RBcel1_E135Q and RBcel1_Y201F, in complex with ligands has brought to light some of the molecular factors behind transglycosylation. The structure of RBcel1_E135Q in complex with cellotriose allowed a +3 subsite to be defined, in accordance with the requirement for cellotriose as a transglycosylation acceptor. The structure of RBcel1_Y201F has been obtained with several transglycosylation intermediates, providing crystallographic evidence of transglycosylation. The catalytic cleft is filled with (i) donors ranging from cellotriose to cellohexaose in the negative subsites and (ii) cellobiose and cellotriose in the positive subsites. Such a structure is particularly relevant since it is the first structure of a GH5 enzyme in complex with transglycosylation products that has been obtained with neither of the catalytic glutamate residues modified.",

The biophysical characteristics of Kv channels can be matched to the needs of different neurons by forming homotetrameric or heterotetrameric channels within one of four subfamilies. The cytoplasmic tetramerization (T1) domain plays a major role in dictating the compatibility of different Kv subunits. The only Kv subfamily lacking a representative structure of the T1 domain is the Kv2 family. Here, X-ray crystallography was used to solve the structure of the human Kv2.1 T1 domain. The structure is similar to those of other T1 domains, but surprisingly formed a pentamer instead of a tetramer. In solution the Kv2.1 T1 domain also formed a pentamer, as determined by inline SEC–MALS–SAXS and negative-stain electron microscopy. The Kv2.1 T1–T1 interface involves electrostatic interactions, including a salt bridge formed by the negative charges in a previously described CDD motif, and inter-subunit coordination of zinc. It is shown that zinc binding is important for stability. In conclusion, the Kv2.1 T1 domain behaves differently from the other Kv T1 domains, which may reflect the versatility of Kv2.1, which can assemble with the regulatory KvS subunits and scaffold ER–plasma membrane contacts.",

    "abstract": "The mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 encodes an S -adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) of archaeal origin in its genome. SAHases are essential enzymes involved in the regulation of cellular S -adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methylation reactions. They are usually active as homotetramers or, less commonly, as homodimers. A SAHase subunit is composed of two major domains: a cofactor (NAD + )-binding domain and a substrate ( S -adenosyl-L-homocysteine)-binding domain. These are connected by a hinge element that is also a coordination site for an alkali-metal cation that influences domain movement during the catalytic cycle. Typically, the highest activity and strongest substrate binding of bacterial SAHases are observed in the presence of K + ions. The SAHase from Synechocystis (SynSAHase) is an exception in this respect. Enzymatic and isothermal titration calorimetry studies demonstrated that in contrast to K + -dependent SAHases, the activity and ligand binding of SynSAHase are not affected by the presence of any particular alkali ion. Moreover, in contrast to other SAHases, the cyanobacterial enzyme is in an equilibrium of two distinct oligomeric states corresponding to its dimeric and tetrameric forms in solution. To explain these phenomena, crystal structures of SynSAHase were determined for the enzyme crystallized in the presence of adenosine (a reaction byproduct or substrate) and sodium or rubidium cations. The structural data confirm that while SynSAHase shares common structural features with other SAHases, no alkali metal is coordinated by the cyanobacterial enzyme as a result of a different organization of the macromolecular environment of the site that is normally supposed to coordinate the metal cation. This inspired the generation of SynSAHase mutants that bind alkali-metal cations analogously to K + -dependent SAHases, as confirmed by crystallographic studies. Structural comparisons of the crystal structure of SynSAHase with other experimental models of SAHases suggest a possible explanation for the occurrence of the cyanobacterial enzyme in the tetrameric state. On the other hand, the reason for the existence of SynSAHase in the dimeric state in solution remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "Modern small-angle scattering (SAS) experiments with neutrons (SANS) or X-rays (SAXS) combined with contrast variation provide comprehensive information about the structure of large multicomponent macromolecules in solution and allow the size, shape and relative arrangement of each component to be mapped out. To obtain such information, it is essential to perform well designed experiments, in which all necessary steps, from assessing sample suitability to structure modeling, are properly executed. This paper describes α-SAS, an integrative approach that is useful for effectively planning a biological contrast-variation SAS experiment. The accurate generation of expected experimental intensities using α-SAS allows the substantial acceleratation of research into the structure and function of biomacromolecules by minimizing the time and costs associated with performing a SAS experiment. The method is validated using a few basic structures with known analytical expressions for scattering intensity and using experimental SAXS data from Arabidopsis β-amylase 1 protein and SANS data from the histidine kinase–Sda complex and from human dystrophin without and with a membrane-mimicking nanodisk. Simulation of a SANS contrast-variation experiment is performed for synthetic nanobodies that effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has become an indispensable tool in structural biology, complementing atomic-resolution techniques. It is sensitive to the electron-density difference between solubilized biomacromolecules and the buffer, and provides information on molecular masses, particle dimensions and interactions, low-resolution conformations and pair distance-distribution functions. When SAXS data are recorded at multiple contrasts, i.e. at different solvent electron densities, it is possible to probe, in addition to their overall shape, the internal electron-density profile of biomacromolecular assemblies. Unfortunately, contrast-variation SAXS has been limited by the range of solvent electron densities attainable using conventional co-solutes (for example sugars, glycerol and salt) and by the fact that some biological systems are destabilized in their presence. Here, SAXS contrast data from an oligomeric protein and a protein-RNA complex are presented in the presence of iohexol and Gd-HPDO3A, two electron-rich molecules that are used in biomedical imaging and that belong to the families of iodinated and lanthanide-based complexes, respectively. Moderate concentrations of both molecules allowed solvent electron densities matching those of proteins to be attained. While iohexol yielded higher solvent electron densities (per mole), it interacted specifically with the oligomeric protein and precipitated the protein-RNA complex. Gd-HPDO3A, while less efficient (per mole), did not disrupt the structural integrity of either system, and atomic models could be compared with the SAXS data. Due to their elevated solubility and electron density, their chemical inertness, as well as the possibility of altering their physico-chemical properties, lanthanide-based complexes represent a class of molecules with promising potential for contrast-variation SAXS experiments on diverse biomacromolecular systems.",

VipF, a conserved core effector among Legionella species, is a putative acetyltransferase, but its structure and catalytic mechanism remain unknown. Here, three crystal structures of VipF in complex with its cofactor acetyl-CoA and/or a substrate are reported. The two GNAT-like domains of VipF are connected as two wings by two β-strands to form a U-shape. Both domains bind acetyl-CoA or CoA, but only in the C-terminal domain does the molecule extend to the bottom of the U-shaped groove as required for an active transferase reaction; the molecule in the N-terminal domain folds back on itself. Interestingly, when chloramphenicol, a putative substrate, binds in the pocket of the central U-shaped groove adjacent to the N-terminal domain, VipF remains in an open conformation. Moreover, mutations in the central U-shaped groove, including Glu129 and Asp251, largely impaired the acetyltransferase activity of VipF, suggesting a unique enzymatic mechanism for the Legionella effector VipF.",

Prokaryotic cells and the chloroplasts of plant cells possess the ribosome-associated chaperone trigger factor, which binds nascent polypeptides at their exit stage from the ribosomal tunnel. The structure of bacterial trigger factor has been well characterized and it has a dragon-shaped conformation, with flexible domains responsible for ribosome binding, peptidyl-prolyl cis – trans isomerization (PPIase) activity and substrate protein binding. Chloroplast trigger-factor sequences have diversified from those of their bacterial orthologs and their molecular mechanism in plant organelles has been little investigated to date. Here, the crystal structure of the plastidic trigger factor from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is presented at 2.6 Å resolution. Due to the high intramolecular flexibility of the protein, diffraction to this resolution was only achieved using a protein that lacked the N-terminal ribosome-binding domain. The eukaryotic trigger factor from C. reinhardtii exhibits a comparable dragon-shaped conformation to its bacterial counterpart. However, the C-terminal chaperone domain displays distinct charge distributions, with altered positioning of the helical arms and a specifically altered charge distribution along the surface responsible for substrate binding. While the PPIase domain shows a highly conserved structure compared with other PPIases, its rather weak activity and an unusual orientation towards the C-terminal domain points to specific adaptations of eukaryotic trigger factor for function in chloroplasts.",

This study clarifies its catalytic properties using a thorough comparison of differences in the binding of RNA and DNA in the active site of S1 nuclease based on X-ray structures, including two newly solved complexes of S1 nuclease with the products of RNA cleavage at atomic resolution. Conclusions derived from this comparison are valid for the whole S1/P1 nuclease family. For proper model building and refinement, multiple lattice-translocation defects present in the measured diffraction data needed to be solved. Two different approaches were tested and compared. Correction of the measured intensities proved to be superior to the use of the dislocation model of asymmetric units with partial occupancy of individual chains. As the crystals suffered from multiple lattice translocations, equations for their correction were derived de novo . The presented approach to the correction of multiple lattice-translocation defects may help to solve similar problems in the field of protein X-ray crystallography.",

    "abstract": "Elaiophylin (Ela), a unique 16-membered symmetric macrodiolide antibiotic, displays broad biological activity. Two rare 2-deoxy-L-fucose moieties at the ends of Ela are critical for its activity. Previously, elaiophylin glycosyltransferase (ElaGT) was identified as the enzyme that is responsible for the symmetric glycosylation of Ela, acting as a potential enzymatic tool for enhancing the diversity and activity of Ela. However, a symmetric catalytic mechanism has never been reported for a glycosyltransferase (GT). To explore the catalytic mechanism, the structure of ElaGT was determined in four forms: the apo form and Ela-bound, thymidine diphosphate-bound and uridine diphosphate-bound forms. In the Ela-bound structure, two ElaGTs form a `face-to-face' C 2-symmetric homodimer with a continuous acceptor-binding pocket, allowing a molecule of Ela to shuffle through. Interestingly, this dimer interface resembles that of the activator-dependent GT EryCIII with its activator EryCII. Sequence analysis also indicates that ElaGT belongs to the activator-dependent GT family, but no putative activator has been identified in the Ela gene cluster. It was then found that the ElaGT homodimer may utilize this `face-to-face' arrangement to stabilize the Ela-binding loops on the interface and to simultaneously allosterically regulate the catalytic center. Therefore, these structures present a novel self-activating model for symmetric sugar transfer in the GT family and a new potential regulation site for substrate specificity.",

While the assembly of the snRNP core particles has been well characterized, comparably little is known of the incorporation of snRNP-specific proteins and the mechanisms of snRNP recycling. U5 snRNP assembly in yeast requires binding of the the Aar2 protein to Prp8p as a placeholder to preclude premature assembly of the SNRNP200 helicase, but the role of the human AAR2 homolog has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, a crystal structure of human AAR2 in complex with the RNase H-like domain of the U5-specific PRPF8 (PRP8F RH) is reported, revealing a significantly different interaction between the two proteins compared with that in yeast. Based on the structure of the AAR2–PRPF8 RH complex, the importance of the interacting regions and residues was probed and AAR2 variants were designed that failed to stably bind PRPF8 in vitro . Protein-interaction studies of AAR2 with U5 proteins using size-exclusion chromatography reveal similarities and marked differences in the interaction patterns compared with yeast Aar2p and imply phosphorylation-dependent regulation of AAR2 reminiscent of that in yeast. It is found that in vitro AAR2 seems to lock PRPF8 RH in a conformation that is only compatible with the first transesterification step of the splicing reaction and blocks a conformational switch to the step 2-like, Mg 2+ -coordinated conformation that is likely during U5 snRNP biogenesis. These findings extend the picture of AAR2 PRP8 interaction from yeast to humans and indicate a function for AAR2 in the spliceosomal assembly process beyond its role as an SNRNP200 placeholder in yeast.",

They have been used as model systems to study mechanisms in protein evolution, such as duplication, recombination and domain swapping. It has been suggested that PBPs evolved from precursors half their size. Here, the crystal structures of two permuted halves of a modern ribose-binding protein (RBP) from Thermotoga maritima are reported. The overexpressed proteins are well folded and show a monomer–dimer equilibrium in solution. Their crystal structures show partially noncanonical PBP-like fold type I conformations with structural deviations from modern RBPs. One of the half variants forms a dimer via segment swapping, suggesting a high degree of malleability. The structural findings on these permuted halves support the evolutionary hypothesis that PBPs arose via a duplication event of a flavodoxin-like protein and further support a domain-swapping step that might have occurred during the evolution of the PBP-like fold, a process that is necessary to generate the characteristic motion of PBPs essential to perform their functions.",

Genetic introduction of methionine point mutations and the subsequent preparation and crystallization of selenomethionyl derivatives permits unambiguous sequence assignment by enabling the placement of the anomalous scatterers (Se atoms) thus introduced. Here, the use of this approach in the assignment of sequence in a part of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex that is responsible for clathrin binding is described. AP2 plays a pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a tightly regulated process in which cell-surface transmembrane proteins are internalized from the plasma membrane by incorporation into lipid-enclosed transport vesicles. AP2 binds cargo destined for internalization and recruits clathrin, a large trimeric protein that helps to deform the membrane to produce the transport vesicle. By selenomethionine labelling of point mutants, it was shown that the clathrin-binding site is buried within a deep cleft of the AP2 complex. A membrane-stimulated conformational change in AP2 releases the clathrin-binding site from autoinhibition, thereby linking clathrin recruitment to membrane localization.",

    "abstract": "Second harmonic generation correlation spectroscopy (SHG-CS) is demonstrated as a new approach to protein nanocrystal characterization. A novel line-scanning approach was performed to enable autocorrelation analysis without sample damage from the intense incident beam. An analytical model for autocorrelation was developed, which includes a correction for the optical scattering forces arising when focusing intense, infrared beams. SHG-CS was applied to the analysis of BaTiO 3 nanoparticles ranging from 200 to ∼500 nm and of photosystem I nanocrystals. A size distribution was recovered for each sample and compared with the size histogram measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Good agreement was observed between the two independent measurements. The intrinsic selectivity of the second-order nonlinear optical process provides SHG-CS with the ability to distinguish well ordered nanocrystals from conglomerates and amorphous aggregates. Combining the recovered distribution of particle diameters with the histogram of measured SHG intensities provides the inherent hyperpolarizability per unit volume of the SHG-active nanoparticles. Simulations suggest that the SHG activity per unit volume is likely to exhibit relatively low sensitivity to the subtle distortions within the lattice that contribute to resolution loss in X-ray diffraction, but high sensitivity to the presence of multi-domain crystals.",

However, most sPLA 2 s are not stable under process conditions. Therefore, a thermostable sPLA 2 was investigated in this study. A marine bacterial sPLA 2 isolated from Sciscionella marina ( Sm -sPLA 2 ) was catalytically active even after 5 h of incubation at high temperatures of up to 50°C, which is outstanding compared with a representative bacterial sPLA 2 ( i.e. sPLA 2 from Streptomyces violaceoruber ; Sv -sPLA 2 ). Consistent with this, the melting temperature of Sm -sPLA 2 was measured to be 7.7°C higher than that of Sv -sPLA 2 . Furthermore, Sm -sPLA 2 exhibited an improved biotransformation performance compared with Sv -sPLA 2 in the hydrolysis of soy lecithin to lysolecithin and free fatty acids at 50°C. Structural and mutagenesis studies revealed that the Trp41-mediated anchoring of a Ca 2+ -binding loop into the rest of the protein body is directly linked to the thermal stability of Sm -sPLA 2 . This finding provides a novel structural insight into the thermostability of sPLA 2 and could be applied to create mutant proteins with enhanced industrial potential.",

Serial femtosecond crystallography data collected from rhodopsin microcrystals grown in the lipidic cubic phase were used to solve the room-temperature structure of the receptor. Although the diffraction data showed high completeness and good consistency to 1.8 Å resolution, prominent electron-density features remained unaccounted for throughout the unit cell after model building and refinement. A deeper analysis of the diffraction intensities uncovered the presence of a lattice-translocation defect (LTD) within the crystals. The procedure followed to correct the diffraction intensities for this pathology enabled the building of an improved resting-state model. The correction was essential to both confidently model the structure of the unilluminated state and interpret the light-activated data collected after photo-excitation of the crystals. It is expected that similar cases of LTD will be observed in other serial crystallography experiments and that correction will be required in a variety of systems.",

Currently, the absolute value of the Bijvoet difference is widely used as an estimate of | F a | values for SAD data. Here, an equation is derived from multivariate statistics and tested that takes into account the correlation between the observed positive ( F + ) and negative ( F − ) Friedel pairs and F a along with measurement errors in the observed data. The multivariate estimation of | F a | has been implemented in a new program, Afro . Results on over 180 test cases show that Afro provides a higher correlation to the final substructure-factor amplitudes (calculated from the refined, final substructures) than the Bijvoet differences and improves the robustness of direct-methods substructure detection.",

Interestingly, the oxidation states of P 2+ clusters correspond to Fe 2 3+ Fe 6 2+ with high electron delocalization, showing the same oxidation states as the resting states of P-clusters (P N ) in nitrogenases. The previously uncertain reduction of P 2+ to P N clusters by two electrons was assigned as a double protonation of P 2+ , in which decoordination of the serine residue and the peptide chain of cysteine take place, in MoFe proteins. This is further supported by the obviously shorter α-alkoxy C—O bond (average of 1.398 Å) in P 2+ clusters and longer α-hydroxy C—O bond (average of 1.422 Å) in P N clusters, while no change is observed in the electronic structures of Fe 8 S 7 Fe atoms in P-clusters. Spatially, the calculations show that Fe3 and Fe6, the most oxidized and most reduced Fe atoms, have the shortest distances of 9.329 Å from the homocitrate in the FeMo cofactor and 14.947 Å from the [Fe 4 S 4 ] cluster, respectively, and may well function as important electron-transport sites.",

This study is focused on the elucidation of the structure–function determinants of a novel laccase-like multicopper oxidase from the thermophilic fungus Thermothelomyces thermophila ( Tt LMCO1), which is capable of oxidizing both ascorbic acid and phenolic compounds and thus is functionally categorized between the ascorbate oxidases and fungal ascomycete laccases (asco-laccases). The crystal structure of Tt LMCO1, determined using an AlphaFold 2 model due to a lack of experimentally determined structures of close homologues, revealed a three-domain laccase with two copper sites, lacking the C-terminal plug observed in other asco-laccases. Analysis of solvent tunnels highlighted the amino acids that are crucial for proton transfer into the trinuclear copper site. Docking simulations showed that the ability of Tt LMCO1 to oxidize ortho -substituted phenols stems from the movement of two polar amino acids at the hydrophilic side of the substrate-binding region, providing structural evidence for the promiscuity of this enzyme.",

Here, high-resolution crystal structures of the purine class of FDA-approved drugs (theophylline, doxophylline and acyclovir) and non-FDA-approved compounds (3-methyl-7-propylxanthine and theobromine) complexed with hBRD2 bromodomains BD1 and BD2 are reported. Remarkably, a new binding site is exhibited by stacking the compounds against the WPF shelf of BD1 and BD2. This serendipitous binding, in addition to the known acetyl-lysine binding site, sufficiently anchors the ligands in the solvent-exposed region. In addition, slight variations in the lipophilicity of these molecules significantly affected the in vitro binding affinity and selectivity towards BD1 compared with BD2. This idiosyncratic binding provides a new structural framework to link these sites for the development of next-generation inhibitors of the BET family.",

While investigating the prevalence of such cross-links, a remarkable example was discovered in Mobiluncus mulieris , a pathogen associated with bacterial vaginosis. This organism encodes a putative adhesin of 7651 residues. Crystallography and mass spectrometry of two selected domains, and AlphaFold structure prediction of the remainder of the protein, were used to show that this adhesin belongs to the family of thioester, isopeptide and ester-bond-containing proteins (TIE proteins). It has an N-terminal domain homologous to thioester adhesion domains, followed by 51 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains containing ester- or isopeptide-bond cross-links. The energetic cost to the M. mulieris bacterium in retaining such a large adhesin as a single gene or protein construct suggests a critical role in pathogenicity and/or persistence.",

Small connected subgraphs, called graphlets, provide information about the wiring of a particular atom. The multiple linear regression approach based on this information aims to predict a distribution of values of isotropic atomic displacement parameters ( B values) within a protein structure, given the atomic coordinates and molecular packing.

However, it is difficult to design small-molecule inhibitors of CENP-E kinesin motor ATPase activity owing to a lack of structural information on the CENP-E motor domain in complex with its inhibitors. Here, the CENP-E motor domain was crystallized in the presence of an ATP-competitive inhibitor and the crystal structure was determined at 1.9 Å resolution. In the determined structure, ADP was observed instead of the inhibitor in the nucleotide-binding site, even though no ADP was added during protein preparation. Structural comparison with the structures of previously reported CENP-E and those of other kinesins indicates that the determined structure is nearly identical except for several loop regions. However, the retention of ADP in the nucleotide-binding site of the structure strengthens the biochemical view that the release of ADP is a rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle of CENP-E. These results will contribute to the development of anticancer drugs targeting CENP-E and to understanding the function of kinesin motor domains.",

    "abstract": "SAD phasing can be challenging when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In such cases, having an accurate estimate of the substructure content can determine whether or not the substructure of anomalous scatterer positions can successfully be determined. Here, a likelihood-based target function is proposed to accurately estimate the strength of the anomalous scattering contribution directly from the measured intensities, determining a complex correlation parameter relating the Bijvoet mates as a function of resolution. This gives a novel measure of the intrinsic anomalous signal. The SAD likelihood target function also accounts for correlated errors in the measurement of intensities from Bijvoet mates, which can arise from the effects of radiation damage. When the anomalous signal is assumed to come primarily from a substructure comprising one anomalous scatterer with a known value of f'' and when the protein composition of the crystal is estimated correctly, the refined complex correlation parameters can be interpreted in terms of the atomic content of the primary anomalous scatterer before the substructure is known. The maximum-likelihood estimation of substructure content was tested on a curated database of 357 SAD cases with useful anomalous signal. The prior estimates of substructure content are highly correlated to the content determined by phasing calculations, with a correlation coefficient (on a log-log basis) of 0.72.",

Although the fold of the protein was virtually identical in all of the crystals, some significant differences were observed in the conformation of Arg64 of BbKI, the residue that occupies the S1 pocket in KLK4. Whereas this residue exhibited two orientations in the highest resolution structure ( P 3 1 21), making either a canonical trypsin-like interaction with Asp189 of KLK4 or an alternate interaction, only a single alternate orientation was observed in the other three structures. A neighboring disulfide, Cys191–Cys220, was partially or fully broken in all KLK4 structures. Four variants of BbKI in which Arg64 was replaced by Met, Phe, Ala and Asp were expressed and crystallized, and their structures were determined in complex with KLK4. Structures of the Phe and Met variants complexed with bovine trypsin and of the Phe variant complexed with α-chymotrypsin were also determined. Although the inhibitory potency of these variant forms of BbKI was lowered by up to four orders of magnitude, only small changes were seen in the vicinity of the mutated residues. Therefore, a totality of subtle differences in KLK4–BbKI interactions within the fully extended interface in the structures of these variants might be responsible for the observed effect. Screening of the BbKI variants against a panel of serine proteases revealed an altered pattern of inhibitory specificity, which was shifted towards that of chymotrypsin-like proteases for the hydrophobic Phe and Met P1 substitutions. This work reports the first structures of plant Kunitz inhibitors with S1-family serine proteases other than trypsin, as well as new insights into the specificity of inhibition of medically relevant kallikreins.",

These enzymes contain variable numbers of cupredoxin domains, two, three or six per subunit, and rely on four copper ions, a single type I copper and three additional copper ions organized in a trinuclear cluster (TNC), with one type II and two type III copper ions, to catalyze the reaction. Here, two crystal structures and the enzymatic characterization of Marinithermus hydrothermalis MCO, a two-domain enzyme, are reported. This enzyme decolorizes Congo Red dye at 70°C in the presence of high halide concentrations and may therefore be useful in the detoxification of industrial waste that contains dyes. In two distinct crystal structures, MhMCO forms the trimers seen in other two-domain MCOs, but differs from these enzymes in that four trimers interact to create a dodecamer. This dodecamer of MhMCO forms a closed ball-like structure and has implications for the sequestration of bound divalent metal ions as well as substrate accessibility. In each subunit of the dodecameric structures, a Trp residue, Trp351, located between the type I and TNC sites exists in two distinct conformations, consistent with a potential role in facilitating electron transfer in the enzyme.",

Once inside a human lung macrophage, it creates a niche called the Legionella -containing vacuole where it can evade phagolysosomal degradation and replicate. During infection, normal cellular functions are hijacked by proteins that are secreted by the pathogen, called bacterial effectors. Here, the structural characterization of the effector LegA15/AnkD is reported.

The CPL domain shows similarity to the CE clan in the MEROPS database, which contains ubiquitin-like hydrolases. The C-terminal segment of LegA15, including the CPL domain, shows structural similarity to another effector, LegA3/AnkH, while they share only 12% sequence identity.

    "abstract": "More than one third of proteins require metal ions to accomplish their functions, making them obligatory for the growth and survival of microorganisms in varying environmental niches. In prokaryotes, besides their involvement in various cellular and physiological processes, metal ions stimulate the uptake of citrate molecules. Citrate is a source of carbon and energy and is reported to be transported by secondary transporters. In Gram-positive bacteria, citrate molecules are transported in complex with divalent metal ions, whereas in Gram-negative bacteria they are translocated by Na+/citrate symporters. In this study, the presence of a novel divalent-metal-ion-complexed citrate-uptake system that belongs to the primary active ABC transporter superfamily is reported. For uptake, the metal-ion-complexed citrate molecules are sequestered by substrate-binding proteins (SBPs) and transferred to transmembrane domains for their transport. This study reports crystal structures of an Mg2+-citrate-binding protein (MctA) from the Gram-negative thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8 in both apo and holo forms in the resolution range 1.63-2.50 Å. Despite binding various divalent metal ions, MctA possesses the coordination geometry to bind its physiological metal ion, Mg2+. The results also suggest an extended subclassification of cluster D SBPs, which are known to bind and transport divalent-metal-ion-complexed citrate molecules. Comparative assessment of the open and closed conformations of the wild-type and mutant MctA proteins suggests a gating mechanism of ligand entry following an `asymmetric domain movement' of the N-terminal domain for substrate binding.",

    "abstract": "Neutrons have become an increasingly powerful and sophisticated tool in structural biology over the last 10-15 years.Major improvements in sources, instrumentation and sample preparation have radically changed the scope of neutron scattering approaches for studies of biological macromolecules in solutions, crystals and partially ordered systems.This is shown by a wide range of high-impact publications that are steadily uncovering novel aspects of biological structure and dynamics that are not accessible to other methods.These developments have come at a time of fundamental change in the scientific landscape, with ground-breaking developments in the use of free-electron laser (FEL) facilities throughout the world, major improvements in the resolution of cryoelectron microscopy, as well as key developments at synchrotron X-ray beam sources.In parallel with this, and at least in part motivated by a drive to maximize the benefits of strongly complementary central facilities (a number of which are co-located), there has been increasing emphasis on the use of integrated and multi-technique approaches that span resolution boundaries and add to the interpretation of results from individual methods -each of which have their own limitations.All of this is occurring while Europe is planning major upgrades to its existing steady-state neutron beam facilities in Grenoble (ILL) and Munich (FRM-II), as well as the ISIS pulsed facility on the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory site in the UK.In the USA, powerful steady-state sources exist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and at NIST in Washington, and the SNS facility at ORNL is now fully operational.The J-PARC facility in Japan is also active in the field of life sciences as is the ANSTO facility in Australia.In addition, the new ESS spallation facility is currently being built in Sweden and will be the most powerful source of its type in the world.It will occupy a central international role within a highly prominent consortium that is dedicated to the joint exploitation of neutron and X-ray science both in Scandinavia and internationally.The potential of these major developments has been highlighted at a number of recent workshops that have demonstrated the current scope of the techniques involved and helped identify future directions and needs.The Neutrons in Structural Biology (NISB) workshop (Grenoble, 2017), the NSF Workshop on Progress and Prospects in Neutron Scattering for the Biological Sciences [Alexandria, Virginia, USA, 2018 -see Ashkar et al. (2018)] and the ILL-ESS Users Meeting (Grenoble, 2018) all touched on these issues in different ways, and this is reflected in the articles of this special issue.One of the most widely used neutron approaches in the study of biological systems is small-angle neutron scattering (SANS).SANS can be deployed to study the solution structures of macromolecular systems and is conceptually rather similar to its X-ray analogue (small-angle X-ray scattering -SAXS) in that it provides low-resolution threedimensional information on molecular shape and without the need for crystallization.This type of information may be very important in the study of large macromolecules and complexes, and in carrying out parametric studies that probe the structural consequences of (for example) ligand interactions.However, in contrast to SAXS, SANS has the additional capability to exploit solvent contrast variation so that regions of a macromolecule/complex/system having different scattering length densities can be distinguished and modelled.This can be extremely powerful in establishing structure-function relationships or in the elucidation of structures when the native sample habit is problematic either for sample preparation or for analysis.Good examples of the latter category are provided by recent studies where membrane proteins have been studied in",

Michael was a towering figure in crystallography as a highly distinguished faculty member at Purdue University for 55 years. Michael made many seminal contributions to crystallography in a career that spanned the entirety of structural biology, beginning in the 1950s at Cambridge where the first protein structures were determined in the laboratories of Max Perutz (hemoglobin, 1960) and John Kendrew (myoglobin, 1958). Michael's work was central in establishing and defining the field of structural biology, which amazingly has described the structures of a vast array of complex biological molecules and assemblies in atomic detail.

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome is compacted inside the nucleus of the cell in the form called chromatin. The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which contains four types of histones (H3, H4, H2A and H2B) and approximately 150 base pairs of DNA wrapped around the histone complex. The structure of the nucleosome is highly conserved across several eukaryotic species, and molecular replacement has been the primary phasing method used to solve nucleosome structures by X-ray crystallography. However, there is currently no simple, widely applicable experimental phasing method for the nucleosome. In the present study, it is demonstrated that selenomethionine-incorporated histones H3, H2A and H2B can be reconstituted into nucleosomes and crystallized for structural determination. Unexpectedly, it was found that the nucleosome can be phased with a relatively small number of Se atoms. The structures of nucleosome core particles containing 12 and 16 Se atoms were solved by SAD phasing at 2.5 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively. The present study demonstrates a simple method for determining nucleosome structures by experimental phasing, which may be particularly useful for noncanonical structures that cannot be solved by molecular replacement.",

A small number of organisms, such as Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, have evolved to use this modified s-triazine as a food source, and the various genes required to metabolize atrazine can be found on a single plasmid. The atomic structures of seven of the eight proteins involved in the breakdown of atrazine by Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP have been determined by X-ray crystallography, but the structures of the proteins required by the cell to import atrazine for use as an energy source are still lacking. The structure of AtzT, a periplasmic binding protein that may be involved in the transport of a derivative of atrazine, 2-hydroxyatrazine, into the cell for mineralization, has now been determined. The structure was determined by SAD phasing using an ethylmercury phosphate derivative that diffracted X-rays to beyond 1.9 Å resolution. `Native' (guanine-bound) and 2-hydroxyatrazine-bound structures were also determined to high resolution (1.67 and 1.65 Å, respectively), showing that 2-hydroxyatrazine binds in a similar way to the purportedly native ligand. Structural similarities led to the belief that it may be possible to evolve AtzT from a purine-binding protein to a protein that can bind and detect atrazine in the environment.",

    "abstract": "The combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography reflects an important trend in structural biology. In a previously published study, a hybrid method for the determination of X-ray structures using initial phases provided by the corresponding parts of cryo-EM maps was presented. However, if the target structure of X-ray crystallography is not identical but homologous to the corresponding molecular model of the cryo-EM map, then the decrease in the accuracy of the starting phases makes the whole process more difficult. Here, a modified hybrid method is presented to handle such cases. The whole process includes three steps: cryo-EM map replacement, phase extension by NCS averaging and dual-space iterative model building. When the resolution gap between the cryo-EM and X-ray crystallographic data is large and the sequence identity is low, an intermediate stage of model building is necessary. Six test cases have been studied with sequence identity between the corresponding molecules in the cryo-EM and X-ray structures ranging from 34 to 52% and with sequence similarity ranging from 86 to 91%. This hybrid method consistently produced models with reasonable R work and R free values which agree well with the previously determined X-ray structures for all test cases, thus indicating the general applicability of the method for X-ray structure determination of homologues using cryo-EM maps as a starting point.",

    "abstract": "Electron cryo-microscopy image-processing workflows are typically composed of elements that may, broadly speaking, be categorized as high-throughput workloads which transition to high-performance workloads as preprocessed data are aggregated. The high-throughput elements are of particular importance in the context of live processing, where an optimal response is highly coupled to the temporal profile of the data collection. In other words, each movie should be processed as quickly as possible at the earliest opportunity. The high level of disconnected parallelization in the high-throughput problem directly allows a completely scalable solution across a distributed computer system, with the only technical obstacle being an efficient and reliable implementation. The cloud computing frameworks primarily developed for the deployment of high-availability web applications provide an environment with a number of appealing features for such high-throughput processing tasks. Here, an implementation of an early-stage processing pipeline for electron cryotomography experiments using a service-based architecture deployed on a Kubernetes cluster is discussed in order to demonstrate the benefits of this approach and how it may be extended to scenarios of considerably increased complexity.",

Bragg intensities yield the average electron density, while the diffuse scattering can be processed to obtain a three-dimensional reciprocal-space map that is further analyzed to determine correlated motion. To make diffuse scattering techniques more accessible, software for data processing called mdx 2 has been created that is both convenient to use and simple to extend and modify. mdx 2 is written in Python, and it interfaces with DIALS to implement self-contained data-reduction workflows. Data are stored in NeXus format for software interchange and convenient visualization. mdx 2 can be run on the command line or imported as a package, for instance to encapsulate a complete workflow in a Jupyter notebook for reproducible computing and education. Here, mdx 2 version 1.0 is described, a new release incorporating state-of-the-art techniques for data reduction. The implementation of a complete multi-crystal scaling and merging workflow is described, and the methods are tested using a high-redundancy data set from cubic insulin. It is shown that redundancy can be leveraged during scaling to correct systematic errors and obtain accurate and reproducible measurements of weak diffuse signals.",

    "abstract": "Over the past forty years there has been a drastic increase in fructose-related diseases, including obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Ketohexokinase (KHK), the first enzyme in the liver fructolysis pathway, catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of fructose to fructose 1-phosphate. Understanding the role of KHK in disease-related processes is crucial for the management and prevention of this growing epidemic. Molecular insight into the structure-function relationship in ligand binding and catalysis by KHK is needed for the design of therapeutic inhibitory ligands. Ketohexokinase has two isoforms: ketohexokinase A (KHK-A) is produced ubiquitously at low levels, whereas ketohexokinase C (KHK-C) is found at much higher levels, specifically in the liver, kidneys and intestines. Structures of the unliganded and liganded human isoforms KHK-A and KHK-C are known, as well as structures of unliganded and inhibitor-bound mouse KHK-C (mKHK-C), which shares 90% sequence identity with human KHK-C. Here, a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of mKHK-C refined to 1.79 Å resolution is presented. The structure was determined in a complex with both the substrate fructose and the product of catalysis, ADP, providing a view of the Michaelis-like complex of the mouse ortholog. Comparison to unliganded structures suggests that KHK undergoes a conformational change upon binding of substrates that places the enzyme in a catalytically competent form in which the β-sheet domain from one subunit rotates by 16.2°, acting as a lid for the opposing active site. Similar kinetic parameters were calculated for the mouse and human enzymes and indicate that mice may be a suitable animal model for the study of fructose-related diseases. Knowledge of the similarity between the mouse and human enzymes is important for understanding preclinical efforts towards targeting this enzyme, and this ground-state, Michaelis-like complex suggests that a conformational change plays a role in the catalytic function of KHK-C.",

A molecular exploration of its inhibitor-binding behaviours yielded promising candidates for innovative drug design. A detailed description of the enzymatic pharmacophore drove the decoration of well-established inhibitory scaffolds, thus gaining further in vitro and in vivo efficacy. In the present work, using X-ray crystallography, an atypical rearrangement was identified in the binding pose of a potent inhibitor characterized by a polar pyridine-based moiety (compound 18 ). The crystal structure shows that upon binding compound 18 the dynamics of a protein loop involved in a gating mechanism at the cofactor-binding site is modulated by the presence of three water molecules, thus fine-tuning the polarity/hydrophobicity of the binding pocket. These solvent molecules are engaged in the formation of a hydrogen-bond mesh in which one of them establishes a direct contact with the pyridine moiety of compound 18 , thus paving the way for a reappraisal of the inhibition of h DHODH. Using an integrated approach, the thermodynamics of such a modulation is described by means of isothermal titration calorimetry coupled with molecular modelling. These structural insights will guide future drug design to obtain a finer K d /logD 7.4 balance and identify membrane-permeable molecules with a drug-like profile in terms of water solubility.",

These studies also identified three additional CoA binding sites on the surface of MtTFE that are different from the active sites. It has been proposed that one of these additional sites could be of functional relevance for the substrate channeling (by surface crawling) of reaction intermediates between the three active sites. Here, 226 fragments were screened in a crystallographic fragment-binding study of MtTFE crystals, resulting in the structures of 16 MtTFE–fragment complexes. Analysis of the 121 fragment-binding events shows that the ECH active site is the `binding hotspot' for the tested fragments, with 41 binding events. The mode of binding of the fragments bound at the active sites provides additional insight into how the long-chain acyl moiety of the substrates can be accommodated at their proposed binding pockets. In addition, the 20 fragment-binding events between the active sites identify potential transient binding sites of reaction intermediates relevant to the possible channeling of substrates between these active sites. These results provide a basis for further studies to understand the functional relevance of the latter binding sites and to identify substrates for which channeling is crucial.",

    "abstract": "Several proteins from plant pathogenesis-related family 10 (PR10) are highly abundant in the latex of opium poppy and have recently been shown to play diverse and important roles in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). The recent determination of the first crystal structures of PR10-10 showed how large conformational changes in a surface loop and adjacent β-strand are coupled to the binding of BIA compounds to the central hydrophobic binding pocket. A more detailed analysis of these conformational changes is now reported to further clarify how ligand binding is coupled to the formation and cleavage of an intermolecular disulfide bond that is only sterically allowed when the BIA binding pocket is empty. To decouple ligand binding from disulfide-bond formation, each of the two highly conserved cysteine residues (Cys59 and Cys155) in PR10-10 was replaced with serine using site-directed mutagenesis. Crystal structures of the Cys59Ser mutant were determined in the presence of papaverine and in the absence of exogenous BIA compounds. A crystal structure of the Cys155Ser mutant was also determined in the absence of exogenous BIA compounds. All three of these crystal structures reveal conformations similar to that of wild-type PR10-10 with bound BIA compounds. In the absence of exogenous BIA compounds, the Cys59Ser and Cys155Ser mutants appear to bind an unidentified ligand or mixture of ligands that was presumably introduced during expression of the proteins in Escherichia coli . The analysis of conformational changes triggered by the binding of BIA compounds suggests a molecular mechanism coupling ligand binding to the disruption of an intermolecular disulfide bond. This mechanism may be involved in the regulation of biosynthetic reactions in plants and possibly other organisms.",

The first crucial step towards generating well folded proteins with a high likelihood of crystallizing is the identification of suitable truncation variants of the target protein. In some cases an optimal length variant alone is not sufficient to support crystallization and additional surface mutations need to be introduced to obtain suitable crystals. In this contribution, four case studies are presented in which rationally designed surface modifications were key to establishing crystallization conditions for the target proteins (the protein kinases Aurora-C, IRAK4 and BUB1, and the KRAS–SOS1 complex). The design process which led to well diffracting crystals is described and the crystal packing is analysed to understand retrospectively how the specific surface mutations promoted successful crystallization. The presented design approaches are routinely used in our team to support the establishment of robust crystallization systems which enable structure-guided inhibitor optimization for hit-to-lead and lead-optimization projects in pharmaceutical research.",

    "abstract": "Crystal polymorphism serves as a strategy to study the conformational flexibility of proteins. However, the relationship between protein crystal packing and protein conformation often remains elusive. In this study, two distinct crystal forms of a green fluorescent protein variant, NowGFP, are compared: a previously identified monoclinic form (space group C 2) and a newly discovered orthorhombic form (space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 ). Comparative analysis reveals that both crystal forms exhibit nearly identical linear assemblies of NowGFP molecules interconnected through similar crystal contacts. However, a notable difference lies in the stacking of these assemblies: parallel in the monoclinic form and perpendicular in the orthorhombic form. This distinct mode of stacking leads to different crystal contacts and induces structural alteration in one of the two molecules within the asymmetric unit of the orthorhombic crystal form. This new conformational state captured by orthorhombic crystal packing exhibits two unique features: a conformational shift of the β-barrel scaffold and a restriction of pH-dependent shifts of the key residue Lys61, which is crucial for the pH-dependent spectral shift of this protein. These findings demonstrate a clear connection between crystal packing and alternative conformational states of proteins, providing insights into how structural variations influence the function of fluorescent proteins.",

As a result of this, outlier reflection intensities are integrated, which is a known issue. Traditional statistical diagnostics have only limited effectiveness in identifying these outliers, here termed Not-Excluded-unMasked-Outliers (NEMOs). The diagnostic tool AUSPEX allows visual inspection of NEMOs, where they form a typical pattern: clusters at the low-resolution end of the AUSPEX plots of intensities or amplitudes versus resolution. To automate NEMO detection, a new algorithm was developed by combining data statistics with a density-based clustering method. This approach demonstrates a promising performance in detecting NEMOs in merged data sets without disrupting existing data-reduction pipelines. Re-refinement results indicate that excluding the identified NEMOs can effectively enhance the quality of subsequent structure-determination steps. This method offers a prospective automated means to assess the efficacy of a beamstop mask, as well as highlighting the potential of modern pattern-recognition techniques for automating outlier exclusion during data processing, facilitating future adaptation to evolving experimental strategies.",

The application was initially developed to meet the needs of a cryoEM facility, but its functionality and adaptability have proven to be broad enough to be extended to other data-generating centers. The expansion of EMHub is enabled by the modular nature of its core functionalities. The application allows external processes to be connected via a REST API, automating tasks such as folder creation, user and password generation, and the execution of real-time data-processing pipelines. EMhub has been used for several years at the Swedish National CryoEM Facility and has been installed in the CryoEM center at the Structural Biology Department at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. A fully automated single-particle pipeline has been implemented for on-the-fly data processing and analysis.

    "abstract": "For protein crystals in which more than two thirds of the volume is occupied by solvent, the featureless nature of the solvent region often generates a constraint that is powerful enough to allow direct phasing of X-ray diffraction data. Practical implementation relies on the use of iterative projection algorithms with good global convergence properties to solve the difficult nonconvex phase-retrieval problem. In this paper, some aspects of phase retrieval using iterative projection algorithms are systematically explored, where the diffraction data and density-value distributions in the protein and solvent regions provide the sole constraints. The analysis is based on the addition of random error to the phases of previously determined protein crystal structures, followed by evaluation of the ability to recover the correct phase set as the distance from the solution increases. The properties of the difference-map (DM), relaxed–reflect–reflect (RRR) and relaxed averaged alternating reflectors (RAAR) algorithms are compared. All of these algorithms prove to be effective for crystallographic phase retrieval, and the useful ranges of the adjustable parameter which controls their behavior are established. When these algorithms converge to the solution, the algorithm trajectory becomes stationary; however, the density function continues to fluctuate significantly around its mean position. It is shown that averaging over the algorithm trajectory in the stationary region, following convergence, improves the density estimate, with this procedure outperforming previous approaches for phase or density refinement.",

    "abstract": "The type IV pilus is a diverse molecular machine capable of conferring a variety of functions and is produced by a wide range of bacterial species. The ability of the pilus to perform host-cell adherence makes it a viable target for the development of vaccines against infection by human pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, the 1.3 Å resolution crystal structure of the N-terminally truncated type IV pilin from P. aeruginosa strain P1 (ΔP1) is reported, the first structure of its phylogenetically linked group (group I) to be discussed in the literature. The structure was solved from X-ray diffraction data that were collected 20 years ago with a molecular-replacement search model generated using AlphaFold; the effectiveness of other search models was analyzed. Examination of the high-resolution ΔP1 structure revealed a solvent network that aids in maintaining the fold of the protein. On comparing the sequence and structure of P1 with a variety of type IV pilins, it was observed that there are cases of higher structural similarities between the phylogenetic groups of P. aeruginosa than there are between the same phylogenetic group, indicating that a structural grouping of pilins may be necessary in developing antivirulence drugs and vaccines. These analyses also identified the α-β loop as the most structurally diverse domain of the pilins, which could allow it to serve a role in pilus recognition. Studies of ΔP1 in vitro polymerization demonstrate that the optimal hydrophobic catalyst for the oligomerization of the pilus from strain K122 is not conducive for pilus formation of ΔP1; a model of a three-start helical assembly using the ΔP1 structure indicates that the α-β loop and the D-loop prevent in vitro polymerization.",

    "abstract": "Twinning is a crystal-growth anomaly in which protein monomers exist in different orientations but are related in a specific way, causing diffraction reflections to overlap. Twinning imposes additional symmetry on the data, often leading to the assignment of a higher symmetry space group. Specifically, in merohedral twinning, reflections from each monomer overlap and require a twin law to model unique structural data from overlapping reflections. Neglecting twinning in the crystallographic analysis of quasi-rotationally symmetric homo-oligomeric protein structures can mask the degree of structural non-identity between monomers. In particular, any deviations from perfect symmetry will be lost if higher than appropriate symmetry is applied during crystallographic analysis. Such cases warrant choosing between the highest symmetry space group possible or determining whether the monomers have distinguishable structural asymmetries and thus require a lower symmetry space group and a twin law. Using hexagonal cocrystals of HIV-1 protease, a C 2 -symmetric homodimer whose symmetry is broken by bound ligand, it is shown that both assigning a lower symmetry space group and applying a twin law during refinement are critical to achieving a structural model that more accurately fits the electron density. By re-analyzing three recently published HIV-1 protease structures, improvements in nearly every crystallographic metric are demonstrated. Most importantly, a procedure is demonstrated where the inhibitor can be reliably modeled in a single orientation. This protocol may be applicable to many other homo-oligomers in the PDB.",

In order to further explore this and to elucidate the structural basis of its differential action on 8-oxo-NTPs and unsubstituted NTPs, the crystal structures of complexes of Ms MutT1 with 8-oxo-dGTP, GMPPNP and GMPPCP have been determined. Replacement soaking was used in order to ensure that the complexes were isomorphous to one another. Analysis of the structural data led to the elucidation of a relationship between the arrangements of molecules observed in the crystals, molecular plasticity and the action of the enzyme on nucleotides. The dominant mode of arrangement involving a head-to-tail sequence predominantly leads to the generation of NDPs. The other mode of packing arrangement appears to preferentially generate NMPs. This work also provides interesting insights into the dependence of enzyme action on the conformation of the ligand. The possibility of modulating the enzyme action through differences in intermolecular interactions and ligand conformations makes Ms MutT1 a versatile enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrate–lectin interactions are involved in important cellular recognition processes, including viral and bacterial infections, inflammation and tumor metastasis. Hence, structural studies of lectin–synthetic glycan complexes are essential for understanding lectin-recognition processes and for the further design of promising chemotherapeutics that interfere with sugar–lectin interactions. Plant lectins are excellent models for the study of the molecular-recognition process. Among them, peanut lectin (PNA) is highly relevant in the field of glycobiology because of its specificity for β-galactosides, showing high affinity towards the Thomsen–Friedenreich antigen, a well known tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen. Given this specificity, PNA is one of the most frequently used molecular probes for the recognition of tumor cell-surface O-glycans. Thus, it has been extensively used in glycobiology for inhibition studies with a variety of β-galactoside and β-lactoside ligands. Here, crystal structures of PNA are reported in complex with six novel synthetic hydrolytically stable β-N- and β-S-galactosides. These complexes disclosed key molecular-binding interactions of the different sugars with PNA at the atomic level, revealing the roles of specific water molecules in protein–ligand recognition. Furthermore, binding-affinity studies by isothermal titration calorimetry showed dissociation-constant values in the micromolar range, as well as a positive multivalency effect in terms of affinity in the case of the divalent compounds. Taken together, this work provides a qualitative structural rationale for the upcoming synthesis of optimized glycoclusters designed for the study of lectin-mediated biological processes. The understanding of the recognition of β-N- and β-S-galactosides by PNA represents a benchmark in protein–carbohydrate interactions since they are novel synthetic ligands that do not belong to the family of O-linked glycosides.",

    "abstract": "A large high-quality crystal is required to specify the positions of H atoms in neutron structural analysis. Consequently, several methods have been proposed for obtaining such large crystals, and theoretical considerations for growing them have been presented. However, further investigation is required to obtain a numerical model that can provide quantitative experimental conditions for obtaining a single large crystal. In the case of protein crystallization experiments, the amount of sample is often limited. Therefore, it is more realistic to make a rough estimation from a small number of experiments. This paper proposes a method of estimating the optimum experimental conditions for the growth of large protein crystals by performing a small number of experiments using a micro-batch method and reporting a numerical model based on nucleation theory and a linear approximation of the crystal-growth rate. Specifically, micro-batch experiments are performed to provide the empirical parameters for the model and to help to estimate the conditions for the growth of a crystal of a predetermined size using a certain sample concentration and volume. This method is offered as a step on the path towards efficiently and rationally producing large crystals that can be subjected to neutron diffraction without depending on luck or on performing many experiments. It is expected to contribute to drug design and the elucidation of protein molecular functions and mechanisms by obtaining positional information on H atoms in the protein molecule, which is an advantage of neutron diffraction.",

    "abstract": "Debio0932 is a promising lead compound in phase I clinical trials targeting the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket of the molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90 N ). The absence of a crystal structure of the Hsp90 N –Debio0932 complex, however, has impeded further structural optimization of Debio0932 and understanding of the molecular-interaction mechanism. Here, a high-resolution crystal structure of the Hsp90 N –Debio0932 complex was successfully determined (resolution limit 2.20 Å; PDB entry 6lr9) by X-ray diffraction and the molecular-interaction mechanism was analysed in detail, which suggested that Debio0932 suppresses cancer cells by accommodating itself in the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 N , disabling its molecular-chaperone capability. The results of a thermal shift assay (Δ T m = 8.83 ± 0.90°C) and isothermal titration calorimetry ( K d = 15.50 ± 1.30 n M ) indicated strong binding and favourable thermodynamic changes in the binding of Hsp90 N and Debio0932. Based on the crystal structure of the complex and on molecular-interaction analysis, 30 new Debio0932 derivatives were designed and nine new derivatives exhibited increased binding to Hsp90 N , as determined by molecular-docking evaluation. Additionally, Debio0932 suppressed cell proliferation (IC 50 values of 3.26 ± 2.82 µ M for A549, 20.33 ± 5.39 µ M for H1299 and 3.16 ± 1.04 µ M for H1975), induced cell-cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis in three non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. These results provide novel perspectives and guidance for the development of new anti-NSCLC drugs based on the lead compound Debio0932.",

Non-isomorphism becomes even more problematic in serial experiments, because it adds natural inter-crystal non-isomorphism to heavy-atom-soaking-induced non-isomorphism. Here, a method that can successfully address these issues (and indeed can benefit from differences in heavy-atom occupancy) and additionally significantly simplifies the SIR experiment is presented. A single heavy-atom soak into a microcrystalline slurry is performed, followed by automated serial data collection of partial data sets. This produces a set of data collections with a gradient of heavy-atom occupancies, which are reflected in differential merging statistics. These differences can be exploited by an optimized genetic algorithm to segregate the pool of data sets into `native' and `derivative' groups, which can then be used to successfully determine phases experimentally by SIR.",

Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzes hydrogen transfer with quantum-mechanical tunneling that involves fast motions in the active site. The structures and B factors of ternary complexes of the enzyme with NAD + and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl alcohol or NAD + and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol were determined to 1.1–1.3 Å resolution below the `glassy transition' in order to extract information about the temperature-dependent harmonic motions, which are reflected in the crystallographic B factors. The refinement statistics and structures are essentially the same for each structure at all temperatures. The B factors were corrected for a small amount of radiation decay. The overall B factors for the complexes are similar (13–16 Å 2 ) over the range 25–100 K, but increase somewhat at 150 K. Applying TLS refinement to remove the contribution of pseudo-rigid-body displacements of coenzyme binding and catalytic domains provided residual B factors of 7–10 Å 2 for the overall complexes and of 5–10 Å 2 for C4N of NAD + and the methylene carbon of the alcohols. These residual B factors have a very small dependence on temperature and include local harmonic motions and apparently contributions from other sources. Structures at 100 K show complexes that are poised for hydrogen transfer, which involves atomic displacements of ∼0.3 Å and is compatible with the motions estimated from the residual B factors and molecular-dynamics simulations. At 298 K local conformational changes are also involved in catalysis, as enzymes with substitutions of amino acids in the substrate-binding site have similar positions of NAD + and pentafluorobenzyl alcohol and similar residual B factors, but differ by tenfold in the rate constants for hydride transfer.",

    "abstract": "This issue publishes the proceedings of the 2015 CCP4 Study Weekend on Advances in Experimental Phasing, held on 8–9 January 2015 at the East Midlands Conference Centre of the University of Nottingham, UK.\r\n\r\nCrystallographic phasing using experimental approaches remains an important, and often the only successful, route for solving crystal structures, especially for structures with novel folds. These are often large and complex assemblies diffracting to limited resolution, but also those likely to provide the most novel biological insights. Our speakers were invited to cover both practical aspects, such as sample preparation and data collection strategies, and computational aspects, relating to the analysis and use of diffraction data from derivatized or anomalously scattering crystals. A session on radiation damage was included to remind experimentalists of the unavoidable side effects of using X-rays for diffraction data collection, while a final session on evolving methods provided a forum for ideas for (perhaps) solving the phase problem employing unconventional approaches.\r\n\r\nThe meeting began with a lecture by Neil Isaacs (University of Glasgow) sharing his personal view of the history of crystallographic phasing from the structure determination of zincblende, solved with the logic of constructive and destructive interference alone, via the heroic early macromolecular structure determinations by multiple isomorphous replacement, all the way to the routine exploitation of weak anomalous signals for the phasing of macromolecular crystals structures. Janet Smith (University of Michigan) then described the foundations of anomalous phasing demonstrating its current capabilities by way of a tour-de-force of phasing using raw data from many crystals.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the power of experimental phasing methods, the second session, after an introduction to the practicalities of preparing derivatized crystals by Liz Carpenter (University of Oxford), comprised three recent case studies of challenging structure determinations; cluster-compound based phasing of the multi-subunit membrane protein bestrophin-1 by Veronica Dickson (University of Cambridge); the determination of the COP9 signalosome structure by Richard Bunker (Friedrich Miescher Institute Basel); and the use of artificially introduced anomalous markers for the validation of the structure of the AP2 clathrin adapter by Bernard Kelly (University of Cambridge).\r\n\r\nThe scientific program of the first day of the Study Weekend was concluded with a session on the computational side of experimental phasing methodologies. Paula Salgado (Newcastle University) gave an overview of the different ways of exploiting dispersive and/or anomalous differences measured on one or several potentially non-isomorphous crystals. Tom Terwilliger (Los Alamos National Laboratory) introduced a new metric for assessing the potential of SAD data to lead to a successful structure solution. Randy Read (University of Cambridge) then discussed a log-likelihood-gain based framework for an improved accounting of measurement errors and uncertainties by means of a formulation in terms of diffraction intensities instead of the structure-factor amplitudes. Garib Murshudov (MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology) described how experimental phases can be used as additional observations in structure refinement. Having last been discussed at a CCP4 Study Weekend in 2009 (http://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2010/04/00/), radiation damage as a major problem in experimental phasing was highlighted in the first session of the second day. Robin Owen (Diamond Light Source) dissected the effect of radiation- and/or derivatization induced structural changes by carefully inspecting the effects on individual reflections. How radiation damage, deliberately induced by UV irradiation, can be harnessed, through optimized data collection schemes was demonstrated by Max Nanao (EMBL Grenoble). The design and the implementation of interleaved data collection protocols for the minimization of systematic errors due to radiation damage effects was described by Gerard Bricogne (Global Phasing Ltd). The use of data from multiple crystals as a means of dealing with limited life-time of individual crystals was then discussed by Gwyndaf Evans (Diamond Light Source).\r\n\r\nThe next session featured representatives from several synchrotrons advocating the modern experimental approaches available. Michele Cianci (EMBL Hamburg) showed how micro-focused low-energy X-ray beams can be used to extract optimum anomalous data from small crystals. The advantages of multi-circle goniometry in terms of increasing multiplicity and correcting for systematic errors was discussed by Andy Thompson (Synchrotron SOLEIL). Daniele de Sanctis (ESRF) described experimental options for achieving optimum data in different scenarios, while Vincent Olieric (Swiss Light Source) described generally applicable strategies for native SAD phasing exploiting anomalous signals from sulfur and or phosphorus. Finally, Armin Wagner (Diamond Light Source) described progress and first results from the new I23 in vacuum beamline at the Diamond synchrotron.\r\n\r\nThe final session of the Study Weekend concerned evolving methods. The successful use of molecular replacement for boot-strapping heavy-atom localizations in large macromolecular complexes in a parallelized computer implementation was described by Bjorn Panyella Pedersen (Aarhus University). The potential use of introducing differences in dispersive and anomalous signals by X-FEL radiation and the subsequent exploitation of these differences for phase determination was explained by Sang-Kil Son (CFEL-DESY, Hamburg). Finally, two methods of iteratively generating improved phase sets by were presented. Monarin Uervirojnangkoorn (Stanford University) employed genetic algorithms for the production of updated phase sets. Julien Jorda (UCLA) demonstrated the use of human perception for the scoring of updated electron densities with crowdsourcing software, which required audience participation.\r\n\r\nWe would like to express our gratitude to the CCP4 staff, in particular Karen McIntyre, for their invaluable help with the practical aspects of the 2015 Study Weekend. We thank all our speakers for their careful preparation and enthusiastic presentation of their talks. We hope that their papers will inspire young and seasoned crystallographers alike.",

    "abstract": "Radiation damage has been a curse of macromolecular crystallography from its early days.This problem was very acute when diffraction data used to be measured from crystals kept at ambient temperatures.The introduction of cryo-cooling techniques to some extent alleviated the severity of damaging effects incurred by protein and nucleic acid crystals because of irradiation by X-rays, but very intense currently available synchrotron sources may destroy diffracting crystals after minutes or seconds of exposure.Not only does the quality of diffraction data and structure solution processes suffer, but, more importantly, radiation damage may lead to misinterpretation of chemical and biological results and to false mechanistic conclusions.Investigations into the effect of radiation damage, and of the ways of dealing with this effect, is a hot topic of contemporary macromolecular methodology.Dedicated international workshops are regularly organized every two years as a forum for discussion of novel results, with the proceedings published in the Journal of Synchrotron Radiation (see http://journals.iucr.org/s/services/specialissues.html for a list of radiation damage special issues).The effects of radiation damage are manifested globally after absorbing doses of several tens of MGy by a decrease in the total crystal diffraction power, a change of unitcell dimensions, an increase of crystal mosaicity or eventually its cracking and disintegration.However, even after absorbing much smaller energy doses of 1-2 MGy, many specific local effects of damage can be identified within the structures of macromolecules.Those most often observed are breakage of disulfide bonds, decarboxylation of acids, reduction of metal ions and conformational changes of side chains (Ravelli & McSweeney, 2000).Certain effects severely affect SAD and MAD phasing procedures which are based on very accurate measurement of the anomalous signal from crystals preserving a high degree of isomorphism throughout the whole data measurement session.The accuracy of the anomalous signal can deteriorate significantly as a result of the cleavage of Se-C bonds in selenomethionines (Holton, 2007), Hg-S bonds in mercury derivatives (Ramagopal et al., 2005), Br-C bonds in brominated nucleic acid bases or I-C bonds iodinated tyrosine residues (Zwart et al., 2004).A significant amount of effort has been directed in the last decade to investigating the effects of radiation damage, relating these effects quantitatively to the amount of the absorbed dose or to the X-ray energy (Shimizu et al., 2007;Liebschner et al., 2015), or to finding ways to ameliorate them by the use of scavengers (Allan et al., 2013) or extrapolation of reflection intensities to zero dose (Diederichs et al., 2003).Particularly active in this field is the group at the University of Oxford headed by Elspeth Garman.In this issue of Acta Cryst.D this group and their collaborators describe an ingenious method to systematically quantify the effect of increasing absorbed dose on individual atoms of the structure and then apply it to a crystal structure containing simultaneously an uncomplexed protein and its complex with nucleic acid (Bury et al., 2016).The way they trace the effects of specific radiation damage at the individual atomic sites is simple and objective.They collected a series of ten data sets from the same crystal, each affected by increasing X-ray dose from 1.3 to 25 MGy, and calculated nine sets of difference Fourier maps, (F n À F 1 , ' 1 ) based on differences of reflection amplitudes between the first and each successive data set with phases obtained from model refinement against the first set.A per-atom density loss metric D loss was computed from changes in electron density around each individual site at each dose.All calculations were performed automatically by a pipeline using popular programs, producing objective information about the damage effect at each atom of the structure.",

    "abstract": "The inside of the front cover of this book states: 'This book is dedicated to the countless students and researchers, who wasted so much time, effort and funds, in a futile search of a solution to the protein folding problem in the wrong direction.And to all new students and researchers who, upon reading this book, will be saved from wasting time, effort and funds . . .'.The book Myths and Verities in Protein Folding Theories by Arieh Ben-Naim might well have been titled Protein Folding Myths -Why the Emperors have No Clothes since the author appears to relish the opportunity to associate his criticisms of protein folding theories specifically with the investigators that published on the subject.In Chapter 1, the Introduction, the belief is laid out that one cannot expect to predict the structure, let alone the dynamics and mechanism of the folding process, by reading the sequence of a protein.The author argues that the hydrophobic effect is ill defined and cannot explain the stability or kinetic problem of protein folding.However, he states that the hydrophilic effect can do both.He outlines that there are five myths associated with the protein folding problem (PFP), and these myths are the reason why the PFP is still considered to be one of the most challenging unsolved problems in molecular biologyand why searches for solutions to the PFP are going in the wrong direction.The entropy, enthalpy and heat capacity change associated with (de)solvation of a nonpolar solute in water is discussed in detail in Chapter 2 (From Frank and Evans' Iceberg Formation Conjecture to the Explanation of the Hydrophobic Effect).A logical argument is given whereby nonpolar solute interactions are not likely to introduce novel (ice-like) structure to water solvent; rather, nonpolar solute interactions are only able to shift the equilibrium of pre-existing water structure.This argument is supported by diagrams and relevant equations.The figures, however, are inconsistent in the structural interpretations necessary to support the idea presented.Specifically, initial figures represent water in stick representation (one oxygen, two hydrogens) and the overall dipole.This is used to indicate how water will arrange around charged ions -correctly indicating orientation of the water dipole, and thus, the basis of entropic changes in solvent upon solvation of ions.Subsequent to this is a discussion of similar solvation of a non-polar solute (argon atoms).However, in this case, the diagram is less rigorous showing unsatisfied donors/acceptors pointing towards the solute.Subsequent figures show water as tetrahedral but with no distinction between hydrogen and oxygen lone pairs.These latter figures are used to illustrate low local density of solvent (associated with an organized lattice structure), but such figures are ambiguous as regards donor/ acceptor interactions.The discussion of Chapter 1 entirely omits any consideration of solvent structure to limit unsatisfied donor/acceptor groups orienting towards solute (an energetically costly organization when solvating nonpolar solute -and a potential basis of increased structure in water).The heat capacity of ice is significantly less than that of liquid water.Yet when nonpolar groups are solvated the heat capacity increases.Thus, an 'iceberg' definition of solvent structure forming around nonpolar solutes cannot be taken literally -it is a reference to an organized clathrate of water that minimizes destabilizing effects of unsatisfied hydrogen-bond groups.The author, as an expert in solvent structure, is clearly perturbed by the use of this metaphor; or rather, the broad lack of recognition as a metaphor.Rather, we are admonished to consider that whatever the solvent structure is around nonpolar solutes it is a pre-existing structure of solvent whose mole fraction increases.Furthermore, we are to accept that solvation of polar/ionic solutes can",

The merits of the proposed strategy for DoF enhancement were assessed in applications of second-harmonic generation imaging of protein crystals. It was found that DoF extension increased the number of crystals detected while simultaneously reducing the number of ` z -slices' required for screening. Experimental measurements of the wavelength-dependence of the extended DoF were in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results provide a simple and broadly applicable approach to increase the throughput of existing nonlinear optical imaging methods for protein crystal screening.",

    "abstract": "Two commensurately modulated structures (PDB entries 4n3e and 6sjj) were solved using translational noncrystallographic symmetry (tNCS). The data required the use of large supercells, sevenfold and ninefold, respectively, to properly index the reflections. Commensurately modulated structures can be challenging to solve. Molecular-replacement software such as Phaser can detect tNCS and either handle it automatically or, for more challenging situations, allow the user to enter a tNCS vector, which the software then uses to place the components. Although this approach has been successful in solving these types of challenging structures, it does not make it easy to understand the underlying modulation in the structure or how these two structures are related. An alternate view of this problem is that the atoms and associated parameters are following periodic atomic modulation functions (AMFs) in higher dimensional space, and what is being observed in these supercells are the points where these higher dimensional AMFs intersect physical 3D space. In this case, the two 3D structures, with a sevenfold and a ninefold superstructure, seem to be quite different. However, describing those structures within the higher dimensional superspace approach makes a strong case that they are closely related, as they show very similar AMFs and can be described with one unique (3+1)D structure, i.e. they are two different 3D intersections of the same (3+1)D structure.",

ROs are classified into five subclasses (IA, IB, IIA, IIB and III) based on their number of constituents and the nature of their redox centres. In this study, two types of crystal structure (type I and type II) were resolved of the class III CARDO-R from Janthinobacterium sp. J3 (CARDO-R J3 ). Superimposition of the type I and type II structures revealed the absence of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) in the type II structure along with significant conformational changes to the FAD-binding domain and the C-terminus, including movements to fill the space in which FAD had been located. Docking simulation of NADH into the FAD-bound form of CARDO-R J3 suggested that shifts of the residues at the C-terminus caused the nicotinamide moiety to approach the N5 atom of FAD, which might facilitate electron transfer between the redox centres. Differences in domain arrangement were found compared with RO reductases from the ferredoxin–NADP reductase family, suggesting that these differences correspond to differences in the structures of their redox partners ferredoxin and terminal oxygenase. The results of docking simulations with the redox partner class III CARDO-F from Pseudomonas resinovorans CA10 suggested that complex formation suitable for efficient electron transfer is stabilized by electrostatic attraction and complementary shapes of the interacting regions.",

The 1,2-positions of the β-bulge are also the 3,4-positions of the β-turn, with the result that the N-terminal portion of the polypeptide chain is orientated at right angles to the β-sheet. Here, it is reported that the β-link is frequently found in certain protein folds of the SCOPe structural classification at specific locations where it connects a β-sheet to another area of a protein. It is found at locations where it connects one β-sheet to another in the β-sandwich and related structures, and in small (four-, five- or six-stranded) β-barrels, where it connects two β-strands through the polypeptide chain that crosses an open end of the barrel. It is not found in larger (eight-stranded or more) β-barrels that are straightforward β-meanders. In some cases it initiates a connection between a single β-sheet and an α-helix. The β-link also provides a framework for catalysis in serine proteases, where the catalytic serine is part of a conserved β-link, and in cysteine proteases, including M pro of human SARS-CoV-2, in which two residues of the active site are located in a conserved β-link.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a flagellated protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease, which represents a serious health problem in the Americas. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are key enzymes that are implicated in cellular energy management. TcNDPK1 is the canonical isoform in the T. cruzi parasite. TcNDPK1 has a cytosolic, perinuclear and nuclear distribution. It is also found in non-membrane-bound filaments adjacent to the nucleus. In the present work, X-ray diffraction and in vivo studies of TcNDPK1 are described. The structure reveals a novel, multi-hexameric, left-handed helical oligomer structure. The results of directed mutagenesis studies led to the conclusion that the microscopic TcNDPK1 granules observed in vivo in T. cruzi parasites are made up by the association of TcNDPK1 oligomers. In the absence of experimental data, analysis of the interactions in the X-ray structure of the TcNDPK1 oligomer suggests the probable assembly and disassembly steps: dimerization, assembly of the hexamer as a trimer of dimers, hexamer association to generate the left-handed helical oligomer structure and finally oligomer association in a parallel manner to form the microscopic TcNDPK1 filaments that are observed in vivo in T. cruzi parasites. Oligomer disassembly takes place on the binding of substrate in the active site of TcNDPK1, leading to dissociation of the hexamers. This study constitutes the first report of such a protein arrangement, which has never previously been seen for any protein or NDPK. Further studies are needed to determine its physiological role. However, it may suggest a paradigm for protein storage reflecting the complex mechanism of action of TcNDPK1.",

    "abstract": "Nitroxide radicals are characterized by a long-lived spin-unpaired electronic ground state and are strongly sensitive to their chemical surroundings. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, these electronic features have led to the widespread application of nitroxide derivatives as spin labels for use in studying protein structure and dynamics. Site-directed spin labelling requires the incorporation of nitroxides into the protein structure, leading to a new protein–ligand molecular model. However, in protein crystallographic refinement nitroxides are highly unusual molecules with an atypical chemical composition. Because macromolecular crystallography is almost entirely agnostic to chemical radicals, their structural information is generally less accurate or even erroneous. In this work, proteins that contain an example of a radical compound (Chemical Component Dictionary ID MTN) from the nitroxide family were re-refined by defining its ideal structural parameters based on quantum-chemical calculations. The refinement results show that this procedure improves the MTN ligand geometries, while at the same time retaining higher agreement with experimental data.",

    "abstract": "β-Galactosidases catalyse the hydrolysis of lactose into galactose and glucose; as an alternative reaction, some β-galactosidases also catalyse the formation of galactooligosaccharides by transglycosylation. Both reactions have industrial importance: lactose hydrolysis is used to produce lactose-free milk, while galactooligosaccharides have been shown to act as prebiotics. For some multi-domain β-galactosidases, the hydrolysis/transglycosylation ratio can be modified by the truncation of carbohydrate-binding modules. Here, an analysis of BbgIII, a multidomain β-galactosidase from Bifidobacterium bifidum, is presented. The X-ray structure has been determined of an intact protein corresponding to a gene construct of eight domains. The use of evolutionary covariance-based predictions made sequence docking in low-resolution areas of the model spectacularly easy, confirming the relevance of this rapidly developing deep-learning-based technique for model building. The structure revealed two alternative orientations of the CBM32 carbohydrate-binding module relative to the GH2 catalytic domain in the six crystallographically independent chains. In one orientation the CBM32 domain covers the entrance to the active site of the enzyme, while in the other orientation the active site is open, suggesting a possible mechanism for switching between the two activities of the enzyme, namely lactose hydrolysis and transgalactosylation. The location of the carbohydrate-binding site of the CBM32 domain on the opposite site of the module to where it comes into contact with the catalytic GH2 domain is consistent with its involvement in adherence to host cells. The role of the CBM32 domain in switching between hydrolysis and transglycosylation modes offers protein-engineering opportunities for selective β-galactosidase modification for industrial purposes in the future.",

    "abstract": "This year we celebrate 30 years of Acta Crystallographica Section D, and so have a milestone at which to reflect on its history and future trajectory.A comprehensive and detailed account of the development of the IUCr Journals can be found in the 2005 article by Andre ´Authier (Authier, 2009).Since Acta D was launched in 1993 (when there were fewer than 1000 entries in the PDB), approximately 16 600 different authors have submitted over 8100 articles, approximately 6650 articles have been published and the PDB has passed 200 000 entries.In the last year alone, authors from 33 different countries published in the journal, the top five being the USA, the UK, Germany, France and China.Over 40 Acta D special issues have been published, most notably those arising from all the CCP4 January Study Weekends since 1998.To speed up the production of special issues we now publish the articles as they are ready and collect them together as a virtual online issue.Since 2017 Acta D has also published the proceedings of the CCP-EM Spring Symposium, reflecting its expanding remit in structural biology.Other special issues have included the proceedings of a number of International Conferences on the Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules, and on subjects ranging from structural proteomics to neutrons in biology to diffraction data deposition.We continue to publish special issues on all areas of structural biology.In addition, Acta D publishes guidelines for experimental data reporting which ensure that structural biologists continue to produce high quality, reproducible scientific results for the wider benefit of the community.The impact factor of Acta D has fluctuated over the years (Fig. 1), reaching the heady heights of 14.1 in 2012, and is currently 7.65 (2022 value).The top 10 most cited papers are listed in Table 1, highlighting the importance of communicating new methods in structural biology.We asked all the previous Section Editors of Acta D if they would like to comment on the 30th Anniversary, and were delighted to hear back from them all.The first was Jenny Glusker, who steered the journal for ten years from 1993 to 2002 and who has kindly sent us this comment:'It was a great honour for me to be the Editor of the new section of Acta Crystallographica.The number of articles of large crystal structures had been increasing and Acta D helped the crystallographic community to present beautiful diagrams of macromolecules and, most important of all, three-dimensional descriptions of active sites and possibly the actual mode of action of many macromolecules.Also newly crystallized macromolecules were described.Authors were most helpful and it was generally a pleasure to interact with them.I thank them for submitting their articles and listening to my comments.We are moving forward in our understanding of the many biochemical processes in our living bodies and articles in Acta D will surely benefit us all.'In 2003 Ted Baker and Zbyszek Dauter took over as Section Editors, and served until 2014 and 2015, respectively.Ted remarks:'Having no previous experience of editorship, I was delighted to take on this task, and share it with my very good friend Zbyszek Dauter.It was an exciting time, sometimes quite challenging.The number of protein structures solved began to accelerate rapidly, as did the use of automated aids for structure solution.Papers became more varied, both in terms of novel structures and in new methods; exciting for us and (I hope) of great value to the community.We also had to place quality and increasingly rigorous validation at the forefront, as less experienced structural biologists began to enter the field.Close links with the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) were mutually beneficial in this regard,",

    "abstract": "The conversion of hits to leads in drug discovery involves the elaboration of chemical core structures to increase their potency. In fragment-based drug discovery, low-molecular-weight compounds are tested for protein binding and are subsequently modified, with the tacit assumption that the binding mode of the original hit will be conserved among the derivatives. However, deviations from binding mode conservation are rather frequently observed, but potential causes of these alterations remain incompletely understood. Here, two crystal forms of the spliceosomal RNA helicase BRR2 were employed as a test case to explore the consequences of conformational changes in the target protein on the binding behaviour of fragment derivatives. The initial fragment, sulfaguanidine, bound at the interface between the two helicase cassettes of BRR2 in one crystal form. Second-generation compounds devised by structure-guided docking were probed for their binding to BRR2 in a second crystal form, in which the original fragment-binding site was altered due to a conformational change. While some of the second-generation compounds retained binding to parts of the original site, others changed to different binding pockets of the protein. A structural bioinformatics analysis revealed that the fragment-binding sites correspond to predicted binding hot spots, which strongly depend on the protein conformation. This case study offers an example of extensive binding-mode changes during hit derivatization, which are likely to occur as a consequence of multiple binding hot spots, some of which are sensitive to the flexibility of the protein.",

Here, a neural network trained to identify unfavourable fragments and remove them from the model-building process in order to improve backbone tracing is presented. Moreover, a decision tree was trained to select an optimal threshold to eliminate unfavourable fragments. The neural network was tested on experimental phasing data sets from the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG), recently deposited experimental phasing data sets (from 2015 to 2021) and molecular-replacement data sets. The experimental results show that using the neural network in the Buccaneer protein-model-building software can produce significantly more complete protein models than those built using Buccaneer alone. In particular, Buccaneer with the neural network built protein models with a completeness that was at least 5% higher for 25% and 50% of the original and truncated resolution JCSG experimental phasing data sets, respectively, for 28% of the recently collected experimental phasing data sets and for 43% of the molecular-replacement data sets.",

This activity underpins the ability of this organism to respire using arsenite present in contaminated environments. The crystal structure of the AioAB/cyt c 552 electron transfer complex reveals two A 2 B 2 /(cyt c 552 ) 2 assemblies per asymmetric unit. Three of the four cyt c 552 molecules in the asymmetric unit dock to AioAB in a cleft at the interface between the AioA and AioB subunits, with an edge-to-edge distance of 7.5 Å between the heme of cyt c 552 and the [2Fe–2S] Rieske cluster in the AioB subunit. The interface between the AioAB and cyt c 552 proteins features electrostatic and nonpolar interactions and is stabilized by two salt bridges. A modest number of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and relatively small, buried surface areas between protein partners are typical features of transient electron transfer complexes. Interestingly, the fourth cyt c 552 molecule is positioned differently between two AioAB heterodimers, with distances between its heme and the AioAB redox active cofactors that are outside the acceptable range for fast electron transfer. This unique cyt c 552 molecule appears to be positioned to facilitate crystal packing rather than reflecting a functional complex.",

    "abstract": "Reverse gyrase is the only topoisomerase that introduces positive supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. Positive DNA supercoiling becomes possible through the functional cooperation of the N-terminal helicase domain of reverse gyrase with its C-terminal type IA topoisomerase domain. This cooperation is mediated by a reverse-gyrase-specific insertion into the helicase domain termed the `latch'. The latch consists of a globular domain inserted at the top of a β-bulge loop that connects this globular part to the helicase domain. While the globular domain shows little conservation in sequence and length and is dispensable for DNA supercoiling, the β-bulge loop is required for supercoiling activity. It has previously been shown that the β-bulge loop constitutes a minimal latch that couples ATP-dependent processes in the helicase domain to DNA processing by the topoisomerase domain. Here, the crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima reverse gyrase with such a β-bulge loop as a minimal latch is reported. It is shown that the β-bulge loop supports ATP-dependent DNA supercoiling of reverse gyrase without engaging in specific interactions with the topoisomerase domain. When only a small latch or no latch is present, a helix in the nearby helicase domain of T. maritima reverse gyrase partially unfolds. Comparison of the sequences and predicted structures of latch regions in other reverse gyrases shows that neither sequence nor structure are decisive factors for latch functionality; instead, the decisive factors are likely to be electrostatics and plain steric bulk.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria such as Aeromonas and Yersinia spp. have developed mechanisms to inhibit the immune defense of their host. Effector proteins are directly injected into the host cytoplasm from the bacterial cytosol via type III secretion systems (T3SSs), where they modulate the cytoskeleton and signaling of the cell. Assembly of, and secretion via, T3SSs is tightly regulated by a number of bacterial proteins, including SctX (AscX in Aeromonas), the secretion of which is essential for T3SS function. Here, crystal structures of AscX in complex with SctY chaperones from Yersinia or Photorhabdus spp. carrying homologous T3SSs are described. There are crystal pathologies in all cases, with one crystal form diffracting anisotropically and the other two exhibiting strong pseudotranslation. The new structures reveal that the positioning of the substrate is very similar on different chaperones. However, the two C-terminal SctX helices that cap the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat of SctY shift and tilt depending on the identity of the chaperone. Moreover, the C-terminus of the α3 helix of AscX exhibits an unprecedented kink in two of the structures. In previous structures, the C-terminus of SctX protrudes beyond the chaperone as a straight helix: a conformation that is required for binding to the nonameric export gate SctV but that is unfavorable for binary SctX-SctY complexes due to the hydrophobicity of helix α3 of SctX. A kink in helix α3 may allow the chaperone to shield the hydrophobic C-terminus of SctX in solution.",

Mutations in SOD1 lead to an unstable structure and aggregation that perturbs the balance of reactive oxygen species in cells. Oxidation damage to the solvent-exposed Trp32 also causes aggregation of SOD1. Here, the FDA-approved antipsychotic drug paliperidone is identified to interact with Trp32 of SOD1 by structure-based pharmacophore mapping and crystallographic studies. Paliperidone is used for the treatment of schizophrenia. The crystal structure of the complex with SOD1, refined to 2.1 Å resolution, revealed that the ligand binds to the SOD1 β-barrel in the β-strand 2 and 3 regions, which are known to scaffold SOD1 fibrillation. The drug also makes substantial π–π interaction with Trp32. Microscale thermophoresis studies confirm significant binding affinity of the compound, suggesting that the ligand can inhibit or prevent tryptophan oxidation. Thus, the antipsychotic drug paliperidone or a derivative may avert SOD1 aggregation and can be used as a lead for ALS drug development.",

    "abstract": "The spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 is the major target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. Antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S have high potency in preventing viral infection. The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2, especially mutations occurring in the RBD of new variants, has severely challenged the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. Here, a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) designated E77 is reported which engages the prototype RBD with high affinity and potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. However, the capability of E77 to bind RBDs vanishes upon encountering variants of concern (VOCs) which carry the N501Y mutation, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Omicron, in contrast to its performance with the Delta variant. To explain the discrepancy, cryo-electron microscopy was used to analyze the structure of an RBD–E77 Fab complex, which reveals that the binding site of E77 on RBD belongs to the RBD-1 epitope, which largely overlaps with the binding site of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Both the heavy chain and the light chain of E77 interact extensively with RBD and contribute to the strong binding of RBD. E77 employs CDRL1 to engage Asn501 of RBD and the Asn-to-Tyr mutation could generate steric hindrance, abolishing the binding. In sum, the data provide the landscape for an in-depth understanding of immune escape of VOCs and rational antibody engineering against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Septins are membrane-associated, GTP-binding proteins that are present in most eukaryotes. They polymerize to play important roles as scaffolds and/or diffusion barriers as part of the cytoskeleton. α-Helical coiled-coil domains are believed to contribute to septin assembly, and those observed in both human SEPT6 and SEPT8 form antiparallel homodimers. These are not compatible with their parallel heterodimeric organization expected from the current model for protofilament assembly, but they could explain the interfilament cross-bridges observed by microscopy. Here, the first structure of a heterodimeric septin coiled coil is presented, that between SEPT14 and SEPT7; the former is a SEPT6/SEPT8 homolog. This new structure is parallel, with two long helices that are axially shifted by a full helical turn with reference to their sequence alignment. The structure also has unusual knobs-into-holes packing of side chains. Both standard seven-residue (heptad) and the less common 11-residue (hendecad) repeats are present, creating two distinct regions with opposite supercoiling, which gives rise to an overall straight coiled coil. Part of the hendecad region is required for heterodimerization and therefore may be crucial for selective septin recognition. These unconventional sequences and structural features produce a metastable heterocomplex that nonetheless has enough specificity to promote correct protofilament assembly. For instance, the lack of supercoiling may facilitate unzipping and transitioning to the antiparallel homodimeric state.",

Atomic-level knowledge of both the inner organization and supramolecular complexation of HLDs is thus crucial to understand their catalytic and noncatalytic functions. Here, crystallographic structures of the ( S )-enantioselective haloalkane dehalogenase DmmarA from the waterborne pathogenic microbe Mycobacterium marinum were determined at 1.6 and 1.85 Å resolution. The structures show a canonical αβα-sandwich HLD fold with several unusual structural features. Mechanistically, the atypical composition of the proton-relay catalytic triad (aspartate–histidine–aspartate) and uncommon active-site pocket reveal the molecular specificities of a catalytic apparatus that exhibits a rare ( S )-enantiopreference. Additionally, the structures reveal a previously unobserved mode of symmetric homodimerization, which is predominantly mediated through unusual L5-to-L5 loop interactions. This homodimeric association in solution is confirmed experimentally by data obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering. Utilizing the newly determined structures of DmmarA, molecular modelling techniques were employed to elucidate the underlying mechanism behind its uncommon enantioselectivity. The ( S )-preference can be attributed to the presence of a distinct binding pocket and variance in the activation barrier for nucleophilic substitution.",

    "abstract": "A bacterial phosphotriesterase was employed as an experimental paradigm to examine the effects of multiple factors, such as the molecular constructs, the ligands used during protein expression and purification, the crystallization conditions and the space group, on the visualization of molecular complexes of ligands with a target enzyme. In this case, the ligands used were organophosphates that are fragments of the nerve agents and insecticides on which the enzyme acts as a bioscavenger. 12 crystal structures of various phosphotriesterase constructs obtained by directed evolution were analyzed, with resolutions of up to 1.38 Å. Both apo forms and holo forms, complexed with the organophosphate ligands, were studied. Crystals obtained from three different crystallization conditions, crystallized in four space groups, with and without N-terminal tags, were utilized to investigate the impact of these factors on visualizing the organophosphate complexes of the enzyme. The study revealed that the tags used for protein expression can lodge in the active site and hinder ligand binding. Furthermore, the space group in which the protein crystallizes can significantly impact the visualization of bound ligands. It was also observed that the crystallization precipitants can compete with, and even preclude, ligand binding, leading to false positives or to the incorrect identification of lead drug candidates. One of the co-crystallization conditions enabled the definition of the spaces that accommodate the substituents attached to the P atom of several products of organophosphate substrates after detachment of the leaving group. The crystal structures of the complexes of phosphotriesterase with the organophosphate products reveal similar short interaction distances of the two partially charged O atoms of the P—O bonds with the exposed β-Zn 2+ ion and the buried α-Zn 2+ ion. This suggests that both Zn 2+ ions have a role in stabilizing the transition state for substrate hydrolysis. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the challenges and considerations involved in studying the crystal structures of ligand–protein complexes, highlighting the importance of careful experimental design and rigorous data analysis in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the resulting phosphotriesterase–organophosphate structures.",

    "abstract": "Structural characterization of the recognition of ubiquitin (Ub) by deubiquitinases (DUBs) has largely relied on covalent complexation of the DUB through its catalytic cysteine with a Ub C-terminal electrophile. The Ub electrophiles are accessed through intein chemistry in conjunction with chemical synthesis. Here, it was asked whether DUB–Ub covalent complexes could instead be accessed by simpler disulfide chemistry using a Ub cysteine mutant in which the last glycine has been replaced with a cysteine. The Ub cysteine mutant displayed a wide variability in disulfide formation across a panel of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DUBs, with some showing no detectable reaction while others robustly produced a disulfide complex. Using this approach, two disulfide-linked ubiquitin-bound complexes were crystallized, one involving the Legionella pneumophila effector SdeA DUB and the other involving the Orientia effector OtDUB. These DUBs had previously been crystallized in Ub-bound forms using the C-terminal electrophile strategy and noncovalent complexation, respectively. While the disulfide-linked SdeA DUB–Ub complex crystallized as expected, in the OtDUB complex the disulfide bond to the Ub mutant involved a cysteine that differed from the catalytic cysteine. Disulfide formation with the SdeA DUB catalytic cysteine was accompanied by local distortion of the helix carrying the active-site cysteine, whereas OtDUB reacted with the Ub mutant using a surface-exposed cysteine.",

    "abstract": "to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) neutron user facilities, the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), on 7-10 August 2016.The original purpose of this series of symposia was to bring together structural biology researchers using X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction techniques, and to facilitate interactions between academic and industrial research.Over the years the scope of the series has grown to include a wide variety of additional techniques used to study biological structure and dynamics including various microscopies, spectroscopies and computational methods.In some respects, the motivation for the ISDSB series anticipates the recent growth in integrative structural biology approaches.The evolution of the programme of the symposia has reflected the broader range of complementary techniques becoming available, the constant need for improved communication and collaboration across disciplines, and the growing recognition that more advanced mathematical and computational techniques are needed to integrate experimental data from a growing number of different experimental techniques as they are applied to address increasingly complex biological problems and emerging challenges.At ISDSB 2016, the discoveries in structural biology using X-ray, neutron and electron diffraction, and complementary techniques such as small-angle scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron microscopy and advanced computational approaches were reported.A total of 89 participants, with many young scientists and PhD students, from five countries took part.The speakers included four plenary lecturers (Jack Johnson, Michael Crowley, Peter Moody and Greg Hura), 31 invited session speakers and 30 poster presentations.Scientific session topics included Bioenergy, Drug Design, Enzyme Mechanism and Allostery, Macromolecular Complexes, Membranes and Membrane Proteins, New Instruments and Methods, and Sources and Facilities.A dinner seminar was held on prospects for biology at the SNS Second Target Station (STS), which represents a next-generation neutron scattering user facility that will provide new capabilities for structural biology.A new feature of this ISDSB was two preceding one-day satellite workshops focused on introductory tutorials.The construction of MaNDi and IMAGINE neutron protein crystallography beamlines at ORNL provide new opportunities for neutron macromolecular crystallography to become a more accessible structural tool for enzymology and structural biology for understanding enzyme mechanisms and ligand binding.In the Computational Tools for Neutron Protein Crystallography workshop, organized by Leighton Coates, current and future neutron macromolecular crystallography users were introduced to the new beamlines, and provided lectures and practical instruction on neutron structure refinement using PHENIX.In the Small Angle Neutron Scattering workshop, organized by Shuo Qian, a combination of lectures and tutorials was used to introduce basic techniques and related computational tools to integrate molecular simulations with small-angle scattering data.Both workshops were well attended and highly appreciated, especially by early career scientists.",

    "abstract": "This monograph on biomolecular small-angle scattering is divided into four parts: a brief introduction that provides an overview of the technique and what can be learned from its application to biological systems, followed by a treatment of the underlying theory, then practical aspects and finally applications.The text is well written and easy to read, with each chapter concluding with a helpful summary.Overall, the book provides a description of biomolecular small-angle scattering and its applications that complements other texts and, when used in combination with established quality reference texts that are well referenced in this new contribution, would be useful for both the novice and expert scatterer.The introductory chapter is succinct and sets the tone for the rest of the book.For the theory chapters that follow, a stated goal was to provide an 'intuitive heuristic approach' to scattering theory rather than a 'rigorously formal' one.This challenging goal is one in which the authors have been successful, particularly in Chapter 2 covering Theoretical Background.For the reader learning about the technique for the first time, the text here is generally more understandable and accessible compared with more formal, typically physics-oriented texts.For the expert reader, some of the descriptions provide useful ways to explain phenomena in a teaching context.The explanations are particularly 'crystallographer friendly', often starting with formalisms that are commonly used in crystallography.This approach is useful in that a significant portion of the growth in biological small-angle scattering comes from practicing crystallographers.In this regard, the discussion of resolution in the context of solution scattering is excellent and important given the general confusion around resolution for solution scattering.There is also an excellent discussion of the limitations of ab initio shape modelling.A small criticism is that the problem of uniqueness of three-dimensional structural modelling based on solution scattering data comes up for the first time in the middle of Chapter 2; this would have ideally been addressed earlier in the introductory Chapter 1, given that this issue is central to having a balanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of biomolecular solution scattering.Chapter 3 moves on to a useful and comprehensive description of the quantities that can be derived from scattering data.Here the authors begin reverting to descriptions in terms of the scattering from electrons, where it would have been of value to write in more general terms of the scattering of X-rays or neutrons by atoms, given that the authors' intention was to consider both SAXS and SANS.The absence of any definitions of units makes the book of limited value as a practical guide by itself, although the references in Part 3 can make up for this omission.It is pertinent to note here also that there are a few errors in the first printing, most notably in equations 3.3 and 3.4 deriving molecular weight from the intensity at the origin: Avogadro's number should be in the denominator in equation 3.3 and in the numerator for equation 3.4.The authors are working with the publisher to correct these equations and other typographical errors in the second printing and in the electronic edition.An erratum for the first printing will be available.While Chapter 4 is titled Shape Reconstruction, it is actually a more comprehensive discussion of three-dimensional modelling methods, including atomistic rigid-body and ensemble modelling, and it appropriately balances the strengths and limitations of different modelling approaches.The authors describe the 'method of choice' for comparing model fits in terms of 2 , which is the traditional measure.However, the most",

    "abstract": "Processing X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) diffraction images poses challenges, as an XFEL pulse is powerful enough to destroy or damage the diffracting volume and thereby yields only one diffraction image per volume. Moreover, the crystal is stationary during the femtosecond pulse, so reflections are generally only partially recorded. Therefore, each XFEL diffraction image must be scaled individually and, ideally, corrected for partiality prior to merging. An additional complication may arise owing to indexing ambiguities when the symmetry of the Bravais lattice is higher than that of the space group, or when the unit-cell dimensions are similar to each other. Here, an automated method is presented that diagnoses these indexing ambiguities based on the Brehm–Diederichs algorithm [Brehm &amp; Diederichs (2014), Acta Cryst. D 70 , 101–109] and produces a consistent indexing choice for the large majority of diffraction images. This method was applied to an XFEL diffraction data set measured from crystals of the neuronal SNARE–complexin-1–synaptotagmin-1 complex. After correcting the indexing ambiguities, substantial improvements were observed in the merging statistics and the atomic model refinement R values. This method should be a useful addition to the arsenal of tools for the processing of XFEL diffraction data sets.",

    "abstract": "Current software tools for the automated building of models for macromolecular X-ray crystal structures are capable of assembling high-quality models for ordered macromolecule and small-molecule scattering components with minimal or no user supervision. Many of these tools also incorporate robust functionality for modelling the ordered water molecules that are found in nearly all macromolecular crystal structures. However, no current tools focus on differentiating these ubiquitous water molecules from other frequently occurring multi-atom solvent species, such as sulfate, or the automated building of models for such species. PeakProbe has been developed specifically to address the need for such a tool. PeakProbe predicts likely solvent models for a given point (termed a `peak') in a structure based on analysis (`probing') of its local electron density and chemical environment. PeakProbe maps a total of 19 resolution-dependent features associated with electron density and two associated with the local chemical environment to a two-dimensional score space that is independent of resolution. Peaks are classified based on the relative frequencies with which four different classes of solvent (including water) are observed within a given region of this score space as determined by large-scale sampling of solvent models in the Protein Data Bank. Designed to classify peaks generated from difference density maxima, PeakProbe also incorporates functionality for identifying peaks associated with model errors or clusters of peaks likely to correspond to multi-atom solvent, and for the validation of existing solvent models using solvent-omit electron-density maps. When tasked with classifying peaks into one of four distinct solvent classes, PeakProbe achieves greater than 99% accuracy for both peaks derived directly from the atomic coordinates of existing solvent models and those based on difference density maxima. While the program is still under development, a fully functional version is publicly available. PeakProbe makes extensive use of cctbx libraries, and requires a PHENIX licence and an up-to-date phenix.python environment for execution.",

    "abstract": "Ab initio reconstruction methods have revolutionized the capabilities of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), allowing the data-driven discovery of previously unknown molecular conformations, exploiting optimization heuristics and assumptions behind the composition of globular molecules. While these methods have been successful for the analysis of small particles, their impact on fibrillar assemblies has been more limited. The micrometre-range size of these assemblies and the complex interaction of their periodicities in their scattering profiles indicate that the discovery of fibril structures from SAXS measurements requires novel approaches beyond extending existing tools for molecular discovery. In this work, it is proposed to use SAXS measurements, together with diffraction theory, to infer the electron distribution of the average cross-section of a fiber. This cross-section is modeled as a discrete electron density with continuous support, allowing representations beyond binary distributions. Additional constraints, such as non-negativity or smoothness/connectedness, can also be added to the framework. The proposed approach is tested using simulated SAXS data from amyloid β fibril models and using measured data of Tobacco mosaic virus from SAXS experiments, recovering the geometry and density of the cross-sections in all cases. The approach is further tested by analyzing SAXS data from different amyloid β fibril assemblies, with results that are in agreement with previously proposed models from cryo-EM measurements. The limitations of the proposed method, together with an analysis of the robustness of the method and the combination with different experimental sources, are also discussed.",

This method has the same effect as the conventional NCS-averaging method but does not include the process of Fourier synthesis to generate the electron density from amplitudes and the corresponding phases. It has great merit for the solution of structures with limited data that are either twinned or incomplete at low resolution.

    "abstract": "Image-processing software has always been an integral part of structure determination by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Recent advances in hardware and software are recognized as one of the key factors in the so-called cryo-EM resolution revolution. Increasing computational power has opened many possibilities to consider more demanding algorithms, which in turn allow more complex biological problems to be tackled. Moreover, data processing has become more accessible to many experimental groups, with computations that used to last for many days at supercomputing facilities now being performed in hours on personal workstations. All of these advances, together with the rapid expansion of the community, continue to pose challenges and new demands on the software-development side. In this article, the development of emcore and emvis, two basic software libraries for image manipulation and data visualization in cryo-EM, is presented. The main goal is to provide basic functionality organized in modular components that other developers can reuse to implement new algorithms or build graphical applications. An additional aim is to showcase the importance of following established practices in software engineering, with the hope that this could be a first step towards a more standardized way of developing and distributing software in the field.",

    "abstract": "The N-terminal region of the stomatin operon partner protein (STOPP) PH1510 (1510-N) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii is a serine protease with a catalytic Ser–Lys dyad (Ser97 and Lys138) and specifically cleaves the C-terminal hydrophobic region of the p-stomatin PH1511. In a form of human hemolytic anemia known as hereditary stomatocytosis, stomatin is deficient in the erythrocyte membrane owing to mis-trafficking. Stomatin is thought to act as an oligomeric scaffolding protein to support cell membranes. The cleavage of stomatin by STOPP might be involved in a regulatory system. Several crystal structures of 1510-N have previously been determined: the wild type, the K138A mutant and its complex with a substrate peptide. Here, the crystal structure of the S97A mutant of 1510-N (1510-N S97A) was determined at 2.25 Å resolution. The structure contained two 1510-N S97A molecules in the asymmetric unit. On the superposition of one monomer of the 1510-N S97A and wild-type dimers, the S97A C α atom of the other monomer of 1510-N S97A deviated by 23 Å from that of the wild type. This result indicates that 1510-N can greatly change the form of its dimer. Because of crystallographic symmetry in space group P 6 5 , a sixfold helical structure is constructed using the 1510-N dimer as a basic unit. This helical structure may be common to STOPP structures.",

    "abstract": "Small DNA-binding proteins that target desired sequences have the potential to act as a scaffold for molecular tools such as genome editing. In this study, an engrailed homeodomain (EHD) was chosen and it was evaluated whether it could be used as a molecular module that can connect to itself to recognize a longer target sequence. It was previously shown that two EHDs connected by a linker (EHD 2 ) recognize a target sequence twice as long as that recognized by a single EHD in cells only when Arg53 in each EHD in the tandem protein is mutated to alanine {(EHD[R53A]) 2 }. To investigate the recognition mechanism of (EHD[R53A]) 2 , the crystal structure of the (EHD[R53A]) 2 –DNA complex was determined at 1.6 Å resolution. The individual EHDs were found to adopt the typical homeodomain fold. Most importantly, the base-specific interactions in the major groove necessary for the affinity/specificity of wild-type EHD were preserved in (EHD[R53A]) 2 . Bacterial assays confirmed that the base-specific interactions are retained under cellular conditions. These observations indicate that the R53A mutation only causes a loss of the arginine–phosphate interaction at the protein–DNA interface, which reduces the DNA-binding affinity compared with the wild type. It is therefore concluded that (EHD[R53A]) 2 precisely recognizes tandem target sites within cells, enabling the individual EHDs to concurrently bind to the target sites with modest binding affinity. This suggests that modulation of the binding activity of each EHD is vital to construct a protein array that can precisely recognize a sequence with multiple target sites.",

    "abstract": "The role and importance of mentors is a cultural theme that runs through all fields of science.Some years ago, I had the privilege of reviewing a set of three volumes containing the collected works of Dorothy Hodgkin, one of our greatest and most influential crystallographers.Those volumes were published through the Indian Academy of Sciences.A generation later, it is an honour to also review the autobiographical memoirs of Professor Mamannamana Vijayan (known to all simply as Vijayan).As a young and idealistic PhD student determined to make a career in crystallography, Vijayan met Dorothy in India and was delighted to be able to later join her research group in Oxford.There he embraced the excitement of this pivotal time in the development of macromolecular crystallography, and the warmth and sense of family that characterized Dorothy's insulin group.And it is these qualities that shine through this book.Now retired, Vijayan has written a fascinating account of his life in science, during which he has played a crucial role in the development of macromolecular crystallography in India, while simultaneously making extraordinarily broad contributions to Indian science in general.This is a book that illuminates not only a fascinating era of crystallographic history but also the rich cultural and scientific diversity of India, seen from the standpoint of an outstanding and internationally engaged Indian scientist.The book begins, appropriately, in Kerala where Vijayan was born into a politically engaged family at a time of optimism for change in a country newly emerging from colonial rule.His roots in Kerala have remained a touchstone throughout his life, bringing a strong commitment to equality and fairness, and a desire that national development should benefit all.These themes reappear throughout subsequent chapters, and have informed all the national roles he has taken.He describes his entry into crystallography, as a physics student at Allahabad University, as the sort of revelation that many readers of this book will have experienced themselves -myself included.There follow a series of chapters that form the crystallographic heart of this memoir.His PhD studies in a nascent crystallography group at the Indian Institute of Science -as the oldest student, he was in charge of the laboratoryenabled him to meet many visiting scientists.Crucially, a meeting with Dorothy Hodgkin in 1967 led him to work with her in Oxford a year later.There follows a fascinating account of his transformative experience over the next three years: the bleak cold of arrival in an English winter, contrasted with the warmth of relationships with Dorothy and the close-knit insulin group that included Guy and Eleanor Dodson, Tom Blundell and myself; new cultural experiences; the excitement of the insulin structure solution; presentations at international conferences and meetings with long-admired figures such as Max Perutz; and Dorothy's personal intervention to enable his fiance ´e Kalyani to travel to Oxford to marry him there.The social ferment of the late 1960s also directed his progressive instincts towards a lifelong commitment to India.A postscript to this time in Oxford came five years later, when a need for specialist medical intervention to enable the safe birth of Vijayan and Kalyani's daughter Devi led Dorothy to bring them both back to Oxford for a further year's visit.Very much the human touch to science.Chapters 6 and 7 describe Vijayan's efforts to establish macromolecular crystallography in Bangalore.As was common in the 1970s, there were many who doubted",

Wild-type TTR amyloids accumulate in the heart in senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). ATTR amyloidosis occurs at a much younger age than SSA, and the affected individuals carry a TTR mutant. The naturally occurring amyloidogenic Y116S TTR variant forms more amyloid fibrils than wild-type TTR. Thus, the Y116S mutation reduces the stability of the TTR structure. A neutron diffraction experiment on Y116S TTR was performed to elucidate the mechanism of the changes in structural stability between Y116S variant and wild-type TTR through structural comparison. Large crystals of the Y116S variant were grown under optimal crystallization conditions, and a single 2.4 mm 3 crystal was ultimately obtained. This crystal was subjected to time-of-flight (TOF) neutron diffraction using the IBARAKI biological crystal diffractometer (iBIX) at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex, Tokai, Japan (J-PARC). A full data set for neutron structure analysis was obtained in 14 days at an operational accelerator power of 500 kW. A new integration method was developed and showed improved data statistics; the new method was applied to the reduction of the TOF diffraction data from the Y116S variant. Data reduction was completed and the integrated intensities of the Bragg reflections were obtained at 1.9 Å resolution for structure refinement. Moreover, X-ray diffraction data at 1.4 Å resolution were obtained for joint neutron–X-ray refinement.",

    "abstract": "The early part of the 20th century was a highly exciting scientific period in many respects, one of these being that it gave birth to a new science, structural biology.This field has continued to have a great impact on biology in general since methods were developed to see the atomic arrangements of the molecules of life, nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.A recent book describes these developments from the valuable and closeup perspective of Sir John Meurig Thomas.It is an excellent book for all interested in the history of science.The book deals with how it all began with the discovery in 1912 by Max von Laue, in Munich, that crystals diffracted X-rays.This provided not only the understanding that X-rays were electromagnetic radiation of short wavelength but also that crystals were well organized objects.This led father and son William Henry and William Lawrence Bragg, in Leeds and Cambridge, to realise that such experiments could lead to the structure of crystals.In the same year the son, William Laurence Bragg (WLB), had already determined the structure of some alkali halides and other simple compounds.It was obvious that the method could be further developed to determine the structures of more complex structures.The field took a great leap when John Desmond Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot (later Hodgkin) took the first diffraction pictures of a protein crystal (pepsin).Max Perutz then began studies in Cambridge with the aim to determine the structure of haemoglobin.A strong supporter of this development was WLB, who by now was Professor of the Cavendish Laboratory.Since it seemed strange to perform biological work in a physics laboratory, he made a shed in the parking lot available to Perutz and his growing number of co-workers.The work in the shed, or the 'hut', was transferred to the newly created Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Biology (LMB) at the end of the 1960s.Parallel to the work on developing methods to determine the structures of proteins and nucleic acids, Perutz, WLB, Francis Crick and John Kendrew (the latter two being Perutz's graduate students), tried to generate models of the structure of proteins.Early work was also done by Maurice L. Huggins.Crystal structures of amino acids and basic information from the X-ray diffraction patterns of proteins provided constraints.The Cambridge workers were beaten to discovering the correct structures by Pauling, Corey and Branson at Caltech, who had not only realised that the peptide group is planar but also that the helical structure did not need to have an integer number of residues in each turn.They proposed both the -helix and -structures.In addition to Francis Crick's contributions to the protein work, he and Jim Watson focused on the structure of DNA, the genetic material of all organisms.However, the book only gives limited insight into this exciting field as the focus of the book is on proteins.Thus, the breakthrough on the structures of myoglobin in 1959 and haemoglobin in 1965 by Kendrew, Perutz and their co-workers are well covered.Here the observations of -helices could be enjoyed in multiple examples.Parts of the physiological insights from the structural results are also discussed.The next step in the arena of proteins was the first structure of an enzyme, lysozyme, in 1965.This was owing to David Phillips and his co-workers working at the Davy-Faraday Research Laboratory at the Royal Institution in London directed by WLB.Here, not only was the first -structure observed but also the binding of substrates led to",

    "abstract": "Choline- O -sulfatase (COSe; EC 3.1.6.6) is a member of the alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily, and its natural function is to hydrolyze choline- O -sulfate into choline and sulfate. Despite its natural function, the major interest in this enzyme resides in the landmark catalytic/substrate promiscuity of sulfatases, which has led to attention in the biotechnological field due to their potential in protein engineering. In this work, an in-depth structural analysis of wild-type Sinorhizobium ( Ensifer ) meliloti COSe (SmeCOSe) and its C54S active-site mutant is reported. The binding mode of this AP superfamily member to both products of the reaction (sulfate and choline) and to a substrate-like compound are shown for the first time. The structures further confirm the importance of the C-terminal extension of the enzyme in becoming part of the active site and participating in enzyme activity through dynamic intra-subunit and inter-subunit hydrogen bonds (Asn146 A –Asp500 B –Asn498 B ). These residues act as the `gatekeeper' responsible for the open/closed conformations of the enzyme, in addition to assisting in ligand binding through the rearrangement of Leu499 (with a movement of approximately 5 Å). Trp129 and His145 clamp the quaternary ammonium moiety of choline and also connect the catalytic cleft to the C-terminus of an adjacent protomer. The structural information reported here contrasts with the proposed role of conformational dynamics in promoting the enzymatic catalytic proficiency of an enzyme.",

Although the crystallization conditions contained the final 148 C-terminal residues of SAS1B, the Fab was observed to crystallize in complex with a 15-residue fragment corresponding to one of only two elements of secondary structure that are predicted to be ordered within the C-terminal region of SAS1B. The antigen forms an amphipathic α-helix that binds the 7H2.2 combining site via hydrophilic residues in an epitope that spans the length of the antigen α-helix, with only two CH–π interactions observed along the edge of the interface between the antibody and antigen. Interestingly, the paratope contains two residues mutated away from the germline (YL32F and YH58R), as well as a ProH96-ThrH97-AspH98-AspH99 insertion within heavy chain CDR3.

The SAS1B–antibody structure provides the first structural insight into any portion of the subdomain architecture of the C-terminal region of the novel cancer-oocyte tumor surface neoantigen SAS1B and provides a basis for the targeted use of SAS1B.",

However, because of the enormous scale of this superfamily, only a small percentage of the proteins belonging to the superfamily have been annotated structurally or functionally to date. Therefore, much remains unknown about the MBL superfamily proteins. Here, TW9814, a hypothetical MBL superfamily protein, was structurally and functionally investigated. Guided by the crystal structure of dimeric TW9814, it was demonstrated that TW9814 functions as a phosphodiesterase (PDE) in the presence of divalent metal ions such as manganese(II) or nickel(II). A docking model between TW9814 and the substrate bis( p -nitrophenyl)phosphate (bpNPP) showed the importance of the dimerization of TW9814 for its bpNPP-hydrolyzing activity and for the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate. TW9814 showed outstanding catalytic efficiency ( k cat / K m ) under alkaline conditions compared with other PDEs. The activity of TW9814 appears to be regulated through a disulfide bond, which is a feature that is not present in other MBL superfamily members. This study provides a platform for the functional characterization of other hypothetical proteins of the MBL or other superfamilies.",

    "abstract": "Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which belongs to the aromatic amino-acid hydroxylase family, is involved in protein synthesis and pyomelanine production through the hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine. In this study, the crystal structure of PAH from Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 ( Bc PAH) with an additional 280 amino acids in the C-terminal region was determined. The structure of Bc PAH consists of three distinct domains: a core domain with two additional inserted α-helices and two novel auxiliary domains: Bc PAH-AD1 and Bc PAH-AD2. Structural homologues of Bc PAH-AD1 and Bc PAH-AD2 are known to be involved in mRNA regulation and protein–protein interactions, and thus it was speculated that Bc PAH might utilize the auxiliary domains for interaction with its partner proteins. Furthermore, phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the three-domain PAHs, including Bc PAH, are completely distinctive from both conventional prokaryotic PAHs and eukaryotic PAHs. Finally, biochemical studies of Bc PAH showed that Bc PAH-AD1 might be important for the structural integrity of the enzyme and that Bc PAH-AD2 is related to enzyme stability and/or activity. Investigations into the intracellular functions of the two auxiliary domains and the relationship between these functions and the activity of PAH are required.",

Kinetic studies indicate that the pyruvate analog (S)-2-bromopropionate inactivates the enzyme in a pseudo-first-order process. An initial velocity pattern indicates that (S)-2-bromopropionate is a competitive inhibitor versus pyruvate, with an inhibition constant of about 8 mM. Crystals of DHDPS complexed with (S)-2-bromopropionate formed in a solution consisting of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 18% polyethylene glycol 3350, 8 mM spermidine, 0.2 M sodium tartrate and 5.0 mg ml-1 DHDPS. The crystals diffracted to 2.15 Å resolution and belonged to space group P1. The crystal structure confirms the displacement of bromine and the formation of a covalent attachment between propionate and Lys161 at the active site of the enzyme. Lys161 is the active-site nucleophile that attacks the carbonyl C atom of pyruvate and subsequently generates an imine adduct in the first half-reaction of the ping-pong enzymatic reaction. A comparison of the crystal structures of DHDPS complexed with pyruvate or (S)-2-bromopropionate indicates the covalent adduct formed from (S)-2-bromopropionate leads to a rotation of about 180° of the β-δ C atoms of Lys61 that aligns the covalently bound propionate fairly closely with the imine adduct formed with pyruvate.",

Given the structures of the subunits, it is possible to predict plausible complex models via computational methods such as molecular docking. Assessing the quality of the predicted models is crucial to obtain correct complex structures. Here, an energy-scoring function was developed based on the interfacial residues of structures in the Protein Data Bank. The statistically derived energy function ( Nepre ) imitates the neighborhood preferences of amino acids, including the types and relative positions of neighboring residues. Based on the preference statistics, a program iNepre was implemented and its performance was evaluated with several benchmarking decoy data sets. The results show that iNepre scores are powerful in model ranking to select the best protein complex structures.",

KBP is an α-solenoid, tetratricopeptide-repeat protein that interacts with the microtubule-binding region of the kinesin motor domain and blocks microtubule attachment. Numerous challenges arose relating to the behavior of KBP and KBP–kinesin complexes during cryo-EM sample preparation. These included the partial denaturation of KBP by air–water interfaces, protein aggregation resulting from carbon interaction and preferential orientation. Sample preparation with a graphene oxide substrate enabled the eventual structure determination.

    "abstract": "The plant-specific class XI myosins (MyoXIs) play key roles at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels, engaging diverse adaptor proteins to transport cargoes along actin filaments. To recognize their cargoes, MyoXIs have a C-terminal globular tail domain (GTD) that is evolutionarily related to those of class V myosins (MyoVs) from animals and fungi. Despite recent advances in understanding the functional roles played by MyoXI in plants, the structure of its GTD, and therefore the molecular determinants for cargo selectivity and recognition, remain elusive. In this study, the first crystal structure of a MyoXI GTD, that of MyoXI-K from Arabidopsis thaliana , was elucidated at 2.35 Å resolution using a low-identity and fragment-based phasing approach in ARCIMBOLDO_SHREDDER . The results reveal that both the composition and the length of the α5–α6 loop are distinctive features of MyoXI-K, providing evidence for a structural stabilizing role for this loop, which is otherwise carried out by a molecular zipper in MyoV GTDs. The crystal structure also shows that most of the characterized cargo-binding sites in MyoVs are not conserved in plant MyoXIs, pointing to plant-specific cargo-recognition mechanisms. Notably, the main elements involved in the self-regulation mechanism of MyoVs are conserved in plant MyoXIs, indicating this to be an ancient ancestral trait.",

    "abstract": "Statistical likelihood maximization is currently one of the main tools in computational procedures in biological crystallography. In these procedures, the likelihood function is calculated, as a rule, within the framework of a diagonal Gaussian approximation (DGA) of the joint probability distribution of the real and imaginary parts of a set of structure factors. This approximation assumes pairwise uncorrelated values of various structure-factor components. In this paper, exact formulas are derived for pairwise correlations of structure factors, and conditions under which these correlations can be considered to be negligible are discussed. It is shown that in the case where the probability distribution of the atomic coordinates is related to the region of the molecule or its domains, the correlation of the structure factors of reflections s and w is determined mostly by the magnitudes of the Fourier transform of the probability distribution calculated at the points 2s, 2w, s - w and s + w. However, in the case where the probability distribution describes small corrections to the coordinates of the existing preliminary atomic model, the correlation is determined by the values of the structure factors of the preliminary model that correspond to the 2s, 2w, s - w and s + w reflections rather than by the Fourier transform of the probability distribution. Test cases demonstrate that the practice of using the DGA for calculation of the likelihood when based on sets containing neighbouring reflections may be unjustified in some crystallographic applications, especially in single-particle studies.",

    "abstract": "Structure-determination methods are needed to resolve the atomic details that underlie protein function. X-ray crystallography has provided most of our knowledge of protein structure, but is constrained by the need for large, well ordered crystals and the loss of phase information. The rapidly developing methods of serial femtosecond crystallography, micro-electron diffraction and single-particle reconstruction circumvent the first of these limitations by enabling data collection from nanocrystals or purified proteins. However, the first two methods also suffer from the phase problem, while many proteins fall below the molecular-weight threshold required for single-particle reconstruction. Cryo-electron tomography of protein nanocrystals has the potential to overcome these obstacles of mainstream structure-determination methods. Here, a data-processing scheme is presented that combines routines from X-ray crystallography and new algorithms that have been developed to solve structures from tomograms of nanocrystals. This pipeline handles image-processing challenges specific to tomographic sampling of periodic specimens and is validated using simulated crystals. The tolerance of this workflow to the effects of radiation damage is also assessed. The simulations indicate a trade-off between a wider tilt range to facilitate merging data from multiple tomograms and a smaller tilt increment to improve phase accuracy. Since phase errors, but not merging errors, can be overcome with additional data sets, these results recommend distributing the dose over a wide angular range rather than using a finer sampling interval to solve the protein structure.",

However, the complete legacy of Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) as a pioneer Egyptologist and premier mathematician and physicist of his time, and the implications of his work in other scientific fields, is less well known. Significantly, his theoretical and experimental work on phenomena related to the transmission of heat founded the mathematical study of irreversible phenomena and introduced the flow of time in physico-chemical processes and geology, with its implications for biological evolution. Fourier's insights are discussed in contrast to the prevalent notion of reversible dynamic time in the early 20th century, which was dominated by Albert Einstein's (1875-1953) theory of general relativity versus the philosophical notion of durée proposed by the French philosopher Henri-Louis Bergson (1859-1941). The current status of the mathematical description of irreversible processes by Ilya Romanovich Prigogine (1917-2003) is briefly discussed as part of the enduring legacy of the pioneering work of J.-B.

The adenylation (AdD) domain at the N-terminus consists of subdomains 1a and 1b, where subdomain 1a is unique to LigA. Small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray diffraction studies were used to probe changes in the relative spatial dispositions of the two subdomains during the adenylation reaction. Structural analyses of the inter-subdomain interactions of the AdD domain suggest that salt bridges formed by Glu22, Glu26 and Glu87 of subdomain 1a with Arg144, Arg315 and His240 of subdomain 1b play an important role in stabilizing the intermediate conformations of the two subdomains. E22A, E26A and E87A mutations reduce the in vitro activity by 89%, 64% and 39%, respectively, on a nicked DNA substrate, while they show no activity loss on a pre-adenylated DNA substrate, thus suggesting that the salt bridges are important in the initial steps of the ligation reaction. Furthermore, the E22A, E26A and E87A mutants exhibited extremely delayed growth in complementation assays involving the Escherichia coli GR501 strain, which harbours its own temperature-sensitive LigA. The H236A and H236Y mutants, which involve the residue that stacks against the adenine moiety of AMP, severely impact the activity and the ability to complement the growth-defective E. coli GR501 strain.

PSK, an 84-amino-acid AMP recently isolated from Chrysomya megacephala larvae, probably belongs to the mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor family according to its sequence. No member of this family from an insect has been structurally characterized to date. In this study, the crystal structure of full-length PSK determined by molecular replacement using an ab initio modeled ensemble as a search model and a solution structure obtained from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements are reported. The crystal structure reveals a distinct fold compared with those of homologous peptides, in that PSK comprises two antiparallel α-helices rather than a single long helix, which is in good agreement with the SAXS-based ab initio model. However, the peptide exists as a monomer in solution, even though a stable dimer was observed in the crystal structure. This apparent contradiction may reflect different oligomerization states that may be implicated in its bioactivity. The data presented here have established a solid basis for further mechanistic studies of this novel insect AMP.",

    "abstract": "Most small-molecule drugs fulfill their function in cells, but studying direct compoundtarget interactions in a cellular environment is challenging.Nevertheless, this is crucial information guiding drug development where drug engagement at the desired site of action and potential off-target binding and activity need to be assessed as early as possible.Rather than intracellular binding affinities, available approaches rely on activity-based cellular assays, and provide a downstream and indirect impact of the respective compounds on target activity.In 2006, several seminal publications proposed a first solution towards this problem by demonstrating that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used to study proteins in living cells (Selenko et al., 2006;Serber et al., 2006).Since then, 'in-cell NMR' has been successfully applied to study proteins, their (post-translational) modifications and interactions (reviewed in Luchinat & Banci, 2017;Selenko & Wagner, 2007;Pastore & Temussi, 2017;Siegal & Selenko, 2019).More recently, several groups have shown that in-cell NMR can be used to study interactions of proteins with small-molecule compounds in living cells (DeMott et al., 2018;Luchinat et al., 2020).However, whether intracellular compound-target interactions can be determined quantitatively in terms of binding affinities has remained unknown.In this issue of Acta Cryst.D, Luchinat et al. report that NMR spectroscopy can provide intracellular binding affinities in the nanomolar range provided that a reference compound with a known dissociation constant (K d ) is available (Luchinat et al., 2021).Using the well studied human carbonic anhydrase II as a model system, Luchinat et al. assessed the binding and competition of a set of four small-molecule inhibitors with known binding affinities in vitro and in living cells.To this end, the authors expressed [ 15 N]-His-labeled carbonic anhydrase II in HEK293 T cells and followed changes in chemical shifts of 1 H, 15 N cross-peaks by NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1).This has the advantage that NMR signals specific for carbonic anhydrase II can be observed even in a complex cellular background.The authors carried out competition experiments either from a series of independent cell samples or from a single real-time NMR bioreactor run.Excitingly, Luchinat et al. found that the intracellular affinities were similar to those obtained in vitro.Whereas it still remains to be shown whether this approach can be applied to other target proteins, these findings promise that in-cell NMR can provide a new route to the determination of intracellular ligand-binding affinities for other target proteins in the future.In principle, this approach should be applicable to all target proteins provided that (i) they can be expressed or introduced in cells isotopically labeled at sufficient concentrations (>10 mM); (ii) there is a lack of binding to other cellular components which would cause extensive broadening of NMR signals; (iii) there is sufficient protein stability; (iv) there are well separated NMR signals in the cellular background; (v) sufficient chemical shift differences are induced by ligand-binding and (iv) there is strong ligand binding.Moreover, the NMR-based approach is not limited to proteins, but could be extended to other biomolecules such as nucleotides and other isotope labeling schemes.The real-time NMR bioreactor setup described promises to be well suited to obtain comprehensive and time-resolved datasets for cellular compound uptake and, at the same time, intracellular compound-target interactions.Remarkably, samples of HEK293 T cells could be kept viable and metabolically active for up to 60 h as shown in this study.An additional and great advantage of this setup is that concentrations of reference and test ligands can be changed easily, and the response of the intracellular compound",

    "abstract": "The YxaL protein was isolated from the soil bacterium Bacillus velezensis and has been shown to promote the root growth of symbiotic plants. YxaL has further been suggested to act as an exogenous signaling protein to induce the growth and branching of plant roots. Amino acid sequence analysis predicted YxaL to exhibit an eight-bladed β-propeller fold stabilized by six tryptophan-docking motifs and two modified motifs. Protein engineering to improve its structural stability is needed to increase the utility of YxaL as a plant growth-promoting factor. Here, the crystal structure of YxaL from B. velezensis was determined at 1.8 Å resolution to explore its structural features for structure-based protein engineering. The structure showed the typical eight-bladed β-propeller fold with structural variations in the third and fourth blades, which may decrease the stability of the β-propeller fold. Engineered proteins targeting the modified motifs were subsequently created. Crystal structures of the engineered YxaL proteins showed that the typical tryptophan-docking interaction was restored in the third and fourth blades, with increased structural stability, resulting in improved root growth-promoting activity in Arabidopsis seeds. The work is an example of structure-based protein engineering to improve the structural stability of β-propellor fold proteins.",

    "abstract": "The cell-death-inducing DFF45-like effector (CIDE) domain is a protein-interaction module comprising ∼80 amino acids and was initially identified in several apoptotic nucleases and their regulators. CIDE-domain-containing proteins were subsequently identified among proteins involved in lipid metabolism. Given the involvement of CIDE-domain-containing proteins in cell death and lipid homeostasis, their structure and function have been intensively studied. Here, the head-to-tail helical filament structure of the CIDE domain of DNA fragmentation factor-related protein 3 (DREP3) is presented. The helical filament structure was formed by opposing positively and negatively charged interfaces of the domain and was assembled depending on protein and salt concentrations. Although conserved filament structures are observed in CIDE family members, the structure elucidated in this study and its comparison with previous structures indicated that the size and the number of molecules used in one turn vary. These findings suggest that this charged-surface-based head-to-tail helical filament structure represents a unified mechanism of CIDE-domain assembly and provides insight into the function of various forms of the filament structure of the CIDE domain in higher-order assembly for apoptotic DNA fragmentation and control of lipid-droplet size.",
