    "abstract": "The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains the points. This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of “thick” facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.",

The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB™, Mathematica™, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.",

Common and notable features of these codes include inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.",

The algorithm is essentially an iterative random search procedure with adaptive moves along the coordinate directions. It permits uphill moves under the control of a probabilistic criterion, thus tending to avoid the first local minima encountered. The algorithm has been tested against the Nelder and Mead simplex method and against a version of Adaptive Random Search. The test functions were Rosenbrock valleys and multiminima functions in 2,4, and 10 dimensions. The new method proved to be more reliable than the others, being always able to find the optimum, or at least a point very close to it. It is quite costly in term of function evaluations, but its cost can be predicted in advance, depending only slightly on the starting point.",

It allows one to compute curves of equilibria, limit points, Hopf points, limit cycles, period doubling bifurcation points of limit cycles, and fold bifurcation points of limit cycles. All curves are computed by the same function that implements a prediction-correction continuation algorithm based on the Moore-Penrose matrix pseudo-inverse. The continuation of bifurcation points of equilibria and limit cycles is based on bordering methods and minimally extended systems. Hence no additional unknowns such as singular vectors and eigenvectors are used and no artificial sparsity in the systems is created. The sparsity of the discretized systems for the computation of limit cycles and their bifurcation points is exploited by using the standard Matlab sparse matrix methods. The MATLAB environment makes the standard MATLAB Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) Suite interactively available and provides computational and visualization tools; it also eliminates the compilation stage and so makes installation straightforward. Compared to other packages such as AUTO and CONTENT, adding a new type of curves is easy in the MATLAB environment. We illustrate this by a detailed description of the limit point curve type.",

An adaptive mesh refinement method is implemented that determines the number of mesh intervals and the degree of the approximating polynomial within each mesh interval to achieve a specified accuracy. The software can be interfaced with either quasi-Newton (first derivative) or Newton (second derivative) NLP solvers, and all derivatives required by the NLP solver are approximated using sparse finite-differencing of the optimal control problem functions. The key components of the software are described in detail and the utility of the software is demonstrated on five optimal control problems of varying complexity.

The library uses advanced object-oriented and data encapsulation techniques to break finite element implementations into smaller blocks that can be arranged to fit users requirements. Through this approach, deal.II supports a large number of different applications covering a wide range of scientific areas, programming methodologies, and application-specific algorithms, without imposing a rigid framework into which they have to fit. A judicious use of programming techniques allows us to avoid the computational costs frequently associated with abstract object-oriented class libraries. The paper presents a detailed description of the abstractions chosen for defining geometric information of meshes and the handling of degrees of freedom associated with finite element spaces, as well as of linear algebra, input/output capabilities and of interfaces to other software, such as visualization tools. Finally, some results obtained with applications built atop deal.II are shown to demonstrate the powerful capabilities of this toolbox.",

We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms.

Predefined tests suites for sequences of uniform random numbers over the interval (0, 1) and for bit sequences are available. Tools are also offered to perform systematic studies of the interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets produced by a given family of RNGs. That is, for a given kind of test and a given class of RNGs, to determine how large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically. Finally, the library provides various types of generators implemented in generic form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found in widely used software. The tests can be applied to instances of the generators predefined in the library, or to user-defined generators, or to streams of random numbers produced by any kind of device or stored in files. Besides introducing TestU01 , the article provides a survey and a classification of statistical tests for RNGs. It also applies batteries of tests to a long list of widely used RNGs.",

    "abstract": "The Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations (SLEPc) is a software library for computing a few eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of a large sparse matrix or matrix pencil. It has been developed on top of PETSc and enforces the same programming paradigm.The emphasis of the software is on methods and techniques appropriate for problems in which the associated matrices are sparse, for example, those arising after the discretization of partial differential equations. Therefore, most of the methods offered by the library are projection methods such as Arnoldi or Lanczos, or other methods with similar properties. SLEPc provides basic methods as well as more sophisticated algorithms. It also provides built-in support for spectral transformations such as the shift-and-invert technique. SLEPc is a general library in the sense that it covers standard and generalized eigenvalue problems, both Hermitian and non-Hermitian, with either real or complex arithmetic.SLEPc can be easily applied to real world problems. To illustrate this, several case studies arising from real applications are presented and solved with SLEPc with little programming effort. The addressed problems include a matrix-free standard problem, a complex generalized problem, and a singular value decomposition. The implemented codes exhibit good properties regarding flexibility as well as parallel performance.",

Typical applications are data assimilation, model tuning, sensitivity analysis, and determination of singular vectors. The adjoint model computes the gradient of a cost function with respect to control variables. Generation of adjoint code may be seen as the special case of differentiation of algorithms in reverse mode, where the dependent function is a scalar. The described method for adjoint code generation is based on a few basic principles, which permits the establishment of simple construction rules for adjoint statements and complete adjoint subprograms. These rules are presented and illustrated with some examples. Conflicts that occur due to loops and redefinition of variables are also discussed. Direct coding of the adjoint of a more sophisticated model is extremely time consuming and subject to errors. Hence, automatic generation of adjoint code represents a distinct advantage. An implementation of the method, described in this article, is the tangent linear and adjoint model compiler (TAMC).",

The backbone of the sparse routines consists of matrix-free Krylov subspace projection methods (Arnoldi and Lanczos processes), and that is why the toolkit is capable of coping with sparse matrices of large dimension. The software handles real and complex matrices and provides specific routines for symmetric and Hermitian matrices. The computation of matrix exponentials is a numerical issue of critical importance in the area of Markov chains and furthermore, the computed solution is subject to probabilistic constraints. In addition to addressing general matrix exponentials, a distinct attention is assigned to the computation of transient states of Markov chains.",

Although many of these facilities were originally produced by the authors in conjunction with the software package LANCELOT, we believe that they will be useful in their own right and should be available to researchers for their development of optimization software. The tools can be obtained by anonymous ftp from a number of sources and may, in many cases, be installed automatically. The scope of a major collection of test problems written in the standard input format (SIF) used by the LANCELOT software package is described. Recognizing that most software was not written with the SIF in mind, we provide tools to assist in building an interface between this input format and other optimization packages. These tools provide a link between the SIF and a number of existing packages, including MINOS and OSL. Additionally, as each problem includes a specific classification that is designed to be useful in identifying particular classes of problems, facilities are provided to build and manage a database of this information. There is a Unix and C shell bias to many of the descriptions in the article, since, for the sake of simplicity, we do not illustrate everything in its fullest generality. We trust that the majority of potential users are sufficiently familiar with Unix that these examples will not lead to undue confusion.",

    "abstract": "Explicit Runge-Kutta methods (RKMs) are among the most popular classes of formulas for the approximate numerical integration of nonstiff, initial value problems. However, high-order Runge-Kutta methods require more function evaluations per integration step than, for example, Adams methods used in PECE mode, and so, with RKMs, it is expecially important to avoid rejected steps. Steps are often rejected when certain derivatives of the solutions are very large for part of the region of integration. This corresponds, for example, to regions where the solution has a sharp front or, in the limit, some derivative of the solution is discontinuous. In these circumstances the assumption that the local truncation error is changing slowly is invalid, and so any step-choosing algorithm is likely to produce an unacceptable step. In this paper we derive a family of explicit Runge-Kutta formulas. Each formula is very efficient for problems with smooth solution as well as problems having rapidly varying solutions. Each member of this family consists of a fifty-order formula that contains imbedded formulas of all orders 1 through 4. By computing solutions at several different orders, it is possible to detect sharp fronts or discontinuities before all the function evaluations defining the full Runge-Kutta step have been computed. We can then either accpet a lower order solution or abort the step, depending on which course of action seems appropriate. The efficiency of the new algorithm is demonstrated on the DETEST test set as well as on some difficult test problems with sharp fronts or discontinuities.",

Automatic implementations of the complex-step method for Fortran and C/C++ are presented and compared to existing algorithmic differentiation tools. The complex-step method is tested in two large multidisciplinary solvers and the resulting sensitivities are compared to results given by finite differences.

By employing novel techniques for automated code generation, the library combines a high level of expressiveness with efficient computation. Finite element variational forms may be expressed in near mathematical notation, from which low-level code is automatically generated, compiled and seamlessly integrated with efficient implementations of computational meshes and high-performance linear algebra. Easy-to-use object-oriented interfaces to the library are provided in the form of a C++ library and a Python module. This paper discusses the mathematical abstractions and methods used in the design of the library and its implementation.

The algorithm is well suited for use in modern vectorized programming languages such as FORTRAN 95 and MATLAB. The algorithm discretizes the cost functional and the differential-algebraic equations in each phase of the optimal control problem. The phases are then connected using linkage conditions on the state and time. A large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP) arises from the discretization and the significant features of the NLP are described in detail. A particular reusable MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called GPOPS , is applied to three classical optimal control problems to demonstrate its utility. The algorithm described in this article will provide researchers and engineers a useful software tool and a reference when it is desired to implement the Gauss pseudospectral method in other programming languages.",

The result is a more complete separation of concerns which eases the incorporation of separate contributions from computer scientists, numerical analysts and application specialists. These contributions may add functionality, or improve performance. Firedrake benefits from automatically applying new optimisations. This includes factorising mixed function spaces, transforming and vectorising inner loops, and intrinsically supporting block matrix operations. Importantly, Firedrake presents a simple public API for escaping the UFL abstraction. This allows users to implement common operations that fall outside pure variational formulations, such as flux-limiters.",

Oscillations in geophysical systems, for example, are sometimes characterized by principal oscillation patterns, eigenmodes of estimated autoregressive (AR) models of first order. This paper describes the estimation of eigenmodes of AR models of arbitrary order. AR processes of any order can be decomposed into eigenmodes with characteristic oscillation periods, damping times, and excitations. Estimated eigenmodes and confidence intervals for the eigenmodes and their oscillation periods and damping times can be computed from estimated models parameters. As a computationally efficient method of estimating the parameters of AR models from high-dimensional data, a stepwise least squares algorithm is proposed. This algorithm computes models of successively decreasing order. Numerical simulations indicate that, with the least squares algorithm, the AR model coefficients and the eigenmodes derived from the coefficients and eigenmodes are rough approximations of the confidence intervals inferred from the simulaitons.",

However, the corresponding memory requirement is proportional to the run-time of the evaluation program. Therefore, the practical applicability of the reverse mode in its original formulation is limited despite the availability of ever larger memory systems. This observation leads to the development of checkpointing schedules to reduce the storage requirements. This article presents the function revolve, which generates checkpointing schedules that are provably optimal with regard to a primary and a secondary criterion.

A modification of the Halton sequence (the Halton sequence leaped) and a new construction of the generalized Halton sequence are suggested for unrestricted number of dimensions and are shown to improve considerably on the original Halton sequence. Problems associated with estimation of the error in quasi Monte Carlo integration and with the selection of test functions are identified. Then an estimate of the maximum error of the quasi Monte Carlo integration of nine test functions is computed for up to 400 dimensions and is used to evaluate the known generators mentioned above and the two new generators. An empirical formula for the error of the quasi Monte Carlo integration is suggested.",

Shepard's method for fitting a surface to data values at scattered points in the plane has the advantages of a small storage requirement and an easy generalization to more than two independent variables, but suffers from low accuracy and a high computational cost relative to some alternative methods. Localizations of this method have reasonably low computational costs, but remain relatively inaccurate. We describe a modified Shepard's method that, without sacrificing the advantages, has accuracy comparable to other local methods. Computational efficiency is also improved by using a cell method for nearest-neighbor searching. Test results for two and three independent variables are presented.",

Experimental results indicate that the modified version retains the fill-reducing property of (and is often better than) the original ordering algorithm and yet requires less computer time. The reduction in ordering time is problem dependent, and for some problems the modified algorithm can run a few times faster than existing implementations of the minimum-degree algorithm. The use of external degree in the algorithm is also introduced.",

    "abstract": "The BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework is a new infrastructure for rapidly instantiating Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) functionality. Its fundamental innovation is that virtually all computation within level-2 (matrix-vector) and level-3 (matrix-matrix) BLAS operations can be expressed and optimized in terms of very simple kernels. While others have had similar insights, BLIS reduces the necessary kernels to what we believe is the simplest set that still supports the high performance that the computational science community demands. Higher-level framework code is generalized and implemented in ISO C99 so that it can be reused and/or reparameterized for different operations (and different architectures) with little to no modification. Inserting high-performance kernels into the framework facilitates the immediate optimization of any BLAS-like operations which are cast in terms of these kernels, and thus the framework acts as a productivity multiplier. Users of BLAS-dependent applications are given a choice of using the traditional Fortran-77 BLAS interface, a generalized C interface, or any other higher level interface that builds upon this latter API. Preliminary performance of level-2 and level-3 operations is observed to be competitive with two mature open source libraries (OpenBLAS and ATLAS) as well as an established commercial product (Intel MKL).",

    "abstract": "Matrices coming from elliptic Partial Differential Equations have been shown to have a low-rank property that can be efficiently exploited in multifrontal solvers to provide a substantial reduction of their complexity. Among the possible low-rank formats, the Block Low-Rank format (BLR) is easy to use in a general purpose multifrontal solver and its potential compared to standard (full-rank) solvers has been demonstrated. Recently, new variants have been introduced and it was proved that they can further reduce the complexity but their performance has never been analyzed. In this article, we present a multithreaded BLR factorization and analyze its efficiency and scalability in shared-memory multicore environments. We identify the challenges posed by the use of BLR approximations in multifrontal solvers and put forward several algorithmic variants of the BLR factorization that overcome these challenges by improving its efficiency and scalability.

    "abstract": "SuiteSparseQR is a sparse QR factorization package based on the multifrontal method. Within each frontal matrix, LAPACK and the multithreaded BLAS enable the method to obtain high performance on multicore architectures. Parallelism across different frontal matrices is handled with Intel's Threading Building Blocks library. The symbolic analysis and ordering phase pre-eliminates singletons by permuting the input matrix A into the form [ R 11 R 12 ; 0 A 22 ] where R 11 is upper triangular with diagonal entries above a given tolerance. Next, the fill-reducing ordering, column elimination tree, and frontal matrix structures are found without requiring the formation of the pattern of A TA . Approximate rank-detection is performed within each frontal matrix using Heath's method. While Heath's method is not always exact, it has the advantage of not requiring column pivoting and thus does not interfere with the fill-reducing ordering. For sufficiently large problems, the resulting sparse QR factorization obtains a substantial fraction of the theoretical peak performance of a multicore computer.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a competitive divide-and-conquer algorithm for solving large-scale black-box optimization problems for which there are thousands of decision variables and the algebraic models of the problems are unavailable. We focus on problems that are partially additively separable, since this type of problem can be further decomposed into a number of smaller independent subproblems. The proposed algorithm addresses two important issues in solving large-scale black-box optimization: (1) the identification of the independent subproblems without explicitly knowing the formula of the objective function and (2) the optimization of the identified black-box subproblems. First, a Global Differential Grouping (GDG) method is proposed to identify the independent subproblems. Then, a variant of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is adopted to solve the subproblems resulting from its rotation invariance property. GDG and CMA-ES work together under the cooperative co-evolution framework. The resultant algorithm, named CC-GDG-CMAES, is then evaluated on the CEC’2010 large-scale global optimization (LSGO) benchmark functions, which have a thousand decision variables and black-box objective functions. The experimental results show that, on most test functions evaluated in this study, GDG manages to obtain an ideal partition of the index set of the decision variables, and CC-GDG-CMAES outperforms the state-of-the-art results. Moreover, the competitive performance of the well-known CMA-ES is extended from low-dimensional to high-dimensional black-box problems.",

Two packages, developed in the mid 1990s, still enjoy regular use: ScaLAPACK and PLAPACK. With the advent of many-core architectures, which may very well take the shape of distributed memory architectures within a single processor, these packages must be revisited since the traditional MPI-based approaches will likely need to be extended. Thus, this is a good time to review lessons learned since the introduction of these two packages and to propose a simple yet effective alternative.

    "abstract": "Many important partial differential equation problems in homogeneous media, such as those of acoustic or electromagnetic wave propagation, can be represented in the form of integral equations on the boundary of the domain of interest. In order to solve such problems, the boundary element method (BEM) can be applied. The advantage compared to domain-discretisation-based methods such as finite element methods is that only a discretisation of the boundary is necessary, which significantly reduces the number of unknowns. Yet, BEM formulations are much more difficult to implement than finite element methods. In this article, we present BEM++, a novel open-source library for the solution of boundary integral equations for Laplace, Helmholtz and Maxwell problems in three space dimensions. BEM++ is a C++ library with Python bindings for all important features, making it possible to integrate the library into other C++ projects or to use it directly via Python scripts. The internal structure and design decisions for BEM++ are discussed. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the library for larger problems.",

The approach is based on the composition of permutations and transformations by cell sub-entity. Current approaches to generating degree-of-freedom maps for arbitrary order problems typically rely on a consistent orientation of cell entities that permits the definition of a common local coordinate system on shared edges and faces. However, while orientation of a mesh is straightforward for simplex cells and is a local operation, it is not a strictly local operation for quadrilateral cells and in the case of hexahedral cells not all meshes are orientable. The permutation and transformation approach is developed for a range of element types, including Lagrange, and divergence- and curl-conforming elements, and for a range of cell shapes. The approach is local and can be applied to cells of any shape, including general polytopes and meshes with mixed cell types. A number of examples are presented and the developed approach has been implemented in an open-source finite element library.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the organization of frontal matrices in multifrontal methods for the solution of large sparse sets of unsymmetric linear equations. In the multifrontal method, work on a frontal matrix can be suspended, the frontal matrix can be stored for later reuse, and a new frontal matrix can be generated. There are thus several frontal matrices stored during the factorization, and one or more of these are assembled (summed) when creating a new frontal matrix. Although this means that arbitrary sparsity patterns can be handled efficiently, extra work is required to sum the frontal matrices together and can be costly because indirect addressing is requred. The (uni)frontal method avoids this extra work by factorizing the matrix with a single frontal matrix. Rows and columns are added to the frontal matrix, and pivot rows and columns are removed. Data movement is simpler, but higher fill-in can result if the matrix cannot be permuted into a variable-band form with small profile. We consider a combined unifrontal/multifrontal algorithm to enable general fill-in reduction orderings to be applied without the data movement of previous multifrontal approaches. We discuss this technique in the context of a code designed for the solution of sparse systems with unsymmetric pattern.",

In this article, we propose new generators of that form with better equidistribution and “bit-mixing” properties for equivalent period length and speed. The state of our new generators evolves in a more chaotic way than for the Mersenne twister. We illustrate how this can reduce the impact of persistent dependencies among successive output values, which can be observed in certain parts of the period of gigantic generators such as the Mersenne twister.",

We begin by presenting some methods for parallel pseudorandom number generation.

We describe, in detail, parameterized versions of the following pseudorandom number generators: (i) linear congruential generators, (ii) shift-register generators, and (iii) lagged-Fibonacci generators. We briefly describe the methods, detail some advantages and disadvantages of each method, and recount results from number theory that impact our understanding of their quality in parallel applications. SPRNG was designed around the uniform implementation of different families of parameterized random number generators. We then present a short description of SPRNG. The description contained within this document is meant only to outline the rationale behind and the capabilities of SPRNG. Much more information, including examples and detailed documentation aimed at helping users with putting and using SPRNG on scalable systems is available at htt;//sprng.sc.fsu.edu. In this description of SPRNG we discuss the random-number generator library as well as the suite of tests of randomness that is an integral part of SPRNG. Random-number tools for parallel Monte Carlo applications must be subjected to classical as well as new types of empirical tests of randomness to eliminate generators that show defects when used in scalable envionments.",

The OOQP distribution contains default implementations that solve several important QP problem types, including general sparse and dense QPs, bound-constrained QPs, and QPs arising from support vector machines and Huber regression. The implementations supplied with the OOQP distribution are based on such well known linear algebra packages as MA27/57, LAPACK, and PETSc.

The algorithm implemented is an efficient and stable trust region (Levenberg-Marquardt) procedure that exploits the structure of the problem so that the computational cost per iteration is equal to that for the same type of algorithm applied to the ordinary nonlinear least squares problem.

    "abstract": "A new global optimization algorithm for functions of many continuous variables is presented, derived from the basic Simulated annealing method. Our main contribution lies in dealing with high-dimensionality minimization problems, which are often difficult to solve by all known minimization methods with or without gradient. In this article we take a special interest in the variables discretization issue. We also develop and implement several complementary stopping criteria. The original Metropolis iterative random search, which takes place in a Euclidean space R n , is replaced by another similar exploration, performed within a succession of Euclidean spaces R p , with p &lt;&lt; n . This Enhanced Simulated Annealing (ESA) algorithm was validated first on classical highly multimodal functions of 2 to 100 variables. We obtained significant reductions in the number of function evaluations compared to six other global optimization algorithms, selected according to previously published computational results for the same set of test functions. In most cases, ESA was able to closely approximate known global optima. The reduced ESA computational cost helped us to refine further the obtained global results, through the use of some local search. We have used this new minimizing procedure to solve complex circuit design problems, for which the objective function evaluation can be exceedingly costly.",

The Schwarz-Christoffel Toolbox for MATLAB is a new implementation of Schwarz-Christoffel formulas for maps from the disk, half-plane, strip, and rectangle domains to polygon interiors, and from the disk to polygon exteriors. The toolbox, written entirely in the MATLAB script language, exploits the high-level functions, interactive environment, visualization tools, and graphical user interface elements supplied by current versions of MATLAB, and is suitable for use both as a standalone tool and as a library for applications written in MATLAB, Fortran, or C. Several examples and simple applications are presented to demonstrate the toolbox's capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Since the advent of high-performance distributed-memory parallel computing, the need for intelligible code has become ever greater. The development and maintenance of libraries for these architectures is simply too complex to be amenable to conventional approaches to implementation. Attempts to employ traditional methodology have led, in our opinion, to the production of an abundance of anfractuous code that is difficult to maintain and almost impossible to upgrade.Having struggled with these issues for more than a decade, we have concluded that a solution is to apply a technique from theoretical computer science, formal derivation, to the development of high-performance linear algebra libraries. We think the resulting approach results in aesthetically pleasing, coherent code that greatly facilitates intelligent modularity and high performance while enhancing confidence in its correctness. Since the technique is language-independent, it lends itself equally well to a wide spectrum of programming languages (and paradigms) ranging from C and Fortran to C++ and Java. In this paper, we illustrate our observations by looking at the Formal Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME), a framework that facilitates the derivation and implementation of linear algebra algorithms on sequential architectures. This environment demonstrates that lessons learned in the distributed-memory world can guide us toward better approaches even in the sequential world.We present performance experiments on the Intel (R) Pentium (R) III processor that demonstrate that high performance can be attained by coding at a high level of abstraction.",

    "abstract": "Sparse Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting computes the factorization PAQ = LU of a sparse matrix A , where the row ordering P is selected during factorization using standard partial pivoting with row interchanges. The goal is to select a column preordering, Q , based solely on the nonzero pattern of A , that limits the worst-case number of nonzeros in the factorization. The fill-in also depends on P , but Q is selected to reduce an upper bound on the fill-in for any subsequent choice of P . The choice of Q can have a dramatic impact on the number of nonzeros in L and U . One scheme for determining a good column ordering for A is to compute a symmetric ordering that reduces fill-in in the Cholesky factorization of A T A . A conventional minimum degree ordering algorithm would require the sparsity structure of A T A to be computed, which can be expensive both in terms of space and time since A T A may be much denser than A . An alternative is to compute Q directly from the sparsity structure of A ; this strategy is used by MATLAB's COLMMD preordering algorithm. A new ordering algorithm, COLAMD, is presented. It is based on the same strategy but uses a better ordering heuristic. COLAMD is faster and computes better orderings, with fewer nonzeros in the factors of the matrix.",

In brief: generate a normal variate x and a uniform variate U until In ( U )&lt;0.5 x 2 + d - dv + d ln( v ), then return dv . Here, the gamma parameter is α ≥ 1, and v = (1 + x / *** with d = α - 1/3. The efficiency is high, exceeding 0.951, 0.981, 0.992, 0.996 at α = 1,2,4,8. The procedure can be made to run faster by means of a simple squeeze that avoids the two logarithms most of the time; return dv if U &lt; 1-0.0331 x 4 . We give a short C program for any α ≥ 1, and show how to boost an α &lt;1 into an α &gt; 1. The gamma procedure is particularly fst for C implementation if the normal variate is generated in-line, via the #define feature. We include such an inline version, based on our ziggurat method. With it, and an inline uniform generator, gamma variates can be produced in 400MHz CPUs at better than 1.3 million per second, with the parameter α changing from call to call.",

The Level3 BLAS are targeted at matrix-matrix operations with the aim of providing more efficient, but portable, implementations of algorithms on high-performance computers. The model implementation provides a portable set of Fortran 77 Level 3 BLAS for machines where specialized implementations do not exist or are not required. The test software aims to verify that specialized implementations meet the specification of the Level 3 BLAS and that implementations are correctly installed.",

This approach leads to a better understanding of the relation between stepsize and error. A new dynamical model describing this relation is derived. The model is used as a basis for a new stepsize selection rule. This rule achieves better error control at little extra expense. The properties of the new model and the improved performance of the new error control are demonstrated using both analysis and numerical examples.",

This approach results in more-reliable translation and permits programmers of multiprecision applications to utilize the full power of Fortran 90. Three multiprecision data types are supported in this system: multiprecision integer, real, and complex. All the usual Fortran conventions for mixed-mode operations are supported, and many of the Fortran intrinsics, such as SIN, EXP, and MOD, are supported with multiprecision arguments. An interesting application of this software, wherein new number-theoretic identities have been discovered by means of multiprecision computations, is included also.",

Since computing the Kronecker structure of a singular pencil is a potentially ill-posed problem, it is important to be able to compute rigorous and reliable error bounds for the computed features. The error bounds rely on perturbation theory for reducing subspaces and generalized eigenvalues of singular matrix pencils. The first part of this two-part paper presents the theory and algorithms for the decomposition and its error bounds, while the second part describes the computed generalized Schur decomposition and the software, and presents applications and an example of its use.",

To determine a class, the user defines the following parameters: (i) problem dimension, (ii) number of local minima, (iii) value of the global minimum, (iv) radius of the attraction region of the global minimizer, (v) distance from the global minimizer to the vertex of the quadratic function. Then, all other necessary parameters are generated randomly for all 100 functions of the class.

Permitting higher internal precision and mixed input/output types and precisions allows us to implement some algorithms that are simpler, more accurate, and sometimes faster than possible without these features. The new BLAS are challenging to implement and test because there are many more subroutines than in the existing Standard, and because we must be able to assess whether a higher precision is used for internal computations than is used for either input or output variables. We have therefore developed an automated process of generating and systematically testing these routines. Our methodology is applicable to languages besides C. In particular, our algorithms used in the testing code will be valuable to all other BLAS implementors. Our extra precision routines achieve excellent performance---close to half of the machine peak Megaflop rate even for the Level 2 BLAS, when the data access is stride one.",

With suitable partitioning, all the other level 3 BLAS can be defined in terms of GEMM and a small amount of level 1 and level 2 computations. Our contribution is twofold. First, the model implementations in Fortran 77 of the GEMM-based level 3 BLAS are structured to reduced effectively data traffic in a memory hierarchy. Second, the GEMM-based level 3 BLAS performance evaluation benchmark is a tool for evaluating and comparing different implementations of the level 3 BLAS with the GEMM-based model implementations.",

The numerical results for 256 matrices presented in this article give an indication of which approaches are suitable for which matrices (based on different criteria, such as total computation time or fill-in) and of the differences between the methods.",

We consider techniques for the adaptive refinement of triangulations used with the finite element method with piecewise linear functions. Several such techniques that differ mainly in the method for dividing triangles and the method for indicating which triangles have the largest error have been developed. We describe four methods for dividing triangles and eight methods for indicating errors. Angle bounds for the triangle division methods are compared. All combinations of triangle divisions and error indicators are compared in a numerical experiment using a population of eight test problems with a variety of difficulties (peaks, boundary layers, singularities, etc.). The comparison is based on the L -infinity norm of the error versus the number of vertices. It is found that all of the methods produce asymptotically optimal grids and that the number of vertices needed for a given error rarely differs by more than a factor of two.",

We present the results of a comparison of the three step selection strategies on the problems in More, Garbow, and Hillstrom in two separate cases: using finite difference gradients and Hessians, and using finite difference gradients with BFGS Hessian approximations.

    "abstract": "Today's largest supercomputers have 100,000s of processor cores and offer the potential to solve partial differential equations discretized by billions of unknowns. However, the complexity of scaling to such large machines and problem sizes has so far prevented the emergence of generic software libraries that support such computations, although these would lower the threshold of entry and enable many more applications to benefit from large-scale computing. We are concerned with providing this functionality for mesh-adaptive finite element computations. We assume the existence of an “oracle” that implements the generation and modification of an adaptive mesh distributed across many processors, and that responds to queries about its structure. Based on querying the oracle, we develop scalable algorithms and data structures for generic finite element methods. Specifically, we consider the parallel distribution of mesh data, global enumeration of degrees of freedom, constraints, and postprocessing. Our algorithms remove the bottlenecks that typically limit large-scale adaptive finite element analyses. We demonstrate scalability of complete finite element workflows on up to 16,384 processors. An implementation of the proposed algorithms, based on the open source software p4est as mesh oracle, is provided under an open source license through the widely used deal.II finite element software library.",

This is equivalent to computing the action of a certain matrix function on the vector representing the initial condition. The matrix function is a linear combination of the matrix exponential and other functions related to the exponential (the so-called phi-functions). Such computations are the major computational burden in the implementation of exponential integrators, which can solve general ODEs. Our approach is to compute the action of the matrix function by constructing a Krylov subspace using Arnoldi or Lanczos iteration and projecting the function on this subspace. This is combined with time-stepping to prevent the Krylov subspace from growing too large. The algorithm is fully adaptive: it varies both the size of the time steps and the dimension of the Krylov subspace to reach the required accuracy. We implement this algorithm in the Matlab function phipm and we give instructions on how to obtain and use this function. Various numerical experiments show that the phipm function is often significantly more efficient than the state-of-the-art.",

Automatic differentation (AD) approaches compute truncation-free derivatives and can be efficient in many cases.

The focus of this work is to combine the strength of these methods into a hybrid strategy that attempts to achieve an optimal balance of implementation and computational efficiency by selecting the appropriate components of the target algorithms for AD and analytical derivation. Although several AD approaches can be considered, our focus is on the use of template overloading forward AD tools in C++ applications. We demonstrate this hybrid strategy for a system of partial differential equations in gas dynamics. These methods apply however to other systems of differentiable equations, including DAEs and ODEs.",

We develop efficient numerical methods for computing this tridiagonal form based on Gauss transformations, using a skew-symmetric, blocked form of the Parlett-Reid algorithm, or based on unitary transformations, using block Householder transformations and Givens rotations, that are applicable to dense and banded matrices, respectively. We also give a complete and fully optimized implementation of these algorithms in Fortran, and also provide Python, Matlab and Mathematica implementations for convenience.

The operator-overloading approach to performing reverse-mode automatic differentiation is the most convenient for the user but current implementations are typically 10-35 times slower than the original algorithm. In this paper a fast new operator-overloading method is presented that uses the expression template programming technique in C++ to provide a compile-time representation of each mathematical expression as a computational graph that can be efficiently traversed in either direction. Benchmarking with four different numerical algorithms shows this approach to be 2.6--9 times faster than current operator-overloading libraries, and 1.3--7.7 times more efficient in memory usage. It is typically less than 4 times the computational cost of the original algorithm, although poorer performance is found for all libraries in the case of simple loops containing no mathematical functions.

To combat such shortcomings, a new method for calculating exact high-order sensitivities using multicomplex numbers is presented. Inspired by the recent complex step method that is only valid for firstorder sensitivities, the new multicomplex approach is valid to arbitrary order. The mathematical theory behind this approach is revealed, and an efficient procedure for the automatic implementation of the method is described. Several applications are presented to validate and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results are compared to conventional approaches such as finite differencing, the complex step method, and two separate automatic differentiation tools. The multicomplex method performs favorably in the preliminary comparisons and is therefore expected to be useful for a variety of algorithms that exploit higher order derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a great deal of attention has been focused on the construction of exponential integrators for semilinear problems. In this article we describe a MATLAB 1 package which aims to facilitate the quick deployment and testing of exponential integrators, of Runge--Kutta, multistep, and general linear type. A large number of integrators are included in this package along with several well-known examples. The so-called φ functions and their evaluation is crucial for accuracy, stability, and efficiency of exponential integrators, and the approach taken here is through a modification of the scaling and squaring technique, the most common approach used for computing the matrix exponential.",

    "abstract": "We present two software packages for derivative-free optimization (DFO): DFO-LS for nonlinear least-squares problems and Py-BOBYQA for general objectives, both with optional bound constraints. Inspired by the Gauss-Newton method, DFO-LS constructs simplified linear regression models for the residuals and allows flexible initialization for expensive problems, whereby it can begin making progress after as few as two objective evaluations. Numerical results show DFO-LS can gain reasonable progress on some medium-scale problems with fewer objective evaluations than is needed for one gradient evaluation. DFO-LS has improved robustness to noise, allowing sample averaging, regression-based model construction, and multiple restart strategies with an auto-detection mechanism. Our extensive numerical experimentation shows that restarting the solver when stagnation is detected is a cheap and effective mechanism for achieving robustness, with superior performance over sampling and regression techniques. The package Py-BOBYQA is a Python implementation of BOBYQA (Powell 2009), with novel features such as the implementation of robustness to noise strategies. Our numerical experiments show that Py-BOBYQA is comparable to or better than existing general DFO solvers for noisy problems. In our comparisons, we introduce an adaptive accuracy measure for data profiles of noisy functions, striking a balance between measuring the true and the noisy objective improvement.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of thread-level parallelism as the primary means for continued performance improvement, the programmability issue has reemerged as an obstacle to the use of architectural advances. We argue that evolving legacy libraries for dense and banded linear algebra is not a viable solution due to constraints imposed by early design decisions. We propose a philosophy of abstraction and separation of concerns that provides a promising solution in this problem domain. The first abstraction, FLASH, allows algorithms to express computation with matrices consisting of contiguous blocks, facilitating algorithms-by-blocks. Operand descriptions are registered for a particular operation a priori by the library implementor. A runtime system, SuperMatrix, uses this information to identify data dependencies between suboperations, allowing them to be scheduled to threads out-of-order and executed in parallel. But not all classical algorithms in linear algebra lend themselves to conversion to algorithms-by-blocks. We show how our recently proposed LU factorization with incremental pivoting and a closely related algorithm-by-blocks for the QR factorization, both originally designed for out-of-core computation, overcome this difficulty. Anecdotal evidence regarding the development of routines with a core functionality demonstrates how the methodology supports high productivity while experimental results suggest that high performance is abundantly achievable.",

Responding to this problem, we have developed PRIMME, a comprehensive package that brings state-of-the-art methods from “bleeding edge” to production, with the best possible robustness, efficiency, and a flexible, yet highly usable interface that requires minimal or no tuning. We describe (1) the PRIMME multimethod framework that implements a variety of algorithms, including the near optimal methods GD+ k and JDQMR; (2) a host of algorithmic innovations and implementation techniques that endow the software with its robustness and efficiency; (3) a multilayer interface that captures our experience and addresses the needs of both expert and end users.",

In these systems constrained motion along a discontinuity surface (so-called sliding) is possible and requires special treatment numerically. The introduced algorithms are based on an extension to Filippov's method to stabilise the sliding flow together with accurate detection of the entrance and exit of sliding regions. The methods are implemented in a general way in MATLAB and sufficient details are given to enable users to modify the code to run on arbitrary examples. Here, the method is used to compute the dynamics of three example systems, a dry-friction oscillator, a relay feedback system and a model of an oil well drill-string.",

The most common strategies are primal value taping (implemented e.g. by ADOL-C) and Jacobian taping (implemented e.g. by Adept and dco/c++). Particulary for Jacobian taping, recent advances using expression templates make it very attractive for large scale software. However, the current implementations are either closed source or miss essential features and flexibility. Therefore, we present the new AD tool CoDiPack (Code Differentiation Package) in this paper. It is specifically designed for minimal memory consumption and optimal runtime, such that it can be used for the differentiation of large scale software. An essential part of the design of CoDiPack is the modular layout and the recursive data structures which not only allow the efficient implementation of the Jacobian taping approach but will also enable other approaches like the primal value taping or new research ideas. We will finally present the performance values of CoDiPack on a generic PDE example and on the SU2 code.",

A matrix is considered structured if its off-diagonal blocks can be approximated by a rank-deficient matrix with low numerical rank. Here, we use Hierarchically Semi-Separable (HSS) representations. Such matrices appear in many applications, for example, finite-element methods, boundary element methods, and so on. Exploiting this structure allows for fast solution of linear systems and/or fast computation of matrix-vector products, which are the two main building blocks of matrix computations. The compression algorithm that we use, that computes the HSS form of an input dense matrix, relies on randomized sampling with a novel adaptive sampling mechanism. We discuss the parallelization of this algorithm and also present the parallelization of structured matrix-vector product, structured factorization, and solution routines. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on large problems from different academic and industrial applications, on up to 8,000 cores. This work is part of a more global effort, the STRUctured Matrices PACKage (STRUMPACK) software package for computations with sparse and dense structured matrices. Hence, although useful on their own right, the routines also represent a step in the direction of a distributed-memory sparse solver.",

One such package is JGraphT, a programming library that contains very efficient and generic graph data structures along with a large collection of state-of-the-art algorithms. The library is written in Java with stability, interoperability, and performance in mind. A distinctive feature of this library is its ability to model vertices and edges as arbitrary objects, thereby permitting natural representations of many common networks, including transportation, social, and biological networks. Besides classic graph algorithms such as shortest-paths and spanning-tree algorithms, the library contains numerous advanced algorithms: graph and subgraph isomorphism, matching and flow problems, approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems such as independent set and the traveling salesman problem, and several more exotic algorithms such as Berge graph detection. Due to its versatility and generic design, JGraphT is currently used in large-scale commercial products, as well as noncommercial and academic research projects. In this work, we describe in detail the design and underlying structure of the library, and discuss its most important features and algorithms. A computational study is conducted to evaluate the performance of JGraphT versus several similar libraries. Experiments on a large number of graphs over a variety of popular algorithms show that JGraphT is highly competitive with other established libraries such as NetworkX or the BGL.",

The introduction of General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) is no exception, and many articles have been devoted to this problem. With this article, we provide a review of the techniques for implementing the SpMV kernel on GPGPUs that have appeared in the literature of the last few years.

Implementing SpGEMM efficiently on throughput-oriented processors, such as the graphics processing unit (GPU), requires the programmer to expose substantial fine-grained parallelism while conserving the limited off-chip memory bandwidth. Balancing these concerns, we decompose the SpGEMM operation into three highly parallel phases: expansion, sorting, and contraction, and introduce a set of complementary bandwidth-saving performance optimizations. Our implementation is fully general and our optimization strategy adaptively processes the SpGEMM workload row-wise to substantially improve performance by decreasing the work complexity and utilizing the memory hierarchy more effectively.",

However, multivariate signals such as images or videos typically exhibit curvilinear singularities, which wavelets are provably deficient in sparsely approximating and also in analyzing in the sense of, for instance, detecting their direction. Shearlets are a directional representation system extending the wavelet framework, which overcomes those deficiencies. Similar to wavelets, shearlets allow a faithful implementation and fast associated transforms. In this article, we will introduce a comprehensive carefully documented software package coined ShearLab 3D (www.ShearLab.org) and discuss its algorithmic details. This package provides MATLAB code for a novel faithful algorithmic realization of the 2D and 3D shearlet transform (and their inverses) associated with compactly supported universal shearlet systems incorporating the option of using CUDA. We will present extensive numerical experiments in 2D and 3D concerning denoising, inpainting, and feature extraction, comparing the performance of ShearLab 3D with similar transform-based algorithms such as curvelets, contourlets, or surfacelets.

Flow-based computational frameworks alleviate part of the challenge through a modular approach, where data flows from component to component. However, existing flow-based frameworks are inefficient when coupled derivatives are needed for optimization. To address this, we develop the modular analysis and unified derivatives (MAUD) architecture. MAUD formulates the multidisciplinary model as a nonlinear system of equations, which leads to a linear equation that unifies all methods for computing derivatives. This enables flow-based frameworks that use the MAUD architecture to provide a common interface for the chain rule, adjoint method, coupled adjoint method, and hybrid methods; MAUD automatically uses the appropriate method for the problem. A hierarchical, matrix-free approach enables modern solution techniques such as Newton--Krylov solvers to be used within this monolithic formulation without computational overhead. Two demonstration problems are solved using a Python implementation of MAUD: a nanosatellite optimization with more than 2 million unknowns and 25,000 design variables, and an aircraft optimization involving over 6,000 design variables and 23,000 constraints. MAUD is now implemented in the open source framework OpenMDAO, which has been used to solve aircraft, satellite, wind turbine, and turbofan engine design problems.",

    "abstract": "Roundoff errors cannot be avoided when implementing numerical programs with finite precision. The ability to reason about rounding is especially important if one wants to explore a range of potential representations, for instance, for FPGAs or custom hardware implementations. This problem becomes challenging when the program does not employ solely linear operations as non-linearities are inherent to many interesting computational problems in real-world applications. Existing solutions to reasoning possibly lead to either inaccurate bounds or high analysis time in the presence of nonlinear correlations between variables. Furthermore, while it is easy to implement a straightforward method such as interval arithmetic, sophisticated techniques are less straightforward to implement in a formal setting. Thus there is a need for methods that output certificates that can be formally validated inside a proof assistant. We present a framework to provide upper bounds on absolute roundoff errors of floating-point nonlinear programs. This framework is based on optimization techniques employing semidefinite programming and sums of squares certificates, which can be checked inside the Coq theorem prover to provide formal roundoff error bounds for polynomial programs. Our tool covers a wide range of nonlinear programs, including polynomials and transcendental operations as well as conditional statements. We illustrate the efficiency and precision of this tool on non-trivial programs coming from biology, optimization, and space control. Our tool produces more accurate error bounds for 23% of all programs and yields better performance in 66% of all programs.",

BLASFEO comes with three different implementations: a high-performance implementation aiming at providing the highest performance for matrices fitting in cache, a reference implementation providing portability and embeddability and optimized for very small matrices, and a wrapper to standard BLAS and LAPACK providing high-performance on large matrices. The three implementations of BLASFEO together provide high-performance dense linear algebra routines for matrices ranging from very small to large. Compared to both open-source and proprietary highly-tuned BLAS libraries, for matrices of size up to about one hundred the high-performance implementation of BLASFEO is about 20-30% faster than the corresponding level 3 BLAS routines and 2-3 times faster than the corresponding LAPACK routines.",

Some of these are obtained through well-established stencil optimizers, integrated in the backend of the Devito compiler.

In this article, we give two new contributions. First, we introduce two new F 2 -linear transformations that have been handcrafted to have good statistical properties and at the same time to be programmable very efficiently on superscalar processors, or even directly in hardware. Then, we describe some scramblers , that is, nonlinear functions applied to the state array that reduce or delete the linear artifacts, and propose combinations of linear transformations and scramblers that give extremely fast pseudorandom number generators of high quality. A novelty in our approach is that we use ideas from the theory of filtered linear-feedback shift registers to prove some properties of our scramblers, rather than relying purely on heuristics. In the end, we provide simple, extremely fast generators that use a few hundred bits of memory, have provable properties, and pass strong statistical tests.",

The key property of the algorithms implemented in hIPPYlib is that the solution of the inverse problem is computed at a cost, measured in linearized forward PDE solves, that is independent of the parameter dimension. The mean of the posterior is approximated by the MAP point, which is found by minimizing the negative log-posterior with an inexact matrix-free Newton-CG method. The posterior covariance is approximated by the inverse of the Hessian of the negative log posterior evaluated at the MAP point. The construction of the posterior covariance is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the Hessian of the log-likelihood. Scalable tools for sample generation are also discussed. hIPPYlib makes all of these advanced algorithms easily accessible to domain scientists and provides an environment that expedites the development of new algorithms.",

    "abstract": "High-performance implementations of graph algorithms are challenging to implement on new parallel hardware such as GPUs because of three challenges: (1) the difficulty of coming up with graph building blocks, (2) load imbalance on parallel hardware, and (3) graph problems having low arithmetic intensity. To address some of these challenges, GraphBLAS is an innovative, on-going effort by the graph analytics community to propose building blocks based on sparse linear algebra, which allow graph algorithms to be expressed in a performant, succinct, composable, and portable manner. In this paper, we examine the performance challenges of a linear-algebra-based approach to building graph frameworks and describe new design principles for overcoming these bottlenecks. Among the new design principles is exploiting input sparsity , which allows users to write graph algorithms without specifying push and pull direction. Exploiting output sparsity allows users to tell the backend which values of the output in a single vectorized computation they do not want computed. Load-balancing is an important feature for balancing work amongst parallel workers. We describe the important load-balancing features for handling graphs with different characteristics. The design principles described in this paper have been implemented in “GraphBLAST”, the first high-performance linear algebra-based graph framework on NVIDIA GPUs that is open-source. The results show that on a single GPU, GraphBLAST has on average at least an order of magnitude speedup over previous GraphBLAS implementations SuiteSparse and GBTL, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives and shared-memory graph frameworks Ligra and Gunrock, and better performance than any other GPU graph framework, while offering a simpler and more concise programming model.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive time-stepping based on linear digital control theory has several advantages: the algorithms can be analyzed in terms of stability and adaptivity, and they can be designed to produce smoother stepsize sequences resulting in significantly improved regularity and computational stability. Here, we extend this approach by viewing the closed-loop transfer map H φ : logφ ↦ log h as a digital filter, processing the signal logφ (the principal error function) in the frequency domain, in order to produce a smooth stepsize sequence log h . The theory covers all previously considered control structures and offers new possibilities to construct stepsize selection algorithms in the asymptotic stepsize-error regime. Without incurring extra computational costs, the controllers can be designed for special purposes such as higher order of adaptivity (for smooth ODE problems) or a stronger ability to suppress high-frequency error components (nonsmooth problems, stochastic ODEs). Simulations verify the controllers' ability to produce stepsize sequences resulting in improved regularity and computational stability.",

First, we develop an efficient block algorithm for approximating an RRQR factorization, employing a windowed version of the commonly used Golub pivoting strategy, aided by incremental condition estimation. Second, we develop efficiently implementable variants of guaranteed reliable RRQR algorithms for triangular matrices originally suggested by Chandrasekaran and Ipsen and by Pan and Tang. We suggest algorithmic improvements with respect to condition estimation, termination criteria, and Givens updating. By combining the block algorithm with one of the triangular postprocessing steps, we arrive at an efficient and reliable algorithm for computing an RRQR factorization of a dense matrix. Experimental results on IBM RS/6000 SGI R8000 platforms show that this approach performs up to three times faster that the less reliable QR factorization with column pivoting as it is currently implemented in LAPACK, and comes within 15% of the performance of the LAPACK block algorithm for computing a QR factorization without any column exchanges. Thus, we expect this routine to be useful in may circumstances where numerical rank deficiency cannot be ruled out, but currently has been ignored because of the computational cost of dealing with it.",

The structural representation may be viewed as storing the minimal structure of the given matrix that will preserve the symbolic Cholesky factor.

This package is in some cases over 200 times faster than that of certain other packages that have been developed for this purpose. The second utility is a translator program, which facilitates the conversion of ordinary Fortran programs to use this package. By means of source directives (special comments) in the original Fortran program, the user declares the precision level and specifies which variables in each subprogram are to be treated as multiprecision. The translator program reads this source program and outputs a program with the appropriate multiprecision subroutine calls. This translator supports multiprecision integer, real, and complex datatypes. The required array space for multiprecision data types is automatically allocated. In the evaluation of computational expressions, all of the usual conventions for operator precedence and mixed mode operations are upheld. Furthermore, most of the Fortran-77 intrinsics, such as ABS, MOD, NINT, COS, EXP are supported and produce true multiprecision values.",

    "abstract": "The Open/ADF tool allows the evaluation of derivatives of functions defined by a Fortran program. The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the analysis and transformation of the original program that defines the function of interest. Open/ADF has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the use of open source components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles of automatic differentiation, the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various levels, for example, for basic block preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, Open/ADF uses components provided by the Open/AD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation engine is an XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes, Open/ADF supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics, a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such as bottom topography as independent (control) variables.",

Computed root mean square discrepancies of the scrambled sequences are compared to known theoretical results.

Supernodes merge and split apart during an update/downdate. Dynamic supernodes are introduced which allow a sparse Cholesky update/downdate to obtain performance competitive with conventional supernodal methods. A dynamic supernodal solver is shown to exceed the performance of the conventional (BLAS-based) supernodal method for solving triangular systems.

These types of problems arise in electronic structure calculations, which are nowadays essential for studying the microscopic quantum mechanical properties of molecules, solids, and other nanoscale materials. KSSOLV is well suited for developing new algorithms for solving the Kohn-Sham equations and is designed to enable researchers in computational and applied mathematics to investigate the convergence properties of the existing algorithms. The toolbox makes use of the object-oriented programming features available in MATLAB so that the process of setting up a physical system is straightforward and the amount of coding effort required to prototype, test, and compare new algorithms is significantly reduced. All of these features should also make this package attractive to other computational scientists and students who wish to study small- to medium-size systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present an algorithm for partitioning the nodes of a graph into supernodes, which improves the performance of the multifrontal method for the factorization of large, sparse matrices on vector computers. This new algorithm first partitions the graph into fundamental supernodes. Next, using a specified relaxation parameter, the supernodes are coalesced in a careful manner to create a coarser supernode partition. Using this coarser partition in the factorization generally introduces logically zero entries into the factor. This is accompanied by a decrease in the amount of sparse vector computations and data movement and an increase in the number of dense vector operations. The amount of storage required for the factor is generally increased by a small amount. On a collection of moderately sized 3-D structures, matrices speedups of 3 to 20 percent on the Cray X-MP are observed over the fundamental supernode partition which allows no logically zero entries in the factor. Using this relaxed supernode partition, the multifrontal method now factorizes the extremely sparse electric power matrices faster than the general sparse algorithm. In addition, there is potential for considerably reducing the communication requirements for an implementation of the multifrontal method on a local memory multiprocessor.",

For a given core size, the reduction in working storage allows some large problems to be solved without having to use auxiliary storage for the working arrays. Even if the working arrays exceed the core size, it will reduce the amount of input-output traffic necessary to manipulate the working vectors. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate significant storage reduction on practical problems using the proposed techniques.",

    "abstract": "We examine aspects of the computation of finite element matrices and vectors that are made possible by automated code generation. Given a variational form in a syntax that resembles standard mathematical notation, the low-level computer code for building finite element tensors, typically matrices, vectors and scalars, can be generated automatically via a form compiler. In particular, the generation of code for computing finite element matrices using a quadrature approach is addressed. For quadrature representations, a number of optimization strategies which are made possible by automated code generation are presented. The relative performance of two different automatically generated representations of finite element matrices is examined, with a particular emphasis on complicated variational forms. It is shown that approaches which perform best for simple forms are not tractable for more complicated problems in terms of run-time performance, the time required to generate the code or the size of the generated code. The approach and optimizations elaborated here are effective for a range of variational forms.",

    "abstract": "Gappa is a tool designed to formally verify the correctness of numerical software and hardware. It uses interval arithmetic and forward error analysis to bound mathematical expressions that involve rounded as well as exact operators. It then generates a theorem and its proof for each verified enclosure. This proof can be automatically checked with a proof assistant, such as Coq or HOL Light. It relies on a large companion library of facts that we have developed. This Coq library provides theorems dealing with addition, multiplication, division, and square root, for both fixed- and floating-point arithmetics. Gappa uses multiple-precision dyadic fractions for the endpoints of intervals and performs forward error analysis on rounded operators when necessary. When asked, Gappa reports the best bounds it is able to reach for a given expression in a given context. This feature can be used to identify where the set of facts and automatic techniques implemented in Gappa becomes insufficient. Gappa handles seamlessly additional properties expressed as interval properties or rewriting rules in order to establish more intricate bounds. Recent work showed that Gappa is suited to discharge proof obligations generated for small pieces of software. They may be produced by third-party tools and the first applications of Gappa use proof obligations written by designers or obtained from traces of execution.",

    "abstract": "The (sequential) algorithm of Multiple Relatively Robust Representations, MRRR, is a more efficient variant of inverse iteration that does not require reorthogonalization. It solves the eigenproblem of an unreduced symmetric tridiagonal matrix T ∈ R n × n at O ( n 2 ) cost. The computed normalized eigenvectors are numerically orthogonal in the sense that the dot product between different vectors is O ( n ϵ), where ϵ refers to the relative machine precision. This article describes the design of ScaLAPACK's parallel MRRR algorithm. One emphasis is on the critical role of the representation tree in achieving both adequate accuracy and parallel scalability. A second point concerns the favorable properties of this code: subset computation, the use of static memory, and scalability. Unlike ScaLAPACK's Divide &amp; Conquer and QR, MRRR can compute subsets of eigenpairs at reduced cost. And in contrast to inverse iterations which can fail, it is guaranteed to produce a satisfactory answer while maintaining memory scalability. ParEig, the parallel MRRR algorithm for PLAPACK, uses dynamic memory allocation. This is avoided by our code at marginal additional cost. We also use a different representation tree criterion that allows for more accurate computation of the eigenvectors but can make parallelization more difficult.",

    "abstract": "Multiphysics simulation software is plagued by complexity stemming from nonlinearly coupled systems of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Such software typically supports many models, which may require different transport equations, constitutive laws, and equations of state. Strong coupling and a multiplicity of models leads to complex algorithms (i.e., the properly ordered sequence of steps to assemble a discretized set of coupled PDEs) and rigid software. This work presents a design strategy that shifts focus away from high-level algorithmic concerns to low-level data dependencies. Mathematical expressions are represented as software objects that directly expose data dependencies. The entire system of expressions forms a directed acyclic graph and the high-level assembly algorithm is generated automatically through standard graph algorithms. This approach makes problems with complex dependencies entirely tractable, and removes virtually all logic from the algorithm itself. Changes are highly localized, allowing developers to implement models without detailed understanding of any algorithms (i.e., the overall assembly process). Furthermore, this approach complements existing MPI-based frameworks and can be implemented within them easily. Finally, this approach enables algorithmic parallelization via threads. By exposing dependencies in the algorithm explicitly, thread-based parallelism is implemented through algorithm decomposition, providing a basis for exploiting parallelism independent from domain decomposition approaches.",

The package TIDES provides an easy-to-use interface for standard double precision integrations, but also for quadruple precision and multiple precision integrations. The motivation for the development of this package is that more and more scientific disciplines need very high precision solution of ODEs, and a standard ODE method is not able to reach these precision levels. The TIDES package combines a preprocessor step in M athematica that generates Fortran or C programs with a library in C. Another capability of TIDES is the direct solution of sensitivities of the solution of ODE systems, which means that we can compute the solution of variational equations up to any order without formulating them explicitly. Different options of the software are discussed, and finally it is compared with other well-known available methods, as well as with different options of TIDES. From the numerical tests, TIDES is competitive, both in speed and accuracy, with standard methods, but it also provides new capabilities.",

    "abstract": "A toolbox called ADiGator is described for algorithmically differentiating mathematical functions in MATLAB. ADiGator performs source transformation via operator overloading using forward mode algorithmic differentiation and produces a file that can be evaluated to obtain the derivative of the original function at a numeric value of the input. A convenient by-product of the file generation is the sparsity pattern of the derivative function. Moreover, because both the input and output to the algorithm are source codes, the algorithm may be applied recursively to generate derivatives of any order. A key component of the algorithm is its ability to statically exploit derivative sparsity at the MATLAB operation level to improve runtime performance. The algorithm is applied to four different classes of example problems and is shown to produce runtime efficient derivative code. Due to the static nature of the approach, the algorithm is well suited and intended for use with problems requiring many repeated derivative computations.",

    "abstract": "We present “GEMM-like Tensor–Tensor multiplication” (GETT), a novel approach for dense tensor contractions that mirrors the design of a high-performance general matrix–matrix multiplication (GEMM). The critical insight behind GETT is the identification of three index sets, involved in the tensor contraction, which enable us to systematically reduce an arbitrary tensor contraction to loops around a highly tuned “macro-kernel.” This macro-kernel operates on suitably prepared (“packed”) sub-tensors that reside in a specified level of the cache hierarchy. In contrast to previous approaches to tensor contractions, GETT exhibits desirable features such as unit-stride memory accesses, cache-awareness, as well as full vectorization, without requiring auxiliary memory. We integrate GETT alongside the so-called Transpose–Transpose-GEMM-Transpose and Loops-over-GEMM approaches into an open source “Tensor Contraction Code Generator.” The performance results for a wide range of tensor contractions suggest that GETT has the potential of becoming the method of choice: While GETT exhibits excellent performance across the board, its effectiveness for bandwidth-bound tensor contractions is especially impressive, outperforming existing approaches by up to 12.4×. More precisely, GETT achieves speedups of up to 1.41× over an equivalent-sized GEMM for bandwidth-bound tensor contractions while attaining up to 91.3% of peak floating-point performance for compute-bound tensor contractions.",

Our library, called modred, handles a wide range of problems and any data format. The modred library contains implementations of the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), balanced POD (BPOD) Petrov-Galerkin projection, and a more efficient variant of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The library contains two implementations of these algorithms, each with its own advantages. One is for smaller and simpler datasets, requires minimal knowledge to use, and follows a common matrix-based formulation. The second, for larger and more complicated datasets, preserves the abstraction of vectors as elements of a vector space and, as a result, allows the library to work with arbitrary data formats and eases distributed memory parallelization. We also include implementations of the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA), and Observer/Kalman Filter Identification (OKID). These methods are typically not computationally demanding and are not parallelized. The library is designed to be easy to use, with an object-oriented design, and includes comprehensive automated tests. In almost all cases, parallelization is done internally so that scripts that use the parallelized classes can be run in serial or in parallel without any modifications.",

PUMI's mesh maintains links to the high-level model definition in terms of a model topology as produced by CAD systems, and is specifically designed to efficiently support evolving meshes as required for mesh generation and adaptation. To support the needs of parallel unstructured mesh simulations, PUMI also supports a specific set of services such as the migration of mesh entities between parts while maintaining the mesh adjacencies, maintaining read-only mesh entity copies from neighboring parts (ghosting), repartitioning parts as the mesh evolves, and dynamic mesh load balancing. Here we present the overall design, software structures, example programs, and performance results.

The implementations of the local integrals are optimized by vectorization over several cells and faces and an even-odd decomposition of the one-dimensional interpolations.

On 2×14 Broadwell cores, the throughput is up to 2.2 billion unknowns per second for the 3D Laplacian and up to 4 billion unknowns per second for the 3D advection on affine geometries, close to a simple copy operation at 4.7 billion unknowns per second.

Minor releases are produced as new features are incorporated. The present work describes NOMAD 4, a complete redesign of the previous version, with a new architecture providing more flexible code, added functionalities, and reusable code. We introduce algorithmic components, which are building blocks for more complex algorithms and can initiate other components, launch nested algorithms, or perform specialized tasks. They facilitate the implementation of new ideas, including the MegaSearchPoll component, warm and hot restarts, and a revised version of the PsdMads algorithm. Another main improvement of NOMAD 4 is the usage of parallelism, to simultaneously compute multiple blackbox evaluations and to maximize usage of available cores. Running different algorithms, tuning their parameters, and comparing their performance for optimization are simpler than before, while overall optimization performance is maintained between versions 3 and 4.

We present novel recursive blocked algorithms for solving one-sided triangular matrix equations, including the continuous-time Sylvester and Lyapunov equations, and a generalized coupled Sylvester equation. The main parts of the computations are performed as level-3 general matrix multiply and add (GEMM) operations.

We describe algorithms for the BLAS3 operations that are asymptotically faster than the conventional ones. These algorithms are based on Strassen's method for fast matrix multiplication, which is now recognized to be a practically useful technique once matrix dimensions exceed about 100. We pay particular attention to the numerical stability of these “fast BLAS3.” Error bounds are given and their significance is explained and illustrated with the aid of numerical experiments. Our conclusion is that the fast BLAS3, although not as strongly stable as conventional implementations, are stable enough to merit careful consideration in many applications.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete factorization has been shown to be a good preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method on a wide variety of problems. It is well known that allowing some fill-in during the incomplete factorization can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed for convergence. Allowing fill-in, however, increases the time for the factorization and for the triangular system solutions. Additionally, it is difficult to predict a priori how much fill-in to allow and how to allow it. The unpredictability of the required storage/work and the unknown benefits of the additional fill-in make such strategies impractical to use in many situations. In this article we motivate, and then present, two “black-box” strategies that significantly increase the effectiveness of incomplete Cholesky factorization as a preconditioner. These strategies require no parameters from the user and do not increase the cost of the triangular system solutions. Efficient implementations for these algorithms are described. These algorithms are shown to be successful for a variety of problems from the Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix collection.",

    "abstract": "The quest for reliable integration of initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a long-standing problem in numerical analysis. At one end of the reliability spectrum are fixed stepsize methods implemented using standard floating point, where the onus lies entirely with the user to ensure the stepsize chosen is adequate for the desired accuracy. At the other end of the reliability spectrum are rigorous interval-based methods, that can provide provably correct bounds on the error of a numerical solution. This rigour comes at a price, however: interval methods are generally two to three orders of magnitude more expensive than fixed stepsize floating-point methods. Along the spectrum between these two extremes lie various methods of different expense that estimate and control some measure of the local errors and adjust the stepsize accordingly. In this article, we continue previous investigations into a class of interpolants for use in Runge-Kutta methods that have a defect function whose qualitative behavior is asymptotically independent of the problem being integrated. In particular the point, in a step, where the maximum defect occurs as h → 0 is known a priori. This property allows the defect to be monitored and controlled in an efficient and robust manner even for modestly large stepsizes. Our interpolants also have a defect with the highest possible order given the constraints imposed by the order of the underlying discrete formula. We demonstrate the approach on three Runge-Kutta methods of orders 5, 6, and 8, and provide Fortran and preliminary Matlab interfaces to these three new integrators. We also consider how sensitive such methods are to roundoff errors. Numerical results for four problems on a range of accuracy requests are presented.",

    "abstract": "We present the design and testing of an algorithm for iterative refinement of the solution of linear equations where the residual is computed with extra precision. This algorithm was originally proposed in 1948 and analyzed in the 1960s as a means to compute very accurate solutions to all but the most ill-conditioned linear systems. However, two obstacles have until now prevented its adoption in standard subroutine libraries like LAPACK: (1) There was no standard way to access the higher precision arithmetic needed to compute residuals, and (2) it was unclear how to compute a reliable error bound for the computed solution. The completion of the new BLAS Technical Forum Standard has essentially removed the first obstacle. To overcome the second obstacle, we show how the application of iterative refinement can be used to compute an error bound in any norm at small cost and use this to compute both an error bound in the usual infinity norm, and a componentwise relative error bound.We report extensive test results on over 6.2 million matrices of dimensions 5, 10, 100, and 1000. As long as a normwise (componentwise) condition number computed by the algorithm is less than 1/ max{10, √n }ε w , the computed normwise (componentwise) error bound is at most 2 max{10, √n } · ε w , and indeed bounds the true error. Here, n is the matrix dimension and ε w = 2 -24 is the working precision. Residuals were computed in double precision (53 bits of precision). In other words, the algorithm always computed a tiny error at negligible extra cost for most linear systems. For worse conditioned problems (which we can detect using condition estimation), we obtained small correct error bounds in over 90% of cases.",

All of the approximations have maximum absolute (| W |&gt;1) or relative (| W |&lt;1) errors of O (10 −4 ). With these approximations an efficient algorithm, consisting of a single iteration of a rapidly converging iteration scheme, gives estimates of W(x) accurate to at least 16 significant digits (15 digits if double precision is used). The Fortran code resulting from the algorithm is written to account for the different floating-point-number mantissa lengths on different computers, so that W(x) is computed to the floating-point precision available on the host machine.",

The underlying algorithm is the well-known forward mode of automatic differentiation implemented via operator overloading on variables of the class fmad. The main distinguishing feature of this MATLAB implementation is the separation of the linear combination of derivative vectors into a separate derivative vector class derivvec. This allows for the straightforward performance optimization of the overall package. Additionally, by internally using a matrix (two-dimensional) representation of arbitrary dimension directional derivatives, we may utilize MATLAB's sparse matrix class to propagate sparse directional derivatives for MATLAB code which uses arbitrary dimension arrays. On several examples, the package is shown to be more efficient than Verma's ADMAT package [Verma 1998a].",

The basic method, a generalization of the NL2SOL algorithm for nonlinear least-squares, employs a model/trust-region scheme for computing trial steps, exploits special structure by maintaining a secant approximation to the second-order part of the Hessian, and adaptively switches between a Gauss-Newton and an augmented Hessian approximation. Gauss-Newton steps are computed using a corrected seminormal equations approach. The subroutines include variants that handle simple bounds on the parameters, and that compute approximate regression diagnostics.",

Various forms of generalized bisection were proposed some time ago for this task. This paper systematically compares such generalized bisection algorithms to themselves, to continuation methods, and to hybrid steepest descent/quasi-Newton methods. A specific algorithm containing novel “expansion” and “exclusion” steps is fully described, and the effectiveness of these steps is evaluated. A test problem consisting of a small, high-degree polynomial system that is appropriate for generalized bisection, but very difficult for continuation methods, is presented. This problem forms part of a set of 17 test problems from published literature on the methods being compared; this test set is fully described here.",

Several random graph models have been proposed that capture key properties of real-life networks. These models provide realistic, parametrized matrices for testing linear system and eigenvalue solvers. CONTEST (CONtrollable TEST matrices) is a random network toolbox for MATLAB that implements nine models. The models produce unweighted directed or undirected graphs; that is, symmetric or unsymmetric matrices with elements equal to zero or one. They have one or more parameters that affect features such as sparsity and characteristic pathlength and all can be of arbitrary dimension. Utility functions are supplied for rewiring, adding extra shortcuts and subsampling in order to create further classes of networks. Other utilities convert the adjacency matrices into real-valued coefficient matrices for naturally arising computational tasks that reduce to sparse linear system and eigenvalue problems.",

An option to the linear Shepard code is a statistically robust fit, intended to be used when the data is known to contain outliers. SHEPPACK also includes a hybrid robust piecewise linear estimation algorithm RIPPLE (residual initiated polynomial-time piecewise linear estimation) intended for data from piecewise linear functions in arbitrary dimension m . The main goal of SHEPPACK is to provide users with a single consistent package containing most existing polynomial variations of Shepard’s algorithm.

    "abstract": "Finite element methods approximate solutions of partial differential equations by restricting the problem to a finite dimensional function space. In hp adaptive finite element methods, one defines these discrete spaces by choosing different polynomial degrees for the shape functions defined on a locally refined mesh. Although this basic idea is quite simple, its implementation in algorithms and data structures is challenging. It has apparently not been documented in the literature in its most general form. Rather, most existing implementations appear to be for special combinations of finite elements, or for discontinuous Galerkin methods. In this article, we discuss generic data structures and algorithms used in the implementation of hp methods for arbitrary elements, and the complications and pitfalls one encounters. As a consequence, we list the information a description of a finite element has to provide to the generic algorithms for it to be used in an hp context. We support our claim that our reference implementation is efficient using numerical examples in two dimensions and three dimensions, and demonstrate that the hp -specific parts of the program do not dominate the total computing time. This reference implementation is also made available as part of the Open Source deal.II finite element library.",

Their main weakness is that the memory they require usually increases rapidly with problem size. We discuss the design and development of the first release of a new symmetric direct solver that aims to circumvent this limitation by allowing the system matrix, intermediate data, and the matrix factors to be stored externally. The code, which is written in Fortran and called HSL_MA77, implements a multifrontal algorithm. The first release is for positive-definite systems and performs a Cholesky factorization. Special attention is paid to the use of efficient dense linear algebra kernel codes that handle the full-matrix operations on the frontal matrix and to the input/output operations. The input/output operations are performed using a separate package that provides a virtual-memory system and allows the data to be spread over many files; for very large problems these may be held on more than one device. Numerical results are presented for a collection of 30 large real-world problems, all of which were solved successfully.",

We use a common base to implement all of the algorithms and compare their relative performance on a wide range of graphs and matrices. We systematize, develop, and use several ideas for enhancing performance. One of these ideas improves the performance of one of the existing algorithms in most cases, sometimes significantly.

MTGP supports large state sizes such as 11213 bits, and uses the high parallelism of GPUs in computing many steps of the recursion in parallel. The second proposal is a parameter-set generator for MTGP, named MTGP Dynamic Creator (MTGPDC). MTGPDC creates up to 2 32 distinct parameter sets which generate sequences with high-dimensional uniformity. This facility is suitable for a large grid of GPUs where each GPU requires separate random number streams. MTGP is based on linear recursion over the two-element field, and has better high-dimensional equidistribution than the Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number generator.",

It generates isotropic simplicial meshes—surface triangular meshes or volume tetrahedral meshes—from input surfaces, 3D domains, and 3D multidomains, with or without sharp features. The underlying meshing algorithm relies on restricted Delaunay triangulations to approximate domains and surfaces and on Delaunay refinement to ensure both approximation accuracy and mesh quality. CGALmesh provides guarantees on approximation quality and on the size and shape of the mesh elements. It provides four optional mesh optimization algorithms to further improve the mesh quality. A distinctive property of CGALmesh is its high flexibility with respect to the input domain representation. Such a flexibility is achieved through a careful software design, gathering into a single abstract concept, denoted by the oracle, all required interface features between the meshing engine and the input domain. We already provide oracles for domains defined by polyhedral and implicit surfaces.",

Like adaptive refinement for the h version of the finite element method, a posteriori error estimates can be used to determine where the mesh needs to be refined, but a single error estimate cannot simultaneously determine whether it is better to do the refinement by h or p . Several strategies for making this determination have been proposed over the years. These strategies are summarized, and the results of a numerical experiment to study the performance of these strategies is presented. It was found that the reference-solution-based methods are very effective, but also considerably more expensive, in terms of computation time, than other approaches. The method based on a priori knowledge is very effective when there are known point singularities. The method based on the decay rate of the expansion coefficients appears to be the best choice as a general strategy across all categories of problems, whereas many of the other strategies perform well in particular situations and are reasonable in general.",

Efforts have focused on symmetric positive-definite systems for which no pivoting is required, while little progress has been reported for the much harder indefinite case. We address this challenge by designing and developing a sparse symmetric indefinite solver SSIDS. This new library-quality LDL T factorization is designed for use on GPU architectures and incorporates threshold partial pivoting within a multifrontal approach. Both the factorize and the solve phases are performed using the GPU. Another important feature is that the solver produces bit-compatible results. Numerical results for indefinite problems arising from a range of practical applications demonstrate that, for large problems, SSIDS achieves performance improvements of up to a factor of 4.6 × compared with a state-of-the-art multifrontal solver on a multicore CPU.",

As illustrated via several tests, the randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation outperform or at least match the classical deterministic techniques (such as Lanczos iterations run to convergence) in basically all respects: accuracy, computational efficiency (both speed and memory usage), ease-of-use, parallelizability, and reliability. However, the classical procedures remain the methods of choice for estimating spectral norms and are far superior for calculating the least singular values and corresponding singular vectors (or singular subspaces).",

Riemannian optimization has been a topic of much interest over the past few years due to many applications including computer vision, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra. The substantial background required to successfully design and apply Riemannian optimization algorithms is a significant impediment for many potential users. Therefore, multiple packages, such as Manopt (in Matlab) and Pymanopt (in Python), have been developed. This article describes ROPTLIB, a C++ library for Riemannian optimization. Unlike prior packages, ROPTLIB simultaneously achieves the following goals: (i) it has user-friendly interfaces in Matlab, Julia, and C++; (ii) users do not need to implement manifold- and algorithm-related objects; (iii) it provides efficient computational time due to its C++ core; (iv) it implements state-of-the-art generic Riemannian optimization algorithms, including quasi-Newton algorithms; and (v) it is based on object-oriented programming, allowing users to rapidly add new algorithms and manifolds.",

    "abstract": "We consider the efficient and accurate computation of Givens rotations. When f and g are positive real numbers, this simply amounts to computing the values of c = f /√ f 2 + g 2 , s = g /√ f 2 + g 2 , and r = √ f 2 + g 2 . This apparently trivial computation merits closer consideration for the following three reasons. First, while the definitions of c , s and r seem obvious in the case of two nonnegative arguments f and g , there is enough freedom of choice when one or more of f and g are negative, zero or complex that LAPACK auxiliary routines SLARTG, CLARTG, SLARGV and CLARGV can compute rather different values of c , s and r for mathematically identical values of f and g . To eliminate this unnecessary ambiguity, the BLAS Technical Forum chose a single consistent definition of Givens rotations that we will justify here. Second, computing accurate values of c , s and r as efficiently as possible and reliably despite over/underflow is surprisingly complicated. For complex Givens rotations, the most efficient formulas require only one real square root and one real divide (as well as several much cheaper additions and multiplications), but a reliable implementation using only working precision has a number of cases. On a Sun Ultra-10, the new implementation is slightly faster than the previous LAPACK implementation in the most common case, and 2.7 to 4.6 times faster than the corresponding vendor, reference or ATLAS routines. It is also more reliable; all previous codes occasionally suffer from large inaccuracies due to over/underflow. For real Givens rotations, there are also improvements in speed and accuracy, though not as striking. Third, the design process that led to this reliable implementation is quite systematic, and could be applied to the design of similarly reliable subroutines.",

One of these techniques, a moving-grid method based on a Lagrangian description of the PDE and a smoothed-equidistribution principle to define the grid positions at each time level, has been coupled with a spatial discretization method that automatically discreizes the spatial part of the user-defined PDE following the method of lines approach. We supply two FORTRAN subroutines, CWRESU and CWRESX, which compute the residuals of the differential algebraic equations (DAE) system obtained from semidiscretizing, respectively, the PDE and the set of moving-grid equations. These routines are combined in an enveloping routine SKMRES, which delivers the residuals of the complete DAE system. To solve this stiff, nonlinear DAE system, a robust and efficient time-integrator must be applied, for example, a BDF method such as implemented in the DAE solvers SPRINT [Berzins and Furzeland 1985; 1986; Berzins et al. 1989] and DASSL [Brenan et al. 1989; Petzold 1983].

Building on our successful recursive approach applied to one-sided matrix equations (Part I), we now present novel recursive blocked algorithms for two-sided matrix equations, which include matrix product terms such as AXB T . Examples are the discrete-time standard and generalized Sylvester and Lyapunov equations. The means for achieving high performance is the recursive variable blocking, which has the potential of matching the memory hierarchies of today's high-performance computing systems, and level-3 computations which mainly are performed as GEMM operations. Different implementation issues are discussed, including the design of efficient new algorithms for two-sided matrix products. We present uniprocessor and SMP parallel performance results of recursive blocked algorithms and routines in the state-of-the-art SLICOT library. Although our recursive algorithms with optimized kernels for the two-sided matrix equations perform more operations, the performance improvements are remarkable, including 10-fold speedups or more, compared to standard algorithms.",

Its design is based on domain analysis of numerical integrators for molecular dynamics (MD) and of fast solvers for the force computation, particularly due to electrostatic interactions.

Our main idea in the accurate tables method is to use “nonstandard tables,” which are different from the natural tables of equally spaced points in which the rounding error prevents obtaining last bit accuracy. In order to achieve a small error we use the following idea: Perturb the original, equally spaced, points in such a way that the table value (or tables values in case we need several tables) will be very close to numbers which can be exactly represented by the computer (much closer than the usual double percision representation). Thus we were able to control the error introduced by the computer representation of real numbers and extended the accuracy without actually using extended precision arithmetic.",

Our purpose is to provide useful information on solving polynomial systems, including specific guidelines for homotopy construction and parameter settings.

In this article, Vitter's reservoir-sampling algorithm, algorithm Z, is modified to give a more efficient algorithm, algorithm K. Additionally, two new algorithms, algorithm L and algorithm M, are proposed. If the time for scanning the population is ignored, all the four algorithms have expected CPU time O ( n (1 + log( N / n ))), which is optimum up to a constant factor. Expressions of the expected CPU time for the algorithms are presented. Among the four, algorithm L is the simplest, and algorithm M is the most efficient when n and N / n are large and N is O ( n 2 ).",

The most important aim of filib is the fast computation of guaranteed bounds for interval versions of a comprehensive set of elementary functions. filib++ extends this library in two aspects. First, it adds a second mode, the extended mode, that extends the exception-free computation mode (using special values to represent infinities and NaNs known from the IEEE floating-point standard 754) to intervals. In this mode, the so-called containment sets are computed to enclose the topological closure of a range of a function over an interval. Second, our new design uses templates and traits classes to obtain an efficient, easily extendable, and portable C++ library.",

This paper will concentrate on the third component, and will report on the improvement in the performance of PDECOL resulting from replacing the current linear algebra modules of the code by modules which take full advantage of the special structure of the equations which arise.

The concept of a model management system (MMS) is introduced and compared to traditional modeling systems. An MMS is seen as a much more generalized software system that requires the confluence of existing operations research, database management, and artificial intelligence techniques. By incorporating powerful, abstraction-based representation structures, an MMS can support multiple levels of model abstraction, only one of which corresponds to traditional, solution-oriented modeling software. The database structures required to implement a knowledge-based MMS are discussed and a prototype system for mathematical programming, the Generalized eXperimental Math Programming system (GXMP), is described. An algebraic language developed for use in GXMP is described in detail.",

We state different algorithms for each of these sweeps as well as algorithms that compute the result in a single sweep. One algorithm outperforms the current ScaLAPACK implementation by 20-30 percent due to improved load-balance on a distributed memory architecture.",

The code extensibility and the rapid algorithm prototyping capability enabled by this programming paradigm promise to enhance the reliability, utility, and ease of use of optimization software. While the use of object-oriented programming is growing, there are still few examples of general purpose codes written in this manner, and a common approach is far from obvious. This paper describes OPT++, a C++ class library for nonlinear optimization. The design is predicated on the concept of distinguishing between an algorithm-independent class hierarchy for nonlinear optimization problems and a class hierarchy for nonlinear optimization methods that is based on common algorithmic traits. The interface is designed for ease of use while being general enough so that new optimization algorithms can be added easily to the existing framework. A number of nonlinear optimization algorithms have been implemented in OPT++ and are accessible through this interface. Furthermore, example applications demonstrate the simplicity of the interface as well as the advantages of a common interface in comparing multiple algorithms.",

    "abstract": "In the past two decades, some major efforts have been made to reduce exact (e.g. integer, rational, polynomial) linear algebra problems to matrix multiplication in order to provide algorithms with optimal asymptotic complexity. To provide efficient implementations of such algorithms one need to be careful with the underlying arithmetic. It is well known that modular techniques such as the Chinese remainder algorithm or the p -adic lifting allow very good practical performance, especially when word size arithmetic is used. Therefore, finite field arithmetic becomes an important core for efficient exact linear algebra libraries. In this article, we study high performance implementations of basic linear algebra routines over word size prime fields: especially matrix multiplication; our goal being to provide an exact alternate to the numerical BLAS library. We show that this is made possible by a careful combination of numerical computations and asymptotically faster algorithms. Our kernel has several symbolic linear algebra applications enabled by diverse matrix multiplication reductions: symbolic triangularization, system solving, determinant, and matrix inverse implementations are thus studied.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel, online algorithm for exact summation of a stream of floating-point numbers. By “online” we mean that the algorithm needs to see only one input at a time, and can take an arbitrary length input stream of such inputs while requiring only constant memory. By “exact” we mean that the sum of the internal array of our algorithm is exactly equal to the sum of all the inputs, and the returned result is the correctly-rounded sum. The proof of correctness is valid for all inputs (including nonnormalized numbers but modulo intermediate overflow), and is independent of the number of summands or the condition number of the sum. The algorithm asymptotically needs only 5 FLOPs per summand, and due to instruction-level parallelism runs only about 2--3 times slower than the obvious, fast-but-dumb “ordinary recursive summation” loop when the number of summands is greater than 10,000. Thus, to our knowledge, it is the fastest, most accurate, and most memory efficient among known algorithms. Indeed, it is difficult to see how a faster algorithm or one requiring significantly fewer FLOPs could exist without hardware improvements. An application for a large number of summands is provided.",

    "abstract": "A MATLAB 6.0 implementation of the LSTRS method is presented. LSTRS was described in Rojas et al. [2000]. LSTRS is designed for large-scale quadratic problems with one norm constraint. The method is based on a reformulation of the trust-region subproblem as a parameterized eigenvalue problem, and consists of an iterative procedure that finds the optimal value for the parameter. The adjustment of the parameter requires the solution of a large-scale eigenvalue problem at each step. LSTRS relies on matrix-vector products only and has low and fixed storage requirements, features that make it suitable for large-scale computations. In the MATLAB implementation, the Hessian matrix of the quadratic objective function can be specified either explicitly, or in the form of a matrix-vector multiplication routine. Therefore, the implementation preserves the matrix-free nature of the method. A description of the LSTRS method and of the MATLAB software, version 1.2, is presented. Comparisons with other techniques and applications of the method are also included. A guide for using the software and examples are provided.",

Jones' deterministic global optimization algorithm called DIRECT , which is widely used in multidisciplinary engineering design, biological science, and physical science applications. The package includes both a serial code and a data-distributed massively parallel code for different problem scales and optimization (exploration vs. exploitation) goals. Dynamic data structures are used to organize local data, handle unpredictable memory requirements, reduce the memory usage, and share the data across multiple processors. The parallel code employs a multilevel functional and data parallelism to boost concurrency and mitigate the data dependency, thus improving the load balancing and scalability. In addition, checkpointing features are integrated into both versions to provide fault tolerance and hot restarts. Important algorithm modifications and design considerations are discussed regarding data structures, parallel schemes, error handling, and portability. Using several benchmark functions and real-world applications, the software is evaluated on different systems in terms of optimization effectiveness, data structure efficiency, parallel performance, and checkpointing overhead. The package organization and usage are also described in detail.",

    "abstract": "Transmission eigenvalue problem has important applications in inverse scattering. Since the problem is non-self-adjoint, the computation of transmission eigenvalues needs special treatment. Based on a fourth-order reformulation of the transmission eigenvalue problem, a mixed finite element method is applied. The method has two major advantages: 1) the formulation leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem naturally without the need to invert a related linear system, and 2) the nonphysical zero transmission eigenvalue, which has an infinitely dimensional eigenspace, is eliminated. To solve the resulting non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem, an iterative algorithm using restarted Arnoldi method is proposed. To make the computation efficient, the search interval is decided using a Faber-Krahn type inequality for transmission eignevalues and the interval is updated at each iteration. The algorithm is implemented using Matlab. The code can be easily used in the qualitative methods in inverse scattering and modified to compute transmission eigenvalues for other models such as elasticity problem.",

The method implements forward-mode automatic differentiation via operator overloading in a manner that produces a new MATLAB code that computes the derivatives of the outputs of the original function with respect to the differentiation variables. Because the derivative code has the same input as the original function code, the method can be used recursively to generate derivatives of any order desired. In addition, the approach developed in this article has the feature that the derivatives are generated by simply evaluating the function on an instance of the class, thus making the method straightforward to use while simultaneously enabling differentiation of highly complex functions. A detailed description of the method is presented and the approach is illustrated and shown to be efficient on four examples.",

As a result, a set of candidate points is created, where the signs of the real and imaginary parts of the function change simultaneously. To verify and refine the results, an iterative algorithm is applied. The validity of the presented technique is supported by the results obtained in numerical tests involving three different types of functions.",

    "abstract": "KBLAS is an open-source, high-performance library that provides optimized kernels for a subset of Level 2 BLAS functionalities on CUDA-enabled GPUs. Since performance of dense matrix-vector multiplication is hindered by the overhead of memory accesses, a double-buffering optimization technique is employed to overlap data motion with computation. After identifying a proper set of tuning parameters, KBLAS efficiently runs on various GPU architectures while avoiding code rewriting and retaining compliance with the standard BLAS API. Another optimization technique allows ensuring coalesced memory access when dealing with submatrices, especially for high-level dense linear algebra algorithms. All KBLAS kernels have been leveraged to a multi-GPU environment, which requires the introduction of new APIs. Considering general matrices, KBLAS is very competitive with existing state-of-the-art kernels and provides a smoother performance across a wide range of matrix dimensions. Considering symmetric and Hermitian matrices, the KBLAS performance outperforms existing state-of-the-art implementations on all matrix sizes and achieves asymptotically up to 50% and 60% speedup against the best competitor on single GPU and multi-GPUs systems, respectively. Performance results also validate our performance model. A subset of KBLAS high-performance kernels have been integrated into NVIDIA's standard BLAS implementation (cuBLAS) for larger dissemination, starting from version 6.0.",

The key factor controlling FSAI efficiency is the identification of an appropriate nonzero pattern. Currently, several strategies have been proposed for building such a nonzero pattern, using both static and dynamic techniques. This article describes a fresh software package, called FSAIPACK, which we developed for shared memory parallel machines. It collects all available algorithms for computing FSAI preconditioners. FSAIPACK allows for combining different techniques according to any specified strategy, hence enabling the user to thoroughly exploit the potential of each preconditioner, in solving any peculiar problem. FSAIPACK is freely available as a compiled library at http://www.dmsa.unipd.it/~janna/software.html, together with an open-source command language interpreter. By writing a command ASCII file, one can easily perform and test any given strategy for building an FSAI preconditioner. Numerical experiments are discussed in order to highlight the FSAIPACK features and evaluate its computational performance.",

Nonetheless, many of the weaknesses of xorshift generators fade away if their result is scrambled by a nonlinear operation (as originally suggested by Marsaglia). In this article we explore the space of possible generators obtained by multiplying the result of a xorshift generator by a suitable constant. We sample generators at 100 points of their state space and obtain detailed statistics that lead us to choices of parameters that improve on the current ones. We then explore for the first time the space of high-dimensional xorshift generators, following another suggestion in Marsaglia's article, finding choices of parameters providing periods of length 2 1024 − 1 and 2 4096 − 1. The resulting generators are of extremely high quality, faster than current similar alternatives, and generate long-period sequences passing strong statistical tests using only eight logical operations, one addition, and one multiplication by a constant.",

Thus, in contrast to existing methods, it is possible to generate normal deviates exactly rounded to any precision with a mean cost that scales linearly in the precision. The method performs no extended precision arithmetic, calls no transcendental functions, and, indeed, uses no floating point arithmetic whatsoever; it uses only simple integer operations.

This coupling naturally induces staggered grids in space and time, which in turn give rise to a canonical, second-order accurate finite difference scheme. While the scheme does not possess TVD or realizability limiters, its simplicity allows for a very efficient implementation in Matlab. We present several test cases, some of which demonstrate that the code solves problems with ten million degrees of freedom in space, angle, and time within a few seconds.

However, existing reranking algorithms can only achieve limited improvement because of the well-known semantic gap between low level visual features and high level semantic concepts. In this paper, we adopt interactive video search reranking to bridge the semantic gap by introducing user's labeling effort. We propose a novel dimension reduction tool, termed sparse transfer learning (STL), to effectively and efficiently encode user's labeling information. STL is particularly designed for interactive video search reranking. Technically, it a) considers the pair-wise discriminative information to maximally separate labeled query relevant samples from labeled query irrelevant ones, b) achieves a sparse representation for the subspace to encodes user's intention by applying the elastic net penalty, and c) propagates user's labeling information from labeled samples to unlabeled samples by using the data distribution knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on the TRECVID 2005, 2006 and 2007 benchmark datasets and compared STL with popular dimension reduction algorithms. We report superior performance by using the proposed STL based interactive video search reranking.",

We call these tools general template units because they are well-defined building blocks (units) for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs), are based on the use of templates of the C++ language, and can be applied in the solution of different kinds of problems. We focus on the solution of PDEs using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) in box-shaped domains. The three concepts just mentioned are intensively used to generate optimized codes for each case study. The convenience of our approach is highlighted in the numerical solutions of the examples of application, including laminar thermal convection, turbulent thermal convection, as well as a two-phase flow model in porous media, all of them in one, two, and three dimensions. The mathematical models of these examples were obtained using the axiomatic formulation, which provides generality, simplicity, and clarity to tackle any continuum mechanics application. The ideas explained in this work are quite simple but powerful in solving fluid dynamics problems, in which the conservativeness of the FVM is an important feature. The techniques developed in this work allow us to swap easily between numerical schemes for computing the coefficients obtained by applying the FVM.",

It supports exhaustive and random searches, as well as component-by-component (CBC) and random CBC constructions, for any number of points, and for various measures of (non)uniformity of the points. The measures currently implemented are all shift-invariant and represent the worst-case integration error for certain classes of integrands. They include, for example, the weighted Pα square discrepancy, the Rα criterion, and figures of merit based on the spectral test, with projection-dependent weights. Each of these measures can be computed as a finite sum. For the Pα and Rα criteria, efficient specializations of the CBC algorithm are provided for projection-dependent, order-dependent, and product weights. For numbers of points that are integer powers of a prime base, the construction of embedded rank-1 lattice rules is supported through any of these algorithms, and through a fast CBC algorithm, with a variety of possibilities for the normalization of the merit values of individual embedded levels and for their combination into a single merit value. The library is extensible, thanks to the decomposition of the algorithms into decoupled components, which makes it easy to implement new types of weights, new search domains, new figures of merit, and so on.",

    "abstract": "Our goal is compression of massive-scale grid-structured data, such as the multi-terabyte output of a high-fidelity computational simulation. For such data sets, we have developed a new software package called TuckerMPI, a parallel C++/MPI software package for compressing distributed data. The approach is based on treating the data as a tensor, i.e., a multidimensional array, and computing its truncated Tucker decomposition, a higher-order analogue to the truncated singular value decomposition of a matrix. The result is a low-rank approximation of the original tensor-structured data. Compression efficiency is achieved by detecting latent global structure within the data, which we contrast to most compression methods that are focused on local structure. In this work, we describe TuckerMPI, our implementation of the truncated Tucker decomposition, including details of the data distribution and in-memory layouts, the parallel and serial implementations of the key kernels, and analysis of the storage, communication, and computational costs. We test the software on 4.5 terabyte and 6.7 terabyte data sets distributed across 100s of nodes (1000s of MPI processes), achieving compression rates between 100-200,000$\\times$ which equates to 99-99.999% compression (depending on the desired accuracy) in substantially less time than it would take to even read the same dataset from a parallel filesystem. Moreover, we show that our method also allows for reconstruction of partial or down-sampled data on a single node, without a parallel computer so long as the reconstructed portion is small enough to fit on a single machine, e.g., in the instance of reconstructing/visualizing a single down-sampled time step or computing summary statistics.",

Hence, we attain both an improved average performance and an improved order of convergence with no cost on the minmax optimality of the bisection method. Numerical experiments show that, on regular functions, the proposed method requires a number of function evaluations similar to current state-of-the-art methods, about 24% to 37% of the evaluations required by the bisection procedure. In problems with non-regular functions, the proposed method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art, requiring on average 82% of the total evaluations required for the bisection method, while the other methods were outperformed by bisection.

The traversal can exploit regular grid subregions and shared memory as well as distributed memory systems with almost no modifications to a serial application code. We formalize the software design by means of two interacting automata---one automaton for the multiscale grid traversal and one for the application-specific algorithmic steps. This yields a callback-based programming paradigm. We further sketch the supported application types and the two data storage schemes realized, before we detail high-performance computing aspects and lessons learned.

Fast and efficient methods for their soltion are very important because these systems usually occur in the innermost loop of the computational scheme. Parallelization is often necessary to achieve an acceptable level of performance. This paper presents the design, implementation, and interface of a library of Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines for sparse matrices (PSBLAS) which is specifically tailored to distributed-memory computers. PSBLAS enables easy, efficient, and portable implementations of parallel iterative solvers for linear systems. The interface keeps in view a Single Program Multiple Data programming model on distributed-memory machines. However, the architecture of the library does not exclude an implementation in different paradigms, such as those based on the shared-memory model.",

We have previously proposed an approach for dealing with this task by processing performance data of the targeted software. This approach has been tested using a customized implementation referred to as PYTHIA. This experience made us realize the complexity of the algorithmic discovery of knowledge from performance data and of the management of these data together with the discovered knowledge. To address this issue, we created PYTHIA-II—a modular framework and system which combines a general knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) methodology and recommender system technologies to provide advice about scientific software/hardware artifacts. The functionality and effectiveness of the system is demonstrated for two existing performance studies using sets of software for solving partial differential equations. From the end-user perspective, PYTHIA-II allows users to specify the problem to be solved and their computational objectives. In turn, PYTHIA-II (i) selects the software available for the user's problem (ii) suggests parameter values, and (iii) assesses the recommendation provided. PYTHIA-II provides all the necessary facilities to set up database schemas for testing suites and associated performance data in order to test sets of software. Moreover, it allows easy interfacing of alternative data mining and recommendation facilities. PYTHIA-II is an open-ended system implemented on public domain software and has been used for performance evaluation in several different problem domains.",

The scope of this PSE is broad, as PELLPACK incorporates many PDE solving systems, and some of these, in turn, include several specific PDE solving methods. Its coverage for 1D, 2D. and 3D elliptic or parabolic problems is quite broad, and it handles some hyperbolic problems, Since a PSE should provided complete support for the problem-solving process, PELLPACK also contains a large amount of code to support graphical user interfaces, analystic tools, user help, domain or mesh partitioning, machine and data selection, visualization, and various other tasks. Its total size is well over 1 million lines code. Its open-ended software architecture consists of several software layers. The top layer is an interactive graphical interface for specifying the PDE model and its solution framework This interface saves that results of the user specification in the form of a very high level PDE language which is an alternative interface to the PELLPACK system. This language also allows a user to specify the PDE problem and its solution framework textually in a natural form. The PELLPACK language preprocessor generates a Fortran control program with the interfaces, calls to specified components and libraries of the PDE solution framework, and functions defining the PDE problem. The PELLPACK program execution is supported by a hign-level tool where the virtual parallel system is defined, where the compilation, loading, and execution are controlled. Finally, the PELLPACK PSE integrates several PDE libraries and PDE systems based on the decomposition of discrete geometric data to map sparse PDE computations to parallel machines. An instance of the system is available as a Web server (WebPELLPACK) for public use at http://pellpack.cs.purdue.edu.",

    "abstract": "In the recently presented sparse matrix extension of MATLAB, there is no routine for sparse QR factorization. Sparse linear least-squares problems are instead solved by the augmented system method. The accuracy in computed solutions is strongly dependent on a scaling parameter δ. Its optimal value is expensive to compute, and it must therefore be approximated by a simple heuristic. We describe a multifrontal method for sparse QR factorization and its implementation in MATLAB. It is well known that the multifrontal approach is suitable for vector machines. We show that it is also attractive in MATLAB. In both cases, scalar operations are expensive, and the reformulation of the sparse problem into dense subproblems is advantageous. Using the new routine, we implement two methods for the solution of sparse linear least-squares problems and compare these with the built-in MATLAB function. We show that the QR-based methods normally are much faster and more accurate than the MATLAB implementation of the augmented system method. A better choice of the parameter δ or iterative refinement must be used to make the augmented system method as accurate as the methods based on QR factorization.",

    "abstract": "Block algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in matrix computations. Since their basic unit of data is a submatrix rather than a scalar, they have a higher level of granularity than point algorithms, and this makes them well suited to high-performance computers. The numerical stability of the block algorithms in the new linear algebra program library LAPACK is investigated here. It is shown that these algorithms have backward error analyses in which the backward error bounds are commensurate with the error bounds for the underlying level-3 BLAS (BLAS3). One implication is that the block algorithms are as stable as the corresponding point algorithms when conventional BLAS3 are used. A second implication is that the use of BLAS3 based on fast matrix multiplication techniques affects the stability only insofar as it increases the constant terms in the normwise backward error bounds. For linear equation solvers employing LU factorization, it is shown that fixed precision iterative refinement helps to mitigate the effect of the larger error constants. Despite the positive results presented here, not all plausible block algorithms are stable; we illustrate this with the example of LU factorization with block triangular factors and describe how to check a block algorithm for stability without doing a full error analysis.",

In large scale problems, the Hessian matrix is usually sparse, and then estimation by differences of gradients is attractive because the number of differences can be small compared to the dimension of the problem. In this paper we describe a set of subroutines whose purpose is to estimate the Hessian matrix with the least possible number of gradient evaluations.",

An overview of the method is given for general domains, followed by a discussion of the improved efficiencies and simplifications possible for rectangular domains. A very-high-level description is given of three specific collocation algorithms that use Hermite bicubic basic functions, (1) GENCOL (collocation on general two-dimensional domains), (2) HERMCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with general linear boundary conditions), and (3) INTCOL (collocation on rectangular domains with uncoupled boundary conditions). The linear system resulting from INTCOL has half the bandwidth of that from HERMCOL, which provides substantial benefit in solving the system. We provide some examples showing the range of applicability of the algorithms and some performance profiles illustrating their efficiency. Fortran implementations of these algorithms are given in the companion papers [10, 11].",

Methods of these classes compute differential operators on the sphere and are used to solve simple partial differential equations in a spherical geometry. The spectral synthesis and analysis algorithms using fast Fourier transforms and Legendre transforms with the associated Legendre functions are presented in detail. A set of methods associated with a spectral_field class provides spectral approximation to the differential operators ∇ ⋯, ∇ ×, ∇, and ∇ 2 in spherical geometry. Laplace inversion and Helmholtz equation solvers are also methods for this class. The use of the class and methods in MATLAB is demonstrated by the solution of the barotropic vorticity equation on the sphere. A survey of alternative algorithms is given and implementations for parallel high performance computers are discussed in the context of global climate and weather models.",

    "abstract": "We present concurrent algorithms for the solution of narrow banded systems on ensemble architectures, and analyze the communication and arithmetic complexities of the algorithms. The algorithms consist of three phases. In phase 1, a block tridiagonal system of reduced size is produced through largely local operations. Diagonal dominance is preserved. If the original system is positive, definite, and symmetric, so is the reduced system. It is solved in a second phase, and the remaining variables obtained through local back substitution in a third phase. With a sufficient number of processing elements, there is no first and third phase. We investigate the arithmetic and communicationcomplexity of Gaussian elimination and block cyclic reduction for the solution of the reduced system on boolean cubes, perfect shuffle and shuffle-exchange networks, binary trees, and linear arrays. With an optimum number of processors, the minimum solution time on a linear array is of an order that ranges from O(m 2 √Nm) to O(m 3 + m 3 log 2 ( N/m )) depending on the bandwidth, the dimension of the problem, and the times for communication and arithmetic. For boolean cubes, cube-connected cycles, prefect shuffle and shuffle-exchange networks, and binary trees, the minimum time is O(m 3 +m 3 log 2 (N/m)) including the communication complexity",

We have developed an open-source software package a --TRLan to include this adaptive scheme in the TRLan method. When applied to calculate the electronic structure of quantum dots, a --TRLan runs up to 2.3x faster than a state-of-the-art preconditioned conjugate gradient eigensolver.",

This leads to a robust and optimally efficient stopping criterion: the iteration is terminated as soon as the algebraic error is insignificant compared to the approximation error. We describe a “proof of concept” MATLAB implementation of this algorithm, which we call EST_MINRES , and we illustrate its effectiveness when integrated into the Incompressible Flow Iterative Solution Software (IFISS) package (cf.

Although a number of strategies addressing this problem have been investigated in several communities, we are not aware of any robust algorithm, and present the first such algorithm. Our calculation relies on the decomposition of the volume of the union into convex regions, namely the restrictions of the balls to their regions in the power diagram. Theoretically, we establish a formula for the volume of a restriction, based on Gauss' divergence theorem. The proof being constructive, we develop the associated algorithm. On the implementation side, we carefully analyse the predicates and constructions involved in the volume calculation, and present a certified implementation relying on interval arithmetic. The result is certified in the sense that the exact volume belongs to the interval computed. Experimental results are presented on hand-crafted models illustrating various difficulties, as well as on the 58,898 models found in the tenth of July 2009 release of the Protein Data Bank.",

In the case of symmetric indefinite systems, it may be necessary to modify this sequence during the factorization to ensure numerical stability. These modifications can have serious consequences in terms of time as well as the memory and flops required for the factorization and subsequent solves. This study focuses on hard-to-solve sparse symmetric indefinite problems for which standard threshold partial pivoting leads to significant modifications. We perform a detailed review of pivoting strategies that are aimed at reducing the modifications without compromising numerical stability. Extensive numerical experiments are performed on a set of tough problems arising from practical applications.

IDR( s ) is based on the induced dimension reduction theorem, that provides a way to construct subsequent residuals that lie in a sequence of shrinking subspaces. The IDR( s ) algorithm that is given in Sonneveld and van Gijzen [2008] is a direct translation of the theorem into an algorithm. This translation is not unique. This article derives a new IDR( s ) variant, that imposes (one-sided) biorthogonalization conditions on the iteration vectors. The resulting method has lower overhead in vector operations than the original IDR( s ) algorithms. In exact arithmetic, both algorithms give the same residual at every ( s + 1)-st step, but the intermediate residuals and also the numerical properties differ. We show through numerical experiments that the new variant is more stable and more accurate than the original IDR( s ) algorithm, and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques for realistic test problems.",

Mapping these curves to twisted Edwards curves allowed deriving two new signature instances, called Ed25519 and Ed448, of the Edwards Digital Signature Algorithm. In this work, we focus on the secure and efficient software implementation of these algorithms using SIMD parallel processing. We present software techniques that target the Intel AVX2 vector instruction set for accelerating prime field arithmetic and elliptic curve operations. Our contributions result in a high-performance software library for AVX2-ready processors. For example, our library computes digital signatures 19% (for Ed25519) and 29% (for Ed448) faster than previous optimized implementations.

The toolbox uses customised QUADPACK and IMSL functions from a MATLAB conversion of the SLATEC library. In addition, MATLAB 's own quadgk function for adaptive Gauss-Kronrod quadrature results in a significant speed up compared with the original algorithm. Usage of IIPBF is described and eighteen test cases illustrate the robustness of the toolbox; five additional ones are used to compare IIPBF with the BESSELINT code for rational and exponential forms of f ( x ) with J a (ρ x ) J b (τ x ). Reliability for a broad range of values of ρ and τ for the three different product types as well as different orders in one case is demonstrated.

Previous SpMV libraries are optimized by either application-specific or architecture-specific approaches but present difficulties for use in real applications. In this work, we develop an auto-tuning system (SMATER) to bridge the gap between specific optimizations and general-purpose use. SMATER provides programmers a unified interface based on the compressed sparse row (CSR) sparse matrix format by implicitly choosing the best format and fastest implementation for any input sparse matrix during runtime. SMATER leverages a machine-learning model and retargetable back-end library to quickly predict the optimal combination. Performance parameters are extracted from 2,386 matrices in the SuiteSparse matrix collection. The experiments show that SMATER achieves good performance (up to 10 times that of the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) on Intel E5-2680 v3) while being portable on state-of-the-art x86 multicore processors, NVIDIA GPUs, and Intel Xeon Phi accelerators. Compared with the Intel MKL library, SMATER runs faster by more than 2.5 times on average.

An element order imposed by the Sierpinski space-filling curve provides an algorithm for grid generation, refinement, and traversal that is inherently memory efficient. Based purely on stack and stream data structures, it completely avoids random memory access. Using an element-oriented data view suitable for local operators, concrete simulation scenarios are implemented based on control loops and event hooks, which hide the complexity of the underlying traversal scheme.

Sections defined by contiguous grid cells define atomic tasks for OpenMP work sharing and stealing, as well as for migration of grid cells between MPI processes. Using optimized communication and load balancing algorithms, sam(oa) 2 achieves 88% strong scaling efficiency from 16 to 512 cores and 92% efficiency in a weak scaling test on 8,192 cores with 10 billion elements—all tests including adaptive mesh refinement and load balancing in each time step.",

The focus is on many independent BLAS operations on small matrices that are grouped together and processed by a single routine, called a Batched BLAS routine. The matrices are grouped together in uniformly sized groups, with just one group if all the matrices are of equal size. The aim is to provide more efficient, but portable, implementations of algorithms on high-performance many-core platforms. These include multicore and many-core CPU processors, GPUs and coprocessors, and other hardware accelerators with floating-point compute facility. As well as the standard types of single and double precision, we also include half and quadruple precision in the standard. In particular, half precision is used in many very large scale applications, such as those associated with machine learning.",

Each sequential algorithm is implemented in two ways: using static and dynamic data structures for more efficient information storage and organization. Furthermore, parallel schemes are applied to some promising algorithms within DIRECTGO . The toolbox is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI), ensuring the user-friendly use of all functionalities available in DIRECTGO . Available features are demonstrated in detailed computational studies using a comprehensive DIRECTGOLib v1.0 library of global optimization test problems. Additionally, 11 classical engineering design problems illustrate the potential of DIRECTGO to solve challenging real-world problems. Finally, the appendix gives examples of accompanying MATLAB programs and provides a synopsis of its use on the test problems with box and general constraints.",

    "abstract": "A new compact way to store a symmetric or triangular matrix called RPF for Recursive Packed Format is fully described. Novel ways to transform RPF to and from standard packed format are included. A new algorithm, called RPC for Recursive Packed Cholesky, that operates on the RPG format is presented. ALgorithm RPC is basd on level-3 BLAS and requires variants of algorithms TRSM and SYRK that work on RPF. We call these RP_TRSM and RP_SYRK and find that they do most of their work by calling GEMM . It follows that most of the execution time of RPC lies in GEMM . The advantage of this storage scheme compared to traditional packed and full storage is demonstrated. First, the RPC storage format uses the minimal amount of storage for the symmetric or triangular matrix. Second, RPC gives a level-3 implementation of Cholesky factorization whereas standard packed implementations are only level 2. Hence, the performance of our RPC implementation is decidedly superior. Third, unlike fixed block size algorithms, RPC, requires no block size tuning parameter. We present performance measurements on several current architectures that demonstrate improvements over the traditional packed routines. Also MSP parallel computations on the IBM SMP computer are made. The graphs that are attached in Section 7 show that the RPC algorithms are superior by a factor between 1.6 and 7.4 for order around 1000, and between 1.9 and 10.3 for order around 3000 over the traditional packed algorithms. For some architectures, the RPC performance results are almost the same or even better than the traditional full-storage algorithms results.",

By the technique known as automatic differentiation, theoretically exact results are obtained using numerical (as opposed to symbolic) manipulation. The key ideas are a hyperpyramid data structure and a generalized Leibniz's rule. Any expression in n variables corresponds to a hyperpyramid array, in n -dimensional space, containing the numerical values of all unique partial derivatives (not wasting space on different permutations of derivatives). The arrays for simple expressions are combined by hyperpyramid operators to form the arrays for more complicated expressions. These operators are facilitated by a generalized Leibniz's rule which, given a product of multivariable functions, produces any partial derivative by forming the minimum number of products (between two lower partials) together with a product of binomial coefficients. The algorithms are described in abstract pseudo-code. A section on implementation shows how these ideas can be converted into practical and efficient programs in a typical computing environment. For any specific problem, only the expression itself would require recoding.",

In this article we consider variants of the method of Arnoldi and discuss the design and development of a code to implement these methods. The new code, which is called EB13 , offers the user the choice of a basic Arnoldi algorithm, an Arnoldi algorithm with Chebychev acceleration, and a Chebychev preconditioned Arnoldi algorithm. Each method is available in blocked and unblocked form. The code may be used to compute either the rightmost eigenvalues, the eigenvalues of largest absolute value, or the eigenvalues of largest imaginary part. The performance of each option in the EB13 package is compared with that of subspace iteration on a range of test problems, and on the basis of the results, advice is offered to the user on the appropriate choice of method. — Author's Abstract",

In combination with our Formal Linear Algebra Methods Environment (FLAME) approach to deriving such families of algorithms, dozens of algorithms for a single linear algebra operation can be derived, verified to be correct, implemented, and tested, often in a matter of minutes per algorithm. Since the algorithms are expressed in code much like they are explained in a classroom setting, these APIs become not just a tool for implementing libraries, but also a valuable tool for teaching the algorithms that are incorporated in the libraries. In combination with an extension of the Parallel Linear Algebra Package (PLAPACK) API, the approach presents a migratory path from algorithm to MATLAB implementation to high-performance sequential implementation to parallel implementation. Finally, the APIs are being used to create a repository of algorithms and implementations for linear algebra operations, the FLAME Interface REpository (FIRE), which already features hundreds of algorithms for dozens of commonly encountered linear algebra operations.",

This is due to the finiteness of the floating-point representations (for software implementations), and to the need to have small, hence fast and/or inexpensive, multipliers (for hardware implementations). We then have to consider polynomial approximations for which the degree- i coefficient has at most m i fractional bits; in other words, it is a rational number with denominator 2 m i . We provide a general and efficient method for finding the best polynomial approximation under this constraint. Moreover, our method also applies if some other constraints (such as requiring some coefficients to be equal to some predefined constants or minimizing relative error instead of absolute error) are required.",

    "abstract": "High order domain decomposition methods using a basis of Legendre polynomials, known variously as “spectral elements” or “ p -type finite elements,” have become very popular. Recent studies suggest that accuracy and efficiency can be improved by replacing Legendre polynomials by prolate spheroidal wave functions of zeroth order. In this article, we explain the practicalities of computing all the numbers needed to switch bases: the grid points x j , the quadrature weights w j , and the values of the prolate functions and their derivatives at the grid points. The prolate functions themselves are computed by a Legendre-Galerkin discretization of the prolate differential equation; this yields a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. The prolate functions are then defined by Legendre series whose coefficients are the eigenfunctions of the matrix eigenproblem. The grid points and weights are found simultaneously through a Newton iteration. For large N and c , the iteration diverges from a first guess of the Legendre-Lobatto points and weights. Fortunately, the variations of the x j and w j with c are well-approximated by a symmetric parabola over the whole range of interest. This makes it possible to bypass the continuation procedures of earlier authors.",

The main conclusion is that SIGMA performs very well, solving 35 of the problems, including some very hard ones. Unfortunately, the limited results available to us at present do not appear sufficient to enable a conclusive comparison with other global optimization methods.",

    "abstract": "Because they are continuous and self-similar, space-filling curves have been widely used in mathematics to transform multi-dimensional problems into one-dimensional forms. For scientific applications, reordering computation by certain space-filling curves can significantly improve data reuse because of the locality properties of these curves. However, when space-filling curves are used in programs for reordering data, traversal or indexing of the curves must be efficient. To address this problem, we present the table-driven framework SFCGen to efficiently generate multi-dimensional space-filling curves on the fly. The framework is general and easy enough to be used in any application that can be partitioned recursively in multiple dimensions. We describe a movement specification table, a universal turtle algorithm to enumerate points along a space-filling curve, a table-based indexing algorithm to transform coordinates of a point into its position along the curve and an algorithm to pregenerate the table automatically. As examples, we show how high-dimensional Hilbert, Morton, and Peano curves and a two-dimensional Sierpiński curve can be generated with our algorithms. We present performance results for Hilbert, Morton, and Peano curves and compare the efficiency of our curve generation algorithm with the most recent work on generating Hilbert curves. Our experimental results on three modern microprocessor-based platforms show that SFCGen performs up to 63% faster than the most recent recursive algorithm on 2D curve generation and up to a factor of 132 faster than two previous byte-oriented non-recursive implementations. On curve indexing, SFCGen performs as much as a factor of three faster than the byte-oriented implementation. Our results on 4D space-filling curves also show that SFCGen scales very well with curve level for higher dimensional spaces.",

It contains several other polynomial invariants, such as the chromatic polynomial and flow polynomial as partial evaluations, and various numerical invariants such as the number of spanning trees as complete evaluations. However despite its ubiquity, there are no widely available effective computational tools able to compute the Tutte polynomial of a general graph of reasonable size. In this article we describe the implementation of a program that exploits isomorphisms in the computation tree to extend the range of graphs for which it is feasible to compute their Tutte polynomials, and we demonstrate the utility of the program by finding counterexamples to a conjecture of Welsh on the location of the real flow roots of a graph.",

    "abstract": "Major breakthroughs in chip and software design have been observed for the last nine years. In October 2001, IBM released the world’s first multicore processor: POWER4. Six years later, in February 2007, NVIDIA made a public release of CUDA SDK, a set of development tools to write algorithms for execution on Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Although software vendors have started working on parallelizing their products, the vast majority of existing code is still sequential and does not effectively utilize modern multicore CPUs and manycore GPUs. This article describes Parallel Colt, a multithreaded Java library for scientific computing and image processing. In addition to describing the design and functionality of Parallel Colt, a comparison to MATLAB is presented. Two ImageJ plugins for iterative image deblurring and motion correction of PET brain images are described as typical applications of this library. Performance comparisons with MATLAB, including GPU computations via AccelerEyes’ Jacket toolbox are also given.",

The main advantage of the proposed framework is that it is flexible, with a strong emphasis on object-oriented classes and operator overloading, and it is therefore useful for the rapid development and evaluation of new MDO methods. The top layer interface is programmed in Python and it allows for the layers below the interface to be programmed in C, C++, Fortran, and other languages. We describe an implementation of pyMDO and demonstrate that we can take advantage of object-oriented programming to obtain intuitive, easy-to-read, and easy-to-develop codes that are at the same time efficient. This allows developers to focus on the new algorithms they are developing and testing, rather than on implementation details. Examples demonstrate the user interface and the corresponding results show that the various MDO methods yield the correct solutions.",

In this article, methods are developed for evaluating generalized Jacobian elements for a nonsmooth function that is expressed as a finite composition of known elemental piecewise differentiable functions. In principle, these elemental functions can include any piecewise differentiable function whose analytical directional derivatives are known. The methods are fully automatable, and are shown to be computationally tractable relative to the cost of a function evaluation.

Since no format is universally better than the others across all possible kinds of operations and computers, sparse linear algebra software packages should provide facilities to easily implement and integrate new storage formats within a sparse linear algebra application without the need to modify it; it should also allow to dynamically change a storage format at run-time depending on the specific operations to be performed. Aiming at these important features, we present an Object Oriented design model for a sparse linear algebra package which relies on Design Patterns. We show that an implementation of our model can be efficiently achieved through some of the unique features of the Fortran 2003 language. Experimental results show that the proposed software infrastructure improves the modularity and ease of use of the code at no performance loss.",

    "abstract": "The MATLAB™ backslash (x=A\\b) is an elegant and powerful interface to a suite of high-performance factorization methods for the direct solution of the linear system Ax = b and the least-squares problem min x ‖ b - Ax ‖. It is a meta-algorithm that selects the best factorization method for a particular matrix, whether sparse or dense. However, the simplicity and elegance of its single-character interface prohibits the reuse of its factorization for subsequent systems. Requiring MATLAB users to find the best factorization method on their own can lead to suboptimal choices; even MATLAB experts can make the wrong choice. Furthermore, naive MATLAB users have a tendency to translate mathematical expressions from linear algebra directly into MATLAB, so that x = A -1 b becomes the inferior yet all-to-prevalent x=inv(A)*b. To address these issues, an object-oriented FACTORIZE method is presented. Via simple-to-use operator overloading, solving two linear systems can be written as F=factorize(A); x=F\\b; y=F\\c, where A is factorized only once. The selection of the best factorization method (LU, Cholesky, LDL T , QR, or a complete orthogonal decomposition for rank-deficient matrices) is hidden from the user. The mathematical expression x = A -1 b directly translates into the MATLAB expression x=inverse(A)*b, which does not compute the inverse at all, but does the right thing by factorizing A and solving the corresponding triangular systems.",

Recently, DAG scheduling has become popular in advanced Dense Linear Algebra libraries due to its efficient asynchronous parallel execution of tasks. However, its application to sparse matrix problems is more challenging as it has to deal with an enormous number of highly irregular tasks. This typically results in substantial scheduling overhead both in time and space, which causes overall parallel performance to be suboptimal. We describe a parallel solver based on two-level task parallelism: tasks are first generated from a parallel tree traversal on the assembly tree; next, those tasks are further refined by using algorithms - by - blocks to gain fine-grained parallelism. The resulting fine-grained tasks are asynchronously executed after their dependencies are analyzed. Our approach is distinct from others in that we adopt two-level task scheduling to mirror the two-level parallelism. As a result, we reduce scheduling overhead, and increase efficiency and flexibility. The proposed parallel sparse direct solver is evaluated for the particular problems arising from the hp -Finite Element Method where conventional sparse direct solvers do not scale well.",

The adaptive AMG presented is meant to handle general symmetric and positive definite (SPD) sparse linear systems, without assuming any a priori information of the problem and its origin; the goal of adaptivity is to achieve a method with a prescribed convergence rate. The presented method exploits a general coarsening process based on aggregation of unknowns, obtained by a maximum weight matching in the adjacency graph of the system matrix. More specifically, a maximum product matching is employed to define an effective smoother subspace (complementary to the coarse space), a process referred to as compatible relaxation, at every level of the recursive two-level hierarchical AMG process. Results on a large variety of test cases and comparisons with related work demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of the method and of the software.",

Given a matrix A , the algorithm “randUTV” computes a factorization A = UTV * , where U and V have orthonormal columns, and T is triangular (either upper or lower, whichever is preferred). The algorithm randUTV is developed primarily to be a fast and easily parallelized alternative to algorithms for computing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). randUTV provides accuracy very close to that of the SVD for problems such as low-rank approximation, solving ill-conditioned linear systems, and determining bases for various subspaces associated with the matrix. Moreover, randUTV produces highly accurate approximations to the singular values of A . Unlike the SVD, the randomized algorithm proposed builds a UTV factorization in an incremental, single-stage, and noniterative way, making it possible to halt the factorization process once a specified tolerance has been met. Numerical experiments comparing the accuracy and speed of randUTV to the SVD are presented. Other experiments also demonstrate that in comparison to column-pivoted QR, which is another factorization that is often used as a relatively economic alternative to the SVD, randUTV compares favorably in terms of speed while providing far higher accuracy.",

We present a Fast Multipole Method (FMM) for computing volume potentials and use them to construct spatially adaptive solvers for the Poisson, Stokes, and low-frequency Helmholtz problems. Conventional N-body methods apply to discrete particle interactions. With volume potentials, one replaces the sums with volume integrals. Particle N-body methods can be used to accelerate such integrals. but it is more efficient to develop a special FMM. In this article, we discuss the efficient implementation of such an FMM. We use high-order piecewise Chebyshev polynomials and an octree data structure to represent the input and output fields and enable spectrally accurate approximation of the near-field and the Kernel Independent FMM (KIFMM) for the far-field approximation. For distributed-memory parallelism, we use space-filling curves, locally essential trees, and a hypercube-like communication scheme developed previously in our group. We present new near and far interaction traversals that optimize cache usage. Also, unlike particle N-body codes, we need a 2:1 balanced tree to allow for precomputations. We present a fast scheme for 2:1 balancing. Finally, we use vectorization, including the AVX instruction set on the Intel Sandy Bridge architecture to get better than 50% of peak floating-point performance.

For fourth-order problems, however, the newly enabled methods significantly outperform interior penalty formulations. We also give some advanced use cases, solving the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation and some biharmonic eigenvalue problems (including Chladni plates) using C 1 discretizations.",

    "abstract": "Effective relaxation methods are necessary for good multigrid convergence. For many equations, standard Jacobi and Gauß–Seidel are inadequate, and more sophisticated space decompositions are required; examples include problems with semidefinite terms or saddle point structure. In this article, we present a unifying software abstraction, PCPATCH, for the topological construction of space decompositions for multigrid relaxation methods. Space decompositions are specified by collecting topological entities in a mesh (such as all vertices or faces) and applying a construction rule (such as taking all degrees of freedom in the cells around each entity). The software is implemented in PETSc and facilitates the elegant expression of a wide range of schemes merely by varying solver options at runtime. In turn, this allows for the very rapid development of fast solvers for difficult problems.",

    "abstract": "The performance of deep neural networks is highly sensitive to the choice of the hyperparameters that define the structure of the network and the learning process. When facing a new application, tuning a deep neural network is a tedious and time-consuming process that is often described as a “dark art.” This explains the necessity of automating the calibration of these hyperparameters. Derivative-free optimization is a field that develops methods designed to optimize time-consuming functions without relying on derivatives. This work introduces the HyperNOMAD package, an extension of the NOMAD software that applies the MADS algorithm [7] to simultaneously tune the hyperparameters responsible for both the architecture and the learning process of a deep neural network (DNN). This generic approach allows for an important flexibility in the exploration of the search space by taking advantage of categorical variables. HyperNOMAD is tested on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets and achieves results comparable to the current state of the art.",

Its performance properties are demonstrated for 2D and 3D benchmarks of flow around a cylinder. The key ingredients of the GMG approach are the construction of the local Vanka smoother over all degrees of freedom in time of the respective subinterval and its efficient application. For this, data structures that store pre-computed cell inverses of the Jacobian for all hierarchical levels and require only a reasonable amount of memory overhead are generated. The GMG method is built for the deal.II finite element library. The concepts are flexible and can be transferred to similar software platforms.",

Some practical limitations of Sorenson's reduction have been eliminated. Worst-case complexity is still O (n 2 ) for n -bit input, but actual implementations given input about 4096 bits long perform over 5.5 times as fast as the binary GCD on one computer architecture having a multiply instruction.

The problem description may be given in terms of continuous or discrete, linear or nonlinear process and measurement dynamics. From this description, autofilter automates many common solution methods (e.g., linearization, discretization) and generates C or Matlab code fully automatically. autofilter surpasses toolkit-based programming approaches for Kalman filters because it requires no low-level programming skills (e.g., to \"glue\" together library function calls). autofilter raises the level of discourse to the mathematics of the problem at hand rather than the details of what algorithms, data structures, optimizations and so on are required to implement it. An overview of autofilter is given along with an example of its practical application to deep space attitude estimation.",

This algorithm is combined with Chebychev acceleration if the rightmost or leftmost eigenvalues are sought, or if the eigenvalues of largest modulus are known to be the rightmost or leftmost eigenvalues. An option exists for computing the corresponding eigenvectors. The code does not need the matrix explicitly since it only requires the user to multiply sets of vectors by the matrix. Sophisticated and novel iteration controls, stopping criteria, and restart facilities are provided. The code is shown to be efficient and competitive on a range of test problems.",

After many years of development, homotopy path trackers based on probability-one homotopy methods are reliable and fast. Now, theoretical advances reducing the number of homotopy paths that must be tracked and handling singular solutions have made probability-one homotopy methods even more practical. POLSYS_GLP consists of Fortran 95 modules for finding all isolated solutions of a complex coefficient polynomial system of equations. The package is intended to be used on a distributed memory multiprocessor in conjunction with HOMPACK90 (Algorithm 777), and makes extensive use of Fortran 95-derived data types and MPI to support a general linear product (GLP) polynomial system structure. GLP structure is intermediate between the partitioned linear product structure used by POLSYS_PLP (Algorithm 801) and the BKK-based structure used by PHCPACK. The code requires a GLP structure as input, and although finding the optimal GLP structure is a difficult combinatorial problem, generally physical or engineering intuition about a problem yields a very good GLP structure. POLSYS_GLP employs a sophisticated power series end game for handling singular solutions, and provides support for problem definition both at a high level and via hand-crafted code. Different GLP structures and their corresponding Bezout numbers can be systematically explored before committing to root finding.",

A coarse base mesh of quadrilateral cells is moved by an algebraic mesh-movement function so as to follow and isolate spatially distinct phenomena. The local mesh-refinement method recursively divides the time step and spatial cells of the moving base mesh in regions where error indicators are high until a prescribed tolerance is satisfied. The static mesh-regeneration procedure is used to create a new base mesh when the existing one becomes too distorted. The adaptive methods have been combined with a MacCormack finite difference scheme for hyperbolic systems and an error indicator based upon estimates of the local discretization error obtained by Richardson extrapolation.

    "abstract": "Box-bisection is a method for solving nonlinear systems. Space is subdivided into boxes of smaller and smaller diameter, and each subbox is tested for the existence of solutions by a test that either eliminates it from further consideration or marks it for subdivision. Simple bisection uses a test for the exclusion of subboxes, but no test that guarantees the existence of a unique solution in a subbox. Using this simple bisection, we show that the passed boxes tend to cluster in geometrical configura- tions whose number is stable under subdivision. This implies for many problems that the work required to do simple bisection may be prohibitive. However, improvements may be possible by grouping clusters and dynamically redefining the box proportions. The restriction to second-degree systems is sufficient to display this behavior.",

    "abstract": "This article reports an unexpected and rather erratic behavior of the LAPACK software implementation of the QR factorization with Businger-Golub column pivoting. It is shown that, due to finite precision arithmetic, the software implementation of the factorization can catastrophically fail to produce a properly structured triangular factor, thus leading to a potentially severe underestimate of a matrix's numerical rank. The 30-year old problem, dating back to LINPACK, has (undetectedly) badly affected many computational routines and software packages, as well as the study of rank-revealing QR factorizations. We combine computer experiments and numerical analysis to isolate, analyze, and fix the problem. Our modification of the current LAPACK xGEQP3 routine is already included in the LAPACK 3.1.0 release. The modified routine is numerically more robust and with a negligible overhead. We also provide a new, equally efficient, and provably numerically safe partial-column norm-updating strategy.",

This matrix is factored as the product of two rectangular matrices with a strong block structure which makes their computation very easy.

We apply our linear system refinement algorithm to Björck’s augmented linear system formulation of an LLS problem. Our algorithm reduces the forward normwise and componentwise errors to O ( ε w ), where ε w is the working precision, unless the system is too ill conditioned. In contrast to linear systems, we provide two separate error bounds for the solution x and the residual r . The refinement algorithm requires only limited use of extra precision and adds only O ( mn ) work to the O ( mn 2 ) cost of QR factorization for problems of size m -by- n . The extra precision calculation is facilitated by the new extended-precision BLAS standard in a portable way, and the refinement algorithm will be included in a future release of LAPACK and can be extended to the other types of least squares problems.",

In particular we present our implementation -- in the M4RI library -- of Strassen-Winograd matrix multiplication and the \"Method of the Four Russians\" multiplication (M4RM) and compare it against other available implementations. Good performance is demonstrated on on AMD's Opteron and particulary good performance on Intel's Core 2 Duo. The open-source M4RI library is available stand-alone as well as part of the Sage mathematics software. In machine terms, addition in GF(2) is logical-XOR, and multiplication is logical-AND, thus a machine word of 64-bits allows one to operate on 64 elements of GF(2) in parallel: at most one CPU cycle for 64 parallel additions or multiplications. As such, element-wise operations over GF(2) are relatively cheap. In fact, in this paper, we conclude that the actual bottlenecks are memory reads and writes and issues of data locality. We present our empirical findings in relation to minimizing these and give an analysis thereof.",

    "abstract": "LAPACK is often mentioned as a positive example of a software library that encapsulates complex, robust, and widely used numerical algorithms for a wide range of applications. At installation time, the user has the option of running a (limited) number of test cases to verify the integrity of the installation process. On the algorithm developer's side, however, more exhaustive tests are usually performed to study algorithm behavior on a variety of problem settings and also computer architectures. In this process, difficult test cases need to be found that reflect particular challenges of an application or push algorithms to extreme behavior. These tests are then assembled into a comprehensive collection, therefore making it possible for any new or competing algorithm to be stressed in a similar way. This article describes an infrastructure for exhaustively testing the symmetric tridiagonal eigensolvers implemented in LAPACK. It consists of two parts: a selection of carefully chosen test matrices with particular idiosyncrasies and a portable testing framework that allows for easy testing and data processing. The tester facilitates experiments with algorithmic choices, parameter and threshold studies, and performance comparisons on different architectures.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-core implementations of algorithms for dense matrix computations have traditionally focused on optimal use of memory so as to minimize I/O, often trading programmability for performance. In this article we show how the current state of hardware and software allows the programmability problem to be addressed without sacrificing performance. This comes from the realizations that memory is cheap and large, making it less necessary to optimally orchestrate I/O, and that new algorithms view matrices as collections of submatrices and computation as operations with those submatrices. This enables libraries to be coded at a high level of abstraction, leaving the tasks of scheduling the computations and data movement in the hands of a runtime system. This is in sharp contrast to more traditional approaches that leverage optimal use of in-core memory and, at the expense of introducing considerable programming complexity, explicit overlap of I/O with computation. Performance is demonstrated for this approach on multicore architectures as well as platforms equipped with hardware accelerators.",

The solver implements Newton’s method in function space, where instead of the usual Jacobian matrices, the derivatives involved are Fréchet derivatives. A major novelty of this approach is the application of automatic differentiation (AD) techniques to compute the operator-valued Fréchet derivatives in the continuous context. Other novelties include the use of anonymous functions and numbering of each variable to enable a recursive, delayed evaluation of derivatives with forward mode AD . The AD techniques are applied within a new Chebfun class called which allows users to set up and solve nonlinear BVPs, both scalar and systems of coupled equations, in a few lines of code, using the “nonlinear backslash” operator (\\).

It is now possible to continue homoclinic-to-hyperbolic-saddle and homoclinic-to-saddle-node orbits in matcont . The implementation is done using the continuation of invariant subspaces, with the Riccati equations included in the defining system. A key feature is the possibility to initiate both types of homoclinic orbits interactively, starting from an equilibrium point and using a homotopy method. All known codimension-two homoclinic bifurcations are tested for during continuation. The test functions for inclination-flip bifurcations are implemented in a new and more efficient way. Heteroclinic orbits can now also be continued and an analogous homotopy method can be used for the initialization.",

The codes twpbvp.f/tpbvpc.f use a deferred correction scheme based on Mono-Implicit Runge-Kutta methods (MIRK); the other codes use a deferred correction scheme based on Lobatto formulas. The acdc.f/acdcc.f codes implement an automatic continuation strategy. The performance and features of the new solver are checked by performing some numerical tests to show that the new code is robust and able to solve very difficult singularly perturbed problems. The results obtained show that bvptwp.m is often able to solve problems requiring stringent accuracies and problems with very sharp changes in the solution. This code, coupled with the existing boundary value codes such as bvp4c.m, makes the MATLAB BVP section an extremely powerful one for a very wide range of problems.",

    "abstract": "Finite Difference (FD) is a widely used method to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDE). PDEs are the core of many simulations in different scientific fields, such as geophysics, astrophysics, etc. The typical FD solver performs stencil computations for the entire computational domain, thus solving the differential operators. In general terms, the stencil computation consists of a weighted accumulation of the contribution of neighbor points along the cartesian axis. Therefore, optimizing stencil computations is crucial in reducing the application execution time. Stencil computation performance is bounded by two main factors: the memory access pattern and the inefficient reuse of the accessed data. We propose a novel algorithm, named Semi-stencil , that tackles these two problems. The main idea behind this algorithm is to change the way in which the stencil computation progresses within the computational domain. Instead of accessing all required neighbors and adding all their contributions at once, the Semi-stencil algorithm divides the computation into several updates. Then, each update gathers half of the axis neighbors, partially computing at the same time the stencil in a set of closely located points. As Semi-stencil progresses through the domain, the stencil computations are completed on precomputed points. This computation strategy improves the memory access pattern and efficiently reuses the accessed data. Our initial target architecture was the Cell/B.E., where the Semi-stencil in a SPE was 44% faster than the naive stencil implementation. Since then, we have continued our research on emerging multicore architectures in order to assess and extend this work on homogeneous architectures. The experiments presented combine the Semi-stencil strategy with space- and time-blocking algorithms used in hierarchical memory architectures. Two x86 (Intel Nehalem and AMD Opteron) and two POWER (IBM POWER6 and IBM BG/P) platforms are used as testbeds, where the best improvements for a 25-point stencil range from 1.27 to 1.76× faster. The results show that this novel strategy is a feasible optimization method which may be integrated into auto-tuning frameworks. Also, since all current architectures are multicore based, we have introduced a brief section where scalability results on IBM POWER7-, Intel Xeon-, and MIC-based systems are presented. In a nutshell, the algorithm scales as well as or better than other stencil techniques. For instance, the scalability of Semi-stencil on MIC for a certain testcase reached 93.8 × over 244 threads.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a new high-performance bidiagonal reduction (BRD) for homogeneous multicore architectures. This article is an extension of the high-performance tridiagonal reduction implemented by the same authors [Luszczek et al., IPDPS 2011] to the BRD case. The BRD is the first step toward computing the singular value decomposition of a matrix, which is one of the most important algorithms in numerical linear algebra due to its broad impact in computational science. The high performance of the BRD described in this article comes from the combination of four important features: (1) tile algorithms with tile data layout, which provide an efficient data representation in main memory; (2) a two-stage reduction approach that allows to cast most of the computation during the first stage (reduction to band form) into calls to Level 3 BLAS and reduces the memory traffic during the second stage (reduction from band to bidiagonal form) by using high-performance kernels optimized for cache reuse; (3) a data dependence translation layer that maps the general algorithm with column-major data layout into the tile data layout; and (4) a dynamic runtime system that efficiently schedules the newly implemented kernels across the processing units and ensures that the data dependencies are not violated. A detailed analysis is provided to understand the critical impact of the tile size on the total execution time, which also corresponds to the matrix bandwidth size after the reduction of the first stage. The performance results show a significant improvement over currently established alternatives. The new high-performance BRD achieves up to a 30-fold speedup on a 16-core Intel Xeon machine with a 12000× 12000 matrix size against the state-of-the-art open source and commercial numerical software packages, namely LAPACK, compiled with optimized and multithreaded BLAS from MKL as well as Intel MKL version 10.2.",

To improve the efficiency of FSDP, SFSDP exploits the aggregated and correlative sparsity of a sensor network localization problem. As a result, SFSDP can handle much larger problems than other software as well as three-dimensional anchor-free problems.

The purpose is to provide independent confirmation that results contained in a manuscript are replicable. Successful completion of the RCR process awards a manuscript with the Replicated Computational Results Designation. This issue of ACM TOMS contains the first [Van Zee and van de Geijn 2015] of what we anticipate to be a growing number of articles to receive the RCR designation, and the related RCR reviewer report [Willenbring 2015].

We present a framework to compute lower bounds on largest absolute roundoff errors, for a particular rounding model. This method applies to numerical programs implementing polynomial functions with box constrained input variables. Our study is based on three different hierarchies, relying respectively on generalized eigenvalue problems, elementary computations, and semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. This is complementary of over-approximation frameworks, consisting of obtaining upper bounds on the largest absolute roundoff error. Combining the results of both frameworks allows one to get enclosures for upper bounds on roundoff errors. The under-approximation framework provided by the third hierarchy is based on a new sequence of convergent robust SDP approximations for certain classes of polynomial optimization problems. Each problem in this hierarchy can be solved exactly via SDP. By using this hierarchy, one can provide a monotone nondecreasing sequence of lower bounds converging to the absolute roundoff error of a program implementing a polynomial function, applying for a particular rounding model. We investigate the efficiency and precision of our method on nontrivial polynomial programs coming from space control, optimization, and computational biology.",

We describe a simple algorithmic construction of a set of basis functions for the space of multi-degree splines with similar properties to standard B-splines. These basis functions are called multi-degree B-splines (or MDB-splines ). The construction relies on an extraction operator that represents all MDB-splines as linear combinations of local B-splines of different degrees. This enables the use of existing efficient algorithms for B-spline evaluations and refinements in the context of multi-degree splines. A M ATLAB implementation is provided to illustrate the computation and use of MDB-splines.",

The local computational overhead and the additional memory requirement for the computation of directional derivatives or adjoints of the solution of the nonlinear system with respect to the parameters can quickly become prohibitive for large values of n . Both are reduced drastically by analytical (and symbolic) approaches to differentiation of the underlying numerical methods. Following the discussion of the proposed terminology, we develop the algorithmic formalism building on prior work by other colleagues and present an implementation based on the AD software dco/c++.

    "abstract": "This article focuses on the design and development of a new robust and efficient general-purpose incomplete Cholesky factorization package HSL_MI28, which is available within the HSL mathematical software library. It implements a limited memory approach that exploits ideas from the positive semidefinite Tismenetsky-Kaporin modification scheme and, through the incorporation of intermediate memory, is a generalization of the widely used ICFS algorithm of Lin and Moré. Both the density of the incomplete factor and the amount of memory used in its computation are under the user's control. The performance of HSL_MI28 is demonstrated using extensive numerical experiments involving a large set of test problems arising from a wide range of real-world applications. The numerical experiments are used to isolate the effects of scaling, ordering, and dropping strategies so as to assess their usefulness in the development of robust algebraic incomplete factorization preconditioners and to select default settings for HSL_MI28. They also illustrate the significant advantage of employing a modest amount of intermediate memory. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that, with limited memory, high-quality yet sparse general-purpose preconditioners are obtained. Comparisons are made with ICFS, with a level-based incomplete factorization code and, finally, with a state-of-the-art direct solver.",

    "abstract": "The T-matrix (TMAT) of a scatterer fully describes the way the scatterer interacts with incident fields and scatters waves, and is therefore used extensively in several science and engineering applications. The T-matrix is independent of several input parameters in a wave propagation model and hence the offline computation of the T-matrix provides an efficient reduced order model (ROM) framework for performing online scattering simulations for various choices of the input parameters. The authors developed and mathematically analyzed a numerically stable formulation for computing the T-matrix (J. Comput. Appl. Math. 234 (2010), 1702--1709). The TMATROM software package provides an object-oriented implementation of the numerically stable formulation and can be used in conjunction with the user’s preferred forward solver for the two-dimensional Helmholtz model. We compare TMATROM with standard methods to compute the T-matrix for a range of two-dimensional test scatterers with large aspect ratios and acoustic sizes. Our numerical results demonstrate the robust numerical stability of the TMATROM implementation, even with scatterers for which the standard methods are numerically unstable. The efficiency and flexibility of the TMATROM software package to handle a wide range of two-dimensional scatterers with various shapes and material properties are also demonstrated.",

The implementation described in this article focuses on the case of sparse symmetric matrices. It contains an interface that is compatible with the distributed memory parallel sparse direct factorization SuperLU_DIST. However, the underlying data structure and design of PSelInv allows it to be easily combined with other factorization routines, such as PARDISO. We discuss general parallelization strategies such as data and task distribution schemes. In particular, we describe how to exploit the concurrency exposed by the elimination tree associated with the LU factorization of A . We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of PSelInv by presenting several numerical experiments. In particular, we show that PSelInv can run efficiently on more than 4,000 cores for a modestly sized matrix. We also demonstrate how PSelInv can be used to accelerate large-scale electronic structure calculations.",

In this article, we propose a modification of the invariant polytope algorithm making it roughly 3 times faster (single threaded), suitable for higher dimensions, and parallelise it. The modified version works for most matrix families of dimensions up to 25, for non-negative matrices up to 3,000. In addition, we introduce a new, fast algorithm, called modified Gripenberg algorithm, for computing good lower bounds for the joint spectral radius. The corresponding examples and statistics of numerical results are provided. Several applications of our algorithms are presented.

In particular, the adoption of specialized hardware and data formats for low-precision arithmetic in high-end GPUs (graphics processing units) has motivated numerous efforts aiming at carefully reducing the working precision in order to speed up the computations. For algorithms whose performance is bound by the memory bandwidth, the idea of compressing its data before (and after) memory accesses has received considerable attention. One idea is to store an approximate operator–like a preconditioner–in lower than working precision hopefully without impacting the algorithm output. We realize the first high-performance implementation of an adaptive precision block-Jacobi preconditioner which selects the precision format used to store the preconditioner data on-the-fly, taking into account the numerical properties of the individual preconditioner blocks. We implement the adaptive block-Jacobi preconditioner as production-ready functionality in the Ginkgo linear algebra library, considering not only the precision formats that are part of the IEEE standard, but also customized formats which optimize the length of the exponent and significand to the characteristics of the preconditioner blocks. Experiments run on a state-of-the-art GPU accelerator show that our implementation offers attractive runtime savings.",

Our approach is based on an exact penalty method to first efficiently transform the original problem into an instance of Max-Cut, and then to solve the Max-Cut problem by a branch-and-bound algorithm. All the main ingredients are carefully developed using new semidefinite programming relaxations obtained by strengthening the existing relaxations with a set of hypermetric inequalities, applying the bundle method as the bounding routine and using new strategies for exploring the branch-and-bound tree. Furthermore, an efficient C implementation of a sequential and a parallel branch-and-bound algorithm is presented. The latter is based on a load coordinator-worker scheme using MPI for multi-node parallelization and is evaluated on a high-performance computer. The new solver is benchmarked against BiqCrunch, GUROBI, and SCIP on four families of (linearly constrained) binary quadratic problems. Numerical results demonstrate that BiqBin is a highly competitive solver. The serial version outperforms the other three solvers on the majority of the benchmark instances. We also evaluate the parallel solver and show that it has good scaling properties. The general audience can use it as an on-line service available at http://www.biqbin.eu .",

We close many of these gaps. We give efficient, fast, and practicable parallel and distributed algorithms for building data structures that support sampling single items (alias tables, compressed data structures). This also yields a simplified and more space-efficient sequential algorithm for alias table construction. Our approaches to sampling k out of n items with/without replacement and to subset (Poisson) sampling are output-sensitive , i.e., the sampling algorithms use work linear in the number of different samples. This is also interesting in the sequential case. Weighted random permutation can be done by sorting appropriate random deviates. We show that this is possible with linear work. Finally, we give a communication-efficient, highly scalable approach to (weighted and unweighted) reservoir sampling. This algorithm is based on a fully distributed model of streaming algorithms that might be of independent interest. Experiments for alias tables and sampling with replacement show near linear speedups using up to 158 threads of shared-memory machines. An experimental evaluation of distributed weighted reservoir sampling on up to 5,120 cores also shows good speedups.",

On the one hand, the numerical linear algebra and the high-performance communities invest significant effort in the development and optimization of highly sophisticated numerical kernels and libraries, aiming at the maximum exploitation of both the properties of the input matrices, and the architectural features of the target computing platform. On the other hand, end users are progressively less likely to go through the error-prone and time consuming process of directly using said libraries by writing their code in C or Fortran; instead, languages and libraries such as Matlab, Julia, Eigen and Armadillo, which offer a higher level of abstraction, are becoming more and more popular. Users are given the opportunity to code matrix computations with a syntax that closely resembles the mathematical description; it is then a compiler or an interpreter that internally maps the input program to lower level kernels, as provided by libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK. Unfortunately, our experience suggests that in terms of performance, this translation is typically vastly suboptimal. In this paper, we first introduce the Linear Algebra Mapping Problem, and then investigate how effectively a benchmark of test problems is solved by popular high-level programming languages. Specifically, we consider Matlab, Octave, Julia, R, Armadillo (C++), Eigen (C++), and NumPy (Python); the benchmark is meant to test both standard compiler optimizations such as common subexpression elimination and loop-invariant code motion, as well as linear algebra specific optimizations such as optimal parenthesization of a matrix product and kernel selection for matrices with properties. The aim of this study is to give concrete guidelines for the development of languages and libraries that support linear algebra computations.",

    "abstract": "A globally adaptive algorithm for numerical cubature of a vector of functions over a collection of n -dimensional simplices is described. The algorithm is based on a subdivision strategy that chooses for subdivision at each stage the subregion (of the input simplices) with the largest estimated error. This subregion is divided into two, three or four equal volume subregions by cutting selected edges. These edges are selected using information about the smoothness of the integrands in the edge directions. The algorithm allows a choice from several embedded cubature rule sequences for approximate integration and error estimation. A Fortran 95 implementation as a part of CUBPACK is also discussed. Testing of the algorithm is described.",

    "abstract": "The computation of the cumulative hypergeometric distribution function is of interest to many researchers who are working in the computational sciences and related areas. Presented here is a new method for computing this function that applies prime number factorization to the factorials. We also apply cancellation to the numerator and denominator to reduce the computational complexity of the initial, the tail end, or weighted probabilities to achieve maximum accuracy. The new method includes two algorithms, one using recursion and the other using iteration. These two algorithms are machine independent; precision is arbitrary, subject to storage limitation. The development of the algorithms is discussed, and some test results and the comparison of these two algorithms are given. To implement both algorithms, we use the Ada programming language that is an American National Standard Institute standardized language. The language has special features such as exception handling and tasks . Exception handling is used to make programming easier and to prevent overflow or underflow conditions during the execution of the program. Tasks are used to compute the numerator and denominator concurrently, and to maximize the possible number of integer multiplications in the numerator and denominator. All of the computations can be done on currently available machines, and the time consumed by these computations remains reasonably small.",

The derivatives are optionally computed by the algorithm. The contours found are normally smooth curves. They consist of polygons approximating intersections with the bicubics. It is possible to fill the areas between them with certain colors or patterns. This is done with a piecewise technique rectangle by rectangle. The method for finding the points of the polygons is shortly reviewed, and some numerical problems are pointed out. The algorithm has a flexible, easy-to-use interface and is easily installed with all plotting systems, provided that a fill-area command is available. A GKS interface may be used.",

The parallel algorithm is asynchronous with small messages which can be aggregated and exhibits low communication costs.

    "abstract": "Given a linear system Ax = b , one can construct a related “normal equations” system AA T y = b, x = A T y . Björck and Elfving have shown that the SSOR algorithm, applied to the normal equations, can be accelerated by the conjugate gradient algorithm (CG). The resulting algorithm, called CGMN, is error-reducing and in theory it always converges even when the equation system is inconsistent and/or nonsquare. SSOR on the normal equations is equivalent to the Kaczmarz algorithm (KACZ), with a fixed relaxation parameter, run in a double (forward and backward) sweep on the original equations. CGMN was tested on nine well-known large and sparse linear systems obtained by central-difference discretization of elliptic convection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs). Eight of the PDEs were strongly convection-dominated, and these are known to produce very stiff systems with large off-diagonal elements. CGMN was compared with some of the foremost state-of-the art Krylov subspace methods: restarted GMRES, Bi-CGSTAB, and CGS. These methods were tested both with and without various preconditioners. CGMN converged in all the cases, while none of the preceding algorithm/preconditioner combinations achieved this level of robustness. Furthermore, on varying grid sizes, there was only a gradual increase in the number of iterations as the grid was refined. On the eight convection-dominated cases, the initial convergence rate of CGMN was better than all the other combinations of algorithms and preconditioners, and the residual decreased monotonically. The CGNR algorithm was also tested, and it was as robust as CGMN, but slower.",

    "abstract": "On many current and emerging computing architectures, single-precision calculations are at least twice as fast as double-precision calculations. In addition, the use of single precision may reduce pressure on memory bandwidth. The penalty for using single precision for the solution of linear systems is a potential loss of accuracy in the computed solutions. For sparse linear systems, the use of mixed precision in which double-precision iterative methods are preconditioned by a single-precision factorization can enable the recovery of high-precision solutions more quickly and use less memory than a sparse direct solver run using double-precision arithmetic. In this article, we consider the use of single precision within direct solvers for sparse symmetric linear systems, exploiting both the reduction in memory requirements and the performance gains. We develop a practical algorithm to apply a mixed-precision approach and suggest parameters and techniques to minimize the number of solves required by the iterative recovery process. These experiments provide the basis for our new code HSL_MA79—a fast, robust, mixed-precision sparse symmetric solver that is included in the mathematical software library HSL. Numerical results for a wide range of problems from practical applications are presented.",

Both algorithms are implemented in MATLAB and tested using both the “families” suggested by Lyness and Kaganove and the battery test used by Gander and Gautschi and Kahaner. They are shown to be more reliable, albeit in some cases less efficient, than other commonly-used adaptive integrators.",

We investigate how modern Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) architectures present old and new challenges that can be addressed by the combination of an algorithm design with careful and natural parallelism exploitation at the function level (optimizations) such as function-call parallelism, function percolation, and function software pipelining. We have three contributions: first, we present a performance overview for double- and double-complex-precision matrices for state-of-the-art SMP systems; second, we introduce new algorithm implementations: a variant of the 3M algorithm and two new different schedules of Winograd's matrix multiplication (achieving up to 20% speedup with respect to regular matrix multiplication). About the latter Winograd's algorithms: one is designed to minimize the number of matrix additions and the other to minimize the computation latency of matrix additions; third, we apply software pipelining and threads allocation to all the algorithms and we show how this yields up to 10% further performance improvements.",

In recent years many research efforts have been focused on recursively employing domain decomposition methods to obtain multilevel preconditioners to be used with Krylov solvers. In this context, we developed MLD2P4 (MultiLevel Domain Decomposition Parallel Preconditioners Package based on PSBLAS), a package of parallel multilevel preconditioners that combines additive Schwarz domain decomposition methods with a smoothed aggregation technique to build a hierarchy of coarse-level corrections in an algebraic way. The design of MLD2P4 was guided by objectives such as extensibility, flexibility, performance, portability, and ease of use. They were achieved by following an object-based approach while using the Fortran 95 language, as well as by employing the PSBLAS library as a basic framework. In this article, we present MLD2P4 focusing on its design principles, software architecture, and use.",

Unlike knot genus (its orientable counterpart), crosscap numbers are difficult to compute and no general algorithm is known. We present three methods for computing crosscap number that offer varying trade-offs between precision and speed: (i) an algorithm based on Hilbert basis enumeration and (ii) an algorithm based on exact integer programming, both of which either compute the solution precisely or reduce it to two possible values, and (iii) a fast but limited precision integer programming algorithm that bounds the solution from above. The first two algorithms advance the theoretical state of the art, but remain intractable for practical use. The third algorithm is fast and effective, which we show in a practical setting by making significant improvements to the current knowledge of crosscap numbers in knot tables. Our integer programming framework is general, with the potential for further applications in computational geometry and topology.",

Despite being a standard routine in many signal processing packages, it is possible to find practical design specifications where existing codes fail to work. Our goal is twofold. We first examine and present solutions for the practical difficulties related to weighted minimax polynomial approximation problems on multi-interval domains (i.e., the general setting under which the Parks-McClellan algorithm operates). Using these ideas, we then describe a robust implementation of this algorithm. It routinely outperforms existing minimax filter design routines.",

However, such matchings are known to be NP-hard to compute on 3-manifolds, through a reduction to the erasability problem. Here, we refine the study of the complexity of problems related to discrete Morse theory in terms of parameterized complexity. On the one hand we prove that the erasability problem is W[P]-complete on the natural parameter. On the other hand we propose an algorithm for computing optimal Morse matchings on triangulations of 3-manifolds which is fixed-parameter tractable in the treewidth of the bipartite graph representing the adjacency of the 1- and 2-simplexes. This algorithm also shows fixed parameter tractability for problems such as erasability and maximum alternating cycle-free matching. We further show that these results are also true when the treewidth of the dual graph of the triangulated 3-manifold is bounded. Finally, we investigate the respective treewidths of simplicial and generalized triangulations of 3-manifolds.",

    "abstract": "A source transformation via operator overloading method is presented for computing derivatives of mathematical functions defined by MATLAB computer programs. The transformed derivative code that results from the method of this article computes a sparse representation of the derivative of the function defined in the original code. As in all source transformation automatic differentiation techniques, an important feature of the method is that any flow control in the original function code is preserved in the derivative code. Furthermore, the resulting derivative code relies solely upon the native MATLAB library. The method is useful in applications where it is required to repeatedly evaluate the derivative of the original function. The approach is demonstrated on several examples and is found to be highly efficient when compared to well-known MATLAB automatic differentiation programs.",

    "abstract": "Batched dense linear algebra kernels are becoming ubiquitous in scientific applications, ranging from tensor contractions in deep learning to data compression in hierarchical low-rank matrix approximation. Within a single API call, these kernels are capable of simultaneously launching up to thousands of similar matrix computations, removing the expensive overhead of multiple API calls while increasing the occupancy of the underlying hardware. A challenge is that for the existing hardware landscape (x86, GPUs, etc.), only a subset of the required batched operations is implemented by the vendors, with limited support for very small problem sizes. We describe the design and performance of a new class of batched triangular dense linear algebra kernels on very small data sizes (up to 256) using single and multiple GPUs. By deploying recursive formulations, stressing the register usage, maintaining data locality, reducing threads synchronization, and fusing successive kernel calls, the new batched kernels outperform existing state-of-the-art implementations.",

The storage of matrix representations of multicomplex and multidual numbers is avoided using a combination of one-dimensional resizable arrays and an indexation method based on binary bitwise operations. To provide high computational efficiency and low memory usage, the multiplication of hypercomplex numbers up to sixth order is carried out using a hard-coded algorithm. For higher hypercomplex orders, the library uses by default a multiplication method based on binary bitwise operations. The computation of algebraic and transcendental functions is achieved using a Taylor series approximation.

    "abstract": "The numerical solution of partial differential equations is at the heart of many grand challenges in supercomputing. Solvers based on high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisation have been shown to scale on large supercomputers with excellent performance and efficiency if the implementation exploits all levels of parallelism and is tailored to the specific architecture. However, every year new supercomputers emerge and the list of hardware-specific considerations grows simultaneously with the list of desired features in a DG code. Thus, we believe that a sustainable DG code needs an abstraction layer to implement the numerical scheme in a suitable language. We explore the possibility to abstract the numerical scheme as small tensor operations, describe them in a domain-specific language (DSL) resembling the Einstein notation, and to map them to small General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication routines. The compiler for our DSL implements classic optimisations that are used for large tensor contractions, and we present novel optimisation techniques such as equivalent sparsity patterns and optimal index permutations for temporary tensors. Our application examples, which include the earthquake simulation software SeisSol, show that the generated kernels achieve over 50% peak performance of a recent 48-core Skylake system while the DSL considerably simplifies the implementation.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference provides a systematic framework for integration of data with mathematical models to quantify the uncertainty in the solution of the inverse problem. However, the solution of Bayesian inverse problems governed by complex forward models described by partial differential equations (PDEs) remains prohibitive with black-box Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We present hIPPYlib-MUQ, an extensible and scalable software framework that contains implementations of state-of-the art algorithms aimed to overcome the challenges of high-dimensional, PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems. These algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling by exploiting the geometry and intrinsic low-dimensionality of parameter space via derivative information and low rank approximation. The software integrates two complementary open-source software packages, hIPPYlib and MUQ. hIPPYlib solves PDE-constrained inverse problems using automatically-generated adjoint-based derivatives, but it lacks full Bayesian capabilities. MUQ provides a spectrum of powerful Bayesian inversion models and algorithms, but expects forward models to come equipped with gradients and Hessians to permit large-scale solution. By combining these two complementary libraries, we created a robust, scalable, and efficient software framework that realizes the benefits of each and allows us to tackle complex large-scale Bayesian inverse problems across a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering disciplines. To illustrate the capabilities of hIPPYlib-MUQ, we present a comparison of a number of MCMC methods available in the integrated software on several high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems. These include problems characterized by both linear and nonlinear PDEs, various noise models, and different parameter dimensions. The results demonstrate that large (∼ 50×) speedups over conventional black box and gradient-based MCMC algorithms can be obtained by exploiting Hessian information (from the log-posterior), underscoring the power of the integrated hIPPYlib-MUQ framework.",

This is partly because specific problems and specific matrix and preconditioner data structures in order to be solved efficiently, i.e., multiple implementations of a preconditioner with specialized data structures are required. This article presents a framework to support preconditioning with various, possibly user-defined, data structures for matrices that are partitioned into blocks. The main idea is to define data structures for the blocks, and an upper layer of software which uses these blocks transparently of their data structure. This transparency can be accomplished by using an object-oriented language. Thus, various preconditioners, such as block relaxations and block-incomplete factorizations, only need to be defined once and will work with any block type. In addition, it is possible to transparently interchange various approximate or exact techniques for inverting pivot blocks, or solving systems whose coefficient matrices are diagonal blocks. This leads to a rich variety of preconditioners that can be selected. Operations with the blocks are performed with optimized libraries or fundamental data types. Comparisons with an optimized Fortran 77 code on both workstations and Cray supercomputers show that this framework can approach the efficiency of Fortran 77, as long as suitable block sized and block types are chosen.",

On the basis of the interest raised by Talbot's method implementation, the author has been induced to investigate more deeply the possibilities of this method and has been able to generalize Talbot's method, to approximate simultaneously several values of f(t) using the same sampling values of the Laplace transform. In this way, the only unfavorable aspect of the classical Talbot method, that is, that of recomputing all of the samples of F(s) for each t , has been eliminated.",

The signal is approximated or represented as a superposition of \"basic\" waveforms chosen from a dictionary of such waveforms so as to best match the signal. The matching pursuit algorithm of Mallat and Zhang is such a method and is discussed in the context of discretized Gabor functions on an interval. We describe two software implementations based on these dictionaries. Both implementations rely on functions defined on an interval to avoid edge effects. One implementation allows for users to have great flexibility in the Gabor dictionary to be used. This is a useful improvement over other implementations, which only allow for a fixed dictionary. The other implementation takes advantage of the FFT algorithm and is faster. These implementations are written in C++, and can be used in practical applications.",

Any such matrix H of order n , normalized so that its subdiagonal elements are nonnegative, can be written as a product of n -1* Givens matrices and a diagonal matrix. This representation, which we refer to as the Schur parametric form of H , arises naturally in applications such as in signal processing and in the computation of Gauss-Szego quadrature rules. Our programs utilize the Schur parametrization to compute the spectral decomposition of H without explicitly forming the elements of H . If only the eigenvalues and first components of the eigenvectors are desired, as in the applications mentioned above, the algorithm requires only O(n 2 ) arithmetic operations. Experimental results presented indicate that the algorithm is reliable and competitive with the general QR algorithm applied to this problem. Moreover, the algorithm can be easily adapted for parallel implementation.— Authors' Abstract",

In stage 1 ( A, B is reduced to block upper Hessenberg-triangular form using mainly level 3 (matrix-matrix) operations that permit data reuse in the higher levels of a memory hierarchy. In the second stage all but one of the r subdiagonals of the block Hessenberg A -part are set to zero using Givens rotations. The algorithm proceeds in a sequence of supersweeps, each reducing m columns. The updates with respect to row and column rotations are organized to reference consecutive columns of A and B . To further improve the data locality, all rotations produced in a supersweep are stored to enable a left-looking reference pattern, i.e., all updates are delayed until they are required for the continuation of the supersweep. Moreover, we present a blocked variant of the single-diagonal double-shift QZ method for computing the generalized Schur form of ( A, B in upper Hessenberg-triangular form. The blocking for improved data locality is done similarly, now by restructuring the reference pattern of the updates associated with the bulge chasing in the QZ iteration. Timing results show that our new blocked variants outperform the current LAPACK routines, including drivers for the generalized eigenvalue problem, by a factor 2-5 for sufficiently large problems.",

    "abstract": "We consider the efficient implementation of the Cholesky solution of symmetric positive-definite dense linear systems of equations using packed storage. We take the same starting point as that of LINPACK and LAPACK, with the upper (or lower) triangular part of the matrix stored by columns. Following LINPACK and LAPACK, we overwrite the given matrix by its Cholesky factor. We consider the use of a hybrid format in which blocks of the matrices are held contiguously and compare this to the present LAPACK code. Code based on this format has the storage advantages of the present code but substantially outperforms it. Furthermore, it compares favorably to using conventional full format (LAPACK) and using the recursive format of Andersen et al. [2001].",

The resulting systems of linear algebraic equations have the same block-tridiagonal structure as traditional central differences and hence may be solved efficiently using the Fourier method. The performance of the method for a variety of test cases, including problems with nonsmooth solutions, is presented. The method is seen to be roughly twice as fast as deferred corrections and, in many cases, results in a smaller discretization error.",

In this paper we reorganize the sequence of operations for Householder bidiagonalization of a general m × n matrix, so that two (_GEMV) vector-matrix multiplications can be done with one pass of the unreduced trailing part of the matrix through cache. Two new BLAS operations approximately cut in half the transfer of data from main memory to cache, reducing execution times by up to 25 per cent. We give detailed algorithm descriptions and compare timings with the current LAPACK bidiagonalization algorithm.",

The functions under consideration are root and power functions, the exponential, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and their inverse functions. For such a function f and a given rectangular complex interval z , some interval w is computed that contains all function values of f in z . This is done by expressing the real and the imaginary part of f as compositions of real standard functions and then estimating the ranges of these compositions. In many cases, the inclusions are optimal, such that w is the smallest rectangular interval containing the range of f .

Built on top of SLEPc and PETSc, it can compute very large numbers of eigenpairs for sparse symmetric generalized eigenvalue problems. The development of SIPs is motivated by applications in nanoscale materials modeling, in which the growing size of the matrices and the pathological eigenvalue distribution challenge the efficiency and robustness of the solver. In this article, we present a parallel eigenvalue algorithm based on distributed spectrum slicing. We describe the object-oriented design and implementation techniques in SIPs, and demonstrate its numerical performance on an advanced distributed computer.",

By exploiting the relationship between the Voronoi diagram and the convex hull, the algorithm derives the approximation of the convex hull from the former. The other extreme vertices of the convex hull are then found by using a two-round checking in the digital and the continuous space successively. The algorithm does not need explicit locking or any other concurrency control mechanism, thus it can maximize the parallelism available on the modern GPU. The implementation using the CUDA programming model on NVIDIA GPUs is exact and efficient. The experiments show that it is up to an order of magnitude faster than other sequential convex hull implementations running on the CPU for inputs of millions of points. The works demonstrate that the GPU can be used to solve nontrivial computational geometry problems with significant performance benefit.",

The code development strategy, software design, and results from two application projects are presented for the Albany code: an implicit, unstructured grid, finite element code for the solution and analysis of partial differential equations. The driving strategy behind the development of Albany is the notion that it is increasingly possible, and advantageous, to build an application code from reusable software libraries connected by well-designed abstract interfaces. The main advantages and disadvantages of this strategy are presented. This approach is increasingly possible because of the tremendous breadth of capabilities now available in software libraries. These notably include the libraries delivered through the Trilinos suite of computational science tools which are the building blocks of Albany. The major features of the design of Albany, specifically the use of abstract layers and heavy use of independent libraries, are presented. Finally, two distinct case studies are shown that validate this approach by using the Albany code base to rapidly develop application codes born with a large set of solution and analysis capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical matrices are space- and time-efficient representations of dense matrices that exploit the low-rank structure of matrix blocks at different levels of granularity. The hierarchically low-rank block partitioning produces representations that can be stored and operated on in near-linear complexity instead of the usual polynomial complexity of dense matrices. In this article, we present high-performance implementations of matrix vector multiplication and compression operations for the H 2 variant of hierarchical matrices on GPUs. The H 2 variant exploits, in addition to the hierarchical block partitioning, hierarchical bases for the block representations and results in a scheme that requires only O ( n ) storage and O ( n ) complexity for the mat-vec and compression kernels. These two operations are at the core of algebraic operations for hierarchical matrices, the mat-vec being a ubiquitous operation in numerical algorithms while compression/recompression represents a key building block for other algebraic operations, which require periodic recompression during execution. The difficulties in developing efficient GPU algorithms come primarily from the irregular tree data structures that underlie the hierarchical representations, and the key to performance is to recast the computations on flattened trees in ways that allow batched linear algebra operations to be performed. This requires marshaling the irregularly laid out data in a way that allows them to be used by the batched routines. Marshaling operations only involve pointer arithmetic with no data movement and as a result have minimal overhead. Our numerical results on covariance matrices from 2D and 3D problems from spatial statistics show the high efficiency our routines achieve over 550GB/s for the bandwidth-limited matrix-vector operation and over 850GFLOPS/s in sustained performance for the compression operation on the P100 Pascal GPU.",

The aim was to develop a way of working with Galerkin operators in boundary element software that is as close to working with the strong form on paper as possible, while hiding the complexities of Galerkin discretisations. In this article, we demonstrate the implementation of this operator algebra and show, using various Laplace and Helmholtz example problems, how it significantly simplifies the definition and solution of a wide range of typical boundary integral equation problems.",

As a result, such approaches can only achieve practical speedup for relatively large, “squarish” matrices due to the extra memory overhead, and their usages are limited due to the considerable workspace. We present novel S trassen primitives for GPUs that can be composed to generate a family of S trassen algorithms. Our algorithms utilize both the memory and thread hierarchies on GPUs, reusing shared memory and register files inherited from gemm , fusing additional operations, and avoiding extra workspace. We further exploit intra- and inter-kernel parallelism by batching, streaming, and employing atomic operations. We develop a performance model for NVIDIA Volta GPUs to select the appropriate blocking parameters and predict the performance for gemm and S trassen . Overall, our 1-level S trassen can achieve up to 1.11× speedup with a crossover point as small as 1,536 compared to cublasSgemm on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. With additional workspace, our 2-level S trassen can achieve 1.19× speedup with a crossover point at 7,680.",

The algorithm uses a direct approach that decomposes 3D volume integrals or 2D surface integrals into multiple 1D integrals and computes the 1D integrals with Gaussian quadratures. It only requires finding roots of univariate nonlinear functions in given intervals and evaluating the integrand, the level set function, and the gradient of the level set function at given points. It can achieve arbitrarily high accuracy by increasing the orders of Gaussian quadratures, and it does not need extra a priori knowledge about the integrand and the level set function. The code for the algorithm is freely available in the open-source finite element toolbox Parallel Hierarchical Grid (PHG) and can serve as a basic building block for implementing 3D high-order numerical algorithms involving implicit interfaces or boundaries.",

    "abstract": "The traditional workflow in continuum mechanics simulations is that a geometry description -- for example obtained using Constructive Solid Geometry or Computer Aided Design tools -- forms the input for a mesh generator. The mesh is then used as the sole input for the finite element, finite volume, and finite difference solver, which at this point no longer has access to the original, \"underlying\" geometry. However, many modern techniques -- for example, adaptive mesh refinement and the use of higher order geometry approximation methods -- really do need information about the underlying geometry to realize their full potential. We have undertaken an exhaustive study of where typical finite element codes use geometry information, with the goal of determining what information geometry tools would have to provide. Our study shows that nearly all geometry-related needs inside the simulators can be satisfied by just two \"primitives\": elementary queries posed by the simulation software to the geometry description. We then show that it is possible to provide these primitives in all of the frequently used ways in which geometries are described in common industrial workflows, and illustrate our solutions using a number of examples.",

    "abstract": "One can simulate low-precision floating-point arithmetic via software by executing each arithmetic operation in hardware and then rounding the result to the desired number of significant bits. For IEEE-compliant formats, rounding requires only standard mathematical library functions, but handling subnormals, underflow, and overflow demands special attention, and numerical errors can cause mathematically correct formulae to behave incorrectly in finite arithmetic. Moreover, the ensuing implementations are not necessarily efficient, as the library functions these techniques build upon are typically designed to handle a broad range of cases and may not be optimized for the specific needs of rounding algorithms. CPFloat is a C library for simulating low-precision arithmetics. It offers efficient routines for rounding, performing mathematical computations, and querying properties of the simulated low-precision format. The software exploits the bit-level floating-point representation of the format in which the numbers are stored and replaces costly library calls with low-level bit manipulations and integer arithmetic. In numerical experiments, the new techniques bring a considerable speedup (typically one order of magnitude or more) over existing alternatives in C, C++, and MATLAB. To our knowledge, CPFloat is currently the most efficient and complete library for experimenting with custom low-precision floating-point arithmetic.",

To illustrate the speed and simplicity of the Monty Python method, we provide a small C program, self-contained, for rapid generation of normal (Gaussian) variables. It is self-contained in the sense that required uniform variates are generated in-line, as pairs of 16-bit integers by means of the remarkable new multiply-with-carry method.",

We introduce the necessary theory in terms of well known algorithms of numerical linear algebra applied to the linear, extended Jacobian system that prescribes the relationship between the derivatives of all variables in the function code. Using an example, we highlight the potential for numerical instability in vertex-elimination. We describe the source transformation implementation of our tool EliAD and present results from five test cases, four of which are taken from the MINPACK-2 collection (Averick et al, Report ANL/MCS-TM-150, 1992) and for which hand-coded Jacobian codes are available. On five computer/compiler platforms, we show that the Jacobian code obtained by EliAD is as efficient as hand-coded Jacobian code. It is also between 2 to 20 times more efficient than that produced by current, state of the art, Automatic Differentiation tools even when such tools make use of sophisticated techniques such as sparse Jacobian compression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of reverse-ordered pre-elimination from the (successively updated) extended Jacobian system of all intermediate variables used once. Thereafter, the monotonic forward/reverse ordered eliminations of all other intermediates is shown to be very efficient. On only one test case were orderings determined by the Markowitz or related VLR heuristics found superior. A re-ordering of the statements of the Jacobian code, with the aim of reducing reads and writes of data from cache to registers, was found to have mixed effects but could be very beneficial.",

A simple statistical model is used to find the relative performance of various addition procedures. It is shown that phrasing the question in terms of finding a best ordering is overly restrictive since the most natural and accurate procedures for performing the addition utilize the storage of intermediate sums as well as performing orderings.",

    "abstract": "Modern architectures have complex memory hierarchies and increasing parallelism (e.g., multicores). These features make achieving and maintaining good performance across rapidly changing architectures increasingly difficult. Performance has become a complex tradeoff, not just a simple matter of counting cost of simple CPU operations. We present a novel, hybrid, and adaptive recursive Strassen-Winograd's matrix multiplication (MM) that uses automatically tuned linear algebra software (ATLAS) or GotoBLAS. Our algorithm applies to any size and shape matrices stored in either row or column major layout (in double precision in this work) and thus is efficiently applicable to both C and FORTRAN implementations. In addition, our algorithm divides the computation into equivalent in-complexity sub-MMs and does not require any extra computation to combine the intermediary sub-MM results. We achieve up to 22% execution-time reduction versus GotoBLAS/ATLAS alone for a single core system and up to 19% for a two dual-core processor system. Most importantly, even for small matrices such as 1500 × 1500, our approach attains already 10% execution-time reduction and, for MM of matrices larger than 3000× 3000, it delivers performance that would correspond, for a classic O ( n 3 ) algorithm, to faster-than-processor peak performance (i.e., our algorithm delivers the equivalent of 5 GFLOPS performance on a system with 4.4 GFLOPS peak performance and where GotoBLAS achieves only 4 GFLOPS). This is a result of the savings in operations (and thus FLOPS). Therefore, our algorithm is faster than any classic MM algorithms could ever be for matrices of this size. Furthermore, we present experimental evidence based on established methodologies found in the literature that our algorithm is, for a family of matrices, as accurate as the classic algorithms.",

Novel parallel algorithms for solving reduced triangular matrix equations based on wavefront-like traversal of the right-hand side matrices are presented together with a generic scalability analysis. These algorithms are used in condition estimation and new robust parallel sep − 1 -estimators are developed. Experimental results from three parallel platforms, including results from a mixed OpenMP/MPI platform, are presented and analyzed using several performance and accuracy metrics.

(2) The size of the separator should be relatively small compared to the area of the subdomains. (3) The maximum area of the subdomains should be close to the average subdomain area. The domain decomposition method uses an approximation of a Medial Axis as an auxiliary structure for constructing the boundary of the subdomains (separators). The N -way decomposition is based on the “divide and conquer” algorithmic paradigm and on a smoothing procedure that eliminates the creation of any new artifacts in the subdomains. This approach produces well shaped uniform and graded domain decompositions, which are suitable for parallel mesh generation.",

This infrastructure is an obvious target for code reuse, except that implementations of these functionalities are typically tied to specific data structures. In this article, we describe a software component---an abstract data model and programming interface---designed to provide low-level mesh query and manipulation support for meshing and solution algorithms. The component’s data model provides a data abstraction, completely hiding all details of how mesh data is stored, while its interface defines how applications can interact with that data. Because the component has been carefully designed to be general purpose and efficient, it provides a practical platform for implementing high-level mesh operations independently of the underlying mesh data structures. After describing the data model and interface, we provide several usage examples, each of which has been used successfully with multiple implementations of the interface functionality. The overhead due to accessing mesh data through the interface rather than directly accessing the underlying mesh data is shown to be acceptably small.",

    "abstract": "A SemiDefinite Programming (SDP) problem is one of the most central problems in mathematical optimization. SDP provides an effective computation framework for many research fields. Some applications, however, require solving a large-scale SDP whose size exceeds the capacity of a single processor both in terms of computation time and available memory. SDPARA (SemiDefinite Programming Algorithm paRAllel package) [Yamashita et al. 2003b] was designed to solve such large-scale SDPs. Its parallel performance is outstanding for general SDPs in most cases. However, the parallel implementation is less successful for some sparse SDPs obtained from applications such as Polynomial Optimization Problems (POPs) or Sensor Network Localization (SNL) problems, since this version of SDPARA cannot directly handle sparse Schur Complement Matrices (SCMs). In this article we improve SDPARA by focusing on the sparsity of the SCM and we propose a new parallel implementation using the formula-cost-based distribution along with a replacement of the dense Cholesky factorization. We verify numerically that these features are key to solving SDPs with sparse SCMs more quickly on parallel computing systems. The performance is further enhanced by multithreading and the new SDPARA attains considerable scalability in general. It also finds solutions for extremely large-scale SDPs arising from POPs which cannot be obtained by other solvers.",

    "abstract": "The SPQR_RANK package contains routines that calculate the numerical rank of large, sparse, numerically rank-deficient matrices. The routines can also calculate orthonormal bases for numerical null spaces, approximate pseudoinverse solutions to least squares problems involving rank-deficient matrices, and basic solutions to these problems. The algorithms are based on SPQR from SuiteSparseQR (ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 38, Article 8, 2011). SPQR is a high-performance routine for forming QR factorizations of large, sparse matrices. It returns an estimate for the numerical rank that is usually, but not always, correct. The new routines improve the accuracy of the numerical rank calculated by SPQR and reliably determine the numerical rank in the sense that, based on extensive testing with matrices from applications, the numerical rank is almost always accurately determined when our methods report that the numerical rank should be correct. Reliable determination of numerical rank is critical to the other calculations in the package. The routines work well for matrices with either small or large null space dimensions.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a family of implementations of low order, additive, geometric multilevel solvers for systems of Helmholtz equations. Both grid spacing and arithmetics may comprise complex numbers and we thus can apply complex scaling techniques to the indefinite Helmholtz operator. Our implementations are based upon the notion of a spacetree and work exclusively with a finite number of precomputed local element matrices. They are globally matrix-free. Combining various relaxation factors with two grid transfer operators allows us to switch from pure additive multigrid over a hierarchical basis method into BPX with several multiscale smoothing variants within one code base. Pipelining allows us to realise a full approximation storage (FAS) scheme within the additive environment where, amortised, each grid vertex carrying degrees of freedom is read/written only once per iteration. The codes thus realise a single-touch policy. Among the features facilitated by matrix-free FAS is arbitrary dynamic mesh refinement (AMR) for all solver variants. AMR as enabler for full multigrid (FMG) cycling---the grid unfolds throughout the computation---allows us to reduce the cost per unknown per order of accuracy. The present paper primary contributes towards software realisation and design questions. Our experiments show that the consolidation of single-touch FAS, dynamic AMR and vectorisation-friendly, complex scaled, matrix-free FMG cycles delivers a mature implementation blueprint for solvers for a non-trivial class of problems such as Helmholtz equations. Besides this validation, we put particular emphasis on a strict implementation formalism as well as some implementation correctness proofs.",

Both the cubic and quartic solvers give highly accurate roots and place no restrictions on the magnitude of the polynomial coefficients. The key to the algorithm is a proper rescaling of both polynomials. This puts upper bounds on the magnitude of the roots and is very useful in stabilizing the root finding process. The cubic solver is based on dividing the cubic polynomial into six classes. By analyzing the root surface for each class, a fast convergent Newton-Raphson starting point for a real root is obtained at a cost no higher than three additions and four multiplications. The quartic solver uses the cubic solver in getting information about stationary points and, when the quartic has real roots, stable Newton-Raphson iterations give one of the extreme real roots. The remaining roots follow by composite deflation to a cubic. If the quartic has only complex roots, the present article shows that a stable Newton-Raphson iteration on a derived symmetric sixth degree polynomial can be formulated for the real parts of the complex roots. The imaginary parts follow by solving suitable quadratics.",

We begin by briefly identifying various challenges associated with the conventional approach, which calls for a carefully written kernel that implements complex arithmetic at the lowest possible level (i.e., assembly language). We then set out to develop a method of complex matrix multiplication that avoids the need for complex kernels altogether. This constraint promotes code reuse and portability within libraries such as Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms and BLAS-Like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) and allows kernel developers to focus their efforts on fewer and simpler kernels. We develop two alternative approaches—one based on the 3 m method and one that reflects the classic 4 m formulation—each with multiple variants, all of which rely only on real matrix multiplication kernels. We discuss the performance characteristics of these “induced” methods and observe that the assembly-level method actually resides along the 4 m spectrum of algorithmic variants. Implementations are developed within the BLIS framework, and testing on modern hardware confirms that while the less numerically stable 3 m method yields the fastest runtimes, the more stable (and thus widely applicable) 4 m method’s performance is somewhat limited due to implementation challenges that appear inherent in nature.",

Performance results show that the routines generated by TTC achieve close to peak memory bandwidth on both the Intel Haswell and the AMD Steamroller architectures and yield significant performance gains over modern compilers. By implementing a set of pruning heuristics, TTC allows users to limit the number of potential solutions; this option is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional tensors, as the search space might become prohibitively large.

The Winograd family of algorithms can greatly reduce the number of arithmetic operations required and is used in many DNN software frameworks.

In this article, we analyse the worst-case FP error and derive an estimation of the norm and conditioning of the algorithm. We show that the bound grows exponentially with the size of the convolution. Further, the error bound of the modified algorithm is slightly lower but still exponential. We propose several methods for reducing FP error. We propose a canonical evaluation ordering based on Huffman coding that reduces summation error. We study the selection of sampling “points” experimentally and find empirically good points for the most important sizes. We identify the main factors associated with good points. In addition, we explore other methods to reduce FP error, including mixed-precision convolution, and pairwise summation across DNN channels. Using our methods, we can significantly reduce FP error for a given block size, which allows larger block sizes to be used and reduced computation.",

The approach is based on the well-known domain-specific language UFL but combines it with loopy, a more powerful intermediate representation for the computational kernel. Given this flexible tool, we present and implement a new class of vectorization strategies for the assembly of Discontinuous Galerkin methods on hexahedral meshes exploiting the finite element’s tensor product structure. The performance-optimal variant from this class is chosen by the code generator through an auto-tuning approach. The implementation is done within the open source PDE software framework Dune and the discretization module dune-pdelab. The strength of the proposed approach is illustrated with performance measurements for DG schemes for a scalar diffusion reaction equation and the Stokes equation. In our measurements, we utilize both the AVX2 and the AVX512 instruction set, achieving 30% to 40% of the machine’s theoretical peak performance for one matrix-free application of the operator.",

A comprehensive test suite highlights the numerical robustness of the QDWH-SVD solver. Although it performs up to two times more flops when computing all singular vectors compared to the standard SVD solver algorithm, our new high performance implementation on single GPU results in up to 4× improvements for asymptotic matrix sizes, compared to the equivalent routines from existing state-of-the-art open-source and commercial libraries.

We prove that, starting from a warm start, the walk mixes to a log-concave target distribution $\\pi(x) \\propto e^{-f(x)}$, where $f$ is $L$-smooth and $m$-strongly-convex, within accuracy $\\varepsilon$ after $\\widetilde O(\\kappa d^2 \\ell^2 \\log (1 / \\varepsilon))$ steps for a well-rounded convex body where $\\kappa = L / m$ is the condition number of the negative log-density, $d$ is the dimension, $\\ell$ is an upper bound on the number of reflections, and $\\varepsilon$ is the accuracy parameter. We also developed an efficient open source implementation of ReHMC and we performed an experimental study on various high-dimensional data-sets. The experiments suggest that ReHMC outperfroms Hit-and-Run and Coordinate-Hit-and-Run regarding the time it needs to produce an independent sample and introduces practical truncated sampling in thousands of dimensions.",

    "abstract": "The Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a versatile and increasingly popular method for data driven analysis of dynamical systems that arise in a variety of applications in, e.g., computational fluid dynamics, robotics or machine learning. In the framework of numerical linear algebra, it is a data driven Rayleigh-Ritz procedure applied to a DMD matrix that is derived from the supplied data. In some applications, the physics of the underlying problem implies hermiticity of the DMD matrix, so the general DMD procedure is not computationally optimal. Furthermore, it does not guarantee important structural properties of the Hermitian eigenvalue problem and may return non-physical solutions. This paper proposes a software solution to the Hermitian (including the real symmetric) DMD matrices, accompanied with a numerical analysis that contains several fine and instructive numerical details. The eigenpairs are computed together with their residuals, and perturbation theory provides error bounds for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The software is developed and tested using the LAPACK package.",

A novel feature is that (almost) all the code defining one problem is textually contiguous in the Fortran text, unlike for example the DETEST package for ODE initial-value solvers where the definition of a problem is spread over several routines. The described implementation forms the infrastructure of the SLDRVER interactive package which supports exploration of a set of Sturm-Liouville problems with the four SL-solvers SLEIGN, SLEDGE, SL02F, and SLEIGN2. A “standard” set of 60 problems is provided, but it is simple to replace this by another one.",

Numerical testing was used to parameterize the minimum matrix dimension that must be used to achieve accuracy in the eigenvalue of one part in 10 12 . This method returns a set of eigenvalues below a given order and their associated solutions simultaneously. A second algorithm is presented which uses approximations to the eigenvalues (Taylor series and asymptotic expansions) and then iteratively corrects the approximations using Newton's method until the corrections are less than a given tolerance. A backward recursion of the continued fraction expansion is used. The second algorithm is faster and is optimized to obtain accuracy of one part in 10 14 , but has only been implemented for orders less than 10.5.",

The main advantage of the algorithms is that they have to pass through the data items only once to produce a sample of arbitrary size n .We give different variants of the algorithm for sampling with and without replacement and analyze their complexity. We generalize earlier results of Knuth on reservoir sampling with a uniform sampling distribution. The general distribution considered here allows us to sample an item with a probability equal to the relative weight (or fitness) of the data item within the whole set of items.

The emphasis in our comparison is on the accuracy of the solution, including the phase information produced by nonsympletic methods; the symplectic methods have been included to provide a contrast. Long intervals of integration necessitate small local error tolerances for the nonsymplectic integrators.Among variable-stepsize integrators, RKNINT requires the least CPU time on the two problems with Newtonian interactions and DIVA the least CPU time on the other two problems for the intervals of integration we used. We find that the error growth on some integrations is noticeably slower than predicted by asymptotic analysis of the truncation and round-off error. Our comparisons suggest that the numerical solutions near the end of a billion year simulation in double precision with variable-stepsize nonsymplectic methods would have poor accuracy.",

This API expresses algorithms at a higher level of abstraction, avoids the use loop and array indices, and represents these algorithms as they are formally derived and presented. We report on two implementations of the workqueuing model, neither of which requires the use of explicit indices to specify parallelism. The first implementation uses the experimental taskq pragma, which may influence the adoption of a similar construct into OpenMP 3.0. The second workqueuing implementation is domain-specific to FLAME but allows us to illustrate the benefits of sorting tasks according to their computational cost prior to parallel execution. In addition, we discuss how scalable parallelization of dense linear algebra algorithms via OpenMP will require a two-dimensional partitioning of operands much like a 2D data distribution is needed on distributed memory architectures. We illustrate the issues and solutions by discussing the parallelization of the symmetric rank-k update and report impressive performance on an SGI system with 14 Itanium2 processors.",

    "abstract": "We present three new object-oriented software design patterns in Fortran 2003 and C++. These patterns integrate coupled differential equations, facilitating the flexible swapping of physical and numerical software abstractions at compile-time and runtime. The Semi-Discrete pattern supports the time advancement of a dynamical system encapsulated in a single abstract data type (ADT). The Puppeteer pattern combines ADTs into a multiphysics package, mediates interabstraction communications, and enables implicit marching even when nonlinear terms couple separate ADTs with private data. The Surrogate pattern emulates C++ forward references in Fortran 2003. After code demonstrations using the Lorenz equations, we provide architectural descriptions of our use of the new patterns in extending the Rouson et al. [2008a] Navier-Stokes solver to simulate multiphysics phenomena. We also describe the relationships between the new patterns and two previously developed architectural elements: the Strategy pattern of Gamma et al. [1995] and the template emulation technique of Akin [2003]. This report demonstrates how these patterns manage complexity by providing logical separation between individual physics models and the control logic that bridges between them. Additionally, it shows how language features such as operator overloading and automated memory management enable a clear mathematical notation for model bridging and system evolution.",

We derive lower bounds on memory traffic between different levels of the hierarchy for these two models. We also develop algorithms for the binomial and trinomial models that have near-optimal memory traffic between levels. We have implemented these algorithms on an UltraSparc IIIi processor with a 4-level of memory hierarchy and demonstrated that our algorithms outperform algorithms without cache blocking by a factor of up to 5 and operate at 70% of peak performance.",

    "abstract": "We describe a new data format for storing triangular, symmetric, and Hermitian matrices called Rectangular Full Packed Format (RFPF). The standard two-dimensional arrays of Fortran and C (also known as full format ) that are used to represent triangular and symmetric matrices waste nearly half of the storage space but provide high performance via the use of Level 3 BLAS. Standard packed format arrays fully utilize storage (array space) but provide low performance as there is no Level 3 packed BLAS. We combine the good features of packed and full storage using RFPF to obtain high performance via using Level 3 BLAS as RFPF is a standard full-format representation. Also, RFPF requires exactly the same minimal storage as packed the format. Each LAPACK full and/or packed triangular, symmetric, and Hermitian routine becomes a single new RFPF routine based on eight possible data layouts of RFPF. This new RFPF routine usually consists of two calls to the corresponding LAPACK full-format routine and two calls to Level 3 BLAS routines. This means no new software is required. As examples, we present LAPACK routines for Cholesky factorization, Cholesky solution, and Cholesky inverse computation in RFPF to illustrate this new work and to describe its performance on several commonly used computer platforms. Performance of LAPACK full routines using RFPF versus LAPACK full routines using the standard format for both serial and SMP parallel processing is about the same while using half the storage. Performance gains are roughly one to a factor of 43 for serial and one to a factor of 97 for SMP parallel times faster using vendor LAPACK full routines with RFPF than with using vendor and/or reference packed routines.",

    "abstract": "In many scientific and engineering applications, one has to solve not one but multiple instances of the same problem. Often times, these problems are linked in a way that allows intermediate results to be reused. A characteristic example for this class of applications is given by the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), a widely spread tool in computational biology. GWAS entails the solution of up to trillions (10 12 ) of correlated generalized least-squares problems, posing a daunting challenge: the performance of petaflops (10 15 floating-point operations) over terabytes (10 12 bytes) of data. In this article, we design an algorithm for performing GWAS on multicore architectures. This is accomplished in three steps. First, we show how to exploit the relation among successive problems, thus reducing the overall computational complexity. Then, through an analysis of the required data transfers, we identify how to eliminate any overhead due to input/output operations. Finally, we study how to decompose computation into tasks to be distributed among the available cores, to attain high performance and scalability. With our algorithm, a GWAS that currently requires the use of a supercomputer may now be performed in matter of hours on a single multicore node. The discussion centers around the methodology to develop the algorithm rather than the specific application. We believe this article contributes valuable guidelines of general applicability for computational scientists on how to develop and optimize numerical algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale parameter estimation problems are among some of the most computationally demanding problems in numerical analysis. An academic researcher’s domain-specific knowledge often precludes that of software design, which results in inversion frameworks that are technically correct but not scalable to realistically sized problems. On the other hand, the computational demands for realistic problems result in industrial codebases that are geared solely for high performance, rather than comprehensibility or flexibility. We propose a new software design for inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations that bridges the gap between these two seemingly disparate worlds. A hierarchical and modular design reduces the cognitive burden on the user while exploiting high-performance primitives at the lower levels. Our code has the added benefit of actually reflecting the underlying mathematics of the problem, which lowers the cognitive load on the user using it and reduces the initial startup period before a researcher can be fully productive. We also introduce a new preconditioner for the 3D Helmholtz equation that is suitable for fault-tolerant distributed systems. Numerical experiments on a variety of 2D and 3D test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on scaling algorithms from small- to large-scale problems with minimal code changes.",

    "abstract": "Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are of increasing importance in scientific high-performance computing to reduce development costs, raise the level of abstraction, and, thus, ease scientific programming. However, designing DSLs is not easy, as it requires knowledge of the application domain and experience in language engineering and compilers. Consequently, many DSLs follow a weak approach using macros or text generators, which lack many of the features that make a DSL comfortable for programmers. Some of these features—e.g., syntax highlighting, type inference, error reporting—are easily provided by language workbenches, which combine language engineering techniques and tools in a common ecosystem. In this article, we present the Parallel Particle-Mesh Environment (PPME), a DSL and development environment for numerical simulations based on particle methods and hybrid particle-mesh methods. PPME uses the Meta Programming System, a projectional language workbench. PPME is the successor of the Parallel Particle-Mesh Language, a Fortran-based DSL that uses conventional implementation strategies. We analyze and compare both languages and demonstrate how the programmer’s experience is improved using static analyses and projectional editing, i.e., code-structure editing, constrained by syntax, as opposed to free-text editing. We present an explicit domain model for particle abstractions and the first formal type system for particle methods.",

The key is a novel, cache-friendly algorithm for applying multiple sets of Givens rotations to the eigenvector/singular vector matrix. This algorithm is then implemented with optimizations that: (1) leverage vector instruction units to increase floating-point throughput, and (2) fuse multiple rotations to decrease the total number of memory operations. We demonstrate the merits of these new QR algorithms for computing the Hermitian eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) of dense matrices when all eigenvectors/singular vectors are computed. The approach yields vastly improved performance relative to traditional QR algorithms for these problems and is competitive with two commonly used alternatives---Cuppen’s Divide-and-Conquer algorithm and the method of Multiple Relatively Robust Representations---while inheriting the more modest O ( n ) workspace requirements of the original QR algorithms. Since the computations performed by the restructured algorithms remain essentially identical to those performed by the original methods, robust numerical properties are preserved.",

As a result, compared to other orthogonalization schemes, SVQR obtains superior performance on many of the current computers, where the communication has become significantly more expensive compared to the arithmetic operations. In this article, we study the stability and performance of various SVQR implementations on multicore CPUs with a GPU. Our focus is on the dense triangular solve, which performs half of the total floating-point operations of SVQR. As a part of this study, we examine an adaptive mixed-precision variant of SVQR, which decides if a lower-precision arithmetic can be used for the triangular solution at runtime without increasing the order of its orthogonality error (though its backward error is significantly greater). If the greater backward error can be tolerated, then our performance results with an NVIDIA Kepler GPU show that the mixed-precision SVQR can obtain a speedup of up to 1.36 over the standard SVQR.",

    "abstract": "Implicitly described domains are a well-established tool in the simulation of time-dependent problems, for example, using level-set methods. To solve partial differential equations on such domains, a range of numerical methods was developed, for example, the Immersed Boundary method, the Unfitted Finite Element or Unfitted Discontinuous Galerkin methods, and the eXtended or Generalised Finite Element methods, just to name a few. Many of these methods involve integration over cut-cells or their boundaries, as they are described by sub-domains of the original level-set mesh. We present a new algorithm to geometrically evaluate the integrals over domains described by a first-order, conforming level-set function. The integration is based on a polyhedral reconstruction of the implicit geometry, following the concepts of the marching cubes algorithm. The algorithm preserves various topological properties of the implicit geometry in its polyhedral reconstruction, making it suitable for Finite Element computations. Numerical experiments show second-order accuracy of the integration. An implementation of the algorithm is available as free software, which allows for an easy incorporation into other projects. The software is in productive use within the DUNE framework (Bastian et al. 2008a).",

The MSS method makes use of a recently proposed stable fast direct method for solving large shifted BFGS systems of equations [Erway and Marcia 2012; Erway et al. 2012] and is able to compute solutions to any user-defined accuracy. This MATLAB implementation is a matrix-free iterative method for large-scale optimization. Numerical experiments on the CUTEr [Bongartz et al. 1995; Gould et al. 2003]) suggest that using the MSS method as a trust-region subproblem solver can require significantly fewer function and gradient evaluations needed by a trust-region method as compared with the Steihaug-Toint method.",

A key innovation in our algorithm is the implementation of a heap data structure for storing the break points of the dual function and computing the solution of the dual problem. Also, a new version of the variable fixing algorithm is developed that is convergent even when the objective Hessian is not strictly positive definite.

Many users depend on reproducibility for debugging or correctness. However, dynamic scheduling of parallel computing resources, combined with nonassociative floating point addition, makes reproducibility challenging even for summation, or operations like the BLAS. We describe a “reproducible accumulator” data structure (the “binned number”) and associated algorithms to reproducibly sum binary floating point numbers, independent of summation order. We use a subset of the IEEE Floating Point Standard 754-2008 and bitwise operations on the standard representations in memory. Our approach requires only one read-only pass over the data, and one reduction in parallel, using a 6-word reproducible accumulator (more words can be used for higher accuracy), enabling standard tiling optimization techniques. Summing n words with a 6-word reproducible accumulator requires approximately 9 n floating point operations (arithmetic, comparison, and absolute value) and approximately 3 n bitwise operations. The final error bound with a 6-word reproducible accumulator and our default settings can be up to 2 29 times smaller than the error bound for conventional (recursive) summation on ill-conditioned double-precision inputs.",

The central assumption on the underlying arithmetic is the first standard model for error analysis for operations on a discrete set of real numbers. Neither do we require a floating-point grid nor a rounding to nearest property. Based on that, we define a relative rounding error unit u and prove rigorous error bounds for the computed result of an arbitrary arithmetic expression depending on u, the size of the expression, and possibly a condition measure. In the second part of this note, we extend the error analysis by examining requirements to ensure faithfully rounded outputs and apply our results to IEEE 754 standard conform floating-point systems. For a class of mathematical expressions, using an IEEE 754 standard conform arithmetic with base β , the result is proved to be faithfully rounded for up to 1 / √ β u - 2 operations. Our findings cover a number of previously published algorithms to compute faithfully rounded results, among them Horner’s scheme, products, sums, dot products, or Euclidean norm. Beyond that, several other problems can be analyzed, such as polynomial interpolation, orientation problems, Householder transformations, or the smallest singular value of Hilbert matrices of large size.",

In this article, we present H2Pack, a high-performance, shared-memory library for constructing and operating with H 2 matrix representations for kernel matrices defined by non-oscillatory, translationally invariant kernel functions. Using a hybrid analytic-algebraic compression method called the proxy point method, H2Pack can efficiently construct an H 2 matrix representation with linear computational complexity. Storage and matrix-vector multiplication also have linear complexity. H2Pack also introduces the concept of “partially admissible blocks” for H 2 matrices to make H 2 matrix-vector multiplication mathematically identical to the fast multipole method (FMM) if analytic expansions are used. We optimize H2Pack from both the algorithm and software perspectives. Compared to existing FMM libraries, H2Pack generally has much faster H 2 matrix-vector multiplications, since the proxy point method is more effective at producing block low-rank approximations than the analytic methods used in FMM. As a tradeoff, H 2 matrix construction in H2Pack is typically more expensive than the setup cost in FMM libraries. Thus, H2Pack is ideal for applications that need a large number of matrix-vector multiplications for a given configuration of data points.",

A library of interpolation-based modelling tools is also described, which can be associated with the structured or unstructured versions of the initial pattern search algorithm. The use of the library further enhances performance, especially when associated with structure. The significant gains in performance associated with these two techniques are illustrated using a new freely-available release of the Brute Force Optimizer (BFO) package firstly introduced in [Porcelli and Toint 2017 ], which incorporates them.

    "abstract": "Multi-degree Tchebycheffian splines are splines with pieces drawn from extended (complete) Tchebycheff spaces, which may differ from interval to interval, and possibly of different dimensions. These are a natural extension of multi-degree polynomial splines. Under quite mild assumptions, they can be represented in terms of a so-called MDTB-spline basis; such basis possesses all the characterizing properties of the classical polynomial B-spline basis. We present a practical framework to compute MDTB-splines, and provide an object-oriented implementation in Matlab. The implementation supports the construction, differentiation, and visualization of MDTB-splines whose pieces belong to Tchebycheff spaces that are null-spaces of constant-coefficient linear differential operators. The construction relies on an extraction operator that maps local Tchebycheffian Bernstein functions to the MDTB-spline basis of interest.",

The normal form is computed up to fifth order, which enables the detection and analysis of codimension-two points where the criticality of the bifurcation changes. The expressions are implemented within a Python package, in which the user needs to specify only expressions for the reaction kinetics and the values of diffusion constants. The code is augmented with a Mathematica routine to compute curves of Turing bifurcations in a parameter plane and automatically detect codimension-two points. The software is illustrated with examples that show the versatility of the method including a case with cross-diffusion, a higher-order scalar equation and a four-component system.",

A visualization aid for continuous-valued recommendation spaces is also outlined. Two case studies are presented to illustrate our approach and tools: (i) a comparison of an iterative and a direct linear system solver on nearly singular problems, and (ii) a comparison of two iterative solvers on problems posed on nonrectangular domains. Both case studies involve continuously varying problem and method parameters which strongly influence the choice of best algorithm in particular cases. By mining the results from thousands of PDE solves, we can gain valuable insight into the relative performance of these methods on similar problems.",

    "abstract": "BACOL is a new, high quality, robust software package in Fortran 77 for solving one-dimensional parabolic PDEs, which has been shown to be significantly more efficient than any other widely available software package of the same class (to our knowledge), especially for problems with solutions exhibiting rapid spatial variation. A novel feature of this package is that it employs high order, adaptive methods in both time and space, controlling and balancing both spatial and temporal error estimates. The software implements a spline collocation method at Gaussian points, with a B-spline basis, for the spatial discretization. The time integration is performed using a modification of the popular DAE solver, DASSL. Based on the computation of a second, higher order, global solution, a high quality a posteriori spatial error estimate is obtained after each successful time step. The spatial error is controlled by a sophisticated new mesh selection algorithm based on an equidistribution principle. In this article we describe the overall structure of the BACOL package, and in particular the modifications to the DASSL package that improve its performance within BACOL. An example is provided in the online Appendix to illustrate the use of the package.",

PyTrilinos vector objects are integrated with the popular NumPy Python module, gathering together a variety of high-level distributed computing operations with serial vector operations. PyTrilinos is a set of interfaces to existing, compiled libraries. This hybrid framework uses Python as front-end, and efficient precompiled libraries for all computationally expensive tasks. Thus, we take advantage of both the flexibility and ease of use of Python, and the efficiency of the underlying C++, C, and FORTRAN numerical kernels. Out numerical results show that, for many important problem classes, the overhead required by the Python interpreter is negligible. To run in parallel, PyTrilinos simply requires a standard Python interpreter. The fundamental MPI calls are encapsulated under an abstract layer that manages all interprocessor communications. This makes serial and parallel scripts using PyTrilinos virtually identical.",

    "abstract": "We discuss how to modify a recently published Matlab code, coteglob, so that the excellent performance this code demonstrates for low and intermediate accuracy requests is retained while the performance is improved for high accuracy requests. coteglob is a globally adaptive code using a 5 and 9 point pair of Newton-Cotes rules. Combining an extended sequence of rules using 5, 9, 17 and 33 points with a doubly adaptive bisection strategy is the main focus of the paper. We also discuss local versus global adaptivity and conclude that globally adaptive codes are to be preferred. Based on this we develop several new globally adaptive codes that all compare favorably both with coteglob, with Matlab's best currently available quadrature software quadl and the general purpose QUADPACK codes dqk15 and dqk21. We include the results from extensive testing using both a Lyness-Kaganove testing technique and a battery test.",

    "abstract": "Surfaces of R 3 are ubiquitous in science and engineering, and estimating the local differential properties of a surface discretized as a point cloud or a triangle mesh is a central building block in computer graphics, computer aided design, computational geometry, and computer vision. One strategy to perform such an estimation consists of resorting to polynomial fitting, either interpolation or approximation, but this route is difficult for several reasons: choice of the coordinate system, numerical handling of the fitting problem, and extraction of the differential properties. This article presents a generic C++ software package solving these problems. On the theoretical side and as established in a companion paper, the interpolation and approximation methods provided achieve the best asymptotic error bounds known to date. On the implementation side and following state-of-the-art coding rules in computational geometry, genericity of the package is achieved thanks to four template classes accounting for, (a) the type of the input points, (b) the internal geometric computations, (c) a conversion mechanism between these two geometries, and (d) the linear algebra operations. An instantiation within the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL, version 3.3) and using LAPACK is also provided.",

On our target machine, all variants outperform standard full-storage implementations while saving almost half the storage. Communication overhead is shown to be virtually eliminated by the Static and Dynamic variants, both of which take advantage of hardware parallelism to hide communication costs. The Basic variant is shown to yield comparable or slightly better performance than the full-storage ScaLAPACK routine PDPOTRF while clearly outperformed by both Static and Dynamic. Models of execution assuming zero communication costs and overhead are developed.

Finitely convergent sequential algorithms can be used for solving such problems; an example of such an algorithm is ART3, which is defined in such a way that its control is cyclic in the sense that during its execution it repeatedly cycles through the given constraints. Previously we found a variant of ART3 whose control is no longer cyclic, but which is still finitely convergent and in practice it usually converges faster than ART3 does. In this paper we propose a general methodology for automatic transformation of finitely convergent sequential algorithms in such a way that (i) finite convergence is retained and (ii) the speed of convergence is improved. The first of these two properties is proven by mathematical theorems, the second is illustrated by applying the algorithms to a practical problem.",

We present a standardization of notation and language which can be used to discuss Costas array generation techniques and array manipulations. Using this standardization we can concisely and clearly state various theorems about Costas arrays, including several new theorems about the symmetries of Costas arrays. We also define labels for each array (generated, emergent, and sporadic), which describe whether the array is generated using a known technique, generated using a semiempirical variation of a known technique, or of unexplained origin. A new method for obtaining emergent Costas arrays, the DRT expansion, is also given here for the first time. A MATLAB Costas array toolbox has also been developed which implements the proposed standardization. The toolbox contains a comprehensive set of functions covering Costas array generation, manipulation and classification.",

The algorithm is based on the basic (nonpartitioned) methods of Parlett and Reid and of Aasen. We show that our factorization algorithm is componentwise backward stable (provided that the growth factor is not too large), with a similar behavior to that of Aasen’s basic algorithm. Our implementation also computes the QR factorization of T and solves linear systems of equations using the computed factorization. The partitioning allows our algorithm to exploit modern computer architectures (in particular, cache memories and high-performance blas libraries). Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms achieve approximately the same level of performance as the partitioned Bunch-Kaufman factor and solve routines in lapack .",

Instead of vendor-tuned BLAS, a programmer could start with source code in Fortran or C (e.g., based on the Netlib BLAS) and use a state-of-the-art optimizing compiler. However, our experiments show that optimizing compilers often attain only one-quarter of the performance of hand-optimized code. In this article, we present a domain-specific compiler for matrix kernels, the Build to Order BLAS (BTO), that reliably achieves high performance using a scalable search algorithm for choosing the best combination of loop fusion, array contraction, and multithreading for data parallelism. The BTO compiler generates code that is between 16% slower and 39% faster than hand-optimized code.",

    "abstract": "In the last few decades, the search for exact algorithms for known NP-hard geometric problems has intensified. Many of these solutions use Integer Linear Programming (ILP) modeling and rely on state-of-the- art solvers to be able to find optimal solutions for large instances in a matter of minutes. In this work, we discuss an ILP-based algorithm that solves to optimality the Art Gallery Problem (AGP), one of the most studied problems in computational geometry. The basic idea of our method is to iteratively generate upper and lower bounds for the problem through the resolution of discretized versions of the AGP, which are reduced to instances of the Set Cover Problem. Our algorithm was implemented and tested on almost 3,000 instances and attained optimal solutions for the vast majority of them, greatly increasing the set of instances for which exact solutions are known. To the best of our knowledge, in spite of the extensive study of the AGP in the last four decades, no other algorithm has shown the ability to solve the AGP as effectively and efficiently as the one described here. Evidence of its robustness is presented through tests done on a number of classes of polygons of various sizes with and without holes. A software package implementing the algorithm is made available.",

In contrast to the CAD, Bertini_real produces cells with midpoints connected to boundary points by homotopies, which can easily be numerically tracked. Furthermore, the implemented decomposition for surfaces naturally yields a triangulation. This CAD-like decomposition captures the topological information and permits further computation on the real sets, such as sampling, visualization, and three-dimensional printing.",

When such features take the form of correlations between the eigenvectors of consecutive problems, as is the case in many real-world applications, the potential benefit of exploiting them can be substantial. We present the Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver (ChASE), a modern algorithm and library based on subspace iteration with polynomial acceleration. Novel to ChASE is the computation of the spectral estimates that enter in the filter and an optimization of the polynomial degree that further reduces the necessary floating-point operations. ChASE is written in C++ using the modern software engineering concepts that favor a simple integration in application codes and a straightforward portability over heterogeneous platforms. When solving sequences of Hermitian eigenproblems for a portion of their extremal spectrum, ChASE greatly benefits from the sequence’s spectral properties and outperforms direct solvers in many scenarios. The library ships with two distinct parallelization schemes, supports execution over distributed GPUs, and is easily extensible to other parallel computing architectures.",

It is shown that the execution time required by the algorithm, when run at its highest accuracy, may be improved by more than a factor of 2. A better accuracy vs efficiency tradeoff scheme is also implemented; this requires the user to supply the number of significant figures desired in the computed values as an extra input argument to the function. Using this tradeoff, it is shown that the efficiency of the algorithm may be further improved significantly while maintaining reasonably accurate and safe results that are free of the pitfalls and complete loss of accuracy seen in other competitive techniques. The current version of the code is provided in Matlab and Scilab in addition to a Fortran translation prepared to meet the needs of real-world problems where very large numbers of function evaluations would require the use of a compiled language. To fulfill this last requirement, a recently proposed reformed version of Humlíček's w4 routine, shown to maintain the claimed accuracy of the algorithm over a wide and fine grid, is implemented in the present Fortran translation for the case of four significant figures. This latter modification assures the reliability of the code in the solution of practical problems requiring numerous evaluation of the function for applications requiring low-accuracy computations (&lt;10 −4 ).",

The code automatically detects and locates accurately the switching points of the PWS, restarting the integration after each discontinuity. Further, in the case of Filippov systems, algorithms to handle properly sliding mode regimes in an automatic way are included. The code requires the user to provide a description of the IVP and the functions defining the hypersurfaces where the switching points are located, and it returns the discrete approximated solution together with the switching points. Several numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the reliability and efficiency of the code.",

Automatic differentiation is a method to obtain gradients of numerical programs, which are crucial in optimization, uncertainty quantification, and machine learning. The computational cost to compute gradients is a common bottleneck in practice. For applications that are parallelized for multicore CPUs or GPUs using OpenMP, one also wishes to compute the gradients in parallel. We propose a framework to reason about the correctness of the generated derivative code, from which we justify our OpenMP extension to the differentiation model. We implement this model in the automatic differentiation tool Tapenade and present test cases that are differentiated following our extended differentiation procedure. Performance of the generated derivative programs in forward and reverse mode is better than sequential, although our reverse mode often scales worse than the input programs.",

Derivgrind leverages the Valgrind instrumentation framework for structured access to the machine code, and a shadow memory tool to store dot values. Access to the source code is required at most for the files in which input and output variables are defined. Derivgrind’s versatility mainly comes at the price of reduced run-time performance. According to our extensive regression test suite, Derivgrind produces correct results on GCC- and Clang-compiled programs, including a Python interpreter, with a small number of exceptions. We provide a list of “bit-tricks” that Derivgrind does not handle correctly, some of which actually appear in highly optimized math libraries.

Evaluating a LUT can be as quick as using Horner’s method to evaluate a polynomial after looking up its coefficients.

Here, we describe the functionality of FunC 2.0 , a C++ library designed to streamline the process of building, comparing, and implementing univariate LUTs in practical applications. In particular, FunC 2.0 can build relatively small LUTs satisfying user-provided absolute and relative tolerances for error. Furthermore, FunC 2.0 can build nonuniform LUTs, it provides utilities to quickly determine reasonable LUT bounds and tolerances for error, and it provides a way to quickly profile a set of LUTs. We demonstrate FunC ’s utility in application by reducing the total runtime of a simulation performed by the Canadian Hydrological Model (CHM). This simulation modelled the snow mass distribution across Western Canada over one month. Now, CHM can evaluate the mathematical function of interest about \\(28\\) times faster, allowing the necessary algorithm to finish \\(2\\) times faster, and the overall simulation is about \\(9\\%\\) faster.",

To achieve this, TorchBraid integrates the PyTorch neural network framework with the state-of-the-art XBraid time-parallel library. This paper presents the use and performance of TorchBraid, in addition to solutions for overcoming the algorithmic challenges inherent in combining automatic differentiation with layer-parallel.

Integration of layer-parallel with data-parallel algorithms is presented for the first time, showing the computational advantages of the combination. Standard deep learning techniques, like batch-normalization, are developed for layer-parallel training.

Since computational simulation often requires intricate and highly efficient codes, the performance penalty of high-level techniques must always be weighed against the improvements they enable. These issues are addressed in a general object-oriented (OO) toolkit for the numerical solution of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). The toolkit can be configured in several different ways to solve DAE initial-value problems with an adaptive multistep method. It contains a wrapped version of the Fortran 77 code DASPK and a translation of this to C++. Two C++ constructs for assembling the tools are provided, as are two implementations an important DAE test problem. Multiple configurations of the toolkit for DAE test problems are compared in order to assess the performance penalties of C++. The mathematical methods and implementation techniques are discussed in detail in order to provide heuristics for efficient OO scientific programming and to demonstrate the effectiveness of OO techniques in managing complexity and producing better code. The codes were tested on a variety of problems using publicly available Fortran 77 and C++ compilers. Extensive effficiency comparisons are presented in order to isolate computationally inefficient OO techniques. Techniques that caused difficulty in implementation and maintenance are also highlighted. The comparisons demonstrate that the majority of C++'s built-in support for OO programming has a negligible effect on performance, when used at sufficiently high levels, and provides flexible and extensible software for numerical methods.",

By using this interface, numerical optimization algorithms can be designed to take advantage of inherent problem features like the splitting of the variables into states and controls and the scaling inherited from the functional scalar products. Further, the interface allows the optimization algorithm to make efficient use of user-provided function evaluations and derivative calculations.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the LAPACK project is to provide efficient and portable software for dense numerical linear algebra computations. By recasting many of the fundamental dense matrix computations in terms of calls to an efficient implementation of the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), the LAPACK project has, in large part, achieved its goal. Unfortunately, the efficient implementation of the BLAS results often in machine-specific code that is not portable across multiple architectures without a significant loss in performance or a significant effort to reoptimize them. This article examines wheter most of the hand optimizations performed on matrix factorization codes are unnecessary because they can (and should) be performed by the compiler. We believe that it is better for the programmer to express algorithms in a machine-independent form and allow the compiler to handle the machine-dependent details. This gives the algorithms portability across architectures and removes the error-prone, expensive and tedious process of hand optimization. Although there currently exist no production compilers that can perform all the loop transformations discussed in this article, a description of current research in compiler technology is provided that will prove beneficial to the numerical linear algebra community. We show that the Cholesky and optimized automaticlaly by a compiler to be as efficient as the same hand-optimized version found in LAPACK. We also show that the QR factorization may be optimized by the compiler to perform comparably with the hand-optimized LAPACK version on modest matrix sizes. Our approach allows us to conclude that with the advent of the compiler optimizations dicussed in this article, matrix factorizations may be efficiently implemented in a BLAS-less form",

    "abstract": "Numerical techniques based on piecewise polynomial (that is, spline) collation at Gaussian points are exceedingly effective for the approximate solution of boundary value problems, both for ordinary differential equations and for time dependent partial differential equations. There are several widely available computer codes based on this approach, all of which have at their core a particular choice of basis representation for the piecewise polynomials used to approximate the solutions. Until recently, the most popular approach was to use a B-spline representation, but it has been shown that the B-spline basis is inferior, both in operation counts and conditioning, to a certain monomial basis, and the latter has come more into favor. In this paper, we describe a linear algebraic equations which arise in spline collocation at Gaussian points with such a monomial basis. It is shown that the new package, which implements an alternate column and row pivoting algorithm, is a distinct improvement over existing packages from the points of view of speed and storage requirements. In addition, we describe a second package, an important special case of the first, for solving the almost block diagonal systems which arise when condensation is applied to the systems arising in spline collocation at Gaussian points, and also in other methods for solving two-point boundary value problems, such as implicit Runge-Kutta methods and multiple shooting.",

    "abstract": "We define the spline interpolating function, and obtain in directly computable form the elementary set of nonlinear equations describing nonlinear spline curves. Using Newton's and Newton-like methods, we solve typical spline configurations, and hence infer that the procedure will reliably yield precise extremum-energy solutions to nonlinear splines of arbitrary (but presumably reasonable) size and complexity. In order to distinguish between stable and unstable states of spline equilibria, we evaluate the energy change resulting from a perturbation, and we briefly discuss aspects of spline existence and uniqueness in relation to the solved examples. We demonstrate the abrupt transition which occurs at the threshold between spline existence and nonexistence, and conclude that proof of a spline's existence is implicit in the solution set of constants yielded by the method. The procedure may be regarded on the one hand as a precise and efficient research instrument for investigating the properties of true splines and elastica, and on the other as an everyday method for obtaining “the smoothest interpolating curve of all. Contact is always maintained with the physical analogue to the curve, the thin uniform elastic beam, since the four assignable parameters used in each spline interval comprise the necessary and sufficient three angles and one length dimension of the actual physical spline. On an historical note, the method may be seen to offer progress in the search, begun in the late 17th century, for a definitive solution to the elastica problem.",

    "abstract": "Automatic differentiation is an interesting and important tool for all numerical algorithms that require derivatives, e.g., in nonlinear programming, optimal control, parameter estimation, and differential equations. The basic idea is to avoid not only numerical approximations, which are expensive with respect to CPU time and contain round-off errors, but also hand-coded differentiation. This article introduces the forward and backward accumulation methods and describes the numerical implementation of a computer code with the name PCOMP. The main intention of the approach used is to provide a flexible and portable Fortran code for practical applications. The underlying language is described in terms of a formal grammar and is a subset of Fortran with a few extensions. Besides a parser that generates an intermediate code and that can be executed independently from the evaluation routines, there are other subroutines for the direct computation of function and gradient values, which can be called directly from a user program. On the other hand, it is possible to generate a Fortran code for function and gradient evaluation that can be compiled and linked separately.",

We report on the design and development of parallel frontal solvers for the numerical solution of large sparse linear systems. Three codes have been developed for the mathematical software library HSL (www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/Activity/HSL). The first is for unsymmetric finite-element problems; the second is for symmetric positive definite finite-element problems; and the third is for highly unsymmetric linear systems such as those that arise in chemical process engineering. In each case, the problem is subdivided into a small number of loosely connected subproblems and a frontal method is then applied to each of the subproblems in parallel. We discuss how our software is designed to achieve the goals of portability, ease of use, efficiency, and flexibility, and illustrate the performance using problems arising from real applications.",

    "abstract": "The routine converts any standard regression algorithm (that calculates both the coefficients and residuals) into a corresponding orthogonal regression algorithm. Thus, a standard, or robust, or L 1 regression algorithm is converted into the corresponding standard, or robust, or L 1 orthogonal algorithm. Such orthogonal procedures are important for three basic reasons. First, they solve the classical errors-in-variables (EV) regression problem. Standard L 2 orthogonal regression, obtained by converting ordinary least squares regression, is the maximum likelihood solution of the EV problem under Gaussian assumptions. However, this L 2 solution is known to be unstable under even slight deviations from the model. Thus this routine's ability to create robust orthogonal regression algorithms from robust ordinary regression algorithms will also be very useful in practice. Second, orthogonal regression is intimately related to principal components procedures. Therefore, this routine can also be used to create corresponding L 1 , robust, etc., principal components algorithms. And third, orthogonal regression treats the x and y variables symmetrically. This is very important in many science and engineering modeling problems. Monte Carlo studies, which test the effectiveness of the routine under a variety of types of data, are given.",

    "abstract": "Many iterative algorithms for the solution of large linear systems may be effectively vectorized if the diagonal of the matrix is surrounded by a large band of zeroes, whose width is called the zero stretch. In this paper, a multicolor numbering technique is suggested for maximizing the zero stretch of irregularly sparse matrices. The technique, which is a generalization of a known multicoloring algorithm for regularly sparse matrices, executes in linear time, and produces a zero stretch approximately equal to n /2σ, where 2σ is the number of colors used in the algorithm. For triangular meshes, it is shown that σ ≤ 3, and that it is possible to obtain σ = 2 by applying a simple backtracking scheme.",

    "abstract": "Fortran software is developed that calculates a best piecewise monotonic approximation to n univariate data contaminated by random errors. The underlying method minimizes the weighted sum of the squares of the errors by requiring k − 1 sign changes in the first divided differences of the approximation, where k is a given positive integer. Hence, the piecewise linear interpolant to the fit consists of k monotonic sections, alternately increasing and decreasing. This calculation can have about O ( n k ) local minima, because the positions of the turning points of the fit are integer variables of the problem. The method, however, by employing a dynamic programming technique divides the data into at most k disjoint sets of adjacent data and solves a k = 1 problem (monotonic fit or isotonic regression) for each set. So it calculates efficiently a global solution in only O ( n σ + k σ 2 ) computer operations when k ≥ 3, where σ is the number of local minima of the data, always bounded by n /2. This complexity reduces to only O ( n ) when k = 1 or k = 2 (unimodal case). At the end of the calculation a spline representation of the solution and the corresponding Lagrange multipliers are provided. The software package has been tested on a variety of data sets showing a performance that does provide in practice shorter computation times than the complexity indicates in theory. An application of the method on identifying turning points and monotonic trends of data from 1947--1996 on the U.K. pound over the U.S. dollar exchange rate is presented. Generally, the method may have useful applications as, for example, in estimating the turning points of a function from some noisy measurements of its values, or in image and signal processing, or in providing a preliminary or complementary smoothing phase to further analyses of the data.",

    "abstract": "Highly accurate long-term numerical integration of nearly oscillatory systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a common problem in astrodynamics. Scheifele’s algorithm is one of the excellent integrators developed in the past years to take advantage of special transformations of variables such as the K-S set. It is based on using expansions in series of the so-called G -functions, and generalizes the Taylor series integrators but with the remarkable property of integrating without truncation error oscillations in one basic known frequency. A generalization of Scheifele’s method capable of integrating exactly harmonic oscillations in two known frequencies is developed here, after introducing a two parametric family of analytical φ -functions. Moreover, the local error contains the perturbation parameter as a factor when the algorithm is applied to perturbed problems. The good behavior and the long-term accuracy of the new method are shown through several examples, including systems with low- and high-frequency constituents and a perturbed satellite orbit. The new methods provide significantly higher accuracy and efficiency than a selection of well-reputed general-purpose integrators and even recent symplectic or symmetric integrators, whose good behavior in the long-term integration of the Kepler problem and the other oscillatory systems is well stated in recent literature.",

    "abstract": "The present algorithm provides a module for calculating the cylindrical functions Jv ( z ), Yv ( z ), Hv (1)( z ), and Hv (2)( z ), where the order v is complex and the complex argument z satisfies − π &lt; arg z ≤ π . The algorithm is written in Fortran 90 and calculates the functions using real and complex numbers of any intrinsic data type whose kind type parameter the user’s Fortran system accepts. The methods of calculating the functions are based on two kinds of series expansions and numerical integration. Wronskian tests examine the functional values computed by this algorithm with double precision at 4,100,625 pseudorandom test points in the region |Re v | ≤ 60, |Im v | ≤ 60, |Re z | ≤ 300, |Im z | ≤ 300. From the results of the tests, we find that the errors of two kinds of Wronskians are less than 6.42 × 10−14.",

The algorithm is well suited for use in modern vectorized programming languages such as FORTRAN 95 and MATLAB. The algorithm discretizes the cost functional and the differential-algebraic equations in each phase of the optimal control problem. The phases are then connected using linkage conditions on the state and time. A large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP) arises from the discretization and the significant features of the NLP are described in detail. A particular reusable MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called GPOPS , is applied to three classical optimal control problems to demonstrate its utility. The algorithm described in this article will provide researchers and engineers a useful software tool and a reference when it is desired to implement the Gauss pseudospectral method in other programming languages.",

    "abstract": "In LAPACK many matrix operations are cast as block algorithms which iteratively process a panel using an unblocked algorithm and then update a remainder matrix using the high performance Level 3 BLAS. The Level 3 BLAS have excellent scaling, but panel processing tends to be bus bound, and thus scales with bus speed rather than the number of processors ( p ). Amdahl's law therefore ensures that as p grows, the panel computation will become the dominant cost of these LAPACK routines. Our contribution is a novel parallel cache assignment approach to the panel factorization which we show scales well with p . We apply this general approach to the QR, QL, RQ, LQ and LU panel factorizations. We show results for two commodity platforms: an 8-core Intel platform and a 32-core AMD platform. For both platforms and all twenty implementations (five factorizations each of which is available in 4 types), we present results that demonstrate that our approach yields significant speedup over the existing state of the art.",

We analyze this phenomenon and show that in the ∞-norm it happens precisely when x has components of widely varying magnitude and every component of x of largest magnitude agrees with the corresponding component of y . Performance profiles are a popular way to compare competing algorithms according to particular measures of performance. We show that performance profiles based on normwise relative errors can give a misleading impression due to the influence of zero or tiny normwise relative errors. We propose a transformation that reduces the influence of these extreme errors in a controlled manner, while preserving the monotonicity of the underlying data and leaving the performance profile unchanged at its left end-point. Numerical examples with both artificial and genuine data illustrate the benefits of the transformation.",

    "abstract": "The QR algorithm is the method of choice for computing all eigenvalues of a dense nonsymmetric matrix A . After an initial reduction to Hessenberg form, a QR iteration can be viewed as chasing a small bulge from the top left to the bottom right corner along the subdiagonal of A . To increase data locality and create potential for parallelism, modern variants of the QR algorithm perform several iterations simultaneously, which amounts to chasing a chain of several bulges instead of a single bulge. To make effective use of level 3 BLAS, it is important to pack these bulges as tightly as possible within the chain. In this work, we show that the tightness of the packing in existing approaches is not optimal and can be increased. This directly translates into a reduced chain length by 33% compared to the state-of-the-art LAPACK implementation of the QR algorithm. To demonstrate the impact of our idea, we have modified the LAPACK implementation to make use of the optimal packing. Numerical experiments reveal a uniform reduction of the execution time, without affecting stability or robustness.",

Strobach and S. L. Shmakov. It is based on the decomposition of the quartic polynomial into two quadratics, whose coefficients are first accurately estimated by handling carefully numerical errors and afterward refined through the use of the Newton-Raphson method. Our algorithm is very accurate in comparison with other state-of-the-art solvers that can be found in the literature, but (most importantly) it turns out to be very efficient according to our timing tests. A crucial issue for us is the robustness of the algorithm, i.e., its ability to cope with the detrimental effect of round-off errors, no matter what set of quartic coefficients is provided in a practical application. In this respect, we extensively tested our algorithm in comparison to other quartic equation solvers both by considering specific extreme cases and by carrying out a statistical analysis over a very large set of quartics. Our algorithm has also been heavily tested in a physical application, i.e., simulations of hard cylinders, where it proved its absolute reliability as well as its efficiency.",

Stochastic Arithmetic is one way to model and estimate FP losses of accuracy, which scales well to large, industrial codes. It exists in different flavors, such as CESTAC or MCA, implemented in various tools such as CADNA, Verificarlo or Verrou. These methodologies and tools are based on the idea that FP losses of accuracy can be modeled via randomness. Therefore, they share the same need to perform a statistical analysis of programs results in order to estimate the significance of the results. In this paper, we propose a framework to perform a solid statistical analysis of Stochastic Arithmetic. This framework unifies all existing definitions of the number of significant digits (CESTAC and MCA), and also proposes a new quantity of interest: the number of digits contributing to the accuracy of the results. Sound confidence intervals are provided for all estimators, both in the case of normally distributed results, and in the general case. The use of this framework is demonstrated by two case studies of large, industrial codes: Europlexus and code_aster.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy regression provides an alternative to statistical regression when the model is indefinite, the relationships between model parameters are vague, the sample size is low, or the data are hierarchically structured. Such cases allow to consider the choice of a regression model based on the fuzzy set theory. In fuzzyreg, we implement fuzzy linear regression methods that differ in the expectations of observational data types, outlier handling, and parameter estimation method. We provide a wrapper function that prepares data for fitting fuzzy linear models with the respective methods from a syntax established in R for fitting regression models. The function fuzzylm thus provides a novel functionality for R through standardized operations with fuzzy numbers. Additional functions allow for conversion of real-value variables to be fuzzy numbers, printing, summarizing, model plotting, and calculation of model predictions from new data using supporting functions that perform arithmetic operations with triangular fuzzy numbers. Goodness of fit and total error of the fit measures allow model comparisons. The package contains a dataset named bats with measurements of temperatures of hibernating bats and the mean annual surface temperature reflecting the climate at the sampling sites. The predictions from fuzzy linear models fitted to this dataset correspond well to the observed biological phenomenon. Fuzzy linear regression has great potential in predictive modeling where the data structure prevents statistical analysis and the modeled process exhibits inherent fuzziness.",

    "abstract": "Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines For Embedded Optimization (BLASFEO) is a dense linear algebra library providing high-performance implementations of BLAS- and LAPACK-like routines for use in embedded optimization and other applications targeting relatively small matrices. BLASFEO defines an application programming interface (API) which uses a packed matrix format as its native format. This format is analogous to the internal memory buffers of optimized BLAS, but it is exposed to the user and it removes the packing cost from the routine call. For matrices fitting in cache, BLASFEO outperforms optimized BLAS implementations, both open source and proprietary. This article investigates the addition of a standard BLAS API to the BLASFEO framework, and proposes an implementation switching between two or more algorithms optimized for different matrix sizes. Thanks to the modular assembly framework in BLASFEO, tailored linear algebra kernels with mixed column- and panel-major arguments are easily developed. This BLAS API has lower performance than the BLASFEO API, but it nonetheless outperforms optimized BLAS and especially LAPACK libraries for matrices fitting in cache. Therefore, it can boost a wide range of applications, where standard BLAS and LAPACK libraries are employed and the matrix size is moderate. In particular, this article investigates the benefits in scientific programming languages such as Octave, SciPy, and Julia.",

The consequence is that the algorithms presented in [ 16 ] can be used with high confidence, and that some of them are even more accurate than what was believed before. This illustrates what formal proof can bring to computer arithmetic: beyond mere (yet extremely useful) verification, correction, and consolidation of already known results, it can help to find new properties.

A key characteristic of this approach is that rounding errors occur both when representing the coefficients of the polynomial on a finite number of bits, and when evaluating it in finite precision arithmetic. Hence, to find a best polynomial, for a given fixed degree, norm and interval, it is necessary to account for both the approximation error and the floating-point evaluation error. While efficient algorithms were already developed for taking into account the approximation error, the evaluation part is usually a posteriori handled, in an ad-hoc manner. Here, we formulate a semi-infinite linear optimization problem whose solution is a best polynomial with respect to the supremum norm of the sum of both errors. This problem is then solved with an iterative exchange algorithm, which can be seen as an extension of the well-known Remez exchange algorithm. An open-source C implementation using the Sollya library is presented and tested on several examples, which are then analyzed and compared against state-of-the-art Sollya routines.",

Currently, the standard is the algorithm of Hockney and Eastwood (1988), with second order in convergence at best. The algorithm proposed by Vico et al. converges spectrally for sufficiently smooth functions i.e. faster than any fixed order in the number of grid points. We implement a performance portable version of the traditional Hockney-Eastwood and the novel Vico-Greengard Poisson solver as part of the IPPL (Independent Parallel Particle Layer) library. For sufficiently smooth source functions, the Vico-Greengard algorithm achieves higher accuracy than the Hockney-Eastwood method with the same grid size, reducing the computational demands of high resolution simulations since one could use coarser grids to achieve them. Additionally, we propose an improvement to the Vico-Greengard method which further reduces its memory footprint. This is important for GPUs, which have limited memory, and should be taken into account when selecting numerical algorithms for performance portable codes. Finally, we showcase performance through GPU and CPU scaling studies on the Perlmutter (NERSC) supercomputer, with efficiencies staying above \\(50\\%\\) in the strong scaling case.

    "abstract": "In this work, restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) and optimized restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) preconditioners from the Trilinos package FROSch (Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz) are employed to solve model problems implemented using deal.II (differential equations analysis library). Therefore, a Tpetra -based interface for coupling deal.II and FROSch is implemented. While RAS preconditioners have been available before, ORAS preconditioners have been newly added to FROSch . The deal.II – FROSch interface works for both Lagrange-based and Nédélec finite elements. Here, as model problems, nonstationary, nonlinear, variational-monolithic fluid-structure interaction and the indefinite time-harmonic Maxwell's equations are considered. Several numerical experiments in two and three spatial dimensions confirm the performance of the preconditioners as well as the FROSch - deal.II interface. In conclusion, the overall software interface is straightforward and easy to use while giving satisfactory solver performances for challenging PDE systems.",

The method needs to be improved, because the expressions obtained using it sometimes contain discontinuities, which unnecessarily limit the domains over which the expressions are correct. We show that the discontinuities are spurious in the following sense: Given an integrand and an expression for its antiderivative that was obtained by the Weierstrass substition, a better expression can be found that is continuous on wider intervals than the first expression and yet is still an antiderivative of the integrand. The origin of the discontinuities is identified, and an algorithm is presented for automatically finding the improved type of antiderivative. The new algorithm also enlarges the set of functions that can be used in the substitution. The algorithm works by first evaluating the given integral using the Weierstrass substitution in the usual way and then removing any spurious discontinuities present in the antiderivative.",

Problems of this type arise, for example, in nonlinear optimization.

The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian matrix are the square roots of those of the Hessenberg matrix.

Blocking techniques are used to express the BLAS in terms of operations involving triangular blocks and calls to GEMM. A principal advantage of this approach is that most manufacturers provide at least an efficient serial version of GEMM so that our implementation can capture a significant percentage of the computer performance. A parameter which controls the blocking allows an efficient exploitation of the memory hierarchy of the various target computers. Furthermore, this blocked version of Level-3 BLAS is naturally parallel. We present results on the ALLIANT FX/80, the CONVEX C220, the CRAY-2, and the IBM 3090/VF. For GEMM, we always use the manufacturer-supplied versions. For the operations dealing with triangular blocks, we use assembler or tuned Fortran (using loop-unrolling) codes, depending on the efficiency of the available libraries.",

For very large systems when using direct factorization methods of solution, it can be beneficial and sometimes necessary to use multiple processors, because of increased memory availability as well as reduced factorization time. We report on the development of a new parallel code that is designed to solve linear systems with a highly unsymmetric sparsity structure using a modest number of processors (typically up to about 16). The problem is first subdivided into a number of loosely connected subproblems and a variant of sparse Gaussian elimination is then applied to each of the subproblems in parallel. An interface problem in the variables on the boundaries of the subproblems must also be factorized. We discuss how our software is designed to achieve the goals of portability, ease of use, efficiency, and flexibility, and illustrate its performance on an SGI Origin 2000, a Cray T3E, and a 2-processor Compaq DS20, using problems arising from real applications.",

It is based on a heuristic for imposing a block tridiagonal structure on matrices with a large percentage of zero or \"effectively zero\" (with respect to the given accuracy tolerance) elements. In the light of a recently developed block tridiagonal divide-and-conquer eigensolver [Gansterer, Ward, Muller, and Goddard, III, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 25 (2003), pp. 65--85], for which block tridiagonalization may be needed as a preprocessing step, the algorithm also provides an option for attempting to produce at least a few very small diagonal blocks in the block tridiagonal matrix. This leads to low time complexity of the last merging operation in the block divide-and-conquer method. Numerical experiments are presented and various block tridiagonalization strategies are compared.",

In our present work, we further hone this theory by rephrasing most of the internal operations as linear transformations over finite-dimensional Banach spaces. This additional insight has led to increased code granularity and allowed the use of level 3 BLAS operations. This is both a conceptual and a practical development; as the run-time performance of FIAT has been improved multiple orders of magnitude.",

For the sake of portability, simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency, the FGMRES solvers have been implemented in Fortran 77 using the reverse communication mechanism for the matrix-vector product, the preconditioning, and the dot-product computations. For distributed-memory computation, several orthogonalization procedures have been implemented to reduce the cost of the dot-product calculation, which is a well-known bottleneck of efficiency for Krylov methods. Furthermore, either implicit or explicit calculation of the residual at restart is possible depending on the actual cost of the matrix-vector product. Finally, the implemented stopping criterion is based on a normwise backward error.",

Our baseline sequential algorithm is based on UMFPACK 4, but is somewhat simpler and is often somewhat faster than UMFPACK version 4.0. Our parallel algorithm is designed for shared-memory machines with a small or moderate number of processors (we tested it on up to 32 processors). We experimentally compare our algorithm with SuperLU_MT, an existing shared-memory sparse LU factorization with partial pivoting. SuperLU_MT scales better than our new algorithm, but our algorithm is more reliable and is usually faster. More specifically, on matrices that are costly to factor, our algorithm is usually faster on up to 4 processors, and is usually faster on 8 and 16. We were not able to run SuperLU_MT on 32. The main contribution of this article is showing that the column-preordering partial-pivoting unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal approach, developed as a sequential algorithm by Davis in several recent versions of UMFPACK, can be effectively parallelized.",

    "abstract": "At the heart of a frontal or multifrontal solver for the solution of sparse symmetric sets of linear equations, there is the need to partially factorize dense matrices (the frontal matrices) and to be able to use their factorizations in subsequent forward and backward substitutions. For a large problem, packing (holding only the lower or upper triangular part) is important to save memory. It has long been recognized that blocking is the key to efficiency and this has become particularly relevant on modern hardware. For stability in the indefinite case, the use of interchanges and 2 × 2 pivots as well as 1 × 1 pivots is equally well established. In this article, the challenge of using these three ideas (packing, blocking, and pivoting) together is addressed to achieve stable factorizations of large real-world symmetric indefinite problems with good execution speed. The ideas are not restricted to frontal and multifrontal solvers and are applicable whenever partial or complete factorizations of dense symmetric indefinite matrices are needed.",

    "abstract": "Preconditioned iterative solvers have the potential to solve very large sparse linear systems with a fraction of the memory used by direct methods. However, the effectiveness and performance of most preconditioners is not only problem dependent, but also fairly sensitive to the choice of their tunable parameters. As a result, a typical practitioner is faced with an overwhelming number of choices of solvers, preconditioners, and their parameters. The diversity of preconditioners makes it difficult to analyze them in a unified theoretical model. A systematic empirical evaluation of existing preconditioned iterative solvers can help in identifying the relative advantages of various implementations. We present the results of a comprehensive experimental study of the most popular preconditioner and iterative solver combinations for symmetric positive-definite systems. We introduce a methodology for a rigorous comparative evaluation of various preconditioners, including the use of some simple but powerful metrics. The detailed comparison of various preconditioner implementations and a state-of-the-art direct solver gives interesting insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses. We believe that these results would be useful to researchers developing preconditioners and iterative solvers as well as practitioners looking for appropriate sparse solvers for their applications.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a validated numeric method for the solution of linear ordinary differential equations (LODEs). A wide range of algorithms (i.e., Runge-Kutta, collocation, spectral methods) exist for numerically computing approximations of the solutions. Most of these come with proofs of asymptotic convergence, but usually, provided error bounds are nonconstructive. However, in some domains like critical systems and computer-aided mathematical proofs, one needs validated effective error bounds. We focus on both the theoretical and practical complexity analysis of a so-called a posteriori quasi-Newton validation method, which mainly relies on a fixed-point argument of a contracting map. Specifically, given a polynomial approximation, obtained by some numerical algorithm and expressed on a Chebyshev basis, our algorithm efficiently computes an accurate and rigorous error bound. For this, we study theoretical properties like compactness, convergence, and invertibility of associated linear integral operators and their truncations in a suitable coefficient space of Chebyshev series. Then, we analyze the almost-banded matrix structure of these operators, which allows for very efficient numerical algorithms for both numerical solutions of LODEs and rigorous computation of the approximation error. Finally, several representative examples show the advantages of our algorithms as well as their theoretical and practical limits.",

    "abstract": "The software package BBCPOP is a MATLAB implementation of a hierarchy of sparse doubly nonnegative relaxations of a class of polynomial optimization (minimization) problems (POPs) with binary, box, and complementarity (BBC) constraints. Given a POP in the class and a relaxation order, BBCPOP constructs a simple conic optimization problem (COP), which serves as a doubly nonnegative relaxation of the POP, and then solves the COP by applying the bisection and projection method. The COP is expressed with a linear objective function and constraints described as a single hyperplane and two cones, which are the Cartesian product of positive semidefinite cones and a polyhedral cone induced from the BBC constraints. BBCPOP aims to compute a tight lower bound for the optimal value of a large-scale POP in the class that is beyond the comfort zone of existing software packages. The robustness, reliability, and efficiency of BBCPOP are demonstrated in comparison to the state-of-the-art software SDP package SDPNAL+ on randomly generated sparse POPs of degree 2 and 3 with up to a few thousands variables, and ones of degree from 5 to 8 with up to a few hundred variables. Numerical results on BBC-constrained POPs that arise from quadratic assignment problems are also reported. The software package BBCPOP is available at https://sites.google.com/site/bbcpop1/.",

We show that their Kummer line is the x -line of a Montgomery curve translated by a point of order two, and exhibit a natural isomorphism to the y -line of a twisted Edwards curve. Moreover, we show that the Kummer line presented by Gaudry and Lubicz can be obtained via the action of a point of order two on the y -line of an Edwards curve. The maps connecting these curves and lines are all very simple. As a result, a cryptographic implementation can use the arithmetic that is optimal for its instruction set at negligible cost.",

Formulating such a problem relies on FEniCS domain-specific language and the representation of convex functions, in particular, non-smooth ones, in the conic programming framework. The discrete formulation of the corresponding optimization problems hinges on the finite element discretization capabilities offered by FEniCS, while their numerical resolution is carried out by the interior-point solver Mosek. Through various illustrative examples, we show that convex optimization problems can be formulated using only a few lines of code, discretized in a very simple manner, and solved extremely efficiently.",

Many different algorithms exist for each part and the possible combinations offer a plethora of possibilities for improvements of solution procedures that are far from fully understood. As a consequence there are still many unanswered questions in the mesh-free community resulting in vivid ongoing research in the field. Medusa implements the core mesh-free elements as independent blocks, which offers users great flexibility in experimenting with the method they are developing, as well as easily comparing it with other existing methods. The article describes the chosen abstractions and their usage, illustrates aspects of the philosophy and design, offers some executions time benchmarks and demonstrates the application of the library on cases from linear elasticity and fluid flow in irregular 2D and 3D domains.",

Their stable numerical computation, when the full solution is sought, is considered solved since the seminal work of Bartels and Stewart [1972] and its generalization by Penzl [1997]. Those variants do not go completely beyond BLAS level-2 style implementation. On modern computers, however, the formulation of level-3 BLAS type implementations is crucial to enable optimal usage of cache hierarchies and modern block scheduling methods based on directed acyclic graphs describing the interdependence of single block computations. Although there exists a recursive blocked solution scheme for (quasi-) triangular generalized Lyapunov equations [Jonsson and Kågström 2002b], we focus on standard blocking techniques. Using the standard blocking approach our contribution lifts the aforementioned level-2 algorithm by Penzl to BLAS level-3 for (quasi-) triangular equations. Especially, we consider the solution of the appearing Sylvester equations and provide a hybrid algorithm merging our strategy with the recursive blocking method above.",

We also optimized other tests and achieved an overall speedup of 50.6 × compared with the reference implementation. This means that 20MB of data can be tested within a minute using our new optimized version of the NIST STS. To speed up the Linear Complexity test, we proposed a new version of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm that computes only the linear complexity of a sequence.

To remove these limitations, we have generalized the RBT to arbitrary matrix sizes by truncating the dimensions of each layer in the transform. We expanded Parker’s theoretical analysis to generalized RBT, specifically that in exact arithmetic, Gaussian elimination with no pivoting will succeed with probability 1 after transforming a matrix with full-depth RBTs. Furthermore, we experimentally show that these generalized transforms improve performance over Parker’s formulation by up to 62 % while retaining the ability to replace pivoting.

The objective function (Euclidean length of the functions) is allowed to increase at intermediate steps. These increases are allowed as long as our predictor indicates that a new set of best values exists in the trust-region. There is logic provided to retreat to the current best values, should that be required. The computations for the model-problem require a constrained nonlinear least-squares solver. This is done using a simpler version of the algorithm. In its present form the algorithm is effective for problems with linear constraints and dense Jacobian matrices. Results on standard test problems are presented in the Appendix. The new algorithm appears to be efficient in terms of function and Jacobian evaluations.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a precision- and range-independent tool for testing the compliance of hardware or software implementations of (multiprecision) floating-point arithmetic with the principles of the IEEE standards 754 and 854. The tool consists of a driver program, offering many options to test only specific aspects of the IEEE standards, and a large set of test vectors, encoded in a precision-independent syntax to allow the testing of basic and extended hardware formats as well as multiprecision floating-point implementations. The suite of test vectors stems on one hand from the integration and fully precision- and range-independent generalization of existing hardware test sets, and on the other hand from the systematic testing of exact rounding for all combinations of round and sticky bits that can occur. The former constitutes only 50% of the resulting test set. In the latter we especially focus on hard-to-round cases. In addition, the test suite implicitly tests properties of floating-point operations, following the idea of Paranoia, and it reports which of the three IEEE-compliant underflow mechanisms is used by the floating-point implementation under consideration. We also chech whether that underflow mechanism is used consistently. The tool is backward compatible with the UCBTEST package and with Coonen's test syntax.",

In this paper, we study a threshold version of the strategy for sparse symmetric matrix decomposition. The use of this scheme is explored in the multifrontal method of Duff and Reid for sparse indefinite systems. Experimental results show that it is at least as effective as the existing pivoting strategy used in the current multifrontal implementation.",

Computer scientists speak of partial differential equations (PDEs) as canonical coupled systems, typically in divergence form. Physicists, chemists, and engineers start with the same description, but then add real-world things like “Rankine-Hugoniot” conditions, integro-differential operators, and Eulerian (moving) coordinate systems. This paper describes a generalization of the classical PDE formulation that allows users to formulate virtually any pde problem. The extended formulation has been used successfully on a wide range of nontrivial problems in the physical sciences that cannot even be written down in the classical form.",

Two proposals for reducing these costs are presented here. The first makes use of an alternative transformation for which the combined operation counts of the transformations together with the iterations themselves are lower than for the standard implementation scheme for singly-implicit methods. The second proposal is to use a Runge-Kutta method for which the first row of the coefficient matrix is zero but which still possesses acceptable stability properties. It is hoped that by combining these two proposals increased efficiency in the implementation of Runge-Kutta methods for stiff problems can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Integrals with logarithmic singularities are often difficult to evaluate by numerical methods. In this work, a quadrature method is developed that allows the exact evaluation (up to machine accuracy) of integrals of polynomials with two general types of logarithmic weights. The total work for the determination of N nodes and points of the quadrature method is O( N 2 ). Subsequently, integrals can be evaluated with O( N ) operations and function evaluations, so the quadrature is efficient. This quadrature method can then be used to generate the nonclassical orthogonal polynomials for weight functions containing logarithms and obtain Gauss and Gauss-related quadratures for these weights. Two algorithms for each of the two types of logarithmic weights that incorporate these methods are given in this paper.",

Some of these solvers were written primarily as research codes while others have been developed for commercial use. Our experiences of using the different packages to solve a wide range of problems arising from real applications were mixed. In this paper, we highlight some of these experiences with the aim of providing advice to both software developers and users of sparse direct solvers. We discuss key features that a direct solver should offer and conclude that while performance is an essential factor to consider when choosing a code, there are other features that a user should also consider looking for that vary significantly between packages.",

    "abstract": "The source transformation tool for automatic differentiation of Fortran programs ADIFOR uses a preaccumulation technique to speed up tangent-linear codes significantly compared to the standard forward mode. Reverse mode automatic differentiation is applied to all scalar assignments to generate efficient code for the computation of local gradients. It has been well known for some time that reverse mode is not necessarily the optimal choice for the computation of these statement-level gradients as it does not minimize the number of operations required. This article presents an efficient algorithm for the solution of this combinatorial optimization problem. The corresponding software is freely available for downloading on our website. Developers of software for automatic differentiation are invited to integrate the algorithm into their tools. Gradients of scalar multivariate functions can be computed by elimination methods on the linearized computational graph. The combinatorial optimization problem that aims to minimize the number of arithmetic operations performed by the elimination algorithm is known to be NP-complete. In this article we present a polynomial algorithm for solving a relevant subclass of this problem's instances. The proposed method relies on the ability to compute vertex covers in bipartite graphs in polynomial time. A simplified version of this graph algorithm is used in a research prototype of the differentiation-enabled NAGWare Fortran compiler for the preaccumulation of local gradients of scalar assignments in the context of automatic generation of efficient tangent-linear code for numerical programs.",

    "abstract": "Boundary value ordinary differential equations (BVODEs) are systems of ODEs with boundary conditions imposed at two or more distinct points. The global error (GE) of a numerical solution to a BVODE is the amount by which the numerical solution differs from the exact solution. The defect is the amount by which the numerical solution fails to satisfy the ODEs and boundary conditions. Although GE control is often familiar to users, the defect controlled numerical solution can be interpreted as the exact solution to a perturbation of the original BVODE. Software packages based on GE control and on defect control are in wide use. The defect control solver, BVP_SOLVER, can provide an a posteriori estimate of the GE using Richardson extrapolation. In this article, we consider three more strategies for GE estimation based on (i) the direct use of a higher-order discretization formula (HO), (ii) the use of a higher-order discretization formula within a deferred correction (DC) framework, and (iii) the product of an estimate of the maximum defect and an estimate of the BVODE conditioning constant, and demonstrate that the HO and DC approaches have superior performance. We also modify BVP_SOLVER to introduce GE control .",

    "abstract": "Finite element codes typically use data structures that represent unstructured meshes as collections of cells, faces, and edges, each of which require associated coordinate systems. One then needs to store how the coordinate system of each edge relates to that of neighboring cells. On the other hand, we can simplify data structures and algorithms if we can a priori orient coordinate systems in such a way that the coordinate systems on the edges follows uniquely from those on the cells \\textit{by rule}. Such rules require that \\textit{every} unstructured mesh allows assigning directions to edges that satisfy the convention in adjacent cells. We show that the convention chosen for unstructured quadrilateral meshes in the \\texttt{deal.II} library always allows to orient meshes. It can therefore be used to make codes simpler, faster, and less bug prone. We present an algorithm that orients meshes in $O(N)$ operations. We then show that consistent orientations are not always possible for 3d hexahedral meshes. Thus, cells generally need to store the direction of adjacent edges, but our approach also allows the characterization of cases where this is not necessary. The 3d extension of our algorithm either orients edges consistently, or aborts, both within $O(N)$ steps.",

We show how a linearized perturbation analysis for a functional identity allows the determination of a maximum residual consistent with backward stability of the constituent matrix function evaluations. Comparison of this maximum residual with a computed residual provides a necessary test for backward stability. We also show how the actual linearized backward error for these relations can be computed. Our approach makes use of Fréchet derivatives and estimates of their norms.

One popular solution method is based on the backward stable QR factorization of the system matrix A . This article focuses on sparse-dense least squares problems in which A is sparse except from a small number of rows that are considered dense. For large-scale problems, the direct application of a QR solver either fails because of insufficient memory or is unacceptably slow. We study several solution approaches based on using a sparse QR solver without modification, focussing on the case that the sparse part of A is rank deficient. We discuss partial matrix stretching and regularization and propose extending the augmented system formulation with iterative refinement for sparse problems to sparse-dense problems, optionally incorporating multi-precision arithmetic. In summary, our computational study shows that, before applying a black-box QR factorization, a check should be made for rows that are classified as dense and, if such rows are identified, then A should be split into sparse and dense blocks; a number of ways to use a black-box QR factorization to exploit this splitting are possible, with no single method found to be the best in all cases.",

    "abstract": "We describe a general and safe computational framework that provides integer programming results with the degree of certainty that is required for machine-assisted proofs of mathematical theorems. At its core, the framework relies on a rational branch-and-bound certificate produced by an exact integer programming solver, SCIP, in order to circumvent floating-point round-off errors present in most state-of-the-art solvers for mixed-integer programs. The resulting certificates are self-contained and checker software exists that can verify their correctness independently of the integer programming solver used to produce the certificate. This acts as a safeguard against programming errors that may be present in complex solver software. The viability of this approach is tested by applying it to finite cases of Chvátal’s conjecture, a long-standing open question in extremal combinatorics. We take particular care to verify also the correctness of the input for this specific problem, using the Coq formal proof assistant. As a result, we are able to provide the first machine-assisted proof that Chvátal’s conjecture holds for all downsets whose union of sets contains seven elements or less.",

Most recent work has focused on dense systems. We investigate the potential of mixed-precision iterative refinement to enhance methods for sparse systems based on approximate sparse factorizations. In doing so, we first develop a new error analysis for LU- and GMRES-based iterative refinement under a general model of LU factorization that accounts for the approximation methods typically used by modern sparse solvers, such as low-rank approximations or relaxed pivoting strategies. We then provide a detailed performance analysis of both the execution time and memory consumption of different algorithms, based on a selected set of iterative refinement variants and approximate sparse factorizations. Our performance study uses the multifrontal solver MUMPS, which can exploit block low-rank factorization and static pivoting. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms on large, sparse problems coming from a variety of real-life and industrial applications showing that mixed-precision iterative refinement combined with approximate sparse factorization can lead to considerable reductions of both the time and memory consumption.",

    "abstract": "We present ATC, a C++ library for advanced Tucker-based lossy compression of dense multidimensional numerical data in a shared-memory parallel setting, based on the sequentially truncated higher-order singular value decomposition (ST-HOSVD) and bit plane truncation. Several techniques are proposed to improve speed, memory usage, error control and compression rate. First, a hybrid truncation scheme is described which combines Tucker rank truncation and TTHRESH quantization. We derive a novel expression to approximate the error of truncated Tucker decompositions in the case of core and factor perturbations. We parallelize the quantization and encoding scheme and adjust this phase to improve error control. Implementation aspects are described, such as an ST-HOSVD procedure using only a single transposition. We also discuss several usability features of ATC, including the presence of multiple interfaces, extensive data type support, and integrated downsampling of the decompressed data. Numerical results show that ATC maintains state-of-the-art Tucker compression rates while providing average speed-up factors of 2.2 to 3.5 and halving memory usage. Our compressor provides precise error control, deviating only 1.4% from the requested error on average. Finally, ATC often achieves higher compression than non-Tucker-based compressors in the high-error domain.",

In a recent work by Liu et al., we showed the efficiency of a multifrontal solver leveraging the butterfly algorithm and its hierarchical matrix extension, HODBF (hierarchical off-diagonal butterfly) compression to compress large frontal matrices. The resulting multifrontal solver can attain quasi-linear computation and memory complexity when applied to sparse linear systems arising from spatial discretization of high-frequency wave equations. To further reduce the overall number of operations and especially the factorization memory usage to scale to larger problem sizes, in this article we develop a composite multifrontal solver that employs the HODBF format for large-sized fronts, a reduced-memory version of the nonhierarchical block low-rank format for medium-sized fronts, and a lossy compression format for small-sized fronts. This allows us to solve sparse linear systems of dimension up to 2.7 × larger than before and leads to a memory consumption that is reduced by 70% while ensuring the same execution time.

Preliminary experiments have shown that these methods are usually more efficient than the standard singly implicit Runge-Kutta (SIRK) methods and, in many cases, are competitive with backward differentiation formulae (BDF). This article presents an algorithm for determining the full coefficient matrix from the stability function, which is already chosen to make the method A-stable. Because of their unconventional nature, DESI methods have to be implemented in a special way. In particular, the effectiveness of these methods depends heavily on how starting values are chosen for the stage iterations. These and other implementation questions are descussed in detail, and design choices we have made form the basis of an experimental coe for the solution of stiff problems by DESI methods. We present here a small subset of the numerical results obtained with our code. Many of these results are quite satisfactory and suggest that DESI methods have a useful role in the solution of this type of problem.",

The proposed design has a simple, linear topology, requires no clock, and makes only modest demands on the host computer. By overlapping the computation of successive function values, a processing element utilization of approximately 1/2 is achieved. The paper illustrates how “mathematical hardware” packages, as well as software library routines, may be part of the mathematical problem solver's tool kit in the future.",

With implicit Runge--Kutta methods it is often difficult to embed a local error estimate with the appropriate order and stability properties. In this paper local error estimation based on the information from the last two integration steps (that are supposed to have the same steplength) is proposed. It is shown that this technique, applied to Radau IIA methods, lets us get estimators with proper order and stability properties. Numerical examples showing that the proposed estimate improves the efficiency of the integration codes are presented.",

This article discusses two complementary toolkits from the collection of Advanced CompuTational Software (ACTS), namely, Global Arrays (GA) for parallel data management and the Toolkit for Advanced Optimization (TAO), which have been integrated to support large-scale scientific applications of unconstrained and bound constrained minimization problems. Most likely to benefit are minimization problems arising in classical molecular dynamics, free energy simulations, and other applications where the coupling among variables requires dense data structures. TAO uses abstractions for vectors and matrices so that its optimization algorithms can easily interface to distributed data management and linear algebra capabilities implemented in the GA library. The GA/TAO interfaces are available both in the traditional library mode and as components compliant with the Common Component Architecture (CCA).

    "abstract": "Computational complexity theory inspires a grid-free abstraction of the Navier-Stokes equations in Fortran 95/2003. A novel complexity analysis estimates that structured programming time grows at least quadratically with the number of program lines. Further analysis demonstrates how an object-oriented strategy focused on mathematical objects renders the quadratic estimate scale-invariant, so the time required for the limiting factor in program development (debugging) no longer grows as the code grows. Compared to the coordinate-free C++ programming of Grant et al. [2000], grid-free Fortran programming eliminates a layer of procedure calls, eliminates a related need for the C++ template construct, and offers a shorter migration path for Fortran programmers. The grid-free strategy is demonstrated by constructing a physical-space driver for a Fourier-space Navier-Stokes solver. Separating the expression of the continuous mathematical model from the discrete numerics clarifies issues that are otherwise easily conflated. A run-time profile suggests that grid-free design substantially reduces the fraction of the procedures that significantly impact runtime, freeing more code to be structured in ways that reduce development time. Applying Amdahl's law to the total solution time (development time plus run time) leads to a strategy that negligibly impacts development time but achieves 58% of the maximum possible speedup.",

    "abstract": "In this article we discuss a new software package, BACOLR, for the numerical solution of a general class of time-dependent 1-D PDEs. This package employs high-order adaptive methods in time and space within a method-of-lines approach and provides tolerance control of the spatial and temporal errors. The DAEs resulting from the spatial discretization (based on B-spline collocation) are handled by a substantially modified version of the Runge-Kutta solver, RADAU5. For each time step, the RADAU5 code computes an estimate of the temporal error and requires it to satisfy the user tolerance. After each time step BACOLR then computes a high-order estimate of the spatial error and requires this error estimate to satisfy the user tolerance. BACOLR was developed through a substantial modification of the adaptive method-of-lines package, BACOL. In this article we introduce the BACOLR package and present numerical results to show that the performance of BACOLR is comparable to and in some cases significantly superior to that of BACOL, which was shown in previous work to be more efficient, reliable and robust than other existing codes, especially for problems with solutions exhibiting narrow spikes or boundary layers.",

The efficiency of the factorization and solution phases is dependent upon the number of entries in the factors. For a given pivot sequence, the level of fill in the factors beyond that predicted on the basis of the sparsity pattern alone depends on the number of pivots that are delayed (i.e., the number of pivots that are used later than expected because of numerical stability considerations). Our aim is to limit the number of delayed pivots, while maintaining robustness and accuracy. In this article, we consider a new out-of-core multifrontal solver HSL_MA78 from the HSL mathematical software library that is designed to solve the unsymmetric sparse linear systems that arise from finite element applications. We consider how equilibration can be built into the solver without requiring the system matrix to be held in main memory. We also examine the effects of different pivoting strategies, including threshold partial pivoting, threshold rook pivoting, and static pivoting. Numerical experiments on problems arising from a range of practical applications illustrate the importance of scaling and show that, in some cases, rook pivoting can be more efficient than partial pivoting in terms of both the factorization time and the sparsity of the computed factors.",

By developing the algorithms with a common framework and notation, we facilitate the comparing and contrasting of the different algorithms and opportunities for optimization on sequential architectures.

We present our implementation of a local assembly code generator using these techniques. We systematically evaluate the approach, measuring operation count, execution time and numerical error using a benchmark suite of synthetic variational forms, comparing against the FEniCS Form Compiler (FFC). Our benchmark forms span complexities chosen to expose the performance characteristics of different code generation approaches. We show that it is possible with additional computational cost, to consistently achieve much of, and sometimes substantially exceed, the performance of alternative approaches without compromising precision. Although the approach of using symbolic integration and CSE for optimizing local assembly is not new, we distinguish our work through our strategies for maintaining numerical precision and detecting common subexpressions. We discuss the benefits of the symbolic approach for inferring numerical relationships, and analyze the relationship to other proposed techniques which also have greater computational complexity than those of FFC.",

They align with matrix-free geometric multigrid solvers as they never assemble the system matrices, which is cumbersome for dynamically adaptive grids and full multigrid. The most sophisticated realizations use BoxMG to construct operator-dependent prolongation and restriction in combination with Galerkin/Petrov-Galerkin coarse-grid operators. This yields robust solvers for nontrivial elliptic problems. We embed the algebraic, problem-dependent, and grid-dependent multigrid operators as stencils into the grid and evaluate all matrix-vector products in situ throughout the grid traversals. Such an approach is not literally matrix-free as the grid carries the matrix. We propose to switch to a hierarchical representation of all operators. Only differences of algebraic operators to their geometric counterparts are held. These hierarchical differences can be stored and exchanged with small memory footprint. Our realizations support arbitrary dynamically adaptive grids while they vertically integrate the multilevel operations through spacetree linearization. This yields good memory access characteristics, while standard colouring of mesh entities with domain decomposition allows us to use parallel many-core clusters. All realization ingredients are detailed such that they can be used by other codes.",

For experts in matrix computations, the combination of the QR factorization and an SVD computation routine is not new. However, what seems to be new and important for applications is that the resulting procedure is numerically superior to xGESVD and that it is capable of reaching the accuracy of the Jacobi SVD. Further, when combined with pivoted Cholesky factorization, xGESVDQ provides numerically accurate and fast solvers (designated as xPHEVC, xPSEVC) for the Hermitian positive definite eigenvalue problem. For instance, using accurately computed Cholesky factor, xPSEVC computes all eigenvalues of the 200 × 200 Hilbert matrix (whose spectral condition number is greater that 10 300 ) to nearly full machine precision. Furthermore, xGESVDQ can be used for accurate spectral decomposition of general (indefinite) Hermitian matrices.",

Using the obtained normalized B-bases, our library can also generate, (partially) differentiate, modify, and visualize a large family of so-called B-curves and tensor product B-surfaces. Moreover, the library also implements methods that can be used to perform dimension elevation, to subdivide B-curves and B-surfaces by means of de Casteljau-like B-algorithms, and to generate basis transformations for the B-representation of arbitrary integral curves and surfaces that are described in traditional parametric form by means of the ordinary bases of the underlying EC spaces.

The PHIST software architecture and the PHIST development process were designed to overcome shortcomings of existing packages.

We showcase these concepts using the PHIST implementation of a block Jacobi-Davidson solver for non-Hermitian and generalized eigenproblems. We study its performance on a multi-core CPU, a GPU, and a large-scale many-core system. Furthermore, we show how an existing implementation of a block Krylov-Schur method in the Trilinos package Anasazi can benefit from the performance engineering techniques used in PHIST.",

The MGRIT algorithm is a reduction-based iterative method that allows parallel-in-time simulations, i.e., calculating multiple time steps simultaneously in a simulation, using a time-grid hierarchy. The PyMGRIT framework includes many different variants of the MGRIT algorithm, ranging from different multigrid cycle types and relaxation schemes, various coarsening strategies, including time-only and space-time coarsening, and the ability to utilize different time integrators on different levels in the multigrid hierachy. The comprehensive documentation with tutorials and many examples and the fully documented code allow an easy start into the work with the package. The functionality of the code is ensured by automated serial and parallel tests using continuous integration. PyMGRIT supports serial runs suitable for prototyping and testing of new approaches, as well as parallel runs using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). In this manuscript, we describe the implementation of the MGRIT algorithm in PyMGRIT and present the usage from both a user and a developer point of view. Three examples illustrate different aspects of the package itself, especially running tests with pure time parallelism, as well as space-time parallelism through the coupling of PyMGRIT with PETSc or Firedrake.",

Almost all high-level languages and libraries for matrix computations (e.g., Matlab, Eigen) internally use optimized kernels such as those provided by BLAS and LAPACK; however, their translation algorithms are often too simplistic and thus lead to a suboptimal use of said kernels, resulting in significant performance losses. To combine the productivity offered by high-level languages, and the performance of low-level kernels, we are developing Linnea, a code generator for linear algebra problems. As input, Linnea takes a high-level description of a linear algebra problem; as output, it returns an efficient sequence of calls to high-performance kernels. Linnea uses a custom best-first search algorithm to find a first solution in less than a second, and increasingly better solutions when given more time. In 125 test problems, the code generated by Linnea almost always outperforms Matlab, Julia, Eigen, and Armadillo, with speedups up to and exceeding 10×.",

Convergence of the iterative corrections is guaranteed only for sufficiently small prediction steps. In high-dimensional systems, corrector steps are extremely costly to compute and the prediction step length must be adapted carefully to avoid failed steps or unnecessarily slow progress. We describe a parallel method for adapting the step length employing several predictor-corrector sequences of different step lengths computed concurrently. In addition, the algorithm permits intermediate results of correction sequences that have not converged to seed new predictions. This strategy results in an aggressive optimization of the step length at the cost of redundancy in the concurrent computation.

    "abstract": "We present an implementation of the trimmed serendipity finite element family, using the open-source finite element package Firedrake. The new elements can be used seamlessly within the software suite for problems requiring H 1 , H (curl), or H (div)-conforming elements on meshes of squares or cubes. To test how well trimmed serendipity elements perform in comparison to traditional tensor product elements, we perform a sequence of numerical experiments including the primal Poisson, mixed Poisson, and Maxwell cavity eigenvalue problems. Overall, we find that the trimmed serendipity elements converge, as expected, at the same rate as the respective tensor product elements, while being able to offer significant savings in the time or memory required to solve certain problems.",

    "abstract": "We present a robust technique to build a topologically optimal all-hexahedral layer on the boundary of a model with arbitrarily complex ridges and corners. The generated boundary layer mesh strictly respects the geometry of the input surface mesh, and it is optimal in the sense that the hexahedral valences of the boundary edges are as close as possible to their ideal values (local dihedral angle divided by 90°). Starting from a valid watertight surface mesh (all-quad in practice), we build a global optimization integer programming problem to minimize the mismatch between the hexahedral valences of the boundary edges and their ideal values. The formulation of the integer programming problem relies on the duality between boundary hexahedral configurations and triangulations of the disk, which we reframe in terms of integer constraints. The global problem is solved efficiently by performing combinatorial branch-and-bound searches on a series of sub-problems defined in the vicinity of complicated ridges/corners, where the local mesh topology is necessarily irregular because of the inherent constraints in hexahedral meshes. From the integer solution, we build the topology of the all-hexahedral layer, and the mesh geometry is computed by untangling/smoothing. Our approach is fully automated, topologically robust, and fast.",

    "abstract": "Formulas developed originally by Weierstrass have been used since the 1960s by many others for the simultaneous determination of all the roots of a polynomial. Convergence to simple roots is quadratic, but individual approximations to a multiple root converge only linearly. However, it is shown here that the mean of such individual approximations converges quadratically to that root. This result, along with some detail about the behavior of such approximations in the neighborhood of the multiple root, suggests a new approach to the design of polynomial rootfinders. It should also be noted that the technique is well suited to take advantage of a parallel environment. This article first provides the relevant mathematical results: a short derivation of the formulas, convergence proofs, an indication of the behavior near a multiple root, and some error bounds. It then provides the outline of an algorithm based on these results, along with some graphical and numerical results to illustrate the major theoretical points. Finally, a new program based on this algorithm, but with a more efficient way of choosing starting values, is described and then compared with corresponding programs from IMSL and NAG with good results. This program is available from Mathon (combin@cs.utoronto.ca).",

We begin by presenting some methods for parallel pseudorandom number generation. We will focus on methods based on parameterization, meaning that we will not consider splitting methods such as the leap-frog or blocking methods. We describe, in detail, parameterized versions of the following pseudorandom number generators: (1) linear congruential generators, (ii) shift-register generators, and (iii) lagged-Fibonacci generators. We briefly describe the methods, detail some advantages and disadvantages of each method, and recount results from number theory that impact our understanding of their quality of parallel applications. SPRNG was designed around the uniform implementation of different families of parameterized random number generators. We then present a short description of SPRNG. The description contained within this document is meant only to outline the rationale behind and the capabilities of SPRNG. Much more information, including examples and detailed documentation aimed at helping users with putting and using SPRNG on scalable systems is available at http://sprng.cs.fsu.edu. In this description of SPRNG we discuss the random-number generator library as well as the suite of tests of randomness that is an integral part of SPRNG. Random-number tools for parallel Monte Carlo applications must be subjected to classical as well as new types of empirical tests of randomness to eliminate generators that show defects when used in scalable environments.",

The process on which the algorithm is based involves the truncation of an infinite sequence with a corresponding analysis of the truncation error. This error is estimated by means of (asymptotic) formulas, which are not only applicable to the real line, but also extendible to the complex plane. This fact makes the algorithm extendible to the complex plane also. However, the rate of convergence decreases sharply when the complex argument is close to the negative real axis. In order to make the algorithm more efficient, analytic continuation into a strip about the negative real axis is carried out by limited use of power series. The analytic details needed for a portable computational algorithm are presented.",

Extrapolation can be viewed as a variable order Runge-Kutta method. It is plausible that variation of order could lead to a much more efficient Runge-Kutta code, but numerical comparisons have been contradictory. We reconcile previous comparisons by exposing differences in testing methodology and incompatibilities of the implementations tested. An experimental Runge-Kutta code is compared to a state-of-the-art extrapolation code. With some qualifications, the extrapolation code shows no advantage. Extrapolation does not appear to be a particularly effective way to vary the order of Runge-Kutta methods. Although an acceptable way to solve nonstiff problems, our tests raise the question as to whether there is any point in pursuing it as a separate method.",

In contrast, the Computer Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) development kit gives a tool to make use of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We provide a detailed comparison between these novel techniques through the parallelisation of a two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann method based fluid flow solver. Our comparison between the CUDA and UPC parallelisation takes into account the required conceptual effort, the performance gain, and the limitations of the approaches from the application oriented developers’ point of view. We demonstrated that UPC led to competitive efficiency with the local memory implementation. However, the performance of the shared memory code fell behind our expectations, and we concluded that the investigated UPC compilers could not efficiently treat the shared memory space. The CUDA implementation proved to be more complex compared to the UPC approach mainly because of the complicated memory structure of the graphics card which also makes GPUs suitable for the parallelisation of the lattice Boltzmann method.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainties practically arise from numerous factors, such as ambiguous information, inaccurate model, and environment disturbance. Interval arithmetic has emerged to solve problems with uncertain parameters, especially in the computational process where only the upper and lower bounds of parameters can be ascertained. In rectangular coordinate systems, the basic interval operations and improved interval algorithms have been developed in the numerical analysis. However, in polar coordinate systems, interval arithmetic still suffers from issues of complex computation and overestimation. This article defines a polar affine variable and develops a polar affine arithmetic (PAA) that extends affine arithmetic to the polar coordinate systems, which performs better in many aspects than the corresponding polar interval arithmetic (PIA). Basic arithmetic operations are developed based on the complex affine arithmetic. The Chebyshev approximation theory and the min-range approximation theory are used to identify the best affine approximation. PAA can accurately keep track of the interdependency among multiple variables throughout the calculation procedure, which prominently reduces the solution conservativeness. Numerical examples implemented in MATLAB programs show that, compared with benchmark results from the Monte Carlo method, the proposed PAA ensures completeness of the exact solution and presents a more compact solution region than PIA when dependency exists in the calculation process. Meanwhile, a comparison of affine arithmetic in polar and rectangular coordinates is presented. An application of PAA in circuit analysis is quantitatively presented and potential applications in other research fields involving complex variables in polar form will be gradually developed.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a high-performance software framework for computing a dense SVD on distributed-memory manycore systems. Originally introduced by Nakatsukasa et al. (2010) and Nakatsukasa and Higham (2013), the SVD solver relies on the polar decomposition using the QR Dynamically Weighted Halley algorithm (QDWH). Although the QDWH-based SVD algorithm performs a significant amount of extra floating-point operations compared to the traditional SVD with the one-stage bidiagonal reduction, the inherent high level of concurrency associated with Level 3 BLAS compute-bound kernels ultimately compensates for the arithmetic complexity overhead. Using the ScaLAPACK two-dimensional block cyclic data distribution with a rectangular processor topology, the resulting QDWH-SVD further reduces excessive communications during the panel factorization, while increasing the degree of parallelism during the update of the trailing submatrix, as opposed to relying on the default square processor grid. After detailing the algorithmic complexity and the memory footprint of the algorithm, we conduct a thorough performance analysis and study the impact of the grid topology on the performance by looking at the communication and computation profiling trade-offs. We report performance results against state-of-the-art existing QDWH software implementations (e.g., Elemental) and their SVD extensions on large-scale distributed-memory manycore systems based on commodity Intel x86 Haswell processors and Knights Landing (KNL) architecture. The QDWH-SVD framework achieves up to 3/8-fold speedups on the Haswell/KNL-based platforms, respectively, against ScaLAPACK PDGESVD and turns out to be a competitive alternative for well- and ill-conditioned matrices. We finally come up herein with a performance model based on these empirical results. Our QDWH-based polar decomposition and its SVD extension are freely available at https://github.com/ecrc/qdwh.git and https://github.com/ecrc/ksvd.git, respectively, and have been integrated into the Cray Scientific numerical library LibSci v17.11.1.",

    "abstract": "BACOL and BACOLR are (Fortran 77) B-spline adaptive collocation packages for the numerical solution of 1D parabolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The packages have been shown to be superior to other similar packages, especially for problems exhibiting sharp, moving spatial layer regions, where a stringent tolerance is imposed. In addition to providing temporal error control through the timestepping software, BACOL and BACOLR feature control of a high-order estimate of the spatial error of the approximate solution, obtained by computing a second approximate solution of one higher order of accuracy; the cost is substantial—execution time and memory usage are almost doubled. In this article, we discuss BACOLI, a new version of BACOL that computes only one approximate solution and uses efficient interpolation-based schemes to obtain a spatial error estimate. In previous studies these schemes have been shown to provide spatial error estimates of comparable quality to those of BACOL. We describe the substantial modification of BACOL needed to obtain BACOLI, and provide numerical results showing that BACOLI is significantly more efficient than BACOL, in some cases by as much as a factor of 2. We also introduce a Fortran 95 wrapper for BACOLI (called BACOLI95) and discuss its simplified user interface.",

The method minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors, subject to nonnegativity of second divided differences, in two phases. First, an approximation close to the optimum is derived in O(n) operations. Then, this approximation is used as the starting point of a dual-feasible quadratic programming algorithm that completes the calculation of the optimum. The constraints allow B-splines to be used, which reduce the problem to an equivalent one with fewer variables where the knots of the splines are determined automatically from the data points due to the constraint equations. The subroutine benefits from this reduction, since common submatrices that occur during the calculation are updated suitably. Iterative refinement improves the accuracy of some calculations when round-off errors accumulate. The subroutine has been applied to a variety of data having substantial differences and has performed fast and stably even for small data spacing, large n , and single-precision arithmetic. Driver programs and examples with output are provided to demonstrate the use of the subroutine.",

We show that for nonuniform distributions, the rejection method may generate random numbers of bad qualify if combined with a linear congruential generator with small multiplier. A method is described that works for any multiplier smaller than 2 30 . It uses the decomposition of multiplier and seed in high-order and low-order bits to compute the upper and lower half of the product. The sum of the two halfs gives the product of multiplier and seed modulo 2 21 – 1. Coded in ANSI-C and FORTRAN77 the method results in a portable implementation of the linear congruential generator that is as fast or faster than other portable methods.",

The error estimation procedure tries to decide whether the approximation for each function has asymptotic behavior, and different actions are taken depending on that decision. The simplex with the largest error is subdivided into 8 simplices. The local procedure is then applied to each new region. This procedure is repeated until convergence.",

The package is intended for problems where n is not too large—say, n 100—so that the cost of storing one n × n matrix, and factoring it at each iteration, is acceptable. The software allows the user to choose between a recently developed “tensor method” for unconstrained optimization and an analogous standard method based on a quadratic model. The tensor method bases each iteration on a specially constructed fourth-order model of the objective function not significantly more expensive to form, store, or solve than the standard quadratic model. In our experience, the tensor method requires significantly fewer iterations and function evaluations to solve most unconstrained optimization problems than standard methods based on quadratic models, and also solves a somewhat wider range of problems. For these reasons, it may be a useful addition to numerical software libraries.",

The generalized inverse has numerous important applications such as regression analysis, filtering, optimization and, more recently, linear associative memories. In this latter application known as Distributed Associative Memory, stimulus vectors are associated with response vectors and the result of many associations is spread over the entire memory matrix, which is calculated as the generalized inverse. Addition/deletion of new associations requires recalculation of the generalized inverse, which becomes computationally costly for large systems. A better solution is to calculate the generalized inverse recursively. The proposed algorithm is a modification of the well known algorithm due to Rust et al. [2], originally introduced for nonrecursive computation. We compare our algorithm with Greville's recursive algorithm and conclude that our algorithm provides better numerical stability at the expense of little extra computation time and additional storage.",

We also develop a methodology for classifying software pipelining techniques. For loop unrolling, a straightforward scheduling algorithm is shown to produce near-optimal results when not inhibited by recurrences or memory hazards. Our study indicates that the performance produced with a modified CRAY-1S scalar architecture and a code scheduler utilizing loop unrolling is comparable to the performance achieved by the CRAY-1S with a vector unit and the CFT vectorizing compiler. Finally, we show that the combination of loop unrolling and dynamic software pipelining, as implemented by a decoupled computer, substantially outperforms the vector CRAY-1S.",

A Data Definition Language provides the means for building data banks; a Model Definition Language provides the means for defining mathematical models featuring abstract linear programming, advanced array arithmetics, and assertions; a Picture Definition Language facilitates formation of tables and diagrams; a Text Definition Language combines word processing with illustrations of modeling results. The man-machine interface is based on interactive panels for controlling the planning process and on a command language for analyzing modeling results. A multilingual capability allows selection of the national language for interfacing with the system. The architecture of CAMP is presented, and its design, implementation, and use in regional planning are discussed.",

There are minimum limits placed on the seed values of the variables because the period of the generator is not a function of the initial values of the variables. The generator passes thirteen standard random number generator tests. It requires only about fifteen lines of FORTRAN code to program and utilizes programming language constructs found in most major languages. Finally, it compares very favorably to the fastest of the other available generators.",

The code computes the functions U ( a , x ), V ( a , x ) and their derivatives for real a and x ( x ≥ 0). The code also computes scaled functions. The range of computation for scaled PCFs is practically unrestricted. The aimed relative accuracy for scaled functions is better than 5 10 −14 . Exceptions to this accuracy are the evaluation of the functions near their zeros and the error caused by the evaluation of trigonometric functions of large arguments when |a| &gt; x . The routines always give values for which the Wronskian relation for scaled functions is verified with a relative accuracy better than 5 10 −14 . The accuracy of the unscaled functions is also better than 5 10 −14 for moderate values of x and a (except close to the zeros), while for large x and a the error is dominated by exponential and trigonometric function evaluations. For IEEE standard double precision arithmetic, the accuracy is better than 5 10 −13 in the computable range of unscaled PCFs (except close to the zeros).",

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose the Fast Algorithms for Maxwell’s Equations (FAME) package for solving Maxwell’s equations for modeling three-dimensional photonic crystals. FAME combines the null-space free method with fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based matrix-vector multiplications to solve the generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) arising from Yee’s discretization. The GEPs are transformed into a null-space free standard eigenvalue problem with a Hermitian positive-definite coefficient matrix. The computation times for FFT-based matrix-vector multiplications with matrices of dimension 7 million are only 0.33 and 3.6 × 10 − 3 seconds using MATLAB with an Intel Xeon CPU and CUDA C++ programming with a single NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU, respectively. Such multiplications significantly reduce the computational costs of the conjugate gradient method for solving linear systems. We successfully use FAME on a single P100 GPU to solve a set of GEPs with matrices of dimension more than 19 million, in 127 to 191 seconds per problem. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed package to enable large-scale numerical simulations for novel physical discoveries and engineering applications of photonic crystals.",

To illustrate its usefulness, two cases from control theory are analyzed in detail: a solution procedure for a sequence of shifted linear systems with multiple right hand sides (e.g. evaluating the transfer function of a MIMO LTI dynamical system at many points) and computation of the staircase form. The proposed algorithm for the generalized Hessenberg reduction uses two levels of aggregation of Householder reflectors, thus allowing efficient BLAS 3-based computation. Another level of aggregation is introduced when solving many shifted systems by processing the shifts in batches. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed methods have superior efficiency.",

In this article, we provide a rounding error analysis of this method, which unlike previous studies is not restricted to binary floating-point arithmetic but holds for any radix β. We show first that an asymptotically optimal bound on the relative error of this method is 2β u + 2 u 2 /β - 2 u 2 = 2 u + 2/β u 2 + O ( u 3 ), where u = 1/2β 1- p is the unit roundoff in radix β and precision p . Then we show that the possibility of removing the O ( u 2 ) term from this bound is governed by the radix parity and the tie-breaking strategy used for rounding: if β is odd or rounding is to nearest even , then the simpler bound 2 u is obtained, while if β is even and rounding is to nearest away , then there exist floating-point inputs a , b , c , d that lead to a relative error larger than 2 u + 2/β u 2 — 4 u 3 . All these results hold provided underflows and overflows do not occur and under some mild assumptions on p satisfied by IEEE 754-2008 formats.",

This implementation uses the NTL library from Victor Shoup, adding new modules that call NTL functions and complement the existing ones, making it better suited to cryptography. The class representing a vector Boolean function can be initialized by several alternative types of data structures such as Truth Table, Trace Representation, and Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) , among others. The most relevant cryptographic criteria for both block and stream ciphers as well as for hash functions can be evaluated with VBF: it obtains the nonlinearity, linearity distance, algebraic degree, linear structures, and frequency distribution of the absolute values of the Walsh Spectrum or the Autocorrelation Spectrum, among others. In addition, operations such as equality testing, composition, inversion, sum, direct sum, bricklayering (parallel application of vector Boolean functions as employed in Rijndael cipher), and adding coordinate functions of two vector Boolean functions are presented. Finally, three real applications of the library are described: the first one analyzes the KASUMI block cipher, the second one analyzes the Mini-AES cipher, and the third one finds Boolean functions with very high nonlinearity, a key property for robustness against linear attacks.",

This article proposes a new numerical method for the full solution (all eigenvalues and all left and right eigenvectors) that, starting with a suitable linearization, uses an initial, structure-preserving reduction designed to reveal and deflate a certain number of zero and infinite eigenvalues before the final linearization is forwarded to the QZ algorithm. The backward error in the reduction phase is bounded column wise in each coefficient matrix, which is advantageous if the coefficient matrices are graded. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm is capable of computing the eigenpairs with small residuals, and that it is competitive with the available state-of-the-art methods.",

The method takes advantage of two shape-changing norms [Burdakov and Yuan 2002 ; Burdakov et al. 2017 ] to decompose the trust-region subproblem into two separate problems. Using one of the proposed norms, the resulting subproblems have closed-form solutions. Meanwhile, using the other proposed norm, one of the resulting subproblems has a closed-form solution while the other is easily solvable using techniques that exploit the structure of L-SR1 matrices. Numerical results suggest that the SC-SR1 method is able to solve trust-region subproblems to high accuracy even in the so-called “hard case.” When integrated into a trust-region algorithm, extensive numerical experiments suggest that the proposed algorithms perform well, when compared with widely used solvers, such as truncated conjugate-gradients.",

This is particularly true when used with continuous finite elements. Herein, we discuss algorithms that are necessary for a comprehensive and generic implementation of hp -adaptive finite element methods on distributed-memory, parallel machines. In particular, we will present a multistage algorithm for the unique enumeration of degrees of freedom suitable for continuous finite element spaces, describe considerations for weighted load balancing, and discuss the transfer of variable size data between processes. We illustrate the performance of our algorithms with numerical examples and demonstrate that they scale reasonably up to at least 16,384 message passage interface processes.

It is designed to be as easy to use as traditional algorithms for this problem, requiring only that a (scalar) subroutine be provided to evaluate the objective function and its gradient vector of first derivatives. The algorithm is based on a block truncated-Newton method. Truncated-Newton methods obtain the search direction by approximately solving the Newton equations via some iterative method.

The software uses unstructured triangular meshes and adaptive local error control in both space and time. The class of problems solved includes systems of parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic equations; for the latter by use of Riemann-solver-based methods. This article describes the software and shows how the adaptive techniques may be used to increase the reliability of the solution for a Burgers' equations problem, an electrostatics problem from elastohydrodynamic lubrication, and a challenging gas jet problem.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, iterative methods for nonlinear systems use heuristic domain and range stopping criteria to determine when accuracy tolerances have been met. However, such heuristics can cause stopping at points far from actual solutions, and can be unreliable due to the effects of round-off error or inaccuracies in data. In verified computations, rigorous determination of when a set of bounds has met a tolerance can be done analogously to the traditional approximate setting. Nonetheless, the range tolerance possibly cannot be met. If the criteria are used to determine when to stop subdivision of n -dimensional bounds into subregions, then failure of a range tolerance results in excessive, unnecessary subdivision, and could make the algorithm impractical. On the other hand, interval techniques can detect when inaccuracies or round-off will not permit residual bounds to be narrowed. These techniques can be incorporated into range thickness stopping criteria that complement the range stopping criteria. In this note, the issue is first introduced and illustrated with a simple example. The thickness stopping criterion is then formally introduced and analyzed. Third, inclusion of the criterion within a general verified global optimization algorithm is studied. An industrial example is presented. Finally, consequences and implications are discussed.",

The benchmarks are characterized in terms of FLOP count, memory usage, communication pattern, local memory accesses, array allocation mechanism, as well as operation and communication counts per iteration. The benchmarks output performance evaluation metrics in the form of elapsed times, FLOP rates, and communication time breakdowns. We also provide a benchmark guide to aid the choice of subsets of the benchmarks for evaluating particular aspects of an HPF compiler. Furthermore, we report an evaluation of an industry-leading HPF compiler from the Portland Group Inc. using the HPFBench benchmarks on the distributed-memory IBM SP2",

We describe here our Fortran 95 implementation intended as a reference model for the Sparse BLAS. We identify the underlying complex issues of the representation and the handling of sparse matrices and give suggestions to other implementors of how to address them.",

The method guarantees that no overflow will occur unless at least one component of the quotient must overflow, otherwise the normwise error in the computed result is at most a few units in the last place. Moreover, the scaling requires only four floating point multiplications and a small amount of integer arithmetic to compute the scale factor. Thus, on many modern CPUs, our method is both safer and faster than Smith's widely used algorithm.",

In such a case, eigenvalues of the returned matrix can be determined by the bulge-chasing BR iteration or by Rayleigh quotient iteration. BHESS followed by BR iteration determines a complete spectrum in about one-fifth the time required for orthogonal reduction to Hessenberg form followed by QR iterations.

    "abstract": "Large-scale linear systems arise in finite-difference and finite-element discretizations of elliptic problems. With increasing computer performance, ever larger systems are solved using direct methods. How large can such systems be without roundoff compromising accuracy? Here we model roundoff dynamics in standard LU and LDL T decompositions with respect to problem size N . For the one-dimensional (1D) Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on an equidistant grid, we show that the relative error in the factorized matrix grows like O(ε √ N ) if roundoffs are modeled as independent, expectation zero random variables. With bias, the growth rate changes to O(ε N ). Subsequent back substitution results in typical error growths of O(ε N √ N ) and O(ε N 2 ), respectively. Error growth is governed by the dynamics of the computational process and by the structure of the boundary conditions rather than by the condition number. Computational results are demonstrated in several examples, including a few fourth-order 1D problems and second-order 2D problems, showing that error accumulation depends strongly on the solution method. Thus, the same LU solver may exhibit different growth rates for the same 2D Poisson problem, depending on whether the five-point or nine-point FDM operator is used.",

    "abstract": "Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) play an important role in both areas of computer simulation and computer security. Currently, there appears to be a huge divide between the types of PRNGs used in these two areas. For PRNGs in computer security applications, the security concern is extremely important. For PRNGs in computer simulation applications, the properties of high-dimensional equi-distribution, efficiency, long period-length, and portability are important. In recent years, there have been many PRNGs proposed in the area of computer simulation satisfying these nice properties. However, most of them are linear generators, thus sharing the same weakness in predictability. The major aim of this article is to propose a general class of secure generators, called SAFE (secure and fast encryption) generators, by properly “mixing” two baseline generators with the aforementioned properties to obtain a secure generator that would inherit these nice properties. Specifically, we propose applying a general mutual-shuffling method to certain linear generators, such as the currently most popular MT19937 generator and large-order multiple recursive generators, as well as outputting certain nonlinear transformations of the generated variates to construct secure PRNGS.",

Graph coloring is used to avoid collisions between threads for concurrent push and relabel operations. In addition, excess values of target nodes are updated using atomic instructions to prevent race conditions. The experiments show that our algorithm is competitive for wide graphs with low diameters. Results from three different data sets are included, computer vision problems, DIMACS challenge problems, and KaHIP partitioning problems. These are compared with existing push-relabel and pseudoflow implementations. We show that high speedup rates are possible using our coloring based parallelization technique on sparse networks. However, we also observe that the pseudoflow algorithm runs faster than the push-relabel algorithm on dense and long networks.",

This article discusses an algorithm to compute the SVD of a bidiagonal matrix through the eigenpairs of an associated symmetric tridiagonal matrix. The algorithm enables the computation of only a subset of singular values and corresponding vectors, with potential performance gains. The article focuses on a sequential version of the algorithm, and discusses special cases and implementation details. The implementation, called BDSVDX, has been included in the LAPACK library. We use a large set of bidiagonal matrices to assess the accuracy of the implementation, both in single and double precision, as well as to identify potential shortcomings. The results show that BDSVDX can be up to three orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms, which are limited to the computation of a full SVD. We also show comparisons of an implementation that uses BDSVDX as a building block for the computation of the SVD of general matrices.",

    "abstract": "A tight lower bound for required I/O when computing a matrix-matrix multiplication on a processor with two layers of memory is established. Prior work obtained weaker lower bounds by reasoning about the number of phases needed to perform C:=AB, where each phase is a series of operations involving S reads and writes to and from fast memory, and S is the size of fast memory. A lower bound on the number of phases was then determined by obtaining an upper bound on the number of scalar multiplications performed per phase. This paper follows the same high level approach, but improves the lower bound by considering C:=AB+C instead of C:=AB, and obtains the maximum number of scalar fused multiply-adds (FMAs) per phase instead of scalar additions. Key to obtaining the new result is the decoupling of the per-phase I/O from the size of fast memory. The new lower bound is 2mnk/ S - 2S where S is the size of fast memory. The constant for the leading term is an improvement of a factor 4/ 2. A theoretical algorithm that attains the lower bound is given, and how the state-of-the-art Goto's algorithm also in some sense meets the lower bound is discussed.",

The simulation is obtained by computing a weighted sum of cosine and sine waves, with weights that depend on the matrix-valued spectral density associated with the spatial correlation structure of the random field to simulate. The computational cost is proportional to the number of locations targeted for simulation, below that of sequential, matrix decomposition and discrete spectral algorithms. Also, the implementation is versatile, as there is no restriction on the number of vector components, workspace dimension, number and geometrical configuration of the target locations. The computer routines are illustrated with synthetic examples and statistical testing is proposed to check the normality of the distribution of the simulated random field or of its generalized increments. A by-product of this work is a spectral representation of spherical, cubic, penta, Askey, J-Bessel, Cauchy, Laguerre, hypergeometric, iterated exponential, gamma, and stable covariance models in the d -dimensional Euclidean space.",

The proposed scheme assumes a generalized banded form where the coefficient matrix has column overlapped block structure in which the blocks could be dense or sparse. In this article, we implement the more general sparse case. The blocks can be handled independently by any existing sequential or parallel QR factorization library. A smaller reduced system is formed and solved before obtaining the minimum norm solution of the original system in parallel. We experimentally compare and confirm the error bound of the proposed method against the QR factorization based techniques by using true single-precision arithmetic.

In this article, we introduce jMarkov, a framework for MC modeling that provides the user with the ability to define MC models from the basic rules underlying the system dynamics. From these rules, jMarkov automatically obtains the MC parameters and solves the model to determine steady-state and transient performance measures. The jMarkov framework is composed of four modules: (i) the main module supports MC models with a finite state space; (ii) the jQBD module enables the modeling of Quasi-Birth-and-Death processes, a class of MCs with infinite state space; (iii) the jMDP module offers the capabilities to determine optimal decision rules based on Markov Decision Processes; and (iv) the jPhase module supports the manipulation and inclusion of phase-type variables to represent more general behaviors than that of the standard exponential distribution.

    "abstract": "The detection of heterogeneity among objects (products, treatments, medical studies) assessed on a series of blocks (consumers, patients, methods, pathologists) is critical in numerous areas such as clinical research, cosmetic studies, or survey analysis. The Cochran’s Q test is the most widely used test for identifying heterogeneity on binary data (success vs. failure, cure vs. not cure, 1 vs. 0, etc.). For a large number of blocks, the Q distribution can be approximated by a χ 2 distribution. Unfortunately, this does not hold for limited sample sizes or sparse tables. In such situations, one has to either run Monte Carlo simulations or compute the exact Q distribution to obtain an accurate and reliable result. However, the latter method is often disregarded in favor of the former due to computational expense considerations. The purpose of this article is to propose an extremely fast implementation of the exact Cochran’s Q test so one can benefit from its accuracy at virtually no cost regarding computation time. It is implemented as a part of the XLSTAT statistical software (Addinsoft 2015). After a short presentation of the Cochran’s Q test and the motivation for its exact version, we detail our approach and present its actual implementation. We then demonstrate the gain of this algorithm with performance evaluations and measurements. Comparisons against a well-established implementation have shown an increase of the computational velocity by a factor ranging from 100 up to 1× 10 6 in the most favorable cases.",

    "abstract": "We describe the implementation of a parameter estimation method suitable for models commonly used in quantitative finance. The Continuum-Generalized Method of Moments (CGMM) is a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) type of methodology that applies a continuum of moment conditions to achieve the efficiency of a Maximum Likelihood method. Instead of the transition density, the more commonly available conditional characteristic function is used for estimation. We test the CGMM and a simpler version, called the CMM, on simulated time series to check the recovery of the parameters. We also applied CMM to two stochastic covariance models, the Wishart Affine Stochastic Correlation (WASC) model and the Principal Components Stochastic Volatility (PCSV) model. This illustrates the power of CGMM, as stochastic covariance models are generally hard to estimate. The estimation method is fully implemented in MATLAB.",

    "abstract": "One way to combine the powers of symbolic computing with numeric computing is to automaticaly derive and produce numeric code. This approach has important applications in science and engineering. Once the desired formulas and procedures are derived in a symbolic manipulation system, they can be translated into a target numeric language by a code generator . GENCRAY is a code generator written in the C language for portability. GENCRAY defines a LISP-style input language that is translated into either FORTRAN 77 or CRAY FORTRAN. By defining its own input syntax, GENCRAY becomes a free-standing code translator that can be made to work with any symbolic manipulation system. GENCRAY is portable to any computer system with a standard C compiler. Input to GENCRAY can come from a file or directly from a symbolic system through a pipe. On UNIX systems with Berkeley networking, GENCRAY also runs as a network server. The input syntax is customizable to allow both Common and Franz LISP input styles. In addition to generating easily vectorizable CRAY FORTRAN code, GENCRAY also provides high-level, easy-to-use parallel programming macros to produce parallel code for the multiprocessor CRAY systems. The features, applications, usage, and implementation of GENCRAY are described. Techniques for producing parallel codes are discussed and illustrated by a substantial example contained in the Appendix.",

The performance of this algorithm is compared to that of the Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm and a Simulated Annealing algorithm on a variety of nonlinear functions. In addition, one-, two-, four-, and eight-processor versions of the algorithm are compared using 64 of the nonlinear problems with constraints collected by Hock and Schittkowski. In general, the algorithm is more robust than the Simplex algorithm, but computationally more expensive. The algorithm appears to be as robust as the Simulated Annealing algorithm, but computationally cheaper. Issues discussed include algorithm speed and robustness, applicability to both computer and mathematical models, and parallel efficiency.",

Only a small number of predefined exceptions need to be introduced into the language, but any number of user-defined exceptions can he introduced by the programmer. A key feature is that handlers are attached to operators that can raise exceptions (including user-defined functions and procedures, as well as built-in operators), rather than to expressions or statements. The programmer has a great deal of freedom in specifying what action is to be taken in case an exception arises. The implementation and the applications are mainly concerned with scientific computing, but we believe the facilities are applicable in other areas as well.",

One possibility is the bootstrap approach, which improves the accuracy of the approximate solution at the off-mesh points in a sequence of steps until the accuracy at the mesh points and off-mesh points is consistent. A bootstrap approach for systems of mixed-order BVODEs is developed to improve approximate solutions produced by COLNEW, a Gauss-collocation-based software package. An implementation of this approach is discussed and numerical results presented which confirm that the improved approximations satisfy the predicted error bounds and are relatively inexpensive to construct.",

    "abstract": "The IEEE 754 and 854 standards for floating-point arithmetic are essentially a specification of a programming environment, encompassing aspects from computer hardware, operating systems, and compilers to programming languages (see especially Section 8). Parts I and II of this paper together describe a tool to test floating-point implementations of arbitrary precision and exponent range (hardware as well as software) for compliance with the principles outlined in the IEEE standards. The tool consists of a driver program, together with a very large set of test vectors encoded in a precision-independent syntax. In Part I we have convered the testing of the basic operaitons +, −, ×, / and of the square root and remainder functions. In Part II we describe the extension of the test tool to deal with conversions between floating-point formats, conversions between floating-point and integer formats, the rounding of floating-point numbers to integral values, and binary-decimal conversions. Conversions can now be tested from a floating-point format of arbitrary precision and exponent range to another arbitrary smaller (larger) floating-point format as well as to and from fixed hardware integer formats. Conversion between the bases 2 and 10 can be tested for a number of precisions ranging from sing (24 bits), double (53 bits), long double or extended (64 bits) to quadruple (113 bits) precisioon and a proper multiprecision (240 bits) format. We conclude Part II with some applications of our test tool and report on the results of testing various floating-point implementations, meaning various language-compiler-hardware combinations as well as multiprecision libraries.",

    "abstract": "We present the BEDFix (Bisection Envelope Deep-cut Fixed point) algorithm for the problem of approximating a fixed point of a function of two variables. The function must be Lipschitz continuous with constant 1 with respect to the infinity norm; such functions are commonly found in economics and game theory. The computed approximation satisfies a residual criterion given a specified error tolerance. The BEDFix algorithm improves the BEFix algorithm presented in Shellman and Sikorski [2002] by utilizing \"deep cuts,\" that is, eliminating additional segments of the feasible domain which cannot contain a fixed point. The upper bound on the number of required function evaluations is the same for BEDFix and BEFix, but our numerical tests indicate that BEDFix significantly improves the average-case performance. In addition, we show how BEDFix may be used to solve the absolute criterion fixed point problem with significantly better performance than the simple iteration method, when the Lipschitz constant is less than but close to 1. BEDFix is highly efficient when used to compute residual solutions for bivariate functions, having a bound on function evaluations that is twice the logarithm of the reciprocal of the tolerance. In the tests described in this article, the number of evaluations performed by the method averaged 31 percent of this worst-case bound. BEDFix works for nonsmooth continuous functions, unlike methods that require gradient information; also, it handles functions with minimum Lipschitz constants equal to 1, whereas the complexity of simple iteration approaches infinity as the minimum Lipschitz constant approaches 1. When BEDFix is used to compute absolute criterion solutions, the worst-case complexity depends on the logarithm of the reciprocal of 1-q, where q is the Lipschitz constant, as well as on the logarithm of the reciprocal of the tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Sparse tiling is a technique to fuse loops that access common data, thus increasing data locality. Unlike traditional loop fusion or blocking, the loops may have different iteration spaces and access shared datasets through indirect memory accesses, such as A[map[i]]—hence the name “sparse.” One notable example of such loops arises in discontinuous-Galerkin finite element methods, because of the computation of numerical integrals over different domains (e.g., cells, facets). The major challenge with sparse tiling is implementation—not only is it cumbersome to understand and synthesize, but it is also onerous to maintain and generalize, as it requires a complete rewrite of the bulk of the numerical computation. In this article, we propose an approach to extend the applicability of sparse tiling based on raising the level of abstraction. Through a sequence of compiler passes, the mathematical specification of a problem is progressively lowered, and eventually sparse-tiled C for-loops are generated. Besides automation, we advance the state-of-the-art by introducing a revisited, more efficient sparse tiling algorithm; support for distributed-memory parallelism; a range of fine-grained optimizations for increased runtime performance; implementation in a publicly available library, SLOPE; and an in-depth study of the performance impact in Seigen, a real-world elastic wave equation solver for seismological problems, which shows speed-ups up to 1.28× on a platform consisting of 896 Intel Broadwell cores.",

    "abstract": "Solving tridiagonal linear-equation systems is a fundamental computing kernel in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, and its computation can be modeled with parallel algorithms. These parallel solvers are typically designed to compute problems whose data fit in a common shared-memory space where all the cores taking part in the computation have access. However, when the problem size is large, data cannot be entirely stored in the common shared-memory space, and a high number of high-latency communications are performed. One alternative is to partition the problem among different memory spaces. At this point, conventional parallel algorithms do not facilitate the partition of computation in independent tiles, since each reduction depends on equations that may be in different tiles. This article proposes an algorithm based on a tree reduction, called the Tree Partitioning Reduction (TPR) method, which partitions the problem into independent slices that can be partially computed in parallel within different common shared-memory spaces. The TPR method can be implemented for any parallel and distributed programming paradigm. Furthermore, in this work, TPR is efficiently implemented for CUDA GPUs to solve large size problems, providing highly competitive performance results with respect to existing packages, being, on average, 22.03× faster than CUSPARSE.",

To solve the targeted QP problem to a desired accuracy efficiently, we consider the restricted-Wolfe dual problem and develop a two-phase Proximal Augmented Lagrangian method (QPPAL), with Phase I to generate a reasonably good initial point to warm start Phase II to obtain an accurate solution efficiently. More specifically, in Phase I, based on the recently developed symmetric Gauss-Seidel (sGS) decomposition technique, we design a novel sGS-based semi-proximal augmented Lagrangian method for the purpose of finding a solution of low to medium accuracy. Then, in Phase II, a proximal augmented Lagrangian algorithm is proposed to obtain a more accurate solution efficiently. Extensive numerical results evaluating the performance of QPPAL against existing state-of-the-art solvers Gurobi, OSQP, and QPALM are presented to demonstrate the high efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm for solving various classes of large-scale convex QP problems.

In this work, we explore forward mode, operator overloading-based differentiation of C++ codes on these architectures using the widely available Sacado AD software package. In particular, we leverage Kokkos, a C++ tool providing APIs for implementing parallel computations that is portable to a wide variety of emerging architectures. We describe the challenges that arise when differentiating code for these architectures using Kokkos, and two approaches for overcoming them that ensure optimal memory access patterns as well as expose additional dimensions of fine-grained parallelism in the derivative calculation. We describe the results of several computational experiments that demonstrate the performance of the approach on a few contemporary CPU and GPU architectures. We then conclude with applications of these techniques to the simulation of discretized systems of partial differential equations.",

For linear systems of equations, there has been renewed enthusiasm for mixed precision variants of iterative refinement. We consider the iterative solution of large sparse systems using incomplete factorization preconditioners. The focus is on the robust computation of such preconditioners in half precision arithmetic and employing them to solve symmetric positive definite systems to higher precision accuracy; however, the proposed ideas can be applied more generally. Even for well-conditioned problems, incomplete factorizations can break down when small entries occur on the diagonal during the factorization. When using half precision arithmetic, overflows are an additional possible source of breakdown. We examine how breakdowns can be avoided and implement our strategies within new half precision Fortran sparse incomplete Cholesky factorization software. Results are reported for a range of problems from practical applications. These demonstrate that, even for highly ill-conditioned problems, half precision preconditioners can potentially replace double precision preconditioners, although unsurprisingly this may be at the cost of additional iterations of a Krylov solver.",

    "abstract": "We introduce FdeSolver, an open-source Julia package designed to solve fractional-order differential equations efficiently. The available solutions are based on product-integration rules, predictor–corrector algorithms, and the Newton-Raphson method. The package covers solutions for one-dimensional equations with orders of positive real numbers. For higher-dimensional systems, it supports orders up to one. Incommensurate derivatives are allowed and defined in the Caputo sense. Here, we summarize the implementation for a representative class of problems and compare it with available alternatives in Julia and MATLAB. Moreover, FdeSolver leverages the power and flexibility of the Julia environment to offer enhanced computational performance, and our development emphasizes adherence to the best practices of open research software. To highlight its practical utility, we demonstrate its capability in simulating microbial community dynamics and modeling the spread of COVID-19. This latter application involves fitting the order of derivatives grounded on real-world epidemiological data. Overall, these results highlight the efficiency, reliability, and practicality of the FdeSolver Julia package.",

An algorithm based on this analysis is implemented; Taylor series with stored coefficients are used to compute \\(w(z)\\) in a small region where recurrence is not efficient.

While several methods exist to evaluate a barycentric rational interpolant, the class is designed to autonomously select the best method to use on a case-by-case basis, as it takes into account the latest results regarding the efficiency and numerical stability of barycentric rational interpolation [ 15 ]. Moreover, we describe a new technique that makes the code robust and less prone to overflow and underflow errors. In addition to the standard C++ data types, the BRI template variables can also be defined with arbitrary precision because the BRI class is compatible with the Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable (MPFR) library [ 14 ].",

The main ideas are to use finite difference to approximate the gradient of the objective function and constraints, and use augmented Lagrangian method and sequential quadratic programming to deal with nonlinear constraints. We incorporate the techniques of implicit filtering, a new restart mechanism, and a modern quadratic programming solver into this new version with an ANSI C implementation. The algorithm exhibits a great advantage in running time and robustness under noise compared with the old version implemented in MATLAB. The numerical experiments show that SOLNP+ is comparable with two widely used solvers, COBYLA and NOMAD. SOLNP+ is available at https://github.com/COPT-Public/SOLNP_plus .",

    "abstract": "Accurate approximation of a real-valued function depends on two aspects of the available data: the density of inputs within the domain of interest and the variation of the outputs over that domain. There are few methods for assessing whether the density of inputs is sufficient to identify the relevant variations in outputs—i.e., the “geometric scale” of the function—despite the fact that sampling density is closely tied to the success or failure of an approximation method. In this article, we introduce a general purpose, computational approach to detecting the geometric scale of real-valued functions over a fixed domain using a deterministic interpolation technique from computational geometry. The algorithm is intended to work on scalar data in moderate dimensions (2–10). Our algorithm is based on the observation that a sequence of piecewise linear interpolants will converge to a continuous function at a quadratic rate (in \\(L^{2}\\) norm) if and only if the data are sampled densely enough to distinguish the feature from noise (assuming sufficiently regular sampling). We present numerical experiments demonstrating how our method can identify feature scale, estimate uncertainty in feature scale, and assess the sampling density for fixed (i.e., static) datasets of input–output pairs. We include analytical results in support of our numerical findings and have released lightweight code that can be adapted for use in a variety of data science settings.",

We prove that optimal Chebyshev polynomials can be factorized in terms of Chebyshev polynomials of lower order which leads to new -optimal- iteration schemes. We also construct a family of new algorithms by dividing the considered interval into sub-intervals where different magic constants and multiplicative factors are used (in order to increase the accuracy).

Any such matrix H of order n , normalized so that its subdiagonal elements are nonnegative, can be written as a product of n –1 Givens matrices and a diagonal matrix. This representation, which we refer to as the Schur parametric form of H, arises naturally in applications such as in signal processing and in the computation of Gauss-Szego¨ quadrature rules. Our programs utilize the Schur parametrization to compute the spectral decomposition of H without explicitly forming the elements of H. If only the eigenvalues and first components of the eigenvectors are desired, as in the applications mentioned above, the algorithm requires only O(n 2 ) arithmetic operations. Experimental results presented indicate that the algorithm is reliable and competitive with the general QR algorithm applied to this problem. Moreover, the algorithm can be easily adapted for parallel implementation.",

Compared to numerical differentiation, the derivatives obtained from applying automatic differentiation are free from truncation error, and their computation often requires less time. To increase the efficiency of a black box approach of automatic differentiation, a technique called interface contraction may be used. Interface contraction exploits the local structure of a code to temporarily reduce the global number of derivatives propagated through the code. Two performance models are introduced to predict the potential improvement in the execution time of a program making use of interface contraction compared to a program generated by a black box approach of automatic differentiation. The performance models are validated by numerical experiments carried out on different computing platforms. The computer codes used in the experiments stem from the application areas of neutron scattering and biostatistics.",

This article describes an implementation of sparse LQ factorization, including block triangularization, approximate minimum degree ordering, symbolic factorization, multifrontal factorization, and updating and downdating. The factor Q is not retained. The updating algorithm expands the nonzero pattern of the factor L, which is reflected in dynamic representation of L. The block triangularization is used as an \"ordering for sparsity\" rather than as a prerequisite for block backward substitution. In symbolic factorization, something called \"element counters\" is introduced to reduce the overestimation of the number of nonzeros that the commonly used methods do. Both the approximate minimum degree ordering and the symbolic factorization are done without explicitly forming the nonzero pattern of the symmetric matrix in the corresponding normal equations. Tests show that the average time used for a single update or downdate is essentially the same as the time used for a single forward or backward substitution. Other parts of the implementation show the same range of performance as existing code, but cannot be replaced because of the special character of the systems that are solved.",

One of the most important mathematical tools to perform data assimilation is the Kalman filter. This is essentially a predictor-corrector algorithm that is optimal in the sense of minimizing the trace of the covariance matrix of the errors. Unfortunately, the computational cost of applying the filter to large scale problems is enormous, and the programming of the filter is highly dependent on the model and the format of the data involved. The first objective of this article is to present a set of Fortran 90 modules that implement the reduced rank square root versions of the Kalman filter, adapted for the assimilation of a very large number of variables. The second objective is to present a Kalman filter implementation whose code is independent of both the model and observations and is easy to use. A detailed description of the algorithms, structure, parallelization is given along with examples of using the package to solve practical problems.",

Static dataflow analysis is commonly used by AD tools to determine the set of active variables, that is, variables that are influenced by the program input in a differentiable way and have a differentiable influence on the program output. In this work, a context-sensitive static analysis combined with procedure cloning is used to generate specialised versions of differentiated procedures for each call site. This enables better detection and elimination of unused computations and memory storage, resulting in performance improvements of the generated code, in both forward- and reverse-mode AD. The implications of this multi-activity AD approach on the static analysis of an AD tool is shown using dataflow equations. The worst-case cost of multi-activity AD on the differentiation process is analysed and practical remedies to avoid running into this worst case are presented. The method was implemented in the AD tool Tapenade, and we present its application to a 3D unstructured compressible flow solver, for which we generate an adjoint solver that performs significantly faster when multi-activity AD is used.",

Many researchers focus on verifying the compliance of implementations for binary and decimal floating-point operations with these standards. In this article, we are concerned with the special values of the operands of the power function Z = X Y . We study how the standards define the correct results for this operation, propose a mathematically justified definition for the correct results of the power function on the occurrence of these special values as its operands, test how different software implementations for the power function deal with these special values, and classify the behavior of different programming languages from the viewpoint of how much they conform to the standards and our proposed mathematical definition.

    "abstract": "Equation-based modelling is a powerful approach to tame the complexity of large-scale simulation problems. Equation-based tools automatically translate models into imperative languages. When confronted with nowadays’ problems, however, well assessed model translation techniques exhibit scalability issues that are particularly severe when models contain very large arrays. In fact, such models can be made very compact by enclosing equations into looping constructs, but reflecting the same compactness into the translated imperative code is nontrivial. In this paper, we face this issue by concentrating on a key step of equations-to-code translation, the equation/variable matching. We first show that an efficient translation of models with (large) arrays needs awareness of their presence, by defining a figure of merit to measure how much the looping constructs are preserved along the translation. We then show that the said figure of merit allows to define an optimal array-aware matching, and as our main result, that the so stated optimal array-aware matching problem is NP-complete. As an additional result, we propose a heuristic algorithm capable of performing array-aware matching in polynomial time. The proposed algorithm can be proficiently used by model translator developers in the implementation of efficient tools for large-scale system simulation.",

    "abstract": "Polynomial interpolation is an important component of many computational problems. In several of these computational problems, failure to preserve positivity when using polynomials to approximate or map data values between meshes can lead to negative unphysical quantities. Currently, most polynomial-based methods for enforcing positivity are based on splines and polynomial rescaling. The spline-based approaches build interpolants that are positive over the intervals in which they are defined and may require solving a minimization problem and/or system of equations. The linear polynomial rescaling methods allow for high-degree polynomials but enforce positivity only at limited locations (e.g., quadrature nodes). This work introduces open-source software (HiPPIS) for high-order data-bounded interpolation (DBI) and positivity-preserving interpolation (PPI) that addresses the limitations of both the spline and polynomial rescaling methods. HiPPIS is suitable for approximating and mapping physical quantities such as mass, density, and concentration between meshes while preserving positivity. This work provides Fortran and Matlab implementations of the DBI and PPI methods, presents an analysis of the mapping error in the context of PDEs, and uses several 1D and 2D numerical examples to demonstrate the benefits and limitations of HiPPIS.",

The series expansion method has been applied to the normal, chi-square, and t distributions, but because of computational difficulties, it has not been applied to the F -Distribution. These problems have been overcome by making the standard transformation to the beta distribution. The procedure is explained in Sections 3 and 4. Empirical results of a comparison of CPU times are given in Section 5. The series expansion is compared to some of the standard root-finding methods. A table is given for p = .90.",

    "abstract": "Numerical methods for partial differential equations often determine approximations that are more accurate at the set of discrete meshpoints than they are at the “off-mesh” points in the domain of interest. These methods are generally most effective if they are allowed to adjust the location of the mesh points to match the local behavior of the solution. Different methods will typically generate their respective approximations on incompatible, unstructured meshes, and it can be difficult to evaluate the quality of a particular solution, or to visualize important properties of a solution. In this paper we will introduce a generic approach which can be used to generate approximate solution values at arbitrary points in the domain of interest for any method that determines approximations to the solution and low-order derivatives at meshpoints. This approach is based on associating a set of “collocation” points with each mesh element and requiring that the local approximation interpolate the meshpoint data and almost satisfy the partial differential equation at the collocation points. The accuracy associated with this interpolation/collocation approach is consistent with the “meshpoint accuracy” of the underlying method. The approach that we develop applies to a large class of methods and problems. It uses local information only and is therefore particularly suitable for implementation in a parallel or network computing environment. Numerical examples are given for some second-order problems in two and three dimensions.",

The basic idea is to first identify the intersection points between contour curves and the sides of each triangle and then draw smooth contour curves connecting these points.

    "abstract": "Exact solving of systems of linear equations (SLEs) is a fundamental subroutine within number theory, formal verification of mathematical proofs, and exact-precision mathematical programming. Moreover, efficient exact SLE solution methods could be valuable for a growing body of science and engineering applications where current fixed-precision standards have been deemed inadequate. This article contains key derivations relating, and computational tests comparing, two exact direct solution frameworks: roundoff-error-free (REF) LU factorization and rational arithmetic LU factorization. Specifically, both approaches solve the linear system Ax = b by factoring the matrix A into the product of a lower triangular (L) and upper triangular (U) matrix, A = LU . Most significantly, the featured findings reveal that the integer-preserving REF factorization framework solves dense SLEs one order of magnitude faster than the exact rational arithmetic approach while requiring half the memory. Since rational LU is utilized for basic solution validation in exact linear and mixed-integer programming, these results offer preliminary evidence of the potential of the REF factorization framework to be utilized within this specific context. Additionally, this article develops and analyzes an efficient streamlined version of Edmonds’s Q-matrix approach that can be implemented as another basic solution validation approach. Further experiments demonstrate that the REF factorization framework also outperforms this alternative integer-preserving approach in terms of memory requirements and computational effort. General purpose codes to solve dense SLEs exactly via any of the aforementioned methods have been made available to the research and academic communities.",

To allow for large values of x , y , and p while avoiding under/overflow issues in the standard double precision floating point arithmetic, we use an explicit normalization that is much more efficient than the classical ratio with the complete gamma function. The generalized incomplete gamma function is estimated with continued fractions, with integrations by parts, or, when x ≈ y , with the Romberg numerical integration algorithm. We show that the accuracy reached by our algorithm improves a recent state-of-the-art method by two orders of magnitude, and it is essentially optimal considering the limitations imposed by floating point arithmetic. Moreover, the admissible parameter range of our algorithm (0 ≤ p,x,y ≤ 10 15 ) is much larger than competing algorithms, and its robustness is assessed through massive usage in an image processing application.",

Proposed modifications of the quadeig framework are designed to enhance backward stability and to make the process of deflating infinite and zero eigenvalues more numerically robust. In particular, careful preprocessing allows scaling invariant/component-wise backward error and thus a better condition number. Further, using an upper triangular version of the Kronecker canonical form enables deflating additional infinite eigenvalues, in addition to those inferred from the rank of M . Theoretical analysis and empirical evidence from thorough testing of the software implementation confirm superior numerical performances of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The central importance of large-scale eigenvalue problems in scientific computation necessitates the development of massively parallel algorithms for their solution. Recent advances in dense numerical linear algebra have enabled the routine treatment of eigenvalue problems with dimensions on the order of hundreds of thousands on the world’s largest supercomputers. In cases where dense treatments are not feasible, Krylov subspace methods offer an attractive alternative due to the fact that they do not require storage of the problem matrices. However, demonstration of scalability of either of these classes of eigenvalue algorithms on computing architectures capable of expressing massive parallelism is non-trivial due to communication requirements and serial bottlenecks, respectively. In this work, we introduce the SISLICE method: a parallel shift-invert algorithm for the solution of the symmetric self-consistent field (SCF) eigenvalue problem. The SISLICE method drastically reduces the communication requirement of current parallel shift-invert eigenvalue algorithms through various shift selection and migration techniques based on density of states estimation and k-means clustering, respectively. This work demonstrates the robustness and parallel performance of the SISLICE method on a representative set of SCF eigenvalue problems and outlines research directions that will be explored in future work.",

    "abstract": "Given a regular matrix pencil λ B -- A and a positively oriented contour γ in the complex plane, the spectral dichotomy methods applied to λ B -- A and γ consist in determining whether λ B -- A possesses eigenvalues on or in a neighborhood of γ . When no such eigenvalues exist, these methods compute iteratively the spectral projector P onto the right deflating subspace of λ B -- A associated with the eigenvalues inside/outside γ . The computation of the projector is accompanied by the spectral norm || H || of a Hermitian positive definite matrix H called the dichotomy condition number , which indicates the numerical quality of the spectral projector P . The smaller || H || is, the better this quality. This article presents a MATLAB program (specdicho) implementing the main types of spectral dichotomy where γ is a circle, an ellipse, the imaginary axis or a parabola.",

    "abstract": "Dantzig--Wolfe Decomposition is recognized as a powerful, algorithmic tool for solving linear programs of block-angular form. While use of the approach has been reported in a wide variety of domains, there has not been a general implementation of Dantzig--Wolfe decomposition available. This article describes an open-source implementation of the algorithm. It is general in the sense that any properly decomposed linear program can be provided to the software for solving. While the original description of the algorithm was motivated by its reduced memory usage, modern computers can also take advantage of the algorithm's inherent parallelism. This implementation is parallel and built upon the POSIX threads (pthreads) library. Some computational results are provided to motivate use of such parallel solvers, as this implementation outperforms state-of-the-art commercial solvers in terms of wall-clock runtime by an order of magnitude or more on several problem instances.",

    "abstract": "We describe a version of the Level 3 BLAS which is designed to be efficient on RISC processors. This is an extension of previous studies by the authors and colleagues on a similar approach for efficient serial and parallel implementations on virtual-memory and shared-memory multiprocessors. All our codes are written in Fortran and use loop-unrolling, blocking, and copying to improve the performance. A blocking technique is used to express the BLAS in terms of operations involving triangular blocks and calls to the matrix-matrix multiplication kernel (GEMM). No manufacturer-supplied or assembler code is used. This blocked implementation uses the same blocking ideas as in our implementation for vector machines except that the ordering of loops is designed for efficient reuse of date held in cache and not necessarily for parallelization. All the codes are specifically tuned for RISC processors. The software also includes a tuned version of GEMM. A parameter which controls the blocking allows efficient exploitation of the memory hierarchy on the various target computers. We present results on a range of RISC-based workstations and multiprocessors: CRAY T3D, DEC 8400 5/300, HP 715/64, IBM SP2, MEIKO CS2-HA, SGI Power Challenge 10000, and SUN UltraSPARC-1 model 140. This implementation of the Level 3 BLAS is available on anonymous FTP, and we welcome input from users to improve and extend our BLAS implementation.",

Corresponding Fortran 77 programs for an IEEE environment have also been developed to illustrate the practicality of the algorithms, and these programs have been tested very carefully to help confirm the correctness of the algorithms and their error bounds. The results of these tests are included in the article, but the Fortran 77 programs are not (these programs are available from Fairgrieve). Tests of other widely available programs fail at many points in the complex plane, and otherwise are slower and produce much less accurate results.",

A key issue is to profile algorithms in terms of the qualitative characteristics of benchmark problems. In this methodological note, we adapt a novel all-pairs algorithm for the profiling task; given performance rankings for m algorithms on n problem instances, each described with p features, identify a (minimal) subset of p that is useful for assessing the selective superiority of an algorithm over another, for all pairs of m algorithms. We show how techniques presented in the mathematical software literature are inadequate for such profiling purposes. In conclusion, we also address various statistical issues underlying the effective application of this technique.",

    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for solving the dense linear (sum) assignment problem and an efficient, parallel implementation that is based on the successive shortest path algorithm. More specifically, we introduce the well-known epsilon scaling approach used in the Auction algorithm to approximate the dual variables of the successive shortest path algorithm prior to solving the assignment problem to limit the complexity of the path search. This improves the runtime by several orders of magnitude for hard-to-solve real-world problems, making the runtime virtually independent of how hard the assignment is to find. In addition, our approach allows for using accelerators and/or external compute resources to calculate individual rows of the cost matrix. This enables us to solve problems that are larger than what has been reported in the past, including the ability to efficiently solve problems whose cost matrix exceeds the available systems memory. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation that is able to solve problems with more than one trillion arcs in less than 100 hours on a single machine.",

    "abstract": "On w -bit processors which are much faster at multiplying two w -bit integers than at dividing 2 w -bit integers by w -bit integers, reductions of large integers by moduli M smaller than 2 w -1 are often implemented suboptimally, leading applications to take excessive processing time. We present a modular reduction algorithm implementing division by a modulus through multiplication by a reciprocal of that modulus, a well-known method for moduli larger than 2 w -1 . We show that application of this method to smaller moduli makes it possible to express certain modular sums and differences without having to compensate for word overflows. By embedding the algorithm in a loop and applying a few transformations to the loop, we obtain an algorithm for reduction of large integers by moduli up to 2 w -1 . Implementations of this algorithm can run considerably faster than implementations of similar algorithms that allow for moduli up to 2 w . This is substantiated by measurements on processors with relatively fast multiplication instructions. It is notoriously hard to specify efficient mathematical algorithms on the level of abstract machine instructions in an error-free manner. In order to eliminate the chance of errors as much as possible, we have created formal correctness proofs of our algorithms, checked by a mechanized proof assistant.",

With it, we establish support for OpenMP features in a reverse mode operator overloading AD tool to an extent that was previously only reported on in source transformation tools. We achieve this with an event-based implementation ansatz that is unprecedented in AD. Combined with modern OpenMP features around OMPT, we demonstrate how it can be used to achieve differentiation without any additional modifications of the source code; neither do we impose a priori restrictions on the data access patterns, which makes OpDiLib highly applicable. For further performance optimizations, restrictions like atomic updates on adjoint variables can be lifted in a fine-grained manner. OpDiLib can also be applied in a semi-automatic fashion via a macro interface, which supports compilers that do not implement OMPT. We demonstrate the applicability of OpDiLib for a pure operator overloading approach in a hybrid parallel environment. We quantify the cost of atomic updates on adjoint variables and showcase the speedup and scaling that can be achieved with the different configurations of OpDiLib in both the forward and the reverse pass.",

Several optimisation schemes are studied together with associated lower and upper bounds on the estimated memory traffic volume. Apart from properly reordering the mesh entities, the two most significant optimisations include adopting a lookup table in adding element matrices or vectors to their global counterparts, and using a row-wise assembly algorithm for multi-threaded parallelisation. Rigorous benchmarking shows that, due to the various optimisations, the actual volumes of memory traffic are in many cases very close to the estimated lower bounds. These results confirm the effectiveness of the optimisations, while also providing a recipe for developing efficient software for finite element assembly.",

    "abstract": "Tensor decompositions, such as CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), are widely used in a variety of applications, such as chemometrics, signal processing, and machine learning. A broadly used method for computing such decompositions relies on the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. When the number of components is small, regardless of its implementation, ALS exhibits low arithmetic intensity, which severely hinders its performance and makes GPU offloading ineffective. We observe that, in practice, experts often have to compute multiple decompositions of the same tensor, each with a small number of components (typically fewer than 20), to ultimately find the best ones to use for the application at hand. In this paper, we illustrate how multiple decompositions of the same tensor can be fused together at the algorithmic level to increase the arithmetic intensity. Therefore, it becomes possible to make efficient use of GPUs for further speedups; at the same time the technique is compatible with many enhancements typically used in ALS, such as line search, extrapolation, and non-negativity constraints. We introduce the Concurrent ALS algorithm and library, which offers an interface to Matlab, and a mechanism to effectively deal with the issue that decompositions complete at different times. Experimental results on artificial and real datasets demonstrate a shorter time to completion due to increased arithmetic intensity.",

We show how the block-column-wise algorithm exploits BLR structure to achieve arithmetic complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$, while the tiled BLR-QR exhibits $\\mathcal{O}(mn^{1.5})$ complexity. However, the tiled BLR-QR has finer task granularity that allows parallel task-based execution on shared memory systems. We compare the block-column-wise BLR-QR using fork-join parallelism with tiled BLR-QR using task-based parallelism. We also compare these two implementations of Householder BLR-QR with a block-column-wise Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) BLR-QR using fork-join parallelism, and a state-of-the-art vendor-optimized dense Householder QR in Intel MKL. For a matrix of size 131k $\\times$ 65k, all BLR methods are more than an order of magnitude faster than the dense QR in MKL. Our methods are also robust to ill-conditioning and produce better orthogonal factors than the existing MGS-based method. On a CPU with 64 cores, our parallel tiled Householder and block-column-wise Householder algorithms show a speedup of 50 and 37 times, respectively.",

Matrix operations found in high performance computing libraries are usually parameterized based on host microprocessor specifications to minimize data movement within the different levels of memory hierarchy. The performance of cache-oblivious algorithms does not rely on such parameterizations. This type of algorithm provides an elegant and portable solution to address the lack of standardization in modern-day processors. Our solution consists in an iterative blocking scheme that takes advantage of the locality-preserving properties of Hilbert space-filling curves to minimize data movement in any memory hierarchy. This scheme traverses the input matrix, in O(nm) time and space, improving the behavior of matrix algorithms that inherently present poor memory locality. The application of this technique to the problem of out-of-place matrix transposition achieved competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The performance of our solution surpassed Intel MKL version after employing standard software prefetching techniques.",

    "abstract": "For control nets outlining a large class of topological polyhedra, not just tensor-product grids, bi-cubic polyhedral splines form a piecewise polynomial, first-order differentiable space that associates one function with each vertex. Akin to tensor-product splines, the resulting smooth surface approximates the polyhedron. Admissible polyhedral control nets consist of quadrilateral faces in a grid-like layout, star-configuration where n ≠ 4 quadrilateral faces join around an interior vertex, n -gon configurations, where 2n quadrilaterals surround an n -gon, polar configurations where a cone of n triangles meeting at a vertex is surrounded by a ribbon of n quadrilaterals, and three types of T-junctions where two quad-strips merge into one. The bi-cubic pieces of a polyhedral spline have matching derivatives along their break lines, possibly after a known change of variables. The pieces are represented in Bernstein-Bézier form with coefficients depending linearly on the polyhedral control net, so that evaluation, differentiation, integration, moments, and so on, are no more costly than for standard tensor-product splines. Bi-cubic polyhedral splines can be used both to model geometry and for computing functions on the geometry. Although polyhedral splines do not offer nested refinement by refinement of the control net, polyhedral splines support engineering analysis of curved smooth objects. Coarse nets typically suffice since the splines efficiently model curved features. Algorithm 1032 is a C++ library with input-output example pairs and an IGES output choice.",

Complex numbers are a special case of complex fans, where the magnitude and angle are point intervals. Operations (especially addition) with complex numbers in polar form are complicated. What most applications do is to convert them to rectangular form, perform operations, and return the result to polar form. However, if the complex number is a Complex Fan, that transformation increases ambiguity in the result. That is, the resulting Fan is not the smallest Fan that contains all possible results. The need for minimal results took us to develop algorithms to perform the basic arithmetic operations with complex fans, ensuring the result will always be the smallest possible complex fan. We have developed the arithmetic operations of addition, negation, subtraction, product, and division of complex fans. The algorithms presented in this article are written in pseudocode, and the programs in Common Lisp, making use of CLOS (Common Lisp Object System). Translation to any other high-level programming language should be straightforward.",

These systems are usually solved by Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods, such as by LSODE of Hindmarsh. Recently, Rosenbrock methods turned out to be rather successful for integrating small systems with inexpensive function and Jacobian evaluations. However, no test has been done on the performance of some recently developed Rosenbrock codes in a situation in which the dimension of the system is large, for example, over one hundred equations. These Rosenbrock codes performed quite well on the STIFF DETEST and other small systems. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of the Rosenbrock methods in solving the flame propagation problem by the method of lines.",

In particular, we describe how a DEI can be used to generate a fine mesh approximation from a coarse mesh approximation; this fine mesh approximation can then be used by a standard contouring function to render an accurate contour plot of the surface. However, the standard approach has a time complexity equivalent to that of rendering a surface plot, O ( fm 2 ) for each element of the coarse mesh, (where fm is the ratio of the width of the coarse mesh to the fine mesh). To address this concern three fast contouring algorithms are proposed that compute accurate contour lines directly from the DEI, and have time complexity at most O ( fm ) for each coarse mesh element.",

PFix has applications in economics, game theory, and the solution of partial differential equations. PFix computes an approximation that satisfies the residual error criterion, and can also compute an approximation satisfying the absolute error criterion when the Lipschitz constant is less than 1. For functions defined on all rectangular domains, the worst-case complexity of PFix has order equal to the logarithm of the reciprocal of the tolerance, raised to the power of the dimension. Dividing this order expression by the factorial of the dimension yields the order of the worst-case bound for the case of the unit hypercube. PFix is a recursive algorithm, in that it uses solutions to a d -dimensional problem to compute a solution to a ( d + 1)-dimensional problem. A full analysis of PFix may be found in Shellman and Sikorski [2003b], and a C implementation is available through ACM ToMS.",

The main feature of the proposed framework is the use of several programming paradigms for the different implementation layers, with a strong emphasis on object-oriented classes and operator overloading for the top layer, and optimized FORTRAN and C code for the layers underneath. We describe an implementation of the proposed framework that is based on the ML library, the algebraic multilevel preconditioning package of Trilinos, which supports state-of-the-art parallel smoothed aggregation methods, and can be used to define general algebraic and geometric multilevel and multigrid preconditioners and solvers. The article demonstrates that we can take advantage of object-oriented programming and operator overloading to obtain intuitive, easy-to-read, and easy-to-develop codes that are at the same time efficient and scalable. Several numerical experiments obtained on serial and parallel computers show that the overhead required by the object-oriented layer is very modest, therefore allowing developers to focus on the new algorithms they are developing and testing, rather than on implementation details.",

This article describes the Fortran software eBACOLI, the extension of BACOLI to solve such multiscale models.

    "abstract": "After a short introduction, the article begins with an axiomatic definition of rounded arithmetic. The concepts of rounding and of rounded arithmetic operations are defined in an axiomatic manner fully independent of special data formats and encodings. Basic properties of floating-point and interval arithmetic can directly be derived from this abstract mathematical model. Interval operations are defined as set operations for elements of the set ¯IR of closed and connected sets of real numbers. As such, they form an algebraically closed subset of the powerset of the real numbers. This property leads to explicit formulas for the arithmetic operations of floating-point intervals of ¯IF, which are executable on the computer. Arithmetic for intervals of ¯IF forms an exception free calculus, i.e., arithmetic operations for intervals of ¯IF always lead to intervals of ¯IF again. Later sections are concerned with programming support and hardware for interval arithmetic. Both are a must and absolutely necessary to move interval arithmetic more into the center of scientific computing. With some minor hardware additions, interval operations can be made as fast as simple floating-point operations. In vector and matrix spaces for real, complex, and interval data, the dot product is a fundamental arithmetic operation. Computing the dot product of two vectors with floating-point components exactly substantially speeds up floating-point and interval arithmetic as well as the accuracy of the computed result. Hardware needed for the exact dot product is very modest. The exact dot product is essential for long real and long interval arithmetic. Section 9 illustrates that interval arithmetic as developed in this article already has a long tradition. Products based on these ideas have been available since 1980. Implementing what the article advocates would have a profound effect on mathematical software. Modern processor architecture from Intel, for example, comes quite close to what is requested in this article.",

    "abstract": "In addition to tensor contractions, one of the most pronounced computational bottlenecks in the nonorthogonally spin-adapted forms of the quantum chemistry methods CCSDT and CCSDTQ, and their approximate forms—including CCSD(T) and CCSDT(Q)—are spin summations. At a first sight, spin summations are operations similar to tensor transpositions, but a closer look reveals additional challenges to high-performance calculations, including temporal locality and scattered memory accesses. This article explores a sequence of algorithmic solutions for spin summations, each exploiting individual properties of either the underlying hardware (e.g., caches, vectorization) or the problem itself (e.g., factorizability). The final algorithm combines the advantages of all the solutions while avoiding their drawbacks; this algorithm achieves high performance through parallelization and vectorization, and by exploiting the temporal locality inherent to spin summations. Combined, these optimizations result in speedups between 2.4× and 5.5× over the NCC quantum chemistry software package. In addition to such a performance boost, our algorithm can perform the spin summations in-place , thus reducing the memory footprint by 2× over an out-of-place variant.",

Our aim is to compare and develop algorithms with a linear complexity in terms of the polynomial degree. A first category of methods relies on a direct interval evaluation of the given Chebyshev expansion in which Chebyshev polynomials are bounded, e.g., with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Our main category of methods that are based on the Clenshaw recurrence includes interval Clenshaw with defect correction (ICDC), and the spectral transformation of Clenshaw recurrence rewritten as a discrete dynamical system. An extension of the barycentric representation to interval arithmetic is also considered that has a log-linear complexity as it takes advantage of a verified discrete cosine transform. We compare different methods and provide illustrative numerical experiments. In particular, our eigenvalue-based methods are interesting for bounding the range of high-degree interval polynomials. Some of the methods rigorously compute narrow enclosures for high-degree Chebyshev expansions at thousands of points in a few seconds on an average computer. We also illustrate how to employ our methods as an automatic a posteriori forward error analysis tool to monitor the accuracy of the Chebfun feval command.",

DPOTF3i are a novel type of level-3 BLAS for use by BPF ( B locked P acked F ormat) Cholesky factorization and LAPACK routine DPOTRF. Performance of routines DPOTF3i are still increasing when the performance of Level-2 routine DPOTF2 of LAPACK starts decreasing. This is our main result and it implies, due to the use of larger block size nb , that DGEMM, DSYRK, and DTRSM performance also increases! The four DPOTF3i routines use simple register blocking. Different platforms have different numbers of registers. Thus, our four routines have different register blocking sizes. BPF is introduced. LAPACK routines for POTRF and PPTRF using BPF instead of full and packed format are shown to be trivial modifications of LAPACK POTRF source codes. We call these codes BPTRF. There are two variants of BPF: lower and upper. Upper BPF is “identical” to Square Block Packed Format (SBPF). “LAPACK” implementations on multicore processors use SBPF. Lower BPF is less efficient than upper BPF. Vector inplace transposition converts lower BPF to upper BPF very efficiently. Corroborating performance results for DPOTF3i versus DPOTF2 on a variety of common platforms are given for n ≈ nb as well as results for large n comparing DBPTRF versus DPOTRF.",

In addition, we demonstrate the benefit of some hardware features encountered in today’s accelerators (GPU) such as static rounding, memory usage, instruction-level parallelism (ILP), and thread-level parallelism (TLP). We then describe a library of fuzzy arithmetic operations written in CUDA and C++. The library is evaluated against traditional approaches using compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks on Nvidia GPUs, with an observed performance gain of 2 to 20.",

This requires solving the Table Maker’s Dilemma (TMD), which implies a huge amount of CPU computation time. In this article, we consider accelerating such computations, namely the Lefèvre algorithm on graphics processing units (GPUs), which are massively parallel architectures with a partial single instruction, multiple data execution. We first propose an analysis of the Lefèvre hard-to-round argument search using the concept of continued fractions. We then propose a new parallel search algorithm that is much more efficient on GPUs thanks to its more regular control flow. We also present an efficient hybrid CPU-GPU deployment of the generation of the polynomial approximations required in the Lefèvre algorithm. In the end, we manage to obtain overall speedups up to 53.4 × on one GPU over a sequential CPU execution and up to 7.1 × over a hex-core CPU, which enable a much faster solution of the TMD for the double-precision format.",

    "abstract": "Software is provided for the rapid solution of certain types of elliptic equations in rectangular and irregular domains. Specifically, solutions are found in two dimensions for the nonseparable self-adjoint elliptic problem ∇·( g∇Ψ )= f , where g and f are given functions of x and y , in two-dimensional polygonal domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Helmholtz and Poisson problems in polygonal domains and the general variable coefficient problem (i.e., g≠1 ) in a rectangular domain may be treated as special cases. The method of solution combines the use of the capacitance matrix method, to treat the irregular boundary, with an efficient iterative method (using the Laplacian as preconditioner) to deal 2 with nonseparability. Each iterative step thus involves solving the Poisson equation in a rectangular domain. The package includes separate, easy-to-use routines for the Helmholtz problem and the general problem in rectangular and general polygonal domains, and example driver routines for each. Both single- and double-precision routines are provided. Second-order-accurate finite differencing is employed. Storage requirements increase approximately as p 2 + n 2 , where p is the number of irregular boundary points and where n is the linear domain dimension. The preprocessing time (the capacitance matrix calculation) varies as pn 2 log n , and the solution time varies as n 2 log n . If the equations are to be solved repeatedly in the same geometry, but with different source or diffusion functions, the capacitance matrix need only be calculated once, and hence the algorithm is particularly efficient for such cases.",

    "abstract": "Pthreads is the library of POSIX standard functions for concurrent, multithreaded programming. The POSIX standard only defines an application programming interface (API) to the C programming language, not to Fortran. Many scientific and engineering applications are written in Fortran. Also, many of these applications exhibit functional, or task-level, concurrency. They would benefit from multithreading, especially on symmetric multiprocessors (SMP). We present here an interface to that part of the Pthreads library that is compatible with standard Fortran. The contribution consists of two primary source files: a Fortran module and a collection of C wrappers to Pthreads functions. The Fortran module defines the data structures, interface and initialization routines used to manage threads. The stability and portability of the Fortran API to Pthreads has been demonstrated using common mathematical computations on several SMP systems.",

The iteration process used in solving for the stage values of the Gauss formula, the selection of the initial step size, and the choice of an appropriate local error estimator for determining the step size change according to a particular tolerance specified by the user are studied.

In a companion paper we developed a two-pass approach to solve SP called the Hierarchical Algorithm . In this paper we report on how we implemented the Hierarchical Algorithm into a code called HASP, and our computational experience in testing HASP on the NETLIB linear-programming problems. We found that HASP substantially outperformed a previous code for SP and that it produced a net savings in optimization time on the NETLIB problems. The results allow us to give guidelines for its use in practice.",

    "abstract": "The MDM T factorization of an n×n symmetric indefinite matrix A can be used to solve a linear system with A as the coefficient matrix. This factorization can be computed efficiently using an algorithm given in 1977 by Bunch and Kaufman. The LAPACK project has been implementing block versions of well-known algorithms for solving dense linear systems and eigenvalue problems. The block version of the MDM T decomposition algorithm in LAPACK requires the user to specify a block size b by supplying an n×b scratch array. It then makes ( n/b −2) 2 /2 invocations of a matrix-matrix product subroutine with one matrix no larger than b×b, n 2 /(2 b )− b invocations of a matrix-vector product routine with a matrix no larger than b×b , and between n − n/b and 2( n − n/b ) invocations of a matrix-vector product routine with matrices with less than b columns. Because the user can query LAPACK about an optimal block size, our concern is focused on users who cannot change the amount of available scratch space or who neglect to use this facility and are unaware of a performance degradation with small block sizes. This article suggests two alternative algorithms. The first is a block algorithm requiring b×b scratch space and is about 5% slower than LAPACK's current block algorithm with large b . The user does not have to specify the block size. The second algorithm is a rejuvenation of an old implementation of the MDM T decomposition algorithm that requires n matrix-vector products. The performance of the various algorithms on a specific machine is dependent on the manufacturer's implementation of the different basic linear algebra subroutines that they each invoke. Our data indicate that on the Cray Y-MP, Alliant, and Convex the time for the rejuvenated algorithm is either less than or within 10% of that of LAPACK's block algorithm with large b .",

Both of these classes of methods have certain drawbacks, however, and it has long been the aim of numerical analysts to derive a class of formulas that has the advantages of both Adams and Runge–Kutta methods and the disadvantages of neither! In this paper we derive a class of modified Adams formulas that attempts to achieve this aim. When used in a certain precisely defined predictor-corrector mode, these new formulas require three function evaluations per step, but have much better stability than Adams formulas. This improved stability makes the modified Adams formulas particularly effective for mildly stiff problems, and some numerical evidence of this is given. We also consider the performance of the new class of methods on the well-known DETEST test set to show their potential on general nonstiff initial value problems.",

Another factor of complexity, whereby the matrix product and accumulation are allowed to take place in a precision different from the storage precisions of either A or B , is also discussed. We first break the problem into orthogonal dimensions, considering the mixing of domains separately from mixing precisions. Support for all combinations of matrix operands stored in either the real or complex domain is mapped out by enumerating the cases and describing an implementation approach for each. Supporting all combinations of storage and computation precisions is handled by typecasting the matrices at key stages of the computation—during packing and/or accumulation, as needed. Several optional optimizations are also documented. Performance results gathered on a 56-core Marvell ThunderX2 and a 52-core Intel Xeon Platinum demonstrate that high performance is mostly preserved, with modest slowdowns incurred from unavoidable typecast instructions. The mixed-datatype implementation confirms that combinatorial intractability is avoided, with the framework relying on only two assembly microkernels to implement 128 datatype combinations.",

In the last years we have been developing a module within SLEPc, called NEP, that is intended for solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems. These problems can be defined by means of a matrix-valued function that depends nonlinearly on a single scalar parameter. We do not consider the particular case of polynomial eigenvalue problems (which are implemented in a different module in SLEPc) and focus here on rational eigenvalue problems and other general nonlinear eigenproblems involving square roots or any other nonlinear function. The paper discusses how the NEP module has been designed to fit the needs of applications and provides a description of the available solvers, including some implementation details such as parallelization. Several test problems coming from real applications are used to evaluate the performance and reliability of the solvers.",

Its accuracy performance is investigated thoroughly, and its running time is compared to other commonly available routines in two and three dimensions. Its running time can be several orders of magnitude faster than recursively called quadrature routines. Its performance is limited only by the memory structure of its operating environment.

The input source can be either C or C++ , while the output code generated by the precompiler and using the new types, is C++. The type conversion is based on a simple XML configuration file which is provided by either the developer of the multiprecision library or by the user of the precompiler. The precompiler can also convert to data types with additional features, which are not supported in the types of the source code. Applicability of the precompiler is shown with the successful conversion of large subsets of the GNU Scientific Library and Numerical Recipes.",

We provide an overview of the various abstractions that arose as a result of this design. Several of the algorithms have common components that may be abstracted and reused. We demonstrate how the design allowed us to derive the traditional benefits of OOD. In addition, we show how the design directly suggested elegant generalizations of existing algorithms. Finally, we show the benefits of using software testing techniques and building a powerful scripting layer for the library.",

A test matrix, called an eigenmat, is generated in a factored form, in which the user can specify the eigenvalues and has some control over the condition of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. An eigenmat A of order n requires only O ( n ) storage for its representation. Auxiliary programs permit the computation of ( A − sI ) b , ( A − sI ) T b , ( A − sI ) −1 b , and ( A − sI ) −T b in O ( n ) operations. A special routine computes specified eigenvectors of an eigenmat and the condition of its eigenvalue. Thus eigenmats are suitable for testing algorithms based on Krylov sequences, as well as others based on matrix-vector products. This article introduces the eigenmat and describes implementations in Fortran 77, Fortran 95, C, and Matlab.",

Ad hoc scaling of intermediate results, as has been done in numerical software such as the BLAS and LAPACK, mostly avoids the problem, but it can still occur at extreme values in the range of representable numbers. More careful scaling, as has been implemented in recent versions of the standard algorithms, may come at the expense of performance or clarity. This work reimplements the vector 2-norm and the generation of Givens rotations from the Level 1 BLAS to improve their performance and design. In addition, support for negative increments is extended to the Level 1 BLAS operations on a single vector, and a comprehensive test suite for all the Level 1 BLAS is included.",

It is suitable for the limited case of well separated eigenvalues, or for multiple zero eigenvalues provided the entire column corresponding to a zero eigenvalue is zero. The solution for the case of constant inhomogeneity is described. The method requires only the computation of a constant matrix using a simple recurrence. Computing the solutions of the system from that matrix, for values of the independent variable, requires one to exponentiate only the diagonal of a matrix. It is not necessary to compute the exponential of a general triangular matrix. Although this work was motivated by a study of nuclear decay without fission or neutron absorption, which is used throughout as an example, it has wider applicability.",

    "abstract": "We propose a set of new Fortran reference implementations, based on an algorithm proposed by Kahan, for the Level 1 BLAS routines *NRM2 that compute the Euclidean norm of a real or complex input vector. The principal advantage of these routines over the current offerings is that, rather than losing accuracy as the length of the vector increases, they generate results that are accurate to almost machine precision for vectors of length N &lt; N max where N max depends upon the precision of the floating point arithmetic being used. In addition, we make use of intrinsic modules, introduced in the latest Fortran standards, to detect occurrences of non-finite numbers in the input data and return suitable values as well as setting IEEE floating point status flags as appropriate. A set of C interface routines is also provided to allow simple, portable access to the new routines. To improve execution speed, we advocate a hybrid algorithm; a simple loop is used first and, only if IEEE floating point exception flags signal, do we fall back on Kahan’s algorithm. Since most input vectors are “easy,” i.e., they do not require the sophistication of Kahan’s algorithm, the simple loop improves performance while the use of compensated summation ensures high accuracy. We also report on a comprehensive suite of test problems that has been developed to test both our new implementation and existing codes for both accuracy and the appropriate settings of the IEEE arithmetic status flags.",

    "abstract": "MANBIS is a C++ mathematical software package for tackling the problem of computing the roots of a function when the number of roots is very large (of the order of hundreds or thousands). This problem has attracted increasing attention in recent years because of the broad variety of applications in various fields of science and technology. MANBIS applies the bisection method to obtain an approximate root according to a predetermined accuracy. Thus, the only computable information required is the algebraic signs of the considered function, which is the smallest amount of information (one bit of information) necessary for the purpose needed, and not any additional information. MANBIS is able to compute very efficiently a user-given percentage of roots and draws its strength from the fact that the roots are expected to be many. Furthermore, MANBIS is capable of estimating without any additional function computational cost the total number of roots within the user-given interval. Our approach can also be efficiently applied in cases where the distribution of the roots is not known. This article is accompanied by another article where the user manual, some implementation details, and some examples are included.",

    "abstract": "We describe the Recursive Subdivision (RS) method-an efficient and effective adaptive grid scheme for two-dimensional elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). The RS method generates a new grid by recursively subdividing a rectangular domain. We use a heuristic approach which attempts to equidistribute a given density function over the domain. The resulting grid is used to generate an adaptive grid domain mapping (AGDM), which may be applied to transform the PDE problem to another coordinate system. The PDE is then solved in the transformed coordinate system using a uniform grid. We believe parallelism is most easily exploited when computations are carried out on uniform grids; the AGDM framework allows the power of adaptation to be applied while still preserving this uniformity. Our method generates good adaptive grid domain mappings at a small cost compared to the cost of the entire computation. We describe the RS algorithm in detail, briefly describe the AGDM framework, and illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme on several realistic test problems.",

    "abstract": "Adjoint methods have become fundamental ingredients of the scientific computing toolbox over the past decades. Large-scale parameter sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, and nonlinear optimization would otherwise turn out computationally infeasible. The symbolic derivation of adjoint mathematical models for relevant problems in science and engineering and their implementation in consistency with the implementation of the underlying primal model frequently proves highly challenging. Hence, an increased interest in algorithmic adjoints can be observed. The algorithmic derivation of adjoint numerical simulation programs shifts some of the problems faced from functional and numerical analysis to computer science. It becomes a highly complex software engineering task requiring expertise in software analysis, transformation, and optimization. Despite rather mature software tool support for algorithmic differentiation, substantial user intervention is typically required when targeting nontrivial numerical programs. A large number of patterns shared by numerous application codes results in repeated duplication of development effort. The adjoint code design patterns introduced in this article aim to reduce this problem through improved formalization from the software engineering perspective. Fully functional reference implementations are provided through github.",

In each case, a variety of options tailored to the needs of practitioners is provided. For example, the toolbox allows the simulation of the scattered near field as well as of the far field. Also, it provides methods for the modeling of the incident field as point sources as well as plane waves. Finally, many common geometries of transmitters and receivers are included out of the box. Regarding the reconstruction, the provided functions implement the regularization scheme that relies on a primal-dual algorithm and was introduced by F. Bürgel, K. S. Kazimierski, and A.

    "abstract": "Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are widely used to model systems affected by random processes. In general, the analysis of an SDE model requires numerical solutions to be generated many times over multiple parameter combinations. However, this process often requires considerable computational resources to be practicable. Due to the embarrassingly parallel nature of the task, devices such as multi-core processors and graphics processing units (GPUs) can be employed for acceleration. Here, we present SODECL (https://github.com/avramidis/sodecl), a software library that utilizes such devices to calculate multiple orbits of an SDE model. To evaluate the acceleration provided by SODECL, we compared the time required to calculate multiple orbits of an exemplar stochastic model when one CPU core is used, to the time required when using all CPU cores or a GPU. In addition, to assess scalability, we investigated how model size affected execution time on different parallel compute devices. Our results show that when using all 32 CPU cores of a high-end high-performance computing node, the task is accelerated by a factor of up to ≈6.7, compared to when using a single CPU core. Executing the task on a high-end GPU yielded accelerations of up to ≈4.5, compared to a single CPU core.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is often used when solving time-dependent partial differential equations using numerical methods. It enables time-varying regions of much higher resolution, which can selectively refine areas to track discontinuities in the solution. The open source Clawpack software implements block-structured AMR to refine around propagating waves in the AMRClaw package. For problems where the solution must be computed over a large domain but is only of interest in a small area, this approach often refines waves that will not impact the target area. We seek a method that enables the identification and refinement of only the waves that will influence the target area. Here we show that solving the time-dependent adjoint equation and using a suitable inner product allows for a more precise refinement of the relevant waves. We present the adjoint methodology in general and give details on the implementation of this method in AMRClaw. Examples and a computational performance analysis for linear acoustics equations are presented. The adjoint method is compared to AMR methods already available in AMRClaw, and the advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The approach presented here is implemented in Clawpack, in Version 5.6.1, and code for all examples presented is archived on Github.",

Particular embedded methods for 2 ≤ s ≤ 7 internal stages with good stability properties and damping for the stiff components are constructed. Furthermore, a new formula for step-size change is proposed, having the advantage that it can be applied to any s -stage Radau IIA method. It is shown through numerical testing on some representative stiff problems that the RADAU5 code by Hairer and Wanner with the new strategy performs as well or even better as with the standard one, which is only feasible for an odd number of stages.

As a component of the sparse exact (SPEX) software package, SPEX Left LU can be applied to any input matrix, A , whose entries are integral, rational, or decimal, and provides a solution to the system \\( Ax = b \\) , which is either exact or accurate to user-specified precision. SPEX Left LU preorders the matrix A with a user-specified fill-reducing ordering and computes a left-looking LU factorization with the special property that each operation used to compute the L and U matrices is integral. Notable additional applications of this package include benchmarking the stability and accuracy of state-of-the-art linear solvers and determining whether singular-to-double-precision matrices are indeed singular. Computationally, this article evaluates the impact of several novel pivoting schemes in exact arithmetic, benchmarks the exact iterative solvers within Linbox, and benchmarks the accuracy of MATLAB sparse backslash. Most importantly, it is shown that SPEX Left LU outperforms the exact iterative solvers in run time on easy instances and in stability as the iterative solver fails on a sizeable subset of the tested (both easy and hard) instances. The SPEX Left LU package is written in ANSI C, comes with a MATLAB interface, and is distributed via GitHub, as a component of the SPEX software package, and as a component of SuiteSparse.",

Bayesian optimization is especially attractive for computational optimization due to its low cost function footprint as well as the ability to account for uncertainties in data. A key challenge to efficiently deploy any optimization strategy on distributed computing systems is the synchronization step, where data from multiple function calls is assimilated to identify the next campaign of function calls. Bayesian optimization provides an elegant approach to overcome this issue via asynchronous updates. We formulate, develop and implement a parallel, asynchronous variant of Bayesian optimization. The framework is robust and resilient to external failures. We show how such asynchronous evaluations help reduce the total optimization wall clock time for a suite of test problems. Additionally, we show how the software design of the framework allows easy extension to response surface reconstruction (Kriging), providing a high performance software for autonomous exploration.

    "abstract": "We propose a new numerical algorithm for computing the tensor rank decomposition or canonical polyadic decomposition of higher-order tensors subject to a rank and genericity constraint. Reformulating this computational problem as a system of polynomial equations allows us to leverage recent numerical linear algebra tools from computational algebraic geometry. We characterize the complexity of our algorithm in terms of an algebraic property of this polynomial system -- the multigraded regularity. We prove effective bounds for many tensor formats and ranks, which are of independent interest for overconstrained polynomial system solving. Moreover, we conjecture a general formula for the multigraded regularity, yielding a (parameterized) polynomial time complexity for the tensor rank decomposition problem in the considered setting. Our numerical experiments show that our algorithm can outperform state-of-the-art numerical algorithms by an order of magnitude in terms of accuracy, computation time, and memory consumption.",

We demonstrate the use and efficiency of forthreads for SIMD parallelism and task parallelism. We present forthreads/MPI implementations that enable hybrid shared-/distributed-memory parallelism in Fortran 2003. Our benchmarks show that forthreads offers performance comparable to that of OpenMP, but better thread control and more freedom.

However, task-based programming models lack the flexibility and the features that are necessary to express in an elegant and compact way scalable algorithms that rely on advanced communication patterns. We show that the Sequential Task Flow paradigm can be extended to write compact yet efficient and scalable routines for linear algebra computations. Although, this work focuses on dense General Matrix Multiplication, the proposed features enable the implementation of more complex algorithms. We describe the implementation of these features and of the resulting GEMM operation. Finally, we present an experimental analysis on two homogeneous supercomputers showing that our approach is competitive up to 32,768 CPU cores with state-of-the-art libraries and may outperform them for some problem dimensions. Although our code can use GPUs straightforwardly, we do not deal with this case because it implies other issues which are out of the scope of this work.",

    "abstract": "Unrestricted control polyhedra facilitate modeling free-form surfaces of arbitrary topology and local patch-layout by allowing n -sided, possibly nonplanar, facets and m -valent vertices. By cutting off edges and corners, the smoothing of an unrestricted control polyhedron can be reduced to the smoothing of a planar-cut polyhedron . A planar-cut polyhedron is a generalization of the well-known tensor-product control structure. The routine Pcp2Nurb in turn translates planar-cut polyhedra to a collection of four-sided linearly trimmed bicubic B-splines and untrimmed biquadratic B-splines. The routine can thus serve as central building block for overcoming topological constraints in the mathematical modeling of smooth surfaces that are stored, transmitted, and rendered using only the standard representation in industry. Specifically, on input of a nine-point subnet of a planar-cut polyhedron, the routine outputs a trimmed bicubic NURBS patch. If the subnet does not have geometrically redundant edges, this patch joins smoothly with patches from adjacent subnets as a four-sided piece of a regular C 1 surface. The patch integrates smoothly with untrimmed biquadratic tensor-product surfaces derived from subnets with tensor-product structure. Sharp features can be retained in this representation by using geometrically redundant edges in the planar-cut polyhedron. The resulting surface follows the outlines of the planar-cut polyhedron in the manner traditional tensor-product splines follow the outline of their rectilinear control polyhedron. In particular, it stays in the local convex hull of the planar-cut polyhedron.",

    "abstract": "Different automatic (also called universal or black-box) methods have been suggested to sample from univariate log-concave distributions. Our new automatic algorithm for bivariate log-concave distributions is based on the method of transformed density rejection. In order to construct a hat function for a rejection algorithm the bivariate density is transformed by the logarithm into a concave function. Then it is possible to construct a dominating function by taking the minimum of several tangent planes, which are by exponentiation transformed back into the original scale. The choice of the points of contact is automated using adaptive rejection sampling. This means that points that are rejected by the rejection algorithm can be used as additional points of contact. The article describes the details how this main idea can be used to construct Algorithm ALC2D that can generate random pairs from all bivariate log-concave distributions with known domain, computable density, and computable partial derivatives.",

Our approach consists of minimizing the discretized strain energy by a descent method with a Sobolev gradient in place of the standard gradient. It serves as a demonstration of the Sobolev gradient method, which is much more generally applicable. The effectiveness of the method in rapidly producing smooth interpolatory curves is demonstrated by test results for several challenging data sets.",

In the past, producing a full-featured macro processor has required significant effort, similar to that required to implement the front-end to a compiler augmented by appropriate text substitution capabilities. The tool described here adopts a different approach. The text containing macro definitions and substitutions is, in a sense, “compiled” to produce a program, and this program must then be executed to produce the final output.",

The hybrid algorithm makes use of two families of univariate algorithms, one Karatsuba based and the other DFT based, which are applied recursively to solve the multivariate problem. The hybrid algorithm is adaptive in that particular univariate algorithms are selected at run time to minimize the time complexity; an order-of-magnitude speedup with respect to classical multiplication is achieved over the entire practical range except for very small problems. Empirical investigation shows that most of the theoretical superiority is maintained in actual implementation. The largest contribution to the space requirements of the total algorithm is determined by the univariate algorithm used for the outermost variable; except for quite small problems, selecting univariate algorithms to minimize run time almost always leads to situations where the space requirements of the total algorithm are extremely close to the space required merely to store the result.",

The main module is self-contained and incorporating it only requires that it be compiled and linked with a program containing a “use dispmodule” statement. A generic interface and optional parameters are used, so that the same subroutine name, DISP, is used to display items of different data type and rank, irrespective of display options. The subroutine is quite versatile, and hopefully can improve Fortran's competitiveness against other array programming languages.

Its descent search directions are formulated in terms of the null-space of the linear programming matrix, which, in turn, is defined by a suitable basis matrix. We describe some basic properties of the method and an experimental implementation that employs a periodic basis change strategy in conjunction with inexact computation of the search direction by an iterative method, specifically, the conjugate-gradient method with diagonal preconditioning. The result of a numerical study on a number of nontrivial problems representative of problems that arise in practice are reported and discussed. A key advantage of the primal null-space affine-scaling method is its compatibility with the primal simplex method. This is considered in the concluding section, along with implications for the development of a more practical implementation.",

Truncation is accomplished in the present version by using the preconditioned Conjugate Gradient algorithm (PCG) to solve approximately the Newton equations. The preconditioner M is factored in PCG using a sparse modified Cholesky factorization based on the Yale Sparse Matrix Package.

This paper describes a task-based QR algorithm for reducing an upper Hessenberg matrix to real Schur form. The task-based algorithm also supports generalized eigenvalue problems (QZ algorithm) but this paper concentrates on the standard case. The task-based algorithm adopts previous algorithmic improvements, such as tightly-coupled multi-shifts and Aggressive Early Deflation (AED), and also incorporates several new ideas that significantly improve the performance. This includes, but is not limited to, the elimination of several synchronization points, the dynamic merging of previously separate computational steps, the shortening and the prioritization of the critical path, and experimental GPU support. The task-based implementation is demonstrated to be multiple times faster than multi-threaded LAPACK and ScaLAPACK in both single-node and multi-node configurations on two different machines based on Intel and AMD CPUs. The implementation is built on top of the StarPU runtime system and is part of the open-source StarNEig library.",

The four versions are very similar and each version implements one of the sets of CLMFs being studied. We compare the performance of these codes with that of a widely used code, LSODE. One of the new sets of CLMFs is not only much more efficient in solving stiff problems that have a Jacobian with eigenvalues close to the imaginary axis but is almost as efficient as LSODE in solving other problems. This is a significant improvement over the ony other CLMF code available, STINT from Tendler, Bickart, and Picel.",

    "abstract": "Most numerical ODE solvers require problems to be written as systems of first-order differential equations. This normally requires the user to rewrite higher-order differential equations as coupled first-order systems. Here, we introduce the treeVar class, written in object-oriented Matlab, which is capable of algorithmically reformulating higher-order ODEs to equivalent systems of first-order equations. This allows users to specify problems using a more natural syntax and saves them from having to manually derive the first-order reformulation. The technique works by using operator overloading to build up syntax trees of expressions as mathematical programs are evaluated. It then applies a set of rules to the resulting trees to obtain the first-order reformulation, which is returned as another program. This technique has connections with algorithmic/automatic differentiation. We present how treeVar has been incorporated in Chebfun, greatly improving the ODE capabilities of the system.",

Applications focusing on high-lift design or dynamic stall, or numerical methods and modeling test cases, still focus on two-dimensional domains. This automated parallel mesh generation approach can generate high-fidelity unstructured meshes with anisotropic boundary layers for use in the computational fluid dynamics field. The anisotropy requirement adds a level of complexity to a parallel meshing algorithm by making computation depend on the local alignment of elements, which in turn is dictated by geometric boundaries and the density functions— one-dimensional spacing functions generated from an exponential distribution. This approach yields computational savings in mesh generation and flow solution through well-shaped anisotropic triangles instead of isotropic triangles. The validity of the meshes is shown through solution characteristic comparisons to verified reference solutions. A 79% parallel weak scaling efficiency on 1,024 distributed memory nodes, and a 72% parallel efficiency over the fastest sequential isotropic mesh generator on 512 distributed memory nodes, is shown through numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "The traditional workflow in continuum mechanics simulations is that a geometry description -- obtained using Constructive Solid Geometry or Computer Aided Design tools -- forms the input for a mesh generator. The mesh is then used as the sole input for the finite element, finite volume, and finite difference solver, which at this point no longer has access to the original geometry. However, many more modern techniques -- for example, adaptive mesh refinement and the use of higher order geometry approximation methods -- really do need information about the underlying geometry to realize their full potential. We have undertaken an exhaustive study of where typical finite element codes use geometry information, with the goal of determining what information geometry tools would have to provide. Our study shows that all geometry needs inside the simulators can be satisfied by just two ``primitives'': elementary queries posed by the simulation software to the geometry description. We then show that it is possible to provide these primitives in all of the commonly used ways in which geometries are described in common industrial workflows. We illustrate our solutions using examples from adaptive mesh refinement for complex geometries.",

Two techniques share the crown to perform this task: the “Fast Exhaustive Search” (FES) algorithm from 2010 (which is based on Gray Codes) and the space-efficient Moebius transform from 2021 (which is reminiscent of the FFT). Both require \\(\\mathcal{O}(d2^{n})\\) operations for a degree- \\(d\\) Boolean polynomial on \\(n\\) variables and operate mostly in-place, but have other slightly different characteristics. They both provide an efficient iterator over the full truth table.

Furthermore, we showcase the application of the introduced package in classifying microarray gene expressions.

    "abstract": "Training in Feed Forward Deep Neural Networks is a memory-intensive operation which is usually performed on GPUs with limited memory capacities. This may force data scientists to limit the depth of the models or the resolution of the input data if data does not fit in the GPU memory. The re-materialization technique, whose idea comes from the checkpointing strategies developed in the Automatic Differentiation literature, allows data scientists to limit the memory requirements related to the storage of intermediate data (activations), at the cost of an increase in the computational cost. This paper introduces a new strategy of re-materialization of activations that significantly reduces memory usage. It consists in selecting which activations are saved and which activations are deleted during the forward phase and then recomputing the deleted activations when they are needed during the backward phase. We propose an original computation model that combines two types of activation savings: either only storing the layer inputs or recording the complete history of operations that produced the outputs. This paper focuses on the fully heterogeneous case, where the computation time and the memory requirement of each layer is different. We prove that finding the optimal solution is NP-hard and that classical techniques from Automatic Differentiation literature do not apply. Moreover, the classical assumption of memory persistence of materialized activations, used to simplify the search of optimal solutions, does not hold anymore. Thus, we propose a weak memory persistence property and provide a dynamic program to compute the optimal sequence of computations. This algorithm is made available through the Rotor software, a PyTorch plug-in dealing with any network consisting of a sequence of layers, each of them having an arbitrarily complex structure. Through extensive experiments, we show that our implementation consistently outperforms existing re-materialization approaches for a large class of networks, image sizes, and batch sizes.",

    "abstract": "In ACM TOMS Algorithm 1012, the DELAUNAYSPARSE software is given for performing Delaunay interpolation in medium to high dimensions. When extrapolating outside the convex hull of the training set, DELAUNAYSPARSE calls the nonnegative least squares solver DWNNLS to compute projections onto the convex hull. However, DWNNLS and many other available sum-of-squares optimization solvers were not intended for usage with many variable problems, which result from the large training sets that are typical in machine learning applications. Thus, a new PROJECT subroutine is given, based on the highly customizable quadratic program solver BQPD . This solution is shown to be as robust as DELAUNAYSPARSE for projection onto both synthetic and real-world datasets, where other available solvers frequently fail. Although it is intended as an update for DELAUNAYSPARSE , due to the difficulty and prevalence of the problem, this solution is likely to be of external interest as well.",

    "abstract": "Graphical models are used to capture complex multivariate relationships and have applications in diverse disciplines such as biology, physics, and economics. Within this field, Gaussian graphical models aim to identify the pairs of variables whose dependence is maintained even after conditioning on the remaining variables in the data, known as the conditional dependence structure of the data. There are many existing software packages for Gaussian graphical modeling, however, they often make restrictive assumptions that reduce their flexibility for modeling data that are not identically distributed. Conversely, covdepGE is an R implementation of a variational weighted pseudo-likelihood algorithm for modeling the conditional dependence structure as a continuous function of an extraneous covariate. To build on the efficiency of this algorithm, covdepGE leverages parallelism and C++ integration with R. Additionally, covdepGE provides fully-automated and data-driven hyperparameter specification while maintaining flexibility for the user to decide key components of the estimation procedure. Through an extensive simulation study spanning diverse settings, covdepGE is demonstrated to be top of its class in recovering the ground truth conditional dependence structure while efficiently managing computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "The discrete optimal transport (OT) problem, which offers an effective computational tool for comparing two discrete probability distributions, has recently attracted much attention and played essential roles in many modern applications. This paper proposes to solve the discrete OT problem by applying a squared smoothing Newton method via the Huber smoothing function for solving the corresponding KKT system directly. The proposed algorithm admits appealing convergence properties and is able to take advantage of the solution sparsity to greatly reduce computational costs. Moreover, the algorithm can be extended to solve problems with similar structures, including the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) problem with fixed supports. To verify the practical performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to solve a large set of discrete OT and WB benchmark problems. Our numerical results show that the proposed method is efficient compared to state-of-the-art linear programming (LP) solvers. Moreover, the proposed method consumes less memory than existing LP solvers, which demonstrates the potential usage of our algorithm for solving large-scale OT and WB problems.",

SPEX LDL extends SPEX Cholesky for symmetric negative definite and symmetric indefinite matrices with exclusively nonzero leading principal minors. SPEX Backslash is a general-purpose exact solver that automatically determines the best ordering and factorization to exactly solve the system \\(A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}\\) . Computationally, we test the accuracy of MATLAB sparse backslash, the state-of-the-art collection of sparse matrix solvers, revealing it is near perfect for 87% of the tested instances. In addition, we show that SPEX Cholesky outperforms alternate exact solvers in run time; specifically, SPEX Cholesky outperforms the exact solver Linbox and exact LU factorization on 73% and 90% of tested instances, respectively. Each of SPEX Cholesky, SPEX LDL, and SPEX Backslash are implemented in C and are accompanied by easy-to-use Python and MATLAB interfaces.

UltimateKalman is a slight simplification and slight generalization of an elegant Kalman filter and smoother that was proposed in 1977 by Paige and Saunders. Their algorithm appears to be numerically superior and more flexible than other Kalman filters and smoothers, but curiously has never been implemented or used before. UltimateKalman is flexible: it can easily handle time-dependent problems, problems with state vectors whose dimensions vary from step to step, problems with varying number of observations in different steps (or no observations at all in some steps), and problems in which the expectation of the initial state is unknown. The programming interface of UltimateKalman is broken into simple building blocks that can be used to construct filters, single or multi-step predictors, multi-step or whole-track smoothers, and combinations.

Integer arithmetic has attracted attention in scientific computing because of its high computational efficiency. Furthermore, considering the current circumstances of hardware development, integer arithmetic is expected to become increasingly important. Nevertheless, integer arithmetic has not been widely used for solving linear systems because it lacks robustness against overflow and underflow, making it hard to solve practical problems. Thus, we propose a new integer-based implementation framework for the flexible GMRES (FGMRES) method, which enables integer-based solvers to solve linear systems with the same accuracy as conventional floating-point solvers. In addition, we propose an integer-only algebraic multigrid preconditioner. Combining it with the integer-based FGMRES framework, we develop an integer-based solver. Numerical experiments on CPUs showed that the developed integer-based solver has a comparable convergence rate to floating-point solvers. We also found the test cases where the integer-based solver runs faster than the floating-point solvers.",

Our software builds upon previously developed Fortran routines, which were designed with restrictions on input parameters that may be limiting in applications. Our routines apply multiple transformations to allow for more general input values, such as elliptic moduli greater than unity for points 1–3, arbitrary real Jacobi amplitudes for points 1–2, and complex first arguments for point 3. In addition, our routines are thread-safe, allowing for parallel computations. Our routines were compared with values from the computer algebra system SageMath over a wide range of input parameters. Values from ellipFor and SageMath agreed to within tolerances commensurate with the limitations of floating-point arithmetic used for the elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions listed in points 1, 2, and 3 above for generalized input arguments.",

The implementation is based on a new parametric, grid-independent representation of multistep methods [Arévalo and Söderlind 2017]. Parameters are supplied for over 60 methods. For nonstiff problems, all maximal order methods ( p = k for explicit and p = k +1 for implicit methods) are supported. For stiff computation, implicit methods of order p = k are included. A collection of step-size controllers based on digital filters is provided, generating smooth step-size sequences offering improved computational stability. Controllers may be selected to match method and problem classes. A new system for automatic order control is also provided for designated families of multistep methods, offering simultaneous h - and p -adaptivity. Implemented as a M atlab toolbox, the software covers high order computations with linear multistep methods within a unified, generic framework. Computational experiments show that the new software is competitive and offers qualitative improvements. M odes is available for downloading and is primarily intended as a platform for developing a new generation of state-of-the-art multistep solvers, as well as for true ceteris paribus evaluation of algorithmic components. This also enables method comparisons within a single implementation environment.",

First, we present a flexible parallel implementation of the recursive SPIKE scheme that aims at removing its original limitation that the number of cores/processors be restricted to powers of two. A new transpose solve option for SPIKE is then developed to satisfy a standard requirement of most numerical solver libraries. Finally, a pivoting recursive SPIKE strategy is presented as an alternative to the non-pivoting scheme to improve numerical stability. All these new enhancements lead to the release of a new black-box feature-complete SPIKE-OpenMP package that significantly improves upon the performance and scalability obtained with other state-of-the-art banded solvers.",

We use an existing theorem to get an approximate measure of the quality of subspaces obtained on convergence of the iteration. Results on various datasets indicate that the POD modes and/or the subspaces are approximated with excellent accuracy with a significant runtime improvement over computing the truncated SVD.

    "abstract": "We introduce a software package called Hybrid Incomplete Factorization with Iterative Refinement (HIFIR) for preconditioning sparse, unsymmetric, ill-conditioned, and potentially singular systems. HIFIR computes a hybrid incomplete factorization (HIF) , which combines multilevel incomplete LU factorization with a truncated, rank-revealing QR (RRQR) factorization on the final Schur complement. This novel hybridization is based on the new theory of ϵ-accurate approximate generalized inverse (AGI) . It enables near-optimal preconditioners for consistent systems and enables flexible GMRES to solve inconsistent systems when coupled with iterative refinement. In this article, we focus on some practical algorithmic and software issues of HIFIR. In particular, we introduce a new inverse-based rook pivoting (IBRP) into ILU, which improves the robustness and the overall efficiency for some ill-conditioned systems by significantly reducing the size of the final Schur complement for some systems. We also describe the software design of HIFIR in terms of its efficient data structures for supporting rook pivoting in a multilevel setting, its template-based generic programming interfaces for mixed-precision real and complex values in C++, and its user-friendly high-level interfaces in MATLAB and Python. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HIFIR for ill-conditioned or singular systems arising from several applications, including the Helmholtz equation, linear elasticity, stationary incompressible Navier–Stokes (INS) equations, and time-dependent advection-diffusion equation.",

    "abstract": "Many numerical methods for evaluating matrix functions can be naturally viewed as computational graphs. Rephrasing these methods as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) is a particularly effective approach to study existing techniques, improve them, and eventually derive new ones. The accuracy of these matrix techniques can be characterized by the accuracy of their scalar counterparts, thus designing algorithms for matrix functions can be regarded as a scalar-valued optimization problem. The derivatives needed during the optimization can be calculated automatically by exploiting the structure of the DAG in a fashion analogous to backpropagation. This article describes GraphMatFun.jl , a Julia package that offers the means to generate and manipulate computational graphs, optimize their coefficients, and generate Julia, MATLAB, and C code to evaluate them efficiently at a matrix argument. The software also provides tools to estimate the accuracy of a graph-based algorithm and thus obtain numerically reliable methods. For the exponential, for example, using a particular form (degree-optimal) of polynomials produces implementations that in many cases are cheaper, in terms of computational cost, than the Padé-based techniques typically used in mathematical software. The optimized graphs and the corresponding generated code are available online.",

Building on the ideas that underpin RSVD, the recently proposed algorithm “randUTV” computes a full factorization of a given matrix that provides low-rank approximations with near-optimal error. Because the bulk of randUTV is cast in terms of communication-efficient operations such as matrix-matrix multiplication and unpivoted QR factorizations, it is faster than competing rank-revealing factorization methods such as column-pivoted QR in most high-performance computational settings. In this article, optimized randUTV implementations are presented for both shared-memory and distributed-memory computing environments. For shared memory, randUTV is redesigned in terms of an algorithm-by-blocks that, together with a runtime task scheduler, eliminates bottlenecks from data synchronization points to achieve acceleration over the standard blocked algorithm based on a purely fork-join approach. The distributed-memory implementation is based on the ScaLAPACK library. The performance of our new codes compares favorably with competing factorizations available on both shared-memory and distributed-memory architectures.",

The data structure is provided as open-source software as part of the TNL library (https://tnl-project.org/). The abstract representation supports almost any cell shape and common 2D quadrilateral, 3D hexahedron and arbitrarily dimensional simplex shapes are currently built into the library. The implementation is highly configurable via templates of the C++ language, which allows avoiding the storage of unnecessary dynamic data. The internal memory layout is based on state-of-the-art sparse matrix storage formats, which are optimized for different hardware architectures in order to provide high-performance computations. The proposed data structure is also suitable for meshes decomposed into several subdomains and distributed computing using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The efficiency of the implemented data structure on CPU and GPU hardware architectures is demonstrated on several benchmark problems and a comparison with another library. Its applicability to advanced numerical methods is demonstrated with an example problem of two-phase flow in porous media using a numerical scheme based on the mixed-hybrid finite element method (MHFEM). We show GPU speed-ups that rise above 20 in 2D and 50 in 3D when compared to sequential CPU computations, and above 2 in 2D and 9 in 3D when compared to 12-threaded CPU computations.",

There is usually a tradeoff between the approximation capabilities of an interpolation scheme and its evaluation efficiency. For many applications, it is important for a user to navigate their data in real time. In practice, evaluation efficiency outweighs any incremental improvements in reconstruction fidelity. We first analyze, from a general standpoint, the use of compact piece-wise polynomial basis functions to efficiently interpolate data that is sampled on a lattice. We then detail our automatic code-generation framework on both CPU and GPU architectures. Specifically, we propose a general framework that can produce a fast evaluation scheme by analyzing the algebro-geometric structure of the convolution sum for a given lattice and basis function combination. We demonstrate the utility and generality of our framework by providing fast implementations of various box splines on the Body Centered and Face Centered Cubic lattices, as well as some non-separable box splines on the Cartesian lattice. We also provide fast implementations for certain Voronoi-splines that have not yet appeared in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate that this framework may also be used for non-Cartesian lattices in 4D.",

Our method uses dedicated arithmetic over a type that encapsulates both the result the user would have had with the original computation and an approximation of its numerical error. We thus can measure the number of significant digits of any result or intermediate result in a simulation.

The first approach is to find an inclusion of the integrand, then integrate this inclusion to obtain an inclusion of the indefinite integral. Inclusions for the integrand may be obtained from Taylor polynomials, Tschebyscheff polynomials, or other approximating forms which have a known error term. The second approach finds an inclusion of the indefinite integral directly as a linear combination of function evaluations plus an interval-valued error term. This requires a self-validating form of a quadrature formula such as Gaussian quadrature. In either approach, composite formulae improve the accuracy of the inclusion. The result of the validated indefinite integration is an algorithm which may be represented as a character string, a subroutine in a high-level programming language such as Pascal-SC or Fortran, or as a collection of data. An example is given showing the application of validated indefinite integration in constructing a validated inclusion of the error function, erf( x ).",

    "abstract": "This article presents an analytical and computational framework for the compression of particle data resulting from hierarchical approximate treecodes such as the Barnes--Hut and Fast Multipole Methods . Due to approximations introduced by hierarchical methods, various parameters (such as position, velocity, acceleration, potential) associated with a particle can be bounded by distortion radii. Using this distortion radii, we develop storage schemes that guarantee error bounds while maximizing compression. Our schemes make extensive use of spatial and temporal coherence of particle behavior and yield compression ratios higher than 12:1 over raw data, and 6:1 over gzipped (LZ) raw data for selected simulation instances. We demonstrate that for uniform distributions with 2M particles, storage requirements can be reduced from 24 MB to about 1.8 MB (about 7 bits per particle per timestep) for storing particle positions. This is significant because it enables faster storage/retrieval, better temporal resolution, and improved analysis. Our results are shown to scale from small systems (2K particles) to much larger systems (over 2M particles). The associated algorithm is asymptotically optimal in computation time ( O ( n )) with a small constant. Our implementations are demonstrated to run extremely fast---much faster than the time it takes to compute a single time-step advance. In addition, our compression framework relies on a natural hierarchical representation upon which other analysis tasks such as segmented and window retrieval can be built.",

Our procedure is combined with existing adaptive cubature algorithms to significantly reduce the necessary number of function evaluations and memory requirements of the integrator. The method is embarrassingly parallel and can be trivially scaled across many cores with virtually no overhead. Our method is particularly pertinent to the integration of Green's functions, a problem directly related to the perturbation theory of impurity models. In three spatial dimensions, we observe a speed-up of order 100 which increases with increasing dimensionality.",

    "abstract": "Data sequences generated by on-line sensors can become arbitrarily large and must, therefore, be pared down to fit into available memory. For situations where only the most recent data is of interest, this problem can be solved with optimal efficiency by a simple circular buffer: it fills each memory location with useful data, and requires just one write to memory per update. The algorithm presented here provides essentially the same efficiency, but while maintaining a continuously updated, fixed-size, compressed representation of the entire data sequence. Each value in these compressed sequences represents a statistic (an average, maximum, random sample, etc.) computed over a contiguous chunk of the original sequence. Compressing circular buffers gain their efficiency by using an alternative indexing sequence, based on well-known principles of elementary number theory, to ensure that each newly written value gets stored in the unoccupied location created when the two oldest sequential over-sampled values are compressed into one. The associated Java implementation supports a variety of aggregating statistics and is used to compare the algorithm's performance with a more obvious approach (doubling).",

    "abstract": "Problem-solving environments (PSEs) offer a powerful yet flexible and convenient means for general experimentation with computational methods, algorithm prototyping, and visualization and manipulation of data. Consequently, PSEs have become the modus operandi of many computational scientists and engineers. However, despite these positive aspects, PSEs typically do not offer the level of granularity required by the specialist or algorithm designer to conveniently modify the details. In other words, the level at which PSEs are black boxes is often still too high for someone interested in modifying an algorithm as opposed to trying an alternative. In this article, we describe odeToJava, a Java-based PSE for initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations. odeToJava implements explicit and linearly implicit implicit-explicit Runge--Kutta methods with error and stepsize control and intra-step interpolation (dense output), giving the user control and flexibility over the implementational aspects of these methods. We illustrate the usage and functionality of odeToJava by means of computational case studies of initial-value problems (IVPs).",

The proposed method allows very fast sampling from a discrete distribution: drawing k samples is up to an order of magnitude faster than binary search from the cumulative distribution function (cdf) or inversion methods used in many libraries. The produced empirical distribution function is evaluated using a modified Cramér-Von Mises goodness-of-fit statistic, showing that the method compares very favorably to multinomial sampling. As continuous distributions can often be approximated with discrete ones, the proposed method can be used as a very general way to efficiently produce random samples for particle filter proposal distributions, for example, for motion models in robotics.",

An option for VTDIRECT95 is to divide the feasible box into subdomains, and concurrently apply the global direct search algorithm DIRECT within each subdomain. When the number of subdomains is greater than one, a bug causes VTDIRECT95 to occasionally sample outside the given feasible box, which is serious if the objective function is not defined outside the given box.

    "abstract": "We consider the algebraic multilevel iteration (AMLI) for the solution of systems of linear equations as they arise form a finite-difference discretization on a rectangular grid. Key operation is the matrix-vector product, which can efficiently be executed on vector and parallel-vector computer architectures if the nonzero entries of the matrix are concentrated in a few diagonals. In order to maintain this structure for all matrices on all levels coarsening in alternating directions is used. In some cases it is necessary to introduce additional dummy grid hyperplanes. The data movements in the restriction and prolongation are crucial, as they produce massive memory conflicts on vector architectures. By using a simple performance model the best of the possible vectorization strategies is automatically selected at runtime. Examples show that on a Fujitsu VPP300 the presented implementation of AMLI reaches about 85% of the useful performance, and scalability with respect to computing time can be achieved.",

In the representation of a tangent vector field, one needs to evaluate the expansion and the Fourier coefficients of vector spherical harmonics. In this article, we develop fast algorithms (FaVeST) for vector spherical harmonic transforms on these evaluations. The forward FaVeST evaluates the Fourier coefficients and has a computational cost proportional to N log √ N for N number of evaluation points. The adjoint FaVeST, which evaluates a linear combination of vector spherical harmonics with a degree up to ⊡ M for M evaluation points, has cost proportional to M log √ M . Numerical examples of simulated tangent fields illustrate the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of FaVeST.",

Anal. 10:413---432, 1973) has proven to be quite valuable in the solution of nonlinear least squares problems in which a substantial number of the parameters are linear. Its advantages are efficiency and, more importantly, a better likelihood of finding a global minimizer rather than a local one. The purpose of our work is to provide a more robust implementation of this algorithm, include constraints on the parameters, more clearly identify key ingredients so that improvements can be made, compute the Jacobian matrix more accurately, and make future implementations in other languages easy.",

This means that 20 MB of data can be tested\nwithin a minute using our new optimized version of the NIST\nSTS. To speed up the Linear Complexity test, we proposed a new\nversion of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm that computes only\nthe linear complexity of a sequence.

In a numerical context, since the solution of the transformed problem consists of a sequence of Laplace Transform samples, most of the software for the numerical inversion cannot be used since the transform, among parameters, must be passed as a function. To fill this gap, we present Talbot Suite DE, a C software collection for Laplace Transform inversions, specifically designed for these problems and based on Talbot’s method . It contains both sequential and parallel implementations; the latter is accomplished by means of OpenMP. We also report some performance results. Aimed at non-expert users, the software is equipped with several examples and a User Guide that includes the external documentation, explains how to use all the sample code, and reports its results about accuracy and efficiency. Some examples are entirely in C and others combine different programming languages (C/MATLAB, C/FORTRAN). The User Guide also contains useful hints to avoid possible errors issued during the compilation or execution of mixed-language code.",

    "abstract": "Sparse symmetric indefinite problems arise in a large number of important application areas; they are often solved through the use of an LDL T factorization via a sparse direct solver. While for many problems prescaling the system matrix A is sufficient to maintain stability of the factorization, for a small but important fraction of problems numerical pivoting is required. Pivoting often incurs a significant overhead, and consequently, a number of techniques have been proposed to try and limit the need for pivoting. In particular, numerically aware ordering algorithms may be used, that is, orderings that depend not only on the sparsity pattern of A but also on the values of its (scaled) entries. Current approaches identify large entries of A and symmetrically permute them onto the subdiagonal, where they can be used as part of a 2 × 2 pivot. This is numerically effective, but the fill in the factor L and hence the runtime of the factorization and subsequent triangular solves may be significantly increased over a standard ordering if no pivoting is required. We present a new algorithm that combines a matching-based approach with a numerically aware nested dissection ordering. Numerical comparisons with current approaches for some tough symmetric indefinite problems are given.",

    "abstract": "Standard discretization techniques for boundary integral equations, e.g., the Galerkin boundary element method, lead to large densely populated matrices that require fast and efficient compression techniques like the fast multipole method or hierarchical matrices. If the underlying mesh is very large, running the corresponding algorithms on a distributed computer is attractive, e.g., since distributed computers frequently are cost-effective and offer a high accumulated memory bandwidth. Compared to the closely related particle methods, for which distributed algorithms are well-established, the Galerkin discretization poses a challenge, since the supports of the basis functions influence the block structure of the matrix and therefore the flow of data in the corresponding algorithms. This article introduces distributed ℋ 2 -matrices, a class of hierarchical matrices that is closely related to fast multipole methods and particularly well-suited for distributed computing. While earlier efforts required the global tree structure of the ℋ 2 -matrix to be stored in every node of the distributed system, the new approach needs only local multilevel information that can be obtained via a simple distributed algorithm, allowing us to scale to significantly larger systems. Experiments show that this approach can handle very large meshes with more than 130 million triangles efficiently.",

    "abstract": "We show how an IEEE-754 conformant precision- p base-β arithmetic can be implemented based on some binary floating-point and/or integer arithmetic. This includes the four basic operations and square root subject to the five IEEE-754 rounding modes, namely the nearest roundings with roundTiesToEven and roundTiesToAway, the directed roundings downwards and upwards, as well as rounding towards zero. Exceptional values like ∞ of NaN are covered according to the IEEE-754 arithmetic standard. The results of the precision- p base-β operations are computed using some underlying precision- q binary arithmetic. We distinguish two cases. When using a precision- q binary integer arithmetic, the base-β precision p is limited for all operations by β 2 p ≤ 2 q , whereas using a precision- q binary floating-point arithmetic imposes stronger limits on the base-β precision, namely β 2 p ≤ 2 q for addition and multiplication, β 2 p ≤ 2 q-1 for division and β 2 p ≤ 2 q -3 for the square root. Those limitations cannot be improved. The algorithms are implemented in a Matlab/Octave flbeta-toolbox with the choice of using uint64 or binary64 as underlying arithmetic. The former allows larger precisions, the latter is advantageous for the square root, whereas computing times are similar. The flbeta-toolbox offers precision- p base-β scalar, vector and matrix operations including sparse matrices as well as corresponding interval operations. The base β can be chosen in the range β ∊ [2,64]. The flbeta-toolbox will be part of Version 13 of INTLAB [ 18 ], the Matlab/Octave toolbox for reliable computing.",

Careful use of low rank approximation can drastically reduce the computation and memory requirements of these operations. In addition to a lower arithmetic complexity, such methods can, by their structure, be designed to efficiently exploit modern hardware architectures. The majority of existing work relies on batched BLAS libraries to handle the computation of many small dense matrices. We show that through careful analysis of the cache utilization, register accumulation using SIMD registers and a redesign of the implementation, one can achieve significantly higher throughput for these types of batched low-rank matrices across a large range of block and batch sizes. We test our algorithm on three CPUs using diverse ISAs – the Fujitsu A64FX using ARM SVE, the Intel Xeon 6148 using AVX-512, and AMD EPYC 7502 using AVX-2, and show that our new batching methodology is able to obtain more than twice the throughput of vendor optimized libraries for all CPU architectures and problem sizes.",

Moreover, GC is asynchronous and does not appear explicitly in the source. This article presents an extension to the model of reverse ST-AD suitable for a language with GC. The approach is validated on a Java implementation of a simple Navier-Stokes solver. Performance is compared with existing AD tools ADOL-C and Tapenade on an equivalent implementation in C and Fortran.",

This article introduces tests for validating Fortran 2008 complex functions—LOG, SQRT, ASIN, ACOS, ATAN, ASINH, ACOSH, and ATANH—on branch cuts with arguments of all 3 IEEE floating-point binary formats: binary32, binary64, and binary128, including signed zero and signed infinity. Multiple test failures were revealed, such as wrong signs of results or unexpected overflow, underflow, or NaN. We conclude that the quality of implementation of these Fortran 2008 intrinsics in many compilers is not yet sufficient to remove the need for special code for branch cuts. The electronic appendix contains the full test results with 8 Fortran 2008 compilers: GCC, Flang, Cray, Oracle, PGI, Intel, NAG, and IBM, detailed derivations of the values of these functions on branch cuts and conformal maps of the branch cuts, to be used as a reference. The tests and the results are freely available from https://cmplx.sourceforge.io.

    "abstract": "A set of Fortran subroutines for reverse mode algorithmic (or automatic) differentiation of the basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS) is presented. This is preceded by a description of the mathematical tools used to obtain the formulae of these derivatives, with emphasis on special matrices supported by the BLAS: triangular, symmetric, and band. All single and double precision BLAS derivatives have been implemented, together with the Cholesky factorization from Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK). The subroutines are written in Fortran 2003 with a Fortran 77 interface to allow use from C and C++, as well as dynamic languages such as R, Python, Matlab, and Octave. The subroutines are all implemented by calling BLAS, thereby attaining fast runtime. Timing results show derivative runtimes that are about twice those of the corresponding BLAS, in line with theory. The emphasis is on reverse mode because it is more important for the main application that we have in mind, numerical optimization. Two examples are presented, one dealing with the least squares modeling of groundwater, and the other dealing with the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of a vector autoregressive time series. The article contains comprehensive tables of formulae for the BLAS derivatives as well as for several non-BLAS matrix operations commonly used in optimization.",

    "abstract": "Inverse iteration is known to be an effective method for computing eigenvectors corresponding to simple and well-separated eigenvalues. In the non-symmetric case, the solution of shifted Hessenberg systems is a central step. Existing inverse iteration solvers approach the solution of the shifted Hessenberg systems with either RQ or LU factorizations and, once factored, solve the corresponding systems. This approach has limited level-3 BLAS potential since distinct shifts have distinct factorizations. This paper rearranges the RQ approach such that data shared between distinct shifts can be exploited. Thereby the backward substitution with the triangular R factor can be expressed mostly with matrix–matrix multiplications (level-3 BLAS). The resulting algorithm computes eigenvectors in a tiled, overflow-free, and task-parallel fashion. The numerical experiments show that the new algorithm outperforms existing inverse iteration solvers for the computation of both real and complex eigenvectors.",

WR allows independent time-discretizations on independent and adaptive time-grids, while maintaining high time-integration orders. Classical WR methods such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel WR are typically either parallel or converge quickly. We present a novel parallel WR method utilizing asynchronous communication techniques to get both properties. Classical WR methods exchange discrete functions after time-integration of a subproblem. We instead asynchronously exchange time-point solutions during time-integration and directly incorporate all new information in the interpolants. We show both continuous and time-discrete convergence in a framework that generalizes existing linear WR convergence theory. An algorithm for choosing optimal relaxation in our new WR method is presented. Convergence is demonstrated in two conjugate heat transfer examples. Our new method shows an improved performance over classical WR methods. In one example, we show a partitioned coupling of the compressible Euler equations with a nonlinear heat equation, with subproblems implemented using the open source libraries DUNE and FEniCS .",

Both current commercial and public-domain software only work on either unicore architectures or shared-memory architectures, which are limited in the number of cores/processors employed in the computation. Our implementations focus on distributed-memory architectures, thus being able to employ hundreds or even thousands of cores in the computation of the minimum distance.

In this article, we fix the errors and present a new approach, which includes a new algorithm, allowing computations to run 1.3 to 4.5 times faster when n grows from 10 to 100,000.",

A production-ready implementation is provided in the Ginkgo numerical linear algebra library. In this report, the Ginkgo library is reinstalled and performance results are generated to perform a comparison to the original results when using Ginkgo’s Conjugate Gradient solver with either the full or the adaptive precision block-Jacobi preconditioner for a suite of test problems on an NVIDIA GPU accelerator. After completing this process, the published results are deemed reproducible.",

The result of the addition is then enclosed by circles in current methods, but under certain circumstances this turns out to be an overestimate. The focus of this article is the diagnosis and treatment of such cases.",

One hope for reducing the cost of this is to make do with iteration matrices that are known to have errors and to do no more iterations than are necessary to maintain the stability of the method. This paper, following work by Klopfenstein, examines the effect of errors in the iteration matrix on the stability of the method. Application of the results to an algorithm is discussed briefly.",
