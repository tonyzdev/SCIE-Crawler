    "abstract": "The paper reflects the message of the WHO Policy Framework on Active Ageing. The Policy Framework is intended to inform discussion and the formation of action plans that promote healthy and active ageing. It was developed by WHO's Ageing and Life Course Programme as a contribution to the Second United Nations World Assembly on Ageing held in April 2002. The paper presents the challenge of rapid ageing population, especially in developing countries. And it discusses the concept and the rational of the active ageing. Policy Responses to this challenge are identify in the final part of the paper.",

    "abstract": "The role of estrogens in male physiology has become more evident, as a consequence of the discovery of human models of estrogen deficiency such as estrogen resistance or aromatase deficiency. In males, testosterone is the major source of plasma estradiol, the main biologically active estrogen, only 20% of which is secreted by the testes. Plasma estrone, 5% of which is converted to plasma estradiol, originates from tissue aromatization of, mainly adrenal, androstenedione. The plasma concentration of estradiol in males is 2-3 ng/dl and its production rate in blood is 25-40 micrograms/24 h; both of these values are significantly higher than in postmenopausal women. Plasma levels of estradiol do not necessarily reflect tissue-level activity as peripherally formed estradiol is partially metabolized in situ; thus, not all enters the general circulation, with a fraction remaining only locally active. Of the factors influencing plasma estradiol levels, plasma testosterone is a major determinant. However, the age-associated decrease in testosterone levels is scarcely reflected in plasma estradiol levels, as a result of increasing aromatase activity with age and the age-associated increase in fat mass. Free and bioavailable estradiol levels do decrease modestly with age as does the ratio of free testosterone to free estradiol, the latter testifying to the age-associated increased aromatization of testosterone. Estradiol levels are highly significantly positively related to body fat mass and more specifically to subcutaneous abdominal fat, but not to visceral (omental) fat. Indeed, aromatase activity in omental fat is only one-tenth of the activity in gluteal fat. Estrogens in males play an important role in the regulation of the gonadotropin feedback, several brain functions, bone maturation, regulation of bone resorption and in lipid metabolism. Moreover, they affect skin metabolism and are an important factor determining sex interest in man.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging disease that was first reported in Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. Risk factors for mortality have not been well summarized. Current meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between age, gender, comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19 infection.Online databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 May 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, random-effects model was used. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also done.In total, 14 studies with 29,909 COVID-19 infected patients and 1445 cases of death were included in the current meta-analysis. Significant associations were found between older age (≥65 vs <65 years old) (pooled ORs = 4.59, 95%CIs = 2.61-8.04, p < .001), gender (male vs female) (pooled ORs = 1.50, 95%CIs = 1.06-2.12, p = .021) and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. In addition, hypertension (pooled ORs = 2.70, 95%CIs = 1.40-5.24, p = .003), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (pooled ORs = 3.72, 95%CIs = 1.77-7.83, p = .001), diabetes (pooled ORs = 2.41, 95%CIs = 1.05-5.51, p = .037), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (pooled ORs = 3.53, 95%CIs = 1.79-6.96, p < .001) and cancer (pooled ORs = 3.04, 95%CIs = 1.80-5.14, p < .001), were associated with higher risk of mortality.Older age (≥65 years old), male gender, hypertension, CVDs, diabetes, COPD and malignancies were associated with greater risk of death from COVID-19 infection. These findings could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone is the predominant gonadal androgen in men. Low testosterone levels are found to be associated with an increased in metabolic risk and systematic inflammation. Since adipose tissue is a source of inflammatory cytokines, testosterone may regulate inflammation by acting on adipose tissue. This review aimed to explore the role of testosterone in inflammation and its mechanism of action. Both animal studies and human studies showed that (1) testosterone deficiency was associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines; (2) testosterone substitution reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines. The suppression of inflammation by testosterone were observed in patients with coronary artery disease, prostate cancer and diabetes mellitus through the increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and the decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α). Despite these, some studies also reported a non-significant relationship. In conclusion, testosterone may possess anti-inflammatory properties but its magnitude is debatable. More evidence is needed to validate the use of testosterone as a marker and in the management of chronic inflammatory diseases.",

Diabetic subjects divided into two groups according to the level of HbA1c: well-controlled T2DM group (HbA1c < 7%) and poorly controlled T2DM group (HbA1c ≥ 7%). Third group was consisted of healthy subjects without any chronic diseases. UHR levels of the groups were compared.The UHR levels of well and poorly controlled diabetics and control subjects were 12%±5%, 17%±6% and 9%±3%, respectively (p<.001). The UHR was significantly and inversely correlated with GFR and was significantly and positively correlated with waist circumference, body weight, body mass index, serum creatinine, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c levels.UHR could serve as a promising predictor of diabetic control in men with T2DM, since it has significant association with HbA1c and FPG levels.",

Forty-eight middle-aged men, with type 2 diabetes, (visceral) obesity and symptoms of androgen deficiency, were included in this open-label study. Twenty-four subjects received testosterone undecanoate (TU; 120 mg daily, for 3 months); 24 subjects received no treatment. Body composition was analyzed by bio-impedance. Parameters of metabolic control were determined. Symptoms of androgen deficiency and erectile dysfunction were scored by self-administered questionnaires. TU had a positive effect on (visceral) obesity: statistically significant reduction in body weight (2.66%), waist-hip ratio (-3.96%) and body fat (-5.65%); negligible changes were found in the control group. TU significantly improved metabolic control: decrease in blood glucose values and mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (from 10.4 to 8.6%). TU treatment significantly improved symptoms of androgen deficiency (including erectile dysfunction), with virtually no change in the control group. There were no adverse effects on blood pressure or hematological, biochemical and lipid parameters, and no adverse events. Oral TU treatment of type 2 diabetic men with androgen deficiency improves glucose homeostasis and body composition (decrease in visceral obesity), and improves symptoms of androgen deficiency (including erectile dysfunction). In these men, the benefit of testosterone supplementation therapy exceeds the correction of symptoms of androgen deficiency and also includes glucose homeostasis and metabolic control.",

Factor analysis was used to establish the raw scale and to identify the dimensions of the scale. This raw scale was applied to a large representative population sample of 992 German males, to establish reference values for the severity of symptoms in males over 40 years.Three dimensions of symptoms were identified in the patient group: a psychological, a somatovegetative and a sexual factor, that explained 51.6% of the total variance. Reference values of the three dimensions were defined to be used in daily practice. The severity of symptoms assessed using the AMS scale was found to be related to the clinically defined 'male climacteric' in the patient group.The AMS scale is a new and valuable tool for assessing aging males' symptomsc and can be easily used in practice.",

    "abstract": "'Classical' genomic progesterone receptors appear relatively late in phylogenesis, i.e. it is only in birds and mammals that they are detectable. In the different species, they mediate manifold effects regarding the differentiation of target organ functions, mainly in the reproductive system. Surprisingly, we know little about the physiology, endocrinology, and pharmacology of progesterone and progestins in male gender or men respectively, despite the fact that, as to progesterone secretion and serum progesterone levels, there are no great quantitative differences between men and women (at least outside the luteal phase). In a prospective cohort study of 1026 men with and without cardiovascular disease, we were not able to demonstrate any age-dependent change in serum progesterone concentrations. Progesterone influences spermiogenesis, sperm capacitation/acrosome reaction and testosterone biosynthesis in the Leydig cells. Other progesterone effects in men include those on the central nervous system (CNS) (mainly mediated by 5α-reduced progesterone metabolites as so-called neurosteroids), including blocking of gonadotropin secretion, sleep improvement, and effects on tumors in the CNS (meningioma, fibroma), as well as effects on the immune system, cardiovascular system, kidney function, adipose tissue, behavior, and respiratory system. A progestin may stimulate weight gain and appetite in men as well as in women. The detection of progesterone receptor isoforms would have a highly diagnostic value in prostate pathology (benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer). The modulation of progesterone effects on typical male targets is connected with a great pharmacodynamic variability. The reason for this is that, in men, some important effects of progesterone are mediated non-genomically through different molecular biological modes of action. Therefore, the precise therapeutic manipulation of progesterone actions in the male requires completely new endocrine-pharmacological approaches.",

    "abstract": "Background: The associations between serum vitamin D (VD), serum testosterone (TT) and metabolic syndrome are complex and with limited published research, particularly on the effects of VD treatment on sexual hormones, erectile function and the metabolic syndrome.Objectives: This study assessed whether a monthly high dose VD treatment for 12 months in VD deficient middle-aged men was associated with: changes in levels of sexual hormones, improvement of diabetes control and metabolic syndrome components, better erectile function [International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 questionnaire]; and changes in a prostate marker.Materials and methods: Descriptive research of a prospective study, conducted between October 2014 and September 2015, 102 male patients ≥35 [(±SD: 53.2 ± 10.5), (range 35–64)] years with deficient serum VD level (<30 ng/mL) were included in the study. Participants were followed up for one year, with monitoring at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months. At the initial baseline visit, a complete medical examination was conducted, and blood was drawn for laboratory tests for above biochemical and hormonal variables under examination. Participants received an initial VD (Ergocalciferol; oral solution 600 000 IU/1.5 ml), and followed a VD treatment regime thereafter. At the four follow up visits (3, 6, 9 and 12 months), blood was collected, and patients' erectile function was evaluated by IIEF-5 questionnaire.Main outcome measures: During the follow up visits, all the biochemical and hormonal (TT, estradiol and luteinizing hormones, HbA1c, serum lipids profile) were assessed, and patients' erectile function was evaluated by IIEF-5 questionnaire.Results: Patients' mean age was 53.2 ± 10.4 years. Serum VD exhibited significant increments (p <0.001) from baseline (15.16 ± 4.64 ng/mL), to 3 (31.90 ± 15.99 ng/mL), 6 (37.23 ± 12.42 ng/mL), 9 (44.88 ± 14.49 ng/mL) and 12 months (48.54 ± 11.62 ng/mL), and there was significant stepladder increases in both serum TT level (12.46 ± 3.30 to 15.99 ± 1.84 nmol/L) and erectile function scores (13.88 ± 3.96 to 20.25 ± 3.24) (p <0.001 for both). We also observed significant stepladder decreases in estradiol (87.90 ± 27.16 to 69.85 ± 14.80 pmol/L, p = 0.001), PTH (from 58.52 ± 28.99 to 38.33 ± 19.44 pg/mL, p <0.001) and HbA1c levels (7.41 ± 2.85 to 6.66 ± 1.67%, p = 0.001). Mean BMI significantly decreased from 33.91 ± 6.67 to 33.14 ± 6.35 kg/m2 (p = 0.001); and PSA values significantly increased from 0.59 ± 0.30 to 0.82 ± 0.39 ng/mL (p <0.001) at the end of the 12 months' follow-up. There were no changes in LH levels.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that VD treatment improves testosterone levels, metabolic syndrome and erectile function in middle-aged men.

Median red cell distribution width (RDW) (p = .04), mean RDW to platelet ratio (RPR) (p = .006), median mean platelet volume to platelet ratio (MPR) (p = .02) levels of the study groups were statistically different. HbA1c level was significantly and positively correlated with RDW (r = 0.45, p < .001), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (r = 0.47, p < .001), mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) (r = 0.35, p < .001), MPR (r = 0.26, p = .003), and RPR (r = 0.37, p < .001) levels.Elevated RDW, NLR, MLR, MPR, and RPR levels in diabetic men should trigger the measurement of HbA1c since each were strongly correlated with HbA1c level. Moreover, elevated RDW, NLR, MLR, and RPR could be marker of worse diabetic control in men with T2DM.",

    "abstract": "Adverse-outcomes related to sarcopenia are mostly mentioned as physical disability. As the other skeletal muscles, respiratory muscles may also be affected by sarcopenia. Respiratory muscle strength is known to affect pulmonary functions. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relations between extremity muscle strength, respiratory muscle strengths and spirometric measures in a group of male nursing home residents. Among a total of 104 male residents, residents with obstructive measures were excluded and final study population was composed of 62 residents. Mean age was 70.5 ± 6.7 years, body mass index: 27.7 ± 5.3 kg/m2 and dominant hand grip strength: 29.7 ± 6.5 kg. Hand grip strength was positively correlated with maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) (r = 0.35, p < 0.01 and r = 0.26, p < 0.05, respectively). In regression analysis, the only factor related to MIP was hand grip strength; among spirometric measures only parameter significantly related to grip strength was peak cough flow (PCF). The association of PCF with grip strength disappeared when MIP alone or \"MIP and MEP\" were included in the regression analysis. In the latter case, PCF was significantly associated only with MIP. We found peripheric muscle strength be associated with MIP and PCF but not with MEP or any other spirometric parameters. The relation between peripheral muscle strength and PCF was mediated by MIP. Our findings suggest that sarcopenia may affect inspiratory muscle strength earlier or more than the expiratory muscle strength. Sarcopenia may cause decrease in PCF in the elderly, which may stand for some common adverse respiratory complications.",

Prior to interruption, TRT resulted in improvements in residual voiding volume, bladder wall thickness, CRP, AMS, IIEF-EF, IPSS and obesity parameters while PSA and prostate volume increased. TRT interruption reduced total testosterone to hypogonadal levels in Group A and resulted in worsening of obesity parameters, AMS, IPSS, residual voiding volume and bladder wall thickness, IIEF-EF and PSA while CRP and prostate volume were unchanged until treatment resumed whereby these effects were reversed. TRT interruption results in worsening of symptoms. Hypogonadism may require lifelong TRT.",

According to their MetS status and BMI, the included participants were allocated into six mutually exclusive groups: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHN)/overweight (MHOW)/obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUN)/overweight (MUOW)/obesity (MUO). To explore the association between MetS-BMI phenotypes and the risk of kidney stones, binary logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios (ORs).A total of 13,589 participants were included. It was revealed that all the phenotypes with obesity displayed higher risks of kidney stones (OR = 1.38, p < 0.01 for MHO & OR = 1.80, p < 0.001 for MUO, in the fully adjusted model). The risk increased significantly when metabolic dysfunction coexisted with overweight and obesity (OR = 1.39, p < 0.05 for MUOW & OR = 1.80, p < 0.001 for MUO, in the fully adjusted model). Of note, the ORs for the MUO and MUOW groups were higher than those for the MHO and MHOW groups, respectively.Obesity and unhealthy metabolic status can jointly increase the risk of kidney stones.

Additionally, there is a scarcity of studies that have systematically investigated the reliable risk factor patterns associated with the development of BPH/LUTS among the Chinese population. The study was in both cross-sectional and prospective cohort study design. The participants were derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). National prevalence and incidence of BPH/LUTS, average onset age of BPH/LUTS, medication rate of BPH/LUTS, and validated risk factors pattern of BPH/LUTS in the Chinese population were investigated. The overall prevalence and annual incidence of BPH/LUTS were 11.10% and 2.23%. In China, the male population affected by BPH/LUTS typically presented at an average age of 55-65 years. However, the medication rate was merely more than 30%. After conducting univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis in both cross-sectional and prospective cohort study designs, we observed that dyslipidemia was the most stable risk factor of BPH/LUTS occurrence in three adjusted models (OR [95% CI]: 2.41 [1.37-4.25]; 2.05 [1.10-3.81] and 2.40 [1.19-4.84], respectively). This is the first study to delineate the prevalence and incidence of BPH/LUTS in Chinese, at the national level. The study reminded us that it was dyslipidemia rather than other chronic diseases or bad habits that posed a detrimental influence on BPH/LUTS occurrence in Chinese.

    "abstract": "AbstractThe male aging process brings about declines in hormonal function including a gradual decline in bioavailable testosterone levels. Animal studies suggest that testosterone modulates cognitive function through enhancing acetylcholine release and up-modulation of nicotinic receptors. Tau protein deposition is also affected by androgen supplementation in animals. We hypothesize that testosterone replacement in elderly hypogonadal males may improve cognition, in particular the visual-spatial domain. Thirty-six male patients with a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had their total and bioavailable testosterone levels measured. None of the patients had been on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Ten of the 36 patients (28%) were deemed biochemically hypogonadal (total testosterone < 240 ng/dl or 7 nmol/l). Five of the hypogonadal patients were randomized to testosterone and five to placebo. Initial Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAScog) and Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) ranged from 31 to 19 and from 17 to 22, respectively. The clock drawing test (CDT) and the pentagon-tracing portion of the MMSE were used as measures of visual-spatial abilities. Normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were essential before treatment with intramuscular testosterone, 200 mg every 2 weeks. Measurement of testosterone, complete blood count, lipids, PSA and neuropsychological cognitive tests were repeated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of treatment. In the testosterone-treated group, levels of total testosterone increased from a mean of 126.4 ng/dl to 341 ng/dl or 3.6 nmol/l to 9.7 nmol/l (p = 0.11). Bioavailable testosterone also increased from a mean of 48.7 ng/dl to 142 ng/dl or 1.39 nmol/l to 4.05 nmol/l (p = 0.10). PSA levels were also elevated from a mean of 0.98 to 1.37 ng/ml (p = 0.07). ADAScog improved from a mean of 25 to 16.3 (p = 0.02); MMSE improved from a mean of 19.4 to 23.2 (p = 0.02), CDT also improved from 2.2 to 3.2 (p = 0.07). One patient stopped treatment because of hypersexual behavior. The placebo-treated group deteriorated gradually. This small pilot study performed in aging male patients suggests that testosterone could indeed improve cognition, including visual-spatial skills in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.KeywordsALZHEIMER'S TESTOSTERONE MEMORY",

The BsmI and FokI polymorphisms were described in relation to obesity and type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to find whether there are associations between BsmI and FokI polymorphisms and anthropometric (BMI, WHR, BP) and biochemical parameters describing metabolic syndrome.Studied were 176 randomly selected men aged 25-65 years (mean: 51.99 years) with a mean BMI of 28.06 kg/m(2). Two polymorphisms of the VDR gene (FokI and BsmI) were explored using the PCR-RFLP method. Serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and TG were measured using commercially available kits.It was found that BB carriers tend to have higher BMI (29.00 +/- 3.74 versus 26.81 +/- 3.76, p = 0.024) and waist circumference (101.79 +/- 10.59 versus 96.23 +/- 10.35, p = 0.014) compared with the bb genotypes.

At baseline, overall patients had mild osteopenia (lumbar BMD= 0.891 ± 0.097 g/cm(2); femoral BMD= 0.847 ± 0.117 g/cm(2)). TU induced a significant improvement of bone mass after 36 months (lumbar BMD=1.053 ± 0.145 g/cm(2); p < 0.002; femoral BMD=0.989 ± 0.109; p < 0.003 g/cm(2)) with a 5%/year increase and a significant reduction in hs-CRP without changes in body mass index. A direct relationship between serum T and BMD increments at the lumbar (r(2) = 0.66, p < 0.0001) and femoral (r(2) =0.52, p < 0.0001) sites was demonstrated. Study adherence was 50% without serious side effects. Long-term TRT in middle-aged men with LOH and MS determines a significant increase in both vertebral and femoral BMD related to increased serum T levels, probably independently from estradiol modifications.",

Recently, a close association between MetS, erectile dysfunction (ED) and male hypogonadism has been reported. In patients with MetS, hypogonadism can exacerbate sexual dysfunction and arteriogenic ED because of its typical symptoms, such as decreased sexual desire and mood disturbances. On the other hand, hypogonadism per se has been associated with an increased risk of CV and overall mortality. Obesity and in particular central obesity is nowadays considered the most important determinant of MetS-induced hypogonadism whereas hypertension and diabetes play a major role in ED associated with MetS. This review analyses the current literature regarding the relationship between ED, MetS and hypogonadism emphasising the epidemiological and psychopathological aspects and stressing the concept that ED subjects are 'lucky', because ED offers a unique chance to undergo medical examination and therefore to improve not only their sexual but, most importantly, their overall health.",

The authors investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI), age and oxidative stress on 2190 subjects undergoing a health care examination. Total antioxidant status (TAS), total peroxides (TOC) and autoantibodies against oxidized LDL (oLAb) were used as oxidative stress biomarkers in addition to serum lipoproteins, bilirubin and uric acid. Gender-specific differences were observed for age, BMI, serum concentrations of bilirubin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), uric acid and TAS, all of which were higher in males (p < 0.001), while high-density lipoprotein (HDL), HDL/LDL ratio and TOC were higher in females (p < 0.001). Total cholesterol (p < 0.05) and LDL were increased (p < 0.05), while HDL was decreased (p < 0.05) in overweight and obese subjects. This was accompanied by increased uric acid and TAS concentrations. Lowest oLAb titers were detected in obese subjects. In extremely obese subjects, increased TOC and decreased TAS were observed in spite of high uric acid levels. These results demonstrate that oxidative stress increases with increasing BMI and age, as a sequel to an impaired antioxidant status, the consumption of oLAbs, an increase of peroxides and uric acid and a disadvantaged lipid profile.",

However, the prevalence and incidence of testosterone deficiency (TD) in association with its risk has not been assessed systematically to date.Methods. Data from the prospective population-based Study of Health in Pomerania were used. From the 2117 men aged 20–79 years at baseline, 1490 men with complete TT data were analysed. Crude and age-specific prevalence and incidence rates of TD were estimated by TT levels below the age-specific 10th percentile. Analysis of covariance and Poisson regression models were used to assess the association of socio-demographic characteristics, health-related lifestyle, as well as somatometric, medical and laboratory measures with risk of incident TD.Results. TD baseline prevalence was 10.4% (N = 155) and incidence 11.7 per 1000 person-years. TT levels showed a significant age-related decline with an unadjusted rate of 0.05 nmol/l per year. Obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and dyslipidaemia were identified as risk factors of incident TD. Subpopulations of men without the revealed risk factors at both examinations maintained constant TT levels over time.Conclusions. Besides aging alone, lifestyle and different comorbidities were associated with TT level decline, suggesting that the age-related TT decline may be at least partly prevented through the management of potentially modifiable risk factors and health related behaviour.",

The diagnoses of diabetes mellitus and hypertension were obtained from the patient's medical history. Data on blood pressure, waist measure, body height and weight were collected and body mass index were calculated. Patients were assessed based on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) for ED and IPSS and IPSS-Quality of Life for LUTS. Blood samples were drawn from fasting patients to determine, fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and serum total testosterone levels.In severe LUTS patient group, IIEF erectile function domain scores were significantly lower than moderate LUTS patient group (p < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that presence of ED was the most predictor of severe LUTS. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in patients with severe LUTS (26%vs. 46%, p = 0.009). The severe form of the LUTS was significantly correlated with waist circumference >102 cm (p < 0.05), blood pressure > or =130/85 mmHg (p < 0.05) and FBG >110 mg/dl (p < 0.01).Obesity, high plasma level of FBG and hypertension constitute risk factors for the development of severe LUTS. Metabolic syndrome may play a key role in the pathogenesis in both ED and LUTS. Presence of ED is the most predictor of severe LUTS.",

Studies on the association of sarcopenia with functional status revealed conflicting results whereas its association with nutritional status is well documented. We aimed at investigating the prevalence of sarcopenia and its association with functional and nutritional status among male residents in a nursing home in Turkey. Fat free mass (FFM) was detected by bioelectric impedance analysis. Functional status was evaluated with Katz activities of daily living (ADL) and Lawton Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Nutritional assessment was performed by Mini Nutritional Assessment Test (MNA(R)). One hundred fifty-seven male residents composed the study cohort. Mean age was 73.1 +/- 6.7 years. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 85.4%. No significant correlation was found between sarcopenia and ADL or IADL. There was a weak but significant correlation between IADL score and FFM (r = 0.18; p = 0.02). Sarcopenic residents had lower MNA score than non-sarcopenic residents (18.1 +/- 3.2 vs. 21.8 +/- 0.8, p = 0.02). FFM was significantly lower in the residents with malnutrition compared to well-nourished residents (26.8 +/- 1 kg/body surface area vs. 28.1 +/- 1.8 kg/body surface area, p < 0.05). In conclusion, the prevalence of sarcopenia was very high among male nursing home residents in Turkey. Sarcopenia was associated with low nutritional status but not with functional status.",

The objective of this investigation was to study the relationship of components of transforming growth factor-B (TGF-β)/phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transduction pathway with clinical-pathological markers. By immunohistochemical methods, we determined the expression of several factors [TGF-β, Transforming Growth Factor B Receptor I (TGFBRI), TGFBRII, PI3K, AKT-Ser, AKT-Thr, mTOR, p-mTOR, inhibitor kB kinase (IKK), pIKK, inhibitor kB (IkB), pIkB, NF-kBp50, and NF-kBp65]. To know their relationship with established classical markers (Preoperative serum prostate specific antigen, pathological tumor stage, clinical tumor stage, Gleason score, perineural invasion, node involvement, positive surgical margins, biochemical progression, and survival) and their importance in the prognosis of biochemical progression, Spearman test, survival analysis, Log-rang test, Kaplan-Meier curves, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional Hazard regression analyses were performed. Spearman analysis showed that there was at least one correlation between TGF-β, TGFBRI, PI3K, pAKT-Thr, p-mTOR, NF-kBp50, and classical markers. Cox multivariate analysis between the prognostic variables (pathological tumor stage, Gleason score, and node involvement) and inmunohistochemical parameters confirmed TGFBR1 and PI3K as a prognostic and independent marker of biochemical progression in prostate cancer. Our results suggest that TGFBR1 and PI3K could be used as useful biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognoses for biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.",

We aimed to report the prevalence of European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) defined sarcopenia and its individual components in community dwelling outpatient older adults and study the correlations of EWGSOP defined sarcopenia, muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance with functional status.The subjects were prospectively recruited from the geriatrics outpatient clinics of our university hospital. Body composition was assessed with bioimpedance analysis. Muscle strength was assessed by measurement of hand grip strength with hydraulic hand dynamometer, physical performance was assessed by 4 meter usual gait speed (UGS). Impaired muscle function was defined as presence of low muscle strength and or slow gait speed. As a measure of functionality, modified version of Katz activities of daily living (ADL) and Lawton instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were assessed.A total of 242 community dwelling outpatients with mean age of 79.4 ± 5.7 years were enrolled. 31.8% were male. Prevalence of low muscle mass was 2.1% and impaired muscle function was 71.1%. Prevalence of EWGSOP defined sarcopenia was 0.8% (1.3% in men and 0.6% in women). Most correlated parameter with ADL and IADL was the usual gait speed (r = 0.49, r = 0.63; p < .001, respectively). Grip strength was also correlated with ADL and IADL (r = 0.28, r = 0.35; p < .001). However, the skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) was not correlated with ADL, IADL (p = .22, p = .22, respectively). In regression analysis, both ADL score and IADL scores were most related to UGS (beta = 0.5 and 0.6, p < .001), age (beta = -0.25 and -0.2, p < .001) and then sarcopenia (beta = 0.1 and 0.1, p < .05) but was not related to hand grip strength or SMMI.The prevalence of sarcopenia was low as 0.8% albeit the presence of impaired muscle function in more than 2/3 of the cases. We have found that EWGSOP defined sarcopenia had association with ADL and IADL. The gait speed component of sarcopenia had the strongest associations with functional measures but SMMI component did not have any relation. We suggest that although low muscle mass may be a parameter related to worse functionality, it should not be regarded prerequisite for presence of sarcopenia analogous to low bone mineral density for osteoporosis.",

This theory however, ignored the effects testosterone variations within a physiologic range could have on early tumour events and since the early 2000s, clinical evidence discounting testosterone as a linear mechanistic cause of prostate cancer growth mounted, with alternative mechanistic hypotheses such as the saturation model being proposed. Together with a growing understanding of the negative health effects and decreased quality of life in men with testosterone deficiency or hypogonadism, a paradigm shift away from testosterone as a prostate cancer inducer occurred allowing clinicians to use testosterone therapy as potential treatment for men with difficult and symptomatic hypogonadism that had been previously treated for prostate cancer. In this review we contextualise the idea of testosterone as a risk factor for prostate cancer inducement and compile the most current literature with regards to the influence of testosterone and testosterone therapy in prostate cancer.",

Four hundred and twelve patients underwent TTh, 393 patients served as controls, with an observation period up to 12 years.Results: TTh led to substantial and sustained reduction of ED; improvement in erectile function was significant for each successive year until year 9. This was accompanied by improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and urinary function throughout the 12-year follow-up period. Benefits of TTh were stronger for patients with moderate/severe ED than for patients with no/minor ED. Incidence of prostate cancer, major adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality were significantly lower in men on TTh compared with untreated men.Conclusion: Long-term TTh for up to 12 years alleviates ED, improves cardiometabolic risk factors, and reduces prostate cancer.

    "abstract": "Purpose: COVID-19, a novel infection, presented with several complications, including socioeconomical and reproductive health challenges such as erectile dysfunction (ED). The present review summarizes the available shreds of evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on ED.Materials and methods: All published peer-reviewed articles from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to date, relating to ED, were reviewed. Results: Available pieces of evidence that ED is a consequence of COVID-19 are convincing. COVID-19 and ED share common risk factors such as disruption of vascular integrity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cytokine storm, diabetes, obesity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). COVID-19 also induces impaired pulmonary haemodynamics, increased ang II, testicular damage and low serum testosterone, and reduced arginine-dependent NO bioavailability that promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endothelial dysfunction, resulting in ED. In addition, COVID-19 triggers psychological/mental stress and suppresses testosterone-dependent dopamine concentration, which contributes to incident ED.Conclusions: In conclusion, COVID-19 exerts a detrimental effect on male reproductive function, including erectile function. This involves a cascade of events from multiple pathways. As the pandemic dwindles, identifying the long-term effects of COVID-19-induced ED, and proffering adequate and effective measures in militating against COVID-19-induced ED remains pertinent.",

We test eight putative correlations across age.Method: Correlations were tested on a large sample of British men.Results: Seven of eight correlations replicated. Most change across men's life courses. The diurnal cycle of T is considerably weaker among older than younger men. Single men have higher T than married men of the same age; however, this difference lessens as men get older. Elevated T among smokers is less pronounced as men age. The inverse relationship between obesity and T is sustained across the adult age range. The lessening of T with age is well established, however there is disagreement about the course of decline. We find T having a steep decline around age 30, with possibly a rebound around age 50, after which levels remain roughly constant. Correlations involving health become stronger among older men. After age 30 or 40, the inverse relationships between T and HbA1c, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome all become increasingly significant, though not necessarily strong in magnitude.Conclusion: Most putative correlates of T are replicated. There is a basis here for the generalization that among older men, those healthy have higher T than those who are not, but not a lot higher.",

Therefore, this study focused on the role and associated molecular mechanism of zinc in HAART-induced sexual and erectile dysfunction.Materials and methods Twenty male Wistar rats were randomly grouped into four (n = 5 rats per group); the control, zinc-treated, HAART-treated, and HAART + zinc-treated groups. Treatments were per os daily for eight weeks.Results Zinc co-administration significantly improved HAART-induced increase in the latencies of mount, intromission, and ejaculations. Zinc also attenuated HAART-induced reduction in the motivation to mate, penile reflex/erection, and frequencies of mount, intromission, and ejaculations. In addition, zinc co-treatment improved HAART-induced decline in penile NO and cGMP, dopamine, and serum testosterone. More so, zinc prevented HAART-induced rise in penile activities of monoamine oxidase, acetylcholinesterase, phosphodiesterase-5, and arginase. Furthermore, concomitant treatment with zinc ameliorated HAART-induced penile oxidative stress and inflammation.Conclusion In conclusion, our present findings show that zinc improves sexual and erectile function in HAART-treated rats by upregulating erectogenic enzymes via the maintenance of penile redox balance.",

    "abstract": "Penile erection (PE) is a hemodynamic event that results from a neuroendocrine process, and it is influenced by the cardiovascular status of the patient. However, it may also modulate an individual's cardiovascular events. The present study provides the mechanisms involved in the association of PE and cardiovascular function. Erection upsurges the cardiac rate, blood pressure, and oxygen uptake. Sex-enhancing strategies, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, alprostadil, and testosterone also promote vasodilatation and cardiac performance, thus preventing myocardial infarction. More so, drugs that are used in the treatment of hypertensive heart diseases (such as angiotensin system inhibitors and β-blockers) facilitate vasodilatation and PE. These associations have been linked with nitric oxide- and testosterone-dependent enhancing effects on the vascular endothelium. In addition, impaired cardiovascular function may negatively impact PE; therefore, impaired PE may be a pointer to cardiovascular pathology. Hence, evaluation of the cardiovascular status of an individual with erectile dysfunction (ED) is essential. Also, employing strategies that are used in maintaining optimal cardiac function may be useful in the management of ED.",

Seven randomized controlled trials with 660 patients were analyzed. The results indicated that compared with the control group, IIEF score of patients in the PRP group improved significantly at 12-week (p = 0.03) and 24-week (p = 0.0004), while there was no significant difference at 4-week.

Subgroup analysis revealed that adding PRP regimen can considerably improve IIEF scores of ED patients compared to using Li-SWT alone (p < 0.0001). PRP demonstrated a better efficacy in treating ED, especially during a follow-up period of 6 months. Compared with using Li-SWT alone, the addition of PRP can considerably improve the IIEF score of ED patients. These findings still required large-scale clinical trials for verification.",

However, most research on male infertility has primarily focused on the testis, often ignoring the critical role of the prostate. As the largest male reproductive gland, the prostate plays a vital role in semen quality. Prostatic fluid, a major component of semen, significantly influences sperm function and overall male fertility. Prostatitis, the most common prostate disorder among men, particularly with advancing age, can severely impair reproductive health. This article aims to explore the fundamental physiological functions of the prostate, the etiology of prostatitis, and its impact on sperm health.

    "abstract": "Although Asian people have the lowest incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer in the world, these rates have risen rapidly in the past two decades in most Asian countries. Prostate cancer has become one of the leading male cancers in some Asian countries. In 2000, the age-adjusted incidence was over 10 per 100 000 men in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Israel. Although some of the increases may result from enhanced detection, much of the increased incidence may be associated with westernization of the lifestyle, with increasing obesity and increased consumption of fat. The differences in incidences between native Americans and Asian immigrants are getting smaller, reflecting a possible improvement of diagnostic efforts and changes of environmental risk factors in Asian immigrants. Nevertheless, the huge variations in incidences among ethnic groups imply that there are important genetic risk factors. The stage distributions of prostate cancer in Asian populations are still unfavorable compared to those of Western developed countries. However, a trend towards diagnosing cancer with more favorable prognosis is seen in most Asian countries. Both genetic and environmental risk factors responsible for elevated risks in Asian people are being identified, which may help to reduce prostate cancer incidence in a chemopreventive setting.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of hypoandrogenism in the aging male is still difficult, since the symptomatology is aspecific and multifactorial, and it is unknown whether the androgen requirements of elderly men are the same as those of young men. Indeed, there are arguments for decreased (increased androgen feed-back sensitivity) as well as for increased (decreased concentration of androgen receptors) requirements in elderly men. In the absence of a reliable, clinically useful, parameter of androgen activity, we have to rely on plasma androgen level, an indirect parameter. In the absence of convincing arguments for altered requirements with age, we consider that the normal range of (free) testosterone levels in young adults is also valid for elderly men, the lower normal limit being 11 nmol/l for total testosterone and 0.225 nmol/l for free testosterone. There are indirect, suggestive clinical arguments for accepting these limit values. The diagnosis of hypoandrogenism in elderly males requires both the presence of clinical symptoms and decreased (free) testosterone levels. The best methods for determining free or bioavailable testosterone, are equilibrium dialysis and ammonium sulfate precipitation, respectively. They are, however, time-consuming techniques which are not easily automated. Calculation of the free androgen index (testosterone/sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) is not a valid method for male serum. Calculation of free testosterone from total testosterone, SHBG and albumin concentration, yields values that are in good agreement with values obtained by dialysis or ammonium sulfate precipitation. Several conditions should, however, be fulfilled: reliable methods for the determination of testosterone and SHBG, SHBG measurement in serum and not in plasma, use of fresh serum (not repeatedly frozen and thawed), absence of (exogenous) steroids competing for binding sites on SHBG and blood samples taken between 08.00 and 10.00 in the fasting state. Under these conditions an excellent correlation with dialysis and bioavailable testosterone (ammonium sulfate precipitation) is generally obtained.",

Indiscriminate administration of testosterone poses a risk and has to be deprecated. Testosterone supplementation to treat late-onset hypogonadism (LOH), a term for androgen deficiency in elderly men, is still controversially discussed mainly due to a lack of large, controlled clinical trials on efficacy and safety. To provide guidance for physicians primarily dealing with aging men, ISSAM is periodically updating and publishing its recommendations as new data become available [Morales A, Lunenfeld B.

The recommendations are based on the currently available scientific data on androgen supplementation therapy and should be regarded as provisional until larger-scale, long-term studies are available. While certainly not intending to be exhaustive, this review will highlight some relevant background information and provide the underlying scientific rationale for the ISA, ISSAM and EAU recommendations on LOH published in this issue.",

The scale is in widespread use (17 languages currently available) and a recent review of methodological data documented good psychometric characteristics and ability as a clinical utility. This paper describes test characteristics of the AMS (positive and negative predictive values), taking two internationally established and published screening scales for androgen deficiency as the available standard.Method A sample of 150 German males aged 40–69 years completed the AMS scale and two screening scales for androgen deficiency: the ADAM scale of Morley and colleagues and the screener of Smith and colleagues. The technique of a computer-assisted telephone interview was applied.Result The comparison of the AMS with the two screening instruments for androgen deficiency showed sufficiently good compatibility despite conceptual differences. The AMS scale sufficiently predicted the results of the two screening instruments. A positive predictive value of 92% and a negative predictive value of 50% were found regarding the ADAM scale. The respective figures regarding Smith's screener were 65% and 49% for positive and negative predictive values, respectively.Conclusion The AMS scale obviously measures a similar phenomenon as the two established and widely used screeners for androgen deficiency, although it was not developed as a screening instrument.",

Testosterone appears to activate a distributed cortical network, the ventral processing stream, during spatial cognition tasks, and addition of testosterone improves spatial cognition in younger and older hypogonadal men. In addition, reduced testosterone is associated with depressive disorders. The relationship between depression and testosterone appears to partly depend upon the androgen receptor genotype of the patient, and in appropriate patients with low testosterone levels, testosterone substitution can increase positive mood and decrease negative mood. The much publicized link between testosterone and aggression is probably only of importance in athletes who supplement their testosterone levels to excessively high levels, whereas in hypogonadal men, testosterone supplementation only enhances the positive aspects of aggression such as vigour and energy. Current data suggest that testosterone supplementation in hypogonadal men of all ages will enhance many aspects of mood and cognition.",

The present study monitored the effects of androgen deprivation therapy in men with insulin-dependent diabetes on glycaemic control and on biochemical cardiovascular risk markers.Methods. Twenty-nine patients from a urology practice were included. All men had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus prior to being diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. In a retrospective analysis, levels of fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c, insulin requirements, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, fibrinogen, PAI-1, tPA and C-reactive protein were obtained on at least eight occasions over a period of up to 24 months.Results. Glycaemic control worsened substantially with increases of serum glucose requiring increases in insulin dosages. HbA1c levels rose indicating impaired glycaemic control. All biochemical cardiovascular risk markers deteriorated.Conclusion. In men with insulin-dependent diabetes, androgen deprivation therapy may have negative effects on their glycaemic control and may aggravate the biochemical risk profile of cardiovascular disease to which diabetics are predisposed. These observations are in agreement with the emerging role of low levels of testosterone in metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.",

Participants drew upon four main discourses when discussing the impact of surgical treatment on their sense of masculinity: masculine identity and sexual activity, ED as a normative experience, mental resilience and vulnerability. Penetrative sex was constructed as central to a masculine identity, but inability to achieve this was normalised in terms of the ageing process. Stereotypically masculine qualities of emotional control and rationality were drawn on in describing their reaction to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer but they also experienced a new-found sense of physical vulnerability.

Therefore, this study investigated the prospective association of total testosterone (TT) concentrations with risk of incident hypertension and blood pressure change in 1484 men aged 20–79 years.Methods. Data from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania, Germany, were used. Serum TT concentrations, measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassays, were categorised into age-specific quartiles. Generalised Estimating Equation (GEE) models, adjusted for age, waist circumference, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption were specified.Results. During a median follow-up time of 5.0 years, the prevalence of hypertension increased from 50.6% to 57.1%. TT concentrations were significantly lower in men with baseline and incident hypertension. Analyses revealed that men with baseline TT concentrations in the lowest quartile had an increased risk of incident hypertension (odds ratio (OR), 1.19 (95% CI, 1.10–1.28)) compared to men with higher TT concentrations. Furthermore, we found a significant inverse association of TT concentrations and blood pressure, showing that men with baseline TT concentrations in the lowest quartile showed the slightest change in systolic blood pressure (−6.01 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (−2.11 mmHg) and pulse pressure (−3.98 mmHg). Sensitivity analyses in a subpopulation of men without antihypertensive medication confirmed these findings.Conclusion. These results show that low male TT concentrations are predictive of hypertension, suggesting TT as a potential biomarker of increased cardiovascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting are two dietary interventions that can improve aging. Religious fasting also suggested having similar benefit; however, such studies are still scarce. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of fasting calorie restriction (FCR) on metabolic parameters and DNA damage among healthy older adult men.A randomized controlled study was done on men, aged 50-70 years in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Subjects were divided into two groups; FCR (reduction of 300-500 kcal/d combined with 2 days/week of Muslim Sunnah Fasting) and control. Assessment was ascertained at three time point; baseline, weeks 6 and 12. Blood samples were analyzed for lipid profile, DNA damage and malondialdehyde (MDA).The FCR group reduced their energy intake for approximately 18% upon completion of the study. A significant interaction effect was found in body weight, body mass index, fat percentage, fat mass, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the ratio of total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.05). A significant improvement (p < 0.001) in total DNA rejoining cells and MDA (p < 0.05) was also observed in the FCR group.FCR improved metabolic parameters and DNA damage in healthy older adult men. Therefore, there is a need to further examine the mechanism of FCR.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether frailty is associated with circulating total and free testosterone, total and free estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in older men. Methods: With NHANES III data of 461 men aged 60 years and older, we used logistic regression to analyze the associations between serum concentrations of sex steroid hormones, SHBG and frailty. Participants meeting any three or more of the five frailty criteria were classified as \"frail\", all others were considered as non-frail. Results: 2.5% of men were frail. Men with SHBG ≥66 nmol/L had three times the odds of frailty (OR = 2.97; 95% CI 1.28–6.86) compared to men with SHBG <66 nmol/L. Men with free testosterone levels below 243 pmol/L had an increased odds of frailty (OR = 3.92; 95% CI 1.29–11.89). None of these associations was statistically significant after additionally adjusting for body mass index, smoking and history of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Total testosterone, and total and free estradiol serum levels were not statistically significantly associated with frailty. Conclusions: In this US nationally representative study of older men, low free testosterone and high SHBG serum levels were associated with a significantly increased odds of frailty after adjustment for age and race/ethnicity. These associations may, however, be explained by confounding due to obesity, smoking, and the higher prevalence of CVD in frail men or by low hormones or high SHBG mediating the association between obesity, smoking, CVD and frailty.",

In our systematic meta-analysis, we demonstrated that combination therapy with ABs and 5-ARIs was associated with significantly higher risk of ED and LA compared with single monotherapy. Combination therapy showed similar risk of LA compared with 5-ARI monotherapy.",

We defined UI according to International Continence Society (ICS) definition: \"the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine\" after 12 months of recovery, international consultation on incontinence questionnaire (ICIQ-SF) and pads/day was collected too. Clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging measurements were assessed. A multivariable logistic regression model predicting incontinence were built-in after adjust by cofounding factors and bootstrapping.Results: About 172 (23%) of the patients were classified as incontinent according to the ICS definition. The mean value of the ICIQ-SF was 10.87 (±4). 17.8% of patients use at least one pad/day, 11.9% use more than one pad/day. The preoperative factors independently influential in UI are: age [OR: 1.055; CI 95% (1.006–1.107), p = .028], urethral wall thickness [OR: 5.03; CI 95% (1.11–22.8), p = .036], history of transurethral resection of the prostate [OR: 6.13; CI 95% (1.86–20.18), p = .003] and membranous urethral length [OR: 0.173; CI 95% (0.046–0.64), p = .009]. The predictive accuracy of the model is 78.7% and the area under the curve (AUC) value 71.7%.Conclusions: Urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy has different prevalence depending on the definition. Age, prior transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), membranous urethral length (MUL) and urethral wall thickness (UWT) were risk factors.",

With reduced number of myelinated fibers, diameter, vacuolization, indentation of the myelin sheath, and degeneration. nNOS and its cofactor (NaDPH diaphorase) were reduced in aged rat DNP. NCV was slow in aged rats and concomitant poor penile reflex was also noted. AR showed reduced expression in aged rat DNP when compared to young and control groups. TUNEL positive cells were increased in aged rat DNP.

Some studies suggest a possible link between low total testosterone (TT) levels and the presence of MetS.Aim: To analyze the strength and independence of associations between TT and MetS components in non-diabetic men.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 143 non-diabetic men older than 40 were analyzed.Main outcomes measure: Blood samples were collected to evaluate metabolic profile and TT levels. MetS was defined as the presence of three or more of the following characteristics: fasting blood glucose levels ≥ 100 mg/dL, triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dL, HDL-c < 40 mg/dL, hypertension or blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mmHg, and waist girth > 102 cm.Results: Mean age of the study population was 61.5 ± 8.61 years old. MetS was present in 47.9% of the individuals. Thirty-four men had low TT and MetS was observed in 23 (70%) against 50 (46%) in those with normal TT (≥ 300 ng/dL) (OR 4.94, p < 0.01), adjusted to confounder's factors. In multiple linear regression analysis, only waist circumference (Beta: −0.395; p = 0.03) and HDL-c (Beta: 0.19; p = 0.04) remained significantly correlated with TT levels.Conclusions: Low TT levels were associated with MetS diagnosis. Abdominal obesity was the MetS component independently correlated to low TT levels.",

The impact of T-replacement therapy (TRT) in men with functional hypogonadism and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has to be elucidated. This study included 80 men (mean age 51.5 ± 6.3 years) with newly diagnosed T2DM (according to ADA criteria) and functional hypogonadism (according to EAU criteria). Randomization: Group1 (n = 40): TRT using 1%-transdermal T-gel (50 mg/day), Group2 (n = 40) no TRT (controls). Dietary treatment applied to both. Parameters at baseline/after 9 months: anthropometric parameters, lipids and indicators of carbohydrate metabolism (fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR), markers of adipose tissue and EnD (leptin, resistin, p- and e-selectin, ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1 and CRP). ANCOVA for repeated measurements revealed TRT to cause a significant decrease in waist circumference (WC), HOMA-IR and HbA1c vs controls (p < .001, p = .002, p = .004, respectively). Leptin declined in subjects receiving TRT vs controls (p = .04). Concentrations of resistin, ICAM-1, p-selectin and CRP decreased significantly vs controls (all p < .001); no effects for e-selectin and VCAM-1. Advanced age attenuated effects, higher delta testosterone levels augmented effects. Decrement of WC was related to decreasing markers of adipose tissue secretion/EnD. TRT in men with functional hypogonadism and T2DM improved carbohydrate metabolism and markers of endothelial dysfunction.",

Sarcopenia was defined by European-Working-Group-on-Sarcopenia-in-Older-People criteria. Obesity was defined by two different methods, a fat-percentile above 60th percentile (Zoico-method) or a BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 (WHO-definition).We enrolled 992 subjects (308 men, 684 women). Body fat-percentage thresholds for obesity were 27.3% for men and 40.7% for women according to Zoico-method. The rates of obesity were about 40% in both genders by Zoico-method; 29.2% versus 53.7% for men and women by WHO definition. Prevalences-of-sarcopenia was 3.1% versus 0.4%; SO was 0.3% versus 0.1% when obesity was assessed with Zoico-method in men and women, respectively. No case of SO was defined when obesity was assessed using WHO-definition.The threshold for obesity definition according to Zoico-method was similar to other European-populations. While obesity-prevalences were considerably high, SO prevalences were low but comparable to other populations. This low-prevalence seems to be due to underestimation of sarcopenia in obese subjects when skeletal-muscle-mass was adjusted by height2 to recognize low-muscle-mass.",

The hormone replacement treatment (HRT) is associated with the potential increase of hematocrit, serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate volume. Moreover, the gynecomastia represent a condition frequently associated with HRT. Recent evidences showed the role of leydig cells in the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D and the elevated frequency of hypovitaminosis D among LOH patients. Finally, another important aspect of LOH is represented by the frequency of secondary infertility due to age or to traditional HRT. This study evaluated 40 LOH patients treated for 6 months with extractive HCG (n = 10 patients) and three different formulations of T: transdermal (n = 10 patients), undecaonate (n = 10 patients) and enantate (n = 10 patients). Hormonal, anthropometric, metabolic and sperm parameters were evaluated and compared. Moreover, the main safety parameters and the results of the main questionnaires were evaluated. After treatment, HCG group showed serum concentrations of 25-OH-vitamin D significantly higher (p < 0.05) and serum concentrations of oestrogens significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared with other groups. Moreover, they showed a mean value of hematocrit, PSA and prostate volume significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared with other groups. Finally, all the groups treated with T showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) of sperm density and of percentage of spermatozoa with progressive motility compared with HCG group.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effect of lead, with or without zinc co-administration, on steroidogenic and xanthine oxidase (XO)/uric acid (UA)/caspase 3-mediated apoptotic signaling in the testis.Forty male Wistar rats were divided into four groups at random; vehicle-treated control, zinc-treated, lead-treated, and lead + zinc-treated groups.Lead exposure significantly lowered overall weight gain, testicular, epididymal, seminal vesicle, and prostate weights. Also, lead decreased sperm count, viability and motility but increased the fraction of sperm with aberrant morphology. In addition, lead caused a marked rise in the level of UA and XO activity but a decrease in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities. Furthermore, lead increased the testicular levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), and tumour necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-α), which were associated with an increase in testicular caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation as well as a decline in circulating gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and testicular 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). These were associated with lead-induced degenerative changes in testicular tissues evidenced by shrunken seminiferous tubules, degeneration and sloughing of germ cells. Co-administration of zinc prevented lead-induced testicular injury by ameliorating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation through downregulation of XO/UA/caspase 3 pathway and upregulation of testicular 3β-HSD/17β-HSD.This study demonstrated that zinc protected against lead-induced testicular toxicity via the downregulation of XO/UA/caspase 3 signaling.",

Retrospective analysis of body composition changes in men with prostate cancer receiving LHRH-A therapy from 2 clinical trials compared to men without prostate cancer serving as a placebo-control in another clinical trial.Setting. Clinical Research Center in Connecticut.Participants. Thirty men (> 60 years) receiving 6 months of LHRH-A therapy for PCa were compared to a healthy group of 25 men without PCa.Measurements. Appendicular skeletal muscle/height2 (ASM/ht2), lean and fat mass were assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Total testosterone levels were assessed by enzyme immunoassay.Results. At baseline, 12/30 (40%) of the treatment group and 7/25 (28%) of the control group (p = 0.11) met criteria for sarcopenia. There were no differences between control groups in ASM/ht2 or lean mass. The LHRH-A group had a higher percent body fat than the control group, 29.8 ± 6.3 versus 26.3 ± 4.6 (p = 0.02).

In epidemiological studies LUTS appears strongly associated with erectile dysfunction, and also with metabolic syndrome. LUTS occurs at an age at which plasma testosterone levels decline, in some men to hypogonadal values.Objectives. This pilot study tested whether testosterone administration to elderly men complaining of LUTS and whose plasma testosterone levels are below normal, might alleviate LUTS.Methods. Group 1 (n = 10) received treatment with testosterone gel (50 mg) daily for three months; group 2 (n = 20) received treatment with injections of testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg for 26 weeks.Results. Upon these interventions, plasma testosterone increased to the normal range. Symptoms of LUTS, measured by the International Prostate Symptoms Score, improved significantly, and also scores of the Aging Males' Symptoms scale and international index of erectile function improved. There were no untoward effects on the prostate over this period of time of the study.Conclusion. Testosterone administration improved symptoms of LUTS in men with late-onset hypogonadism. The mechanism of action is as yet not understood, but it may be connected with or parallel with the effects of testosterone on penile tissues in hypogonadal men, such as on nitric oxide and phosphodiesterase.",

    "abstract": "Purpose. To determine the value of available questionnaires used for the diagnosis of testosterone deficiency syndromes (TDS) by correlating their ratings with a panel of hormonal determinations in a male population.Materials and methods. Participants completed the ADAM questionnaire and underwent biochemical evaluation at the local site. Assessments determined entry into Group A (symptomatic) or Group B (non-symptomatic). After stratification, subjects provided a morning sample of blood, completed the Aging Male Survey (AMS) and the newly developed Canadian Society for the Study of the Aging Male (CSAM-Q) questionnaires. Serum aliquots were analysed at a central lab for 8 putative markers commonly associated with symptomatic testosterone deficiency associated with aging: total testosterone (T); bioavailable T (BT); dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S); sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG); luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL); thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).Results. 92 men were screened; of these 59 (mean age of 58 ± 11 years) completed the study, 30 (51%) scored positively (mean 61.5 years) to the ADAM while 29 (49%) did not (mean 54.1 years). For the AMS the weight of the three domains (psychological, somato-vegetative and sexual) was significantly greater in Group A (p < 0.001) than in Group B. Equally, for the CAS questionnaire, the scores for the variables energy, global performance, frequency of intercourse, mood and quality of sleep were lower in Group A than in their asymptomatic counterparts (p < 0.001). The domain of memory assessment within the CSSAM-Q was not discriminatory. ADAM and AMS are self-administered and completed within 10 minutes. CSSAM-Q is more time consuming, requires an investigator to administer, and memory domain is biased in favour of specific professional training.No difference was found between the two groups in 6 of 8 biochemical tests. However, significant lower values (p < 0.001) were found for DHEA-S and IGF-1 in the symptomatic group as compared with the non-symptomatic cohort.Conclusions. This study confirms that newer, more complex tools perform similarly to the simpler ADAM questionnaire. The lack of correlation between the clinical picture and the most commonly used biochemical confirmatory tests, again, clearly points to the paramount importance of the clinical evaluation. An emphasis and reliance on serum T alone hinders the clinician's ability to manage testosterone deficiency syndromes (TDS).",

Recruitment of a convenience sample continued until a minimum of 20 men represented each decade between 30 and 80 years. Demographics (age, height, weight), health and current activity level were recorded. Balance and mobility were measured using the timed up and go test, the step test, functional and lateral reach. Reaction time was determined from limits of stability test. Leg muscle strength was measured with a spring gauge (kg), and ankle flexibility was measured using goniometry.Results. Balance, mobility and most strength measures were reduced by the 60s while ankle flexibility declined by the 70s (p < 0.01). Reaction times increased by the 60s (p < 0.01).Conclusion. This study of men demonstrated reduced musculoskeletal function, balance and mobility generally by the 60s. These results provide health professionals with normal performance levels to use as therapeutic goals as well as identify musculoskeletal factors associated with reducing balance and mobility. Hence, these results inform clinicians and policy makers for the establishment of pre-emptive interventions to promote healthier ageing.",

However, it is not known whether telomere length changes during the course of type 2 diabetes.

Methods: A total of 93 males with type 2 diabetes and 10 years or more since original diagnosis; 96 males with less than one year of diagnosis; 98 age matched healthy males. Telomere length was estimated by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Fasting venous blood samples were obtained for measurement of lipid peroxidation and inflammation markers.Results: We found a greater telomere shortening in group (A) with type 2 diabetes of 10 years or more since original diagnosis, compared with the control group (C) of healthy males (5.4 vs 9.6 Kb) (p = 0.04) and with group B (5.4 vs 8.7kb) (p = 0.05). With regard to inflammatory markers TNF-α, malondialdehyde peroxidation and adiponectin we found significant differences. Conclusion: Telomere shortening increases with the duration of diabetes. The time of exhibition suggests in parallel that the progressive increase of inflammation and/or oxidative stress plays a direct role in telomere shortening.",

Twenty patients, matched aged, with vascular ED who did not accept to undergo the standard PhA's protocol, represented the control group. All patients were evaluated, by IIEF-5 questionnaire administration, penile eco color doppler and flow-cytometric analysis for detection of serum concentrations of original immunophenotype endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) = CD45neg/CD34pos/CD144pos and endothelial microparticles (EMPs) = CD45neg/CD34neg/CD144pos.After 3 months, group A showed IIEF 5 score and peak systolic velocity significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to controls, and significantly lower values (p < 0.05) of acceleration time, in addition serum concentrations of EPCs and EMPs were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in group A compared to controls.PhA improves quality of arterial ED, without other pharmacological approach, probably by reduced endothelial apoptosis.

This study was designed to investigate the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and severity of CHF as well as to evaluate its determinants among different parameters of cardiac dysfunction.Methods. Seventy-one CHF males with NYHA class II and III and 20 control subjects age ≥ 55 years were recruited. CBF was evaluated by colour duplex sonography of extracranial arteries. Echocardiography, 6-min walk test, quality of life and endothelial function were also assessed. Serum NT-pro-BNP and adipokines levels (adiponectin and leptin) were measured.Results. CBF was significantly reduced in elderly patients with CHF compared to healthy controls (677 ± 170 vs 783 ± 128 ml/min, p = 0.011). Reduced CBF was associated with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = 0.271, p = 0.022), lower 6-min walk distance (r = 0.339, p = 0.004), deteriorated quality of life (r = −0.327, p = 0.005), increased serum adiponectin (r = −0.359, p = 0.002), and NT-pro-BNP levels (r = −0.375, p = 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, LVEF and adiponectin were independently associated with reduced CBF in CHF patients (R2 = 0.289).Conclusion. CBF was reduced in elderly males with mild-to-moderate CHF, and was associated with factors that represent the severity of CHF including high serum adiponectin and NT-pro-BNP levels, decreased LVEF, impaired physical performance, and deteriorated quality of life.",

Such dysfunction is present in both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and erectile dysfunction (ED). ED is the persistent inability to achieve or sustain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance and is one of the first manifestations of endothelial damage in men with CVD risk factors. The purpose of this article is to review the results of studies involving physical activity, CVD, endothelial dysfunction and ED in order to verify its applicability for improving the health and quality of life of men with such disorders. There is consistent evidence that endothelial damage is intimately linked to ED, and this manifestation seems to be associated with the appearance CVDs. On the other hand, physical activity has been pointed out as an important clinical strategy in the prevention and treatment of CVDs and ED mainly associated with improvement of endothelial function. However, further experimental and clinical prospective investigations are needed to test the role of physical exercises in the modulation of endothelial function and their implications on erectile function and the appearance of CVDs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: We examined the prevalence of low testosterone (LT) and its relationship with body mass index (BMI) in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), who were enrolled in a clinical trial of drug therapy, the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study.Materials and methods: MTOPS enrolled 3047 men, and of these, 1896 had total testosterone (TT) measured at baseline. LT was defined as a single measurement of TT of <300 ng/dL.Results: The overall prevalence of LT was 25.7%. Prevalence increased with increasing BMI; 14.7% among men who were normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m2) and 24.2% and 39.3% among overweight (BMI 25 to <30 kg/m2), and obese (baseline BMI ≥30 kg/m2) men, respectively.Conclusions: LT was observed in about one in four MTOPS study participants with baseline TT measurements. The prevalence of LT increased markedly with increasing BMI. Our findings suggest a high prevalence of LT in obese men with LUTS/BPH. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of symptoms of hypogonadism in this population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) have been associated with falls in studies either exclusively or predominantly of women. It is, therefore, less clear if LUTS are risk factors for falls in men.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the association between LUTS and falls, injuries, and fractures in community-dwelling older men. Medline, Embase, and Cinahl were searched for any type of observational study that has been published in a peer-reviewed journal in English language. Studies were excluded if they did not report male-specific data or targeted specific patient populations. Results were summarized qualitatively.Results: Three prospective cohort studies and six cross-sectional studies were identified. Incontinence, urgency, nocturia, and frequency were consistently shown to have weak to moderate association with falls (the point estimates of odds ratio and relative risk ranged from 1.31 to 1.67) in studies with low risk of bias for confounding. Only frequency was shown to be associated with fractures.Conclusions: Urinary incontinence and lower urinary tract storage symptoms are associated with falls in community-dwelling older men. The circumstances of falls in men with LUTS need to be investigated to generate hypotheses about what types of interventions may be effective in reducing falls.",

We aimed to report muscle-mass reference cut-off points adjusted for height and weight as muscle-mass threshold best discriminating muscle-weakness and adjusted for body mass index (BMI) significantly lower than that of healthy young population.We included young adults between 18 and 39 years and community dwelling older adults 60-99 years of age. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) was used to assess skeletal muscle mass. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) adjusted for height, weight, BMI were calculated [SMMI (height), SMMI (weight), SMMI (BMI)]. Handgrip strength was evaluated with Jamar hydraulic dynamometer for muscle-strength. SMMI (height) and SMMI (weight) cut-offs that predict low muscle-strength were calculated with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Low muscle-strength was evaluated by three different thresholds, i.e. 32 kg/22 kg, 30 kg/20 kg, 26 kg/16 kg in males/females. SMMI (BMI) cut-offs were calculated as \"mean young SMMI (BMI)-two standard deviation.\"The young and older reference groups included 301 and 992 individuals, respectively. LMM cut-points for SMMI (height) were (i) 10.8 vs. 8.9 kg/m2 for 32/22 kg; 10.8 vs. 9.4 kg/m2 for 30/20 kg and 11.1 vs. 8.9 kg/m2 for the 26/16 kg thresholds, in males and females, respectively. LMM cut-points for the SMMI (weight) were 40.6% and 33.2% for the all three studied muscle-strength thresholds for males and females, respectively. For all the analyses sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were not sufficiently high in both genders. The SMMI (BMI) cut-points were 1.049 vs. 0.823 kg/BMI for males and females, respectively.We presented the very first cut-off thresholds for muscle-mass adjusted by height and weight that best discriminate muscle-weakness in the older adults and by BMI that is significantly lower than that of healthy young population. This study suggests that correlation between total skeletal muscle mass measured by BIA (either adjusted for height or weight) and muscle strength is low.",

These parameters are influenced by the population, living settings and age. We aimed to study these parameters in Turkish community-dwelling male elderly. We studied 274 male elderly ≥60 years of age admitted to our Geriatrics outpatient clinics. Mean age was 74.4 ± 7.1 years; 47.4% of the subjects were ≥75 years, 24.1% were ≥80 years. Mean activities-of-daily-living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) scores were 9.4 and 11.1, respectively. Patients with at least one-dependence at ADL–IADL were 22.6%–47.2%, and more than half-dependence at ADL–IADL were 2.8%–17.9%, respectively. Mean number of comorbidities were 2.6. Most common diagnosis was hypertension with 65%; mean number of drugs were 4.5; 55.3% were using ≥4 chronic drugs. Prevalences of malnutrition were 3.7%–6.9%, malnutrition risk were 23.5%–26.7% by the Mini Nutritional Assessment Test - Long Form and Short Form, respectively. Calf circumference was measured <31 cm in 10.5%. Our findings suggest that Turkish community-dwelling male elderly may have greater prevalences of functional dependence, sarcopenia but lower rates of malnutrition and similar rates of polypharmacy compared with the western developing countries and developed countries. This study emphasized the geographical differences in and/or between the individual countries highlighting the need for studies both country- and world-wide.",

Primary outcomes were the peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), post-void residual volume (PVR) and international prostate symptom score (IPSS). Secondary outcomes were operation time, irrigation duration, catheterization duration, resected tissue and complications.Results: Four trials assessing B-TURP and HoLEP were considered eligible for Meta-analysis, including three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective study. There was no statistically significant difference between B-TURP and HoLEP in terms of Qmax, IPSS, PVR at 3–6 months follow-up, operation duration, catheterization duration, resected tissue and complications (p > 0.05). HoLEP was associated with a significantly shorter irrigation time as compared with B-TURP (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Both B-TURP and HoLEP are safe and minimally invasive techniques that are similar in terms of symptomatic relief, although these findings need further validation in larger RCTs involving larger numbers of patients and over a longer follow-up duration for B-TURP or HoLEP before a new gold standard procedure emerges for surgical treatment of BPH.",

    "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is one of the most common disorders in male and is often associated with other age-related comorbidities. The aging process affects the structural organization and function of penile erectile components such as smooth muscle cell and vascular architecture. These modifications affect penile hemodynamics by impairing cavernosal smooth muscle cell relaxation, reducing penile elasticity, compliance and promoting fibrosis. This review aims to identify the mechanisms of ED in the penile aging process in experimental and clinical data. It also highlights areas that are in need of more research. The search strategies yielded total records screened from PubMed. Clarification of the molecular mechanisms that accompanies corpus cavernosum aging and aging-associated ED will aid new perspectives in the development of novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches. Age is not a limiting factor for ED medical management, and it is never too late to treat. Hypogonadism should be managed regardless of age, and synergistic effects have been found during testosterone (T) replacement therapy when used along with oral phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Therefore, the clinical management of ED related to aging can be done by therapeutic interventions that include PDE-5 inhibitors, and other pharmacological treatments.",

    "abstract": "The role of estrogens in male physiology has become more evident, as a consequence of the discovery of human models of estrogen deficiency such as estrogen resistance or aromatase deficiency. In males, testosterone is the major source of plasma estradiol, the main biologically active estrogen, only 20% of which is secreted by the testes. Plasma estrone, 5% of which is converted to plasma estradiol, originates from tissue aromatization of, mainly adrenal, androstenedione. The plasma concentration of estradiol in males is 2-3 ng/dl and its production rate in blood is 25-40 μg/24 h; both of these values are significantly higher than in postmenopausal women. Plasma levels of estradiol do not necessarily reflect tissue-level activity as peripherally formed estradiol is partially metabolized in situ; thus, not all enters the general circulation, with a fraction remaining only locally active. Of the factors influencing plasma estradiol levels, plasma testosterone is a major determinant. However, the age-associated decrease in testosterone levels is scarcely reflected in plasma estradiol levels, as a result of increasing aromatase activity with age and the age-associated increase in fat mass. Free and bioavailable estradiol levels do decrease modestly with age as does the ratio of free testosterone to free estradiol, the latter testifying to the age-associated increasewd aromatization of testosterone. Estradiol levels are highly significantly positively related to body fat mass and more specifically to subcutaneous abdominal fat, but not to visceral (omental) fat. Indeed, aromatase activity in omental fat is only one-tenth of the activity in gluteal fat. Estrogens in males play an important role in the regulation of the gonadotropin feedback, several brain functions, bone maturation, regulation of bone resorption and in lipid metabolism. Moreover, they affect skin metabolism and are an important factor determining sex interest in man.",

    "abstract": "The association between erectile dysfunction (ED) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) among men was examined in the Integrated Healthcare Information Services National Managed Care Benchmark Database (IHCIS). The IHCIS is a fully de-identified, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant database and includes complete medical histories for more than 17 million managed-care lives; data from more than 30 US health plans, covering seven census regions; and patient demographics, including morbidity, age and gender. A total of 12 825 ED patients and an equal number of male patients without ED were included in the retrospective cohort study. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the adjusted risk of PVD that accounted for age at ED diagnosis, smoking, obesity and medications including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers and statins. The cohort of men with ED were observed to have a 75% increase in risk for PVD (odds ratio (OR) = 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06, 2.90) after adjusting for age at ED diagnosis, smoking, obesity and use of ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and statins. Some evidence of a possible trend towards increased risk was detected by age group. After controlling for the aforementioned covariates and compared to men aged 30-39 years, it was noted that patients aged 40-44 years were 2.1 times more likely to develop PVD (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.89, 4.81), 45-49-year-old men were also more than twice as likely to have PVD (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.03, 5.22), and 50-55-year-old patients had a three-fold increased risk of developing PVD (OR = 3.00, 95% CI = 1.40, 6.43). The results of this study indicate that ED may serve as a marker for PVD. The risk becomes more pronounced with increasing age, indicating the need for cardiologists and internists to monitor ED patients who may not necessarily present with cardiovascular symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone therapy has been used for more than 60 years in the treatment of male hypogonadism. The classical forms of hypogonadism are comprised of primary testicular failure or insufficient testicular stimulation due to the lack of pituitary gonadotropins. Typical causes of primary hypogonadism are Klinefelter's syndrome, anorchia or acquired disturbances of testicular function. Secondary hypogonadism is characterized by insufficient production of pituitary gonadotropins, due either to pituitary failure or defects at the hypothalamic level. It is unequivocally accepted in clinical practice that any male with inadequately low testosterone production for his age will require androgen therapy. In addition to the classical forms of hypogonadism, the past decade of research has clearly demonstrated that, with increasing age, many men will suffer from decreasing testosterone production. About 15-25% of men over the age of 50 years will experience serum testosterone levels well below the threshold considered normal for men between 20 and 40 years of age. Studies substituting testosterone in elderly men with low serum testosterone have shown that men with clinical symptoms identical to the symptomatology of classical hypogonadism will benefit most from such therapy. Therefore, it is the general consensus to treat men with age-related hypogonadism only when clinical symptoms are present that can be potentially corrected by testosterone administration. Until recently, intramuscular injections of esters, such as testosterone enanthate, have been the mainstay of testosterone therapy. The introduction of testosterone patches has not challenged this approach, since many users of patches suffer from moderate to severe skin reactions. Some oral testosterone formulations have proven to be problematic, as absorption can be variable, bioavailability is frequently poor, due to the first-pass effect of the liver, and frequent administration is often required<citeref rid=\"b1\"><emph>1</emph></citeref>. Oral testosterone undecanoate avoids, at least partially, the first-pass effect of the liver. However, plasma testosterone levels generally undergo large fluctuations<citeref rid=\"b2\"><emph>2</emph></citeref>. The large fluctuations in serum testosterone levels caused by conventional intramuscular injections result in unsatisfactory shifts in mood and sexual function in some men, which, combined with the frequency of injections, make the intramuscular mode of delivery far from ideal. Recently, a hydroalcoholic gel containing 1% testosterone has proven to be as efficient as a testosterone patch, but with fewer side-effects and a higher grade of patient satisfaction<citeref rid=\"b3\"><emph>3</emph></citeref>-<citeref rid=\"b4\"></citeref><citeref rid=\"b5\"><emph>5</emph></citeref>. Doses of 50-100 mg gel applied once daily on the skin deliver sufficient amounts of testosterone to restore normal hormonal values and correct the signs and symptoms of hypogonadism. The gel has been shown to be effective and successful in patients in the United States, who have benefited from its availability for almost 3 years. In the near future, intramuscular injections of testosterone undecanoate will become commercially available. Such injections have a very favorable pharmacokinetic profile, with one injection every 3 months maintaining serum testosterone well within the normal range. In phase III studies, intramuscular testosterone undecanoate proved to be as efficient as testosterone enanthate, with only one-quarter of the number of injections required and more stable serum testosterone levels. Thus, the new application modes - hydroalcoholic gel (for example, Testogel®, Schering AG, Germany) and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate (Nebido®, Schering AG, Germany) - appear to be the methods of choice in the near future, one being very suitable for hormone therapy in elderly men, the other for long-term substitution in classical forms of hypogonadism.",

    "abstract": "Aging in men is associated with a progressive decline in the production of several hormones, including androgens. The extent to which an age-dependent decline in androgen levels lead to health problems or can affect quality of life remains under debate. Clinical results on replacement therapy do not yet provide a definitive clue on the benefit/risk balance. A sexual dimorphism of the immune system is well established, and the differences between female and male immune responses under normal, as well as pathological, conditions are generally attributed to the influence of estrogens, progestins, and androgens. The suppressive effects of male sex hormones on immune functions have been observed in a wide variety of disease processes and appear to be testosterone-mediated. Endogenous testosterone inhibits skin wound healing response in males and is associated with an enhanced inflammatory response. Although there are no known gender-related differences in permeability barrier function in adults, estrogens accelerates—whereas testosterone retards—barrier development in fetal skin, and male fetuses demonstrate slower barrier development than female littermates.",

However, few studies have longitudinally evaluated the rate of muscle strength loss and the risk factors for the loss in older men. This study examined the patterns and determinants of muscle strength change with aging in a healthy older male population. The study participants were 321 men (age range 51-84 yrs) recruited from population-based listings in the Pittsburgh region, USA. Grip strength was measured at baseline and after an average of 7-years of follow-up. The amount of longitudinal rate of grip strength loss was 2.8% per year (a total of 20% decline during 7-year follow-up). Although all age groups experienced a decline in strength during follow-up, the rate of loss accelerated with age. After adjusting for baseline measurement, grip strength loss ranged from 2.0% decline per year for men aged < 60 years to 3.4% decline per year for men aged 70 years or older (p < .0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that besides older age, other risk factors also contributed to the loss of muscle strength in older men, including back pain, use of calcium channel blockers, caffeine intake, and height and weight loss.",

The fear to induce prostate cancer appeared very powerful. About 68% of physicians associate the use of T more with risks than benefits, more so in Europe than elsewhere. As a result about 35% of hypogonadal men do not receive treatment. The PDE-5 inhibitors are very prominent in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Of patients suffering from erectile dysfunction, 18% to 29% have T deficiency which is not always diagnosed and treated.World-wide physicians require more education on diagnosing T deficiency, on the role of T in erectile dysfunction and the relative safety of testosterone treatment.",

LOH reduces quality of life and may pose important risk factors for frailty, changes in body composition, cardiovascular disease, sexual dysfunction and osteoporosis. Testosterone supplementation in cases of LOH will restore serum testosterone levels into the physiologic range; will restore metabolic parameters to the eugonadal state, increase muscle mass, strength, and function; maintaine or improve BMD reducing fracture risk; will improve neuropsychological function (cognition and mood); libido and sexual functioning; and enhance quality of life. The ultimate goals, however, are to maintain or regain a high quality of life, to reduce disability, to compress major illnesses into a narrow age range and to add life to years. To achieve these goals men must also adjust their lifestyle to optimize dietary habits, as well as to exercise and to abstain from smoking life-long. Monitoring these patients is a shared responsibility that cannot be taken lightly. The physician must emphasize to the patient the need for periodic evaluations and the patient must agree to comply with these requirements. The physician's evaluation should include an assessment of the clinical response and monitoring must be tailored to the indications and individual needs of the patient.",

Of 2117 men at baseline, 1589 were followed up 5 years later. Low total testosterone concentration at baseline determined by <10th percentile (10-year age-strata) were used as a risk factor for incident T2DM at follow-up. To evaluate for potential non-response bias, drop out weights were used in sensitivity analysis.Results. From 1339 men eligible for analyses, 68 (5.1%) developed T2DM. Men with low total testosterone concentration had an increased risk of developing T2DM (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, 95% CI 1.9–6.1), even after adjustment for age, waist circumference and smoking, OR 3.0; (95% CI 1.6–5.7). Recalculated weighted models revealed almost identical estimates indicating no relevant non-response bias.Discussion. Our prospective findings suggest that low total testosterone concentration is associated with incident T2DM in men and might represent a biomarker that might causally be involved in the risk of T2DM.

The Aging Male Symptom (AMS) scale, Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were obtained from patients with LOH.

Serum FT levels and the scores for the four parameters of AMS, six of eight domains in SF-36, IIEF-5 and total IPSS improved significantly after 3 months TRT. In addition, all IPSS domains also improved significantly, and voiding disturbance seems to have improved more than storage disturbance (P = 0.0280 vs. 0.0483).Conclusion.

    "abstract": "Hypogonadism is a common condition which occurs more frequently in older men. It is characterized by low testosterone (T) and is associated with symptoms which are often nonspecific. A key symptom is low libido, but it can also be associated with erectile dysfunction, reduced muscle mass and strength, increased body fat, reduced bone mineral density and osteoporosis, reduced vitality, and depressed mood. Hypogonadism is linked with a variety of comorbid conditions including erectile dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis. However, the condition is often underdiagnosed. T supplementation in hypogonadism is associated with a range of benefits including improved sexual function, increased lean body mass and/or reduced fat mass, and improved bone mineral density. A variety of T supplementation formulations are available. Although there is no evidence of increased risk of initiating prostate cancer with T supplementation, it is contraindicated in men with prostate cancer. It is important that primary care physicians are aware of both the signs and symptoms of hypogonadism, the monitoring and testing that is required and the merits and advantages of the various T preparations to ensure optimal management of the condition with a treatment approach that best suits patients' needs.",

Results: At the cross-sectional analysis, Shyper men, but not women, had a significantly (p = 0.02) lower SPPB score than Eut controls, although with comparable CMA, grip strength and NCV, and were more likely to have poor physical performance (odds ratio = 2.97, p < 0.05).

    "abstract": "Tadalafil is a promising phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitor prescribed for erectile dysfunction (ED). Daily low dose (5 mg) of tadalafil has also been used for the treatment of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). PDE5 inhibitors induce relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the urethra, prostate, bladder neck, and blood vessels. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of tadalafil on vessels endothelial function, in patients with male LUTS symptoms associated with BPH.The Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this clinical study and informed consents had been obtained from 81 BPH patients. The following male LUTS parameters: international prostate symptom score (IPSS), overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), voiding volume, max and mean voiding flow on voiding flowmetry examination and post-voiding residual urine (RU) were compared at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after a daily dose of 5 mg tadalafil. In addition, erectile function was evaluated by the sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) score and vessels endothelial function and peripheral neuropathy were assessed by the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), ankle brachial index (ABI), and vibration perception threshold (VPT) at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment.The mean age of 81 patients was 66.4 ± 11.4 years old. Their prostate size was 30.2 ± 22.1 ml. Male LUTS parameters including IPSS, OABSS, and RU showed significant improvement from 1 to 12 months after tadalafil administration. Max and mean voiding flow was significantly increased at 6 months after tadalafil treatment. The SHIM score showed significant improvement after 3 months. Whilst, the results of baPWV also showed significant improvement from 3 to 12 months. ABI was also significantly improved at 6 months. However, there was no change in the VPT at any time point.Tadalafil is effective for both male LUTS and ED. It is also shown that tadalafil improves baPWV, which we can conclude that higher vessels elasticity has been obtained. This major finding of this study shows that tadalafil has the potency to improve vessels endothelial dysfunction in patients with BPH.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer can be diagnosed as an incidental finding during the pathological examination of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) specimens by Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). BPH and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia often coexist in elderly people. We identified which comorbidities can be used to predict the presence of incidental prostate cancer, particularly high-risk cancer, in men who had undergone HoLEP. On the basis of pathological findings of HoLEP specimens, patients with incidental cancer were categorized as low-risk (Gleason ≤6 and T1a) or high-risk (all others). Of the 654 patients who underwent HoLEP, 41 patients (6.3%) were identified as having incidental cancer (25 low-risk and 16 high-risk). There were no significant factors for overall prostate cancers. However, a significantly higher frequency of diabetes was observed in patients with high-risk cancer compared to those with BPH (31% vs. 13%; p = .033). Logistic regression analysis using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and prostate volume (PV), and smoking showed that diabetes was an independent predictor of high-risk cancer (odds ratio, 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–9.43). Diabetes may be an important predictor of the presence of high-risk prostate cancer in men with BPH who have undergone HoLEP.",

Demographic data were recorded at baseline.Subjects completed three standardised questionnaires to assess sexual health including International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Aging Males Symptoms (AMS) and IIEF Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). Patients were stratified by ED severity with SHIM scores of 1-7 considered severe ED, 8-11 moderate ED and 12-16 mild to moderate. Serum testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein) were assessed along with plasma fasting glucose and HbA1c. Weight, BMI and waist circumference were also recorded.A significant association was observed between severity of ED and mean weight (p = 0.000), waist circumference (p = 0.000), triglycerides (p = 0.009), total cholesterol (p = 0.027), HbA1c (p = 0.000), fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and AMS scores (p = 0.043). No significant differences were seen in testosterone fractions and SHBG levels between ED subgroups. A positive correlation existed between the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) and ED severity in this cohort (p = 0.018).The descriptive data of our cohort show that increased severity of ED within LOH patients correlated with an increased waist circumference, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlipidemia and a history of diabetes mellitus. Severe ED functions as a prognostic indicator of co-morbidities in men with LOH.",

It affects negatively quality of life and it represents a risk factor for other pathologies, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. No silver bullet exists to hinder sarcopenia, but it may be counteracted by physical exercise, nutrition, and a proper endocrine milieu. Indeed, we aim to analyze the scientific literature to give to clinician effective advices to counteract sarcopenia.Main text: Physical exercise, proper nutrition, optimized hormonal homeostasis represent the three pillars to fight sarcopenia. Physical exercise represents the most effective remedy to face sarcopenia, in particular if it is combined with a proper diet and with an adequate endocrine milieu. Consistency in training, adequate daily protein intake and eugonadism seems to be the keys to fight sarcopenia. The combination of these three pillars might act synergistically.Conclusions: Optimization of these factors may increase their efficiency; however, scientific data may be sometimes confusing so far. Therefore, we aim to give practical advices to clinician to identify and to highlight the most important aspects in each of these three factors that should be addressed.",

Antioxidants supplementation can potentially improve cryopreservation outcomes. In this study, we tried to investigate the effects of sericin supplementation in freezing and thawing media on frozen-thawed human sperm motility, morphology, viability, and DNA fragmentation. In experiment 1, semen samples were collected from 30 healthy fertile men and were cryopreserved in the presence of freezing medium supplemented with different concentrations of sericin (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5%). The results showed that the addition of 2.5 and 5% sericin in freezing medium significantly increased sperm viability and total motility (A + B) and decreased DNA fragmentation (P < 0.05). In experiment 2, semen samples were collected from 21 fertile men and were cryopreserved in freezing medium without any supplementation for 48 h. Then, the samples were thawed in medium supplemented with different concentrations of sericin (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5%). The addition of 5% sericin to thawing medium increased the total motility, viability, and decreased DNA fragmentation compared with those in thaws without sericin. In nutshell, the results clearly indicate the feasibility of sericin as an cryoprotective supplement for freezing media in human spermatozoa.",

The quest for treatment regarding low levels of serum testosterone and male infertility has, therefore, worldwide relevance. Zinc has important biological actions insofar as the male reproductive physiology and endocrine system. In general, a common and safe recommendation for zinc in the treatment of male hypogonadism is 220 mg of zinc sulfate (equivalent to 50 mg of elemental zinc) twice a day, over one to four months. Additionally, it may be further required to extend, both the treatment, dose and daily fractionation of this mineral. Albeit medicinal doses of zinc may increase total testosterone and improve sperm count, the current body of evidence does not suggest broad recommendations regarding the use of zinc for all types of hypogonadism. In many cases, the use of zinc supplements is insufficient, with the use of surgery and drugs being required for an effective treatment.",

Concurrent increases in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; p < 0.05) resulted in a lack of change to either bioavailable or calculated free testosterone (p > 0.05) amongst SED.Although resting levels of systemic total testosterone increased in response to 6 weeks of exercise training, increases in SHBG negated any potential relationship between calculated-free or bioavailable testosterone.

We pooled results after 1 year of TTh to obtain more statistical power. Results for group T after 2 years of TTh are also presented. We evaluated wide assortment of biochemical (fasting plasma glucose—FPG, glycated hemoglobin—HbA1c and lipid profile), hormonal, vascular (flow-mediated dilatation—FMD and intima-media thickness—IMT), anthropometrical and derived parameters (BMI, HOMA-IR, non-HDL cholesterol, bioavailable and calculated free testosterone). Quality of life was assessed using Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) questionnaire.Results FPG, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and IMT decreased, FMD increased, lipid profile and AMS sexual sub-score improved, and testosterone levels fully normalized after 2 years of TTh.Conclusions Two-year of TTh resulted in normalized serum testosterone levels, improved glycemia, endothelial function, lipids and insulin sensitivity, and quelled the symptoms of hypogonadism, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk in obese men with FH and T2D.",

The results indicated that increased testosterone levels in women were associated with a higher risk of breast and cervical cancers but a lower risk of ovarian cancer. Conversely, increased testosterone was linked to lower stomach cancer risk for men, whereas high SHBG levels were related to decreased risks of breast and prostate cancers. The corresponding genes of the identified SNPs, as revealed by pathway enrichment analysis, were involved in significant metabolic and proliferative pathways. These findings emphasize the need for further research into the biological mechanisms behind these associations, paving the way for potential targeted interventions in preventing and treating these cancers.",

Blue laser vaporization, a novel approach for BPH treatment, has yet to be thoroughly investigated for its effects on sexual function. This prospective study assesses the impact of blue laser vaporization on sexual function in BPH patients, focusing on patient perceptions. This study prospectively enrolled BPH patients undergoing blue laser vaporization at our hospital since January 2023. We evaluated the treatment's effectiveness and its impact on preserving sexual function using standardized questionnaires. These included the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire for Ejaculatory Dysfunction (MSHQ-EjD), and both the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire for Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-MLUTS) and its sexual function component (ICIQ-MLUTSsex). We included 67 BPH patients with a median age of 65 years in this study, monitoring them for over three months. The results indicate that blue laser vaporization significantly improved International Prostate Symptom Score, Quality of Life, and ICIQ-MLUTS scores in BPH patients (p < 0.001), along with a reduction in post-void residual volume (p < 0.001). Importantly, there were no significant changes in the IIEF-5 score, MSHQ-EjD score, and ICIQ-MLUTSsex score, indicating preservation of sexual function post-surgery. Blue laser vaporization effectively alleviates lower urinary tract symptoms in BPH patients while preserving erectile and ejaculatory functions.",

Methods: PCa patients who underwent RP were prospectively enrolled and randomized into standard PFMT (S-PFMT) group, somatosensory interactive PFMT (SI-PFMT, an enhanced PFMT) group, and standard PFMT combined with magnetic stimulation (S-PFMT+MS) group. SUI status was evaluated through the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) scores and 1-hour pad test. Results: 101 subjects were enrolled, including 48 in S-PFMT group, 39 in SI-PFMT group, and 14 in S-PFMT+MS group. All groups showed significant ICIQ-UI SF score improvement at 3 and 6 months post-RP compared with baseline (all p < 0.001). At 6 months post-RP, significant improvement of 1-hour pad test result was observed (p = 0.012). Compared with those in the other two groups, patients in the S-PFMT+MS group exhibited significantly better SUI improvement (p = 0.033 vs. S-PFMT; p = 0.011 vs. SI-PFMT) at 6 months. Bayesian survival analysis revealed the superior efficacy of the S-PFMT+MS intervention over an extended period. Conclusions: PCa patients may benefit from magnetic stimulation in addition to standard PFMT for post-RP SUI recovery. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: HKUCTR-3029, https://www.hkuctr.com/.",

This study set out to conduct a translation and cultural validation of the 'Aging Males' Symptoms' (AMS) scale, originally developed in German, into English for use in North America and the UK. Following international methodological recommendations, the AMS scale was translated in a standardized way consisting of forward translation, quality control, backward translation and a pretest. Five experienced bilingual translators and reviewers were involved. Many difficulties of compatibility between the cultural backgrounds of Germany, the UK and North America were identified and resolved by consensus. This resulted in one version for British and American English. A pretest in volunteers demonstrated clarity and understandability across social classes, but also suggested minor changes in the instrument. A preliminary test-retest comparison of the final scale showed high reliability with a correlation coefficient of 0.93 for the total AMS score. The AMS scale is a valuable tool for assessing symptoms in the aging male. This scale can be used in German and English speaking countries. Flemish and Finnish versions are also in use.",

The positive effects of testosterone treatment on all of the above parameters persisted in this 3-year follow-up. The benefits occurred independent of age (equally in the older and younger subjects). The positive effects of transdermal testosterone gel on bone mineral density previously identified at 6 months of treatment, continued with time. The positive effects on bone mineral density were greater in the spine than the hip. There were minimal effects on lipid levels. Levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increased with testosterone treatment but, in general, remained in the normal range. Three subjects (1.8%) were shown to have elevated PSA and biopsy-proven prostate cancer. It was not possible to determine if this incidence is above the background rate.

The subjects included ten men with primary hypogonadism and 29 with andropause with sexual dysfunction as the most common problem. The changes in subjective symptoms were evaluated by the PNUH QoL scoring system and the St. Louis University Questionnaire for androgen deficiency in aging males (ADAM). Digital rectal examination (DRE) was performed and serum testosterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and liver profile were monitored. Testosterone undecanoate treatment (n = 33) significantly improved sexual dysfunction and symptom scores of metabolic, cardiopulmonary, musculo-skeletal and gastrointestinal functions compared to baseline and to placebo (n = 6). ADAM score also significantly improved after 3 months of treatment. Serum testosterone was significantly increased compared to pretreatment levels only in the testosterone undecanoate group. In the placebo group, no significant changes compared to baseline were found for testosterone levels and QoL questionnaires. No abnormal findings were detected on DRE or laboratory findings in either group. Adverse events, such as gastrointestinal problems and fatigue, were mild and self-limiting. It is concluded that androgen supplement therapy with oral testosterone undecanoate (Andriol) restores the quality of life through improvement of general body functions in men with testosterone deficiency.",

    "abstract": "The existence of the so-called 'andropause' is an irrefutable fact, although the terms 'SLOH' (symptomatic late-onset hypogonadism) or 'symptomatic ADAM' (androgen deficiency of the aging male) are more accurate. The term 'andropause' is, in most cases, inappropriate, except when the gonads cease functioning. Testosterone production decreases as a function of age, but this decrease is not universal. Several clinical manifestations are associated with hypogonadism, but these are not solely attributable to hypogonadism. Other hormones (i.e. dehydroepiandrosterone, growth hormone, thyroxine and melatonin) also decrease with age. Such multi-hormone alterations are closely inter-related and may influence 'andropause-related' symptoms. Many patients with SLOH, although by no means all, respond well to testosterone therapy. Although testosterone therapy can induce adverse effects, these can be largely minimized by proper monitoring by a knowledgeable clinician. Extrapolation of the effects of estrogens + progesterone in menopausal women to the use of testosterone in hypogonadal men is mythical, and more research on the effect of exogenous sex steroids in aging men and women is needed. However, to restrict the prescription of such hormones until all issues have been fully addressed is impossible. Indeed, the discourse on SLOH would benefit considerably from more science and less speculation.",

Body mass index and waist to hip ratio were calculated and total body fat mass and percentage of abdominal deposit were investigated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Dpx ( + ) Lunar, USA). The serum levels of sex hormones and insulin were measured using commercial radioimmunoassay and IRMA (by SHBG) kits (DPC, USA). The serum levels of lipids and glucose were assessed by means of enzymatic methods.Results Men with coronary artery disease had lower total testosterone levels (17.01 ± 6.42 vs. 19.37 ± 6.58 nmol/l; p < 0.05), testosterone/estradiol ratio (228.5 ± 88.5 vs. 289.8 ± 120.1; p < 0.05) and free androgen index (FAI) (59.49 ± 14.79 vs. 83.03 ± 25.81; p < 0.0001), and higher levels of estrone (49.5 ± 27.7 vs. 36.6 ± 12.7 pg/ml) than men in the control group. Moreover, men with coronary artery disease were more insulin-resistant than controls and had an atherogenic lipid profile. There was an inverse correlation (p < 0.05) between testosterone level and serum level of glucose (r = −0.29), triglycerides (r = −0.37), body mass index (r = −0.55), waist (r = −0.43), total body fat mass (r = −0.3) and fasting insulin resistance index. A significant positive association (p < 0.05) was found between testosterone and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and high density lipoprotein cholesterol level in serum (r = 0.26).Conclusions Low levels of total testosterone, testosterone/estradiol ratio and free androgen index and higher levels of estrone in men with coronary artery disease appear together with many features of metabolic syndrome and may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis.",

Arterial stiffness chronicles the cumulative burden of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Therefore, the capacity of LTL to predict arterial stiffness was examined.Methods. A total of 275 unrelated Chinese males: 163 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 112 healthy controls, 40–73 years of age were included in this study. The relative telomere length of leukocytes was determined by a real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Large artery stiffness was measured with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV).Results. The relative telomere length (T/S) ratio was significantly shorter in patients with CAD (0.79 ± 0.26) than in control subjects (1.08 ± 0.22) (p < 0.001). The correlation between LTL and PWV in patients with CAD was stronger than that in the controls (r = −0.467, r2 = 0.227, p < 0.001 for patients with CAD versus r = −0.223; r 2 = 0.050; p = 0.018 for controls).

The data show an association of leukocyte telomere length shortening with increased arterial stiffness and cardiovascular burden, suggesting that telomere length is a biomarker of large artery elasticity and CAD. Further studies are warranted to study the role of LTL dynamics in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

Eighty-six men with SD and decreased levels of serum T and/or DHEA, participated in a study receiving oral T undecanoate (OTU) (n = 29) 80 mg twice daily, DHEA (n = 28) 50 mg twice daily, or placebo (n = 29). Outcomes included evaluation of sexual performance by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (ADAM), Aging Male Symtom Scale (AMS), and Global Assessment Questionnaire (GAQ) questionnaires. Biochemical evaluations included measurement of T and DHEA, prolactin, gonadotropins, and PSA.Results. Seventy-nine men completed the study. There were no significant differences in outcomes as assessed by four different instruments: the ADAM, IIEF, AMS, and GAQ in regard to sexual interest or erectile function. Biochemically, a significant increase in serum DHEA between baseline and final visit was documented in the group receiving DHEA. The levels of T, on the other hand, increased insignificantly between entry and final visit in the T cohort. No biochemical changes were observed in the placebo group. Levels of PSA remained stable in all three groups.Conclusions. This study did not suggest a clinical benefit of OTU or DHEA supplementation in men with hypoandrogenism and SD. The recommended dose of OTU may have been inadequate or poorly absorbed. Increased doses or an alternative T delivery form may result in a different response.",

Among IPSS and CLSS symptoms, factors other than daytime frequency and incomplete emptying showed significant correlation with the total IIEF-5 score. A multivariate regression model indicated nocturia and urethral pain as independent factors for low IIEF-5 scores.

The study included 455 ≥ 65 year older men of InCHIANTI study, Italy, with complete data on testosterone levels, hand grip strength, cross-sectional muscle area (CSMA), short physical performance battery (SPPB). Linear models were used to test the relationship between gonadal status and determinants of physical performance.Results. Three different groups of older men were created: (1) severely hypogonadal (N = 23), total testosterone levels ≤230 ng /dl; (2) moderately hypogonadal (N = 88), total testosterone >230 and < 350 ng/dl) and (3) eugonadal (N = 344), testosterone levels ≥350 ng/dl. With increased severity of hypogonadal status, participants were significantly older while their BMI was substantially similar. In the age and BMI adjusted analysis, there was a significant difference in haemoglobin levels, hand grip strength and SPPB score (p for trend < 0.001) among three groups, with severely hypogonadal men having lower values of haemoglobin, muscle strength and physical performance. We found no association between testosterone group assignment and calf muscle mass and 4 m walking speed. In the multivariate analysis grip strength (p for trend = 0.004) and haemoglobin (p for trend < 0.0001) but not SPPB and other determinants of physical performance were significantly different between the three groups.Conclusions. In older men, gonadal status is independently associated with some determinants (haemoglobin and muscle strength) of physical performance.",

Patients were subdivided into four treatment groups: oral testosterone (T) (T undecanoate, 80 mg/d), transmucosal T (60 mg/d), transdermal T (30 mg/d) or no treatment (control), and evaluated at 0 and 6 months. FPG, hemoglobin (Hb), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total T were measured and the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index was calculated. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fitness level (6-min walking test), Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, handgrip strength and energy expenditure with physical activity (Minnesota questionnaire for Leisure Time Physical Activity (LTPA)) were evaluated and a \"frailty score\" (based on: grip strength, gait speed and LTPA) was calculated. T levels increased in all treatment groups; the oral T group had values still in the hypogonadal range (5.9 ± 1.1 nmol/L). PSA and Hb concentrations did not change in any group. BMI, waist circumference, FPG and HOMA-IR improved in all T-treated groups after 6 months, with a greater effect seen with transmucosal and transdermal T compared with oral T. This study indicates that low-to-intermediate dose TRT may be safely utilized in LOH patients to ameliorate somatic and psychological frailty symptoms in association with improved anthropometric and glycometabolic parameters in aging, overweight men with LOH and impaired fasting glucose.",

Until 5 years ago there was no indication that men with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) had subnormal serum T. But recent studies indicate that about 10% of men with T1DM suffer from hypogonadism, as a rule aged men and men with obesity. While hypogonadal men with T2DM benefit from normalization of their serum T, this has not been investigated in men with T1DM. Nine men with T1DM, erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism (total testosterone ≤ 12 nmol/L) received testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). In seven men TRT was intermitted: one man with prostate malignancy and six men because of problems of reimbursement. Incidentally, this provided an opportunity to monitor the effects of withdrawal and of the reinstatement of TRT. In all men, glycemic control (serum glucose and HbA1c), weight, waist circumference, lipid profiles and erectile function improved upon TRT. The seven men whose TRT was intermitted showed a deterioration which improved again upon reinstatement of TRT. The data suggest that aging and obese men with T1DM might have subnormal T levels and that their glycemic control, lipid profiles and erectile function might benefit from TRT.",

Here, we evaluate the agreement between the radioimmunoassay (RIA) and calculated FT (cFT) versus equilibrium dialysis (EqD), considered the gold standard.Methods: Fifty-six consecutive men (aged 26–77) had blood samples assessed for FT, including men with treated and untreated testosterone deficiency (TD) and men without TD. Samples were split and tested by the two methodologies at a Quest Diagnostics national reference laboratory. cFT was calculated by the Vermeulen method.Results: A robust correlation was noted for RIA and EqD (r = 0.966) and for cFT and EqD (r = 0.986). Strong correlations were observed for men receiving testosterone therapy and for men in the lowest and highest quartiles for total and FT. The correlation of total testosterone with FT was similar for cFT (r = 0.843), RIA (r = 0.806), and EqD (r = 0.809). Sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was not correlated with any measure of FT. Bland–Altman analysis demonstrated similar bias for both cFT and RIA, although cFT consistently overestimated FT. Numerical values for RIA were approximately one seventh of EqD values.Conclusions: These results support the clinical use of both RIA and cFT as measures of FT. Due to numerical differences, each test requires its own set of reference values.",

Thus, the current challenge is to identify better those individuals for whom specific screening tools and a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) would be beneficial. On the basis of the recommendations of the Prostate Cancer Working Group in the International Society of Geriatric Oncology, older patients with prostate cancer should be managed according to their individual health status and not by their age. CGA is the best tool for determining the health status of an older patient. In this article, we sought to assemble all available evidence on the models of CGA and the prevalence of geriatric conditions in older patients with prostate cancer.

Therefore, the present study investigated the relationship between bone mineral densitometry measurements, bone markers, endocrine hormones and blood lead levels.Material and methods: The present study included lead exposure patients (n: 30) and control subjects (n: 32). We recorded information on patient demographics and risk factors of osteoporosis. Blood lead levels were evaluated using Varian AA 240Z atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Bone mineral density measurements were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.Results: Each lumbar T and Z scores in the lead exposure group were lower than the control group. There were no significant differences in femur neck and femur total T and Z scores between two groups. Blood lead levels were also negatively correlated with lumbar 2-4 T score, total lumbar T score, lumbar 2-4 Z score and total lumbar Z score. Urinary hydroxyproline and urinary deoxypyridinoline levels in the lead exposure group were significantly higher compared to controls. Blood lead levels were strong, positively correlated with urinary deoxypyridinoline. Endocrine hormone levels and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 levels were comparable between lead exposure and control group.Conclusion: Lead exposure in male workers is an important factor for deterioration in bone mineral density. We should be screening blood lead levels and history of lead exposure in male osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "The Aging Male's Symptoms (AMS) scale and the Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (ADAM) questionnaire have been widely used for screening men suspected of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH). We evaluated the consistency of the two questionnaires with sex hormone levels. A total of 985 men completed the two questionnaires, as well as an analysis of the serum levels of total testosterone (TT), bioavailable testosterone (BT), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), prolactin (PRL) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). No correlation was observed between any hormone level and the psychological or somatic section of the AMS score, whereas the sexual section was correlated with the levels of FT, LH, FSH, SHBG and BT. Significant correlations were observed between the result of the two questionnaires and these hormone levels. When LOH was defined as TT < 300 ng/dl and FT < 5 ng/dl, the sensitivity and specificity of the AMS scale were 54.0% and 41.2% compared with 78.7% and 14.8% for the ADAM questionnaire. Several sex hormone levels correlated with the two questionnaires, but neither of these questionnaires had sufficient sensitivity and specificity. It is necessary to provide a new questionnaire applicable to the Chinese population to screening LOH.",

Hence the study was designed to analyze the expression pattern of PI3K/AKT and apoptotic components in patients with BPH.Materials and methods A total of 27 BPH patients aged between 55 and 75 years were recruited in the study and prostatic tissues were obtained after transurethral resection of the prostate. Gene expression levels of PI3K and AKT were assessed by q-PCR. Apoptotic components like BcL-2, caspase-3, caspase-9, BAD, and p-BAD were analyzed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry.Results Gene expression of PI3K (p85-A) (p = .02), AKT1 (p < .01) and AKT2 (p < .01), and protein expression of BcL-2 (p < .01) and caspase-9 (p < .01) were significantly increased in BPH patients with larger prostate size compared to smaller prostate size.Conclusions Overexpression of PI3K/AKT pathway and BcL-2 were associated with reduced apoptosis and increased prostate size in BPH.",

The primary aim of this study was to establish the influence of lifelong training history on serum T, cortisol (C) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in aging men. A secondary aim was to determine the agreement between serum and salivary measurement of steroid hormones in ageing men.Methods: Serum and salivary steroid hormones (serum C, T and SHBG, and salivary measures of C and T) were determined and compared between two distinct groups; lifelong exercising males (LE [n = 20], 60.4 ± 4.7 year) and age matched lifelong sedentary individuals (SED [n = 28], 62.5 ± 5.3 years).Results: T-test revealed a lack of significant differences for serum C or SHBG between LE and SED, while Mann-Whitney U revealed a lack of differences in total T (TT), bioavailable T (bio-T) or free testosterone (free-T). Further, salivary T (sal-T) did not correlate with serum markers of T in LE, SED, or when pooled (r = 0.040; p > 0.05).Conclusions: Findings from this investigation suggested that resting levels of serum T and calculated free-T was unable to distinguish between diverse lifelong training histories in aging men. Further, sal-T was not an appropriate indicator of serum T and calculated free-T values in older males and considerable caution should be exercised when interpreting sal-T measurements in aging males.",

TT and FT levels were significantly lower in older men.Conclusions: Subjects with low TT and FT levels had low Hb and Hct levels. This suggests that TT and FT play a significant role in erythropoiesis. Testosterone replacement therapy may be effective in men with hypogonadism to reduce the incidence of anemia.",

Among individual score components, it has been found that subjects with PCa were less likely to consume olive oil as the main culinary fat, vegetables, fruits and fish than those without. However, these differences were not statistically significative. A high intake of fruit, vegetables and cooked tomato sauce Mediterranean style (sofrito) was related to less PCa aggressiveness.

Dynamics of symptoms and indicators in each group were evaluated in comparison with their data at the beginning and end of the study. Parameters were the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) for urinary symptoms and quality of life (QoL), ultrasound measurement of prostate volume (PV) and uroflowmetry (maximum flow rate, Qmax). TT effectiveness was examined in 124 men with BPH and PV <60 mL. We also investigated the data of five patients with BPH and PV >60 mL.Results: TT decreased urinary symptoms and PV, increased Qmax and improved QoL in men with BPH, PV <60 mL, and in men with BPH, PV >60 mL.Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that TT is effective for BPH, suggesting that blood circulation plays a crucial role in its cause. The continuous heat exposure that does not exceed the normal body temperature terminates the trigger of BPH development, \"micro-focus\" of hypothermia, and the following spontaneous expansion of capillaries.

Physical performance was evaluated by usual gait speed (UGS), nutritional status, and frailty were screened by mini-nutritional assessment (MNA) questionnaire and FRAIL scale. Depression was diagnosed through a psychiatric interview and the administration of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).Participants with depression were similar to participants without depression regarding age (p = .055), education (p = .095), frailty (p = .857), and HGS scores (p = .053). The group with depression had longer CSST duration (p = .023), slower UGS (p = .027), and more malnutrition (p = .001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that only the malnutrition was independently associated factor with depression after adjusting for confounding factors.Depression is associated with malnutrition and some components of sarcopenia in geriatric outpatients. Our results revealed that sarcopenia might be associated with depression through malnutrition. If malnutrition lasts for a long time, sarcopenia may become evident in the later stages of depression.",

    "abstract": "Phytochemicals have played a vital role in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Although synthetic drugs can produce dramatic results in most cases, the side-effects associated with them are a major concern. The source of many compounds used in modern medicine today can be traced down to plant origin. Whether or not scientific justification is available for the use of most plant products, the continued use of these compounds is due to their safety profile, ease of availability and also economic reasons. Each medicinal plant that has been used in the traditional system of medicine must be scientifically tested in order to bring forth its active principle that might be effectively used as a phytomedicine. In this vast resource of phytoproducts there are various plants that are claimed to improve the sexual deficiency in man. Tribulus terrestris Linn. (TT) is one such plant that has been used for a long time in both the Indian and Chinese systems of medicine. The plant is also said to possess various other pharmacological properties. The extract obtained from the air-dried aerial parts of this plant contains mainly steroidal glycosides, the major saponin being protodioscin (PTN). In our study on this plant product it was observed that PTN produced a moderate increase in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in primates following bolus intravenous administration of the TT extract at doses of 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg body weight. It also improved libido, sexual activity and intracavernous pressure in rats following TT extract administration orally (for 8 weeks at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight) and had a proerectile effect on the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle of rabbits (orally for 8 weeks at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight). In this article, the various pharmacological effects of TT have been reviewed and our studies based on TT extract in relation to male erectile dysfunction have been summarized.",

In addition, these parameters were correlated with aging and body composition. Muscle mass decreased and fat mass increased significantly with age. Both age and free testosterone were independent determinants of fat mass. Abdominal fat was by far the most important determinant of free testosterone levels, gluteal fat contributing little to the free testosterone levels. The decrease of fat free mass was essentially correlated with age, the contribution of free testosterone levels being marginal. The ratio of subcutaneous to visceral fat decreased with age, independent of body mass index, free testosterone or estradiol levels. This suggests that, at a similar degree of obesity, the health hazards are more pronounced in elderly men.IGF-I levels correlated negatively with fat mass, but this correlation was lost after adjustment for age. The negative correlation of fat mass with (free) testosterone levels persisted after correction for IGF-I levels, suggesting that the decrease of free testosterone levels is an independent co-determinant of the age-associated increase in fat mass. Hence, it may be concluded that the age-associated decrease in androgen levels plays an important role in the changes in body composition, independent of the effect of age itself or the age-associated decrease in IGF-I levels.",

At presentation these patients had complaints possibly related to partial androgen deficiency in the aging male. Hormonal parameters were measured and specific aging male questionnaires, such as Androgen Deficiency in Aging Male (ADAM) and Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale questionnaires were completed. The median age was 59 (range 53-66) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.4 +/- 3.3 kg/m2. Mean testosterone was 479.8 +/- 149.0 ng/dl and mean free testosterone was 10.0 +/- 3.0 ng/dl. Only 7.1% of all patients were diagnosed with 'idiopathic' ADAM. The majority of patients presented with erectile dysfunction. A wide variety of conditions were diagnosed, including hemochromatosis, micro- and macroprolactinoma, hypothyroidism, benign prostate hypertrophism and prostate carcinoma. The scores of AMS psychological, somatovegetative and sexual subscales were 12, 16 and 13, according to AMS classification corresponding to severe, moderate and severe complaints, respectively. There was no correlation between AMS (total and subscales) and testosterone levels. A positive correlation between the somatovegetative subscale of the AMS and both BMI and insulin was found. In conclusion, we observed that in a group of self-referred men andropause is not a frequent diagnosis, and other pathology needs to be addressed requiring a multi-disciplinary approach.",

Thirty-one community-dwelling healthy, elderly men (mean age 73.4 +/- 6.1 years) with a good nutritional status participated in the study. The Caltrac accelerometer was used to estimate energy expenditure related to physical activity. Subjects were divided into two groups according to the criteria proposed by Bauman: less active (< 1600 kcal/week) and more active (> 1600 kcal/week). In all the men, plasma total antioxidant status (TAS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were determined. The reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in hemolyzed red blood cells were also measured. There were no significant differences in TAS, H2O2 concentrations and the activity of GPx between less and more active men. In the group of more active subjects, plasma levels of GSH were higher, while TBARS concentrations were lower compared with the group of less active men (p < 0.05). Negative correlation between GSH and TBARS levels was observed (r = -0.71; p < 0.01), and GSH concentrations positively correlated with level of physical activity (r = 0.63; p < 0.05). The results indicate that habitual physical activity can favorably affect antioxidant potential and prevent lipid peroxidation in healthy, elderly men.",

The aim of the present trial was to evaluate the endocrine, neuroendocrine and clinical consequences of a long-term (1 year), low-dose (25 mg/day) replacement therapy in a group of aging men who presented the clinical characteristics of partial androgen deficiency (PADAM). Circulating DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione, total testosterone and free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, allopregnanolone, estrone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), cortisol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels were evaluated monthly to assess the endocrine effects of the therapy, while β-endorphin values were used as a marker of the neuroendocrine effects. A Kupperman questionnaire was performed to evaluate the subjective symptoms before and after treatment.The results showed a great modification of the endocrine profile; with the exception of cortisol levels, which remained unchanged, DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione, total and free testosterone, DHT, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, estrone, estradiol, GH, IGF-1 and β-endorphin levels increased significantly with respect to baseline values, while FSH, LH and SHBG levels showed a significant decrease. The Kupperman score indicated a progressive improvement in mood, fatigue and joint pain.In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that 25 mg/day of DHEA is able to cause significant changes in the hormonal profile and clinical symptoms and can counteract the age-related decline of endocrine and neuroendocrine functions. Restoring DHEA levels to young adult values seems to benefit the age-related decline in physiological functions but, however promising, placebo-controlled trials are required to confirm these preliminary results.",

In men, age-associated testosterone decline is one of the major factors that reduce quality of life. In patients and the physicians treating them, decreased energy levels and impairments to sex-life are perceived as the most important effects of hypogonadism. Two quality of life scales, the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) and the Age-Related Hormone Deficiency-Dependent Quality of Life (A-RHDQoL) scales, have recently been developed to specifically assess this patient population, and the A-RHDQoL found that memory, energy and physical capabilities, and sex-life were the factors most adversely affected by low testosterone levels. Unfortunately, there are limited data on the effects of testosterone on the quality of life of men with hypogonadism, but the information that exists suggests that testosterone can improve the quality of life significantly (to the same level as men with normal testosterone levels) and the more severe the symptoms before treatment, the greater the benefits of testosterone replacement. These promising early results need to be confirmed in more detailed quality of life studies.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone supplementation can help reduce many of the symptoms associated with androgen deficiency in the aging male by its effects on various parts of the body. Bone mineral density can decrease in the hypogonadal man and this may contribute to the increased fracture rate in the elderly. Testosterone therapy can improve bone mineral density and bone architecture by increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption - the possible benefits on fracture rate are unknown. Testosterone also improves body composition by reducing body fat mass and increasing lean body mass, and by increasing epidermal thickness, but its effects on muscle strength are still debated. In patients with diabetes and androgen deficiency, testosterone supplementation appears to reduce blood glucose and this could have important implications for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. The wide-ranging benefits of testosterone therapy in young and old men are clear and it appears that the route of administration (intramuscular, oral, or transdermal) does not alter this fact, but future work could illustrate even more profound effects of testosterone (e.g., in reducing cardiovascular risk) that could result in its recommended use in a wider range of patients.",

    "abstract": "Recent work shows a high prevalence of low testosterone and inappropriately low luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations in type 2 diabetes. This syndrome of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH) is associated with obesity in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the duration of diabetes or HbA1c are not related to HH. Furthermore, recent data show that HH is not associated with type 1 diabetes. C-reactive protein concentrations have been shown to be elevated in patients with HH and are inversely related to plasma testosterone concentrations. This inverse relationship between plasma free testosterone and C- reactive protein concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes suggests that inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. This is of interest since inflammatory mechanisms may have a cardinal role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. It is also relevant that in the mouse, deletion of the insulin receptor in neurons leads to HH in addition to a state of systemic insulin resistance. It has also been shown that insulin facilitates the secretion of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) from neuronal cell cultures. Thus, HH may be the result of insulin resistance at the level of the GnRH secreting neuron. Low testosterone concentrations are also related to an increase in total and regional adiposity. This review discusses these issues and attempts to make the syndrome relevant as a clinical entity. Clinical trials are required to determine whether testosterone replacement alleviates insulin resistance and inflammation. In addition, low testosterone levels are associated with an increase in cardiovascular events. Testosterone therapy may therefore, reduce cardiovascular risk. This important aspect requires further investigation.",

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that age-dependent changes in the bioavailability of H2S increased the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED). Methods: Young, adult (3-month) and older (18-month) male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6−8/group) were treated daily with sodium hydrosulfide hydrate (NaHS), DL-propargylglycine, sildenafil or l-NAME for 10 weeks. Subsequent to cavernous nerve electrical stimulation, intracavernosal pressure (ICP) responses were determined, and the samples were collected and processed for hormonal (plasma) and gaseous parameters (plasma and erectile corpus cavernosum [CC]) using standard assay protocols. Results: Aging significantly reduced the ICP response (35.9 ± 2.0 mmHg vs. 45.2 ± 1.9 mmHg in young controls), which was countered by NaHS (53.5 ± 6.0) or sildenafil (52.8 ± 9.8) treatment. In these rats, marked increments to testosterone (T) or estradiol resulted from NaHS supplementation. Similar to age-dependent decline in NO, the plasma and CC level of H2S was significantly lower in senescent rats when compared with young animals (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our results confirm that ED with aging may be linked to a derangement in the H2S pathway accompanied by low T levels. It is likely that a pharmacologic intervention delivering H2S will provide additional benefits to sexual function from an improved T milieu.",

A large web-based survey was undertaken over 3 years to study the scale of this missed diagnosis.An online questionnaire giving the symptoms characterising testosterone deficiency syndrome (Aging Male Symptoms-AMS-scale) was set up on three web sites, together with questions about possible contributory factors.Of over 10,000 men, mainly from the UK and USA, who responded, 80% had moderate or severe scores likely to benefit from testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). The average age was 52, but with many in their 40s when the diagnosis of 'late onset hypogonadism' is not generally considered. Other possible contributory factors to the high testosterone deficiency scores reported were obesity (29%), alcohol (17.3%), testicular problems such as mumps orchitis (11.4%), prostate problems (5.6%), urinary infection (5.2%) and diabetes 5.7%.In this self-selected large international sample of men, there was a very high prevalence of scores which if clinically relevant would warrant a therapeutic trial of testosterone treatment. This study suggests that there are large numbers of men in the community whose testosterone deficiency is neither being diagnosed nor treated.",

    "abstract": "Aim: An analysis of variations in diagnosing and treating testosterone (T) deficiency between different regions of the world in 2006 was repeated in 2010. Methods: Physicians were interviewed in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Saudi Arabia about (1) reasons to use/not to use T. (2) safety (prostate pathology) and other concerns in the decision not to provide T treatment. (3) the actual usage of T preparations for treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Results: More men were treated with T in 2010. ED and lack of libido (2006) but also depression and obesity (2010) were regarded as symptoms of T deficiency. For 70% of physicians, severity of complaints was more significant than the laboratory value of T to prescribe T, more so in Germany (96%) than in Spain and Saudi Arabia. Concerns about prostate disease remained strong and, therefore, 11% of eligible patients did not receive T. PDE-5 inhibitors are more often combined with T in 2010 for ED. Conclusion: More appropriate studies and more education of physicians are needed on diagnosing T deficiency, on the role of T in ED and on the evidence-based relative safety of T treatment.",

Methods: Between 2007 and 2010, serum total testosterone (TT), free testosterone, and estradiol were prospectively measured in patients who were transferred to our university hospital. The 924 subjects were divided into two groups. Group I (n = 646) were treated with an alpha blocker only and group II (n = 278) were treated with an alpha blocker + a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor over 3 months before their visit. Clinical conditions were assessed by digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), transrectal ultrasonography and maximum urinary flow rate and postvoid residual urine. Results: The mean age was 69.65 ± 6.56 years. The total IPSS and subscore (storage symptom) was significantly associated with age (p < 0.001/p < 0.05) and the TT level (p < 0.05/p < 0.05). TT level was significantly decreased in patients with ≥4 episodes of nocturia. The TT level was significantly related to the presence of severe LUTS (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Endogenous testosterone may have a beneficial effect on lower urinary tract function and that a high frequency of nocturia may induce testosterone deficiency.",

Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. Staining with propidium iodide (PI) followed by flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle phase.Results: hAMSC showed proper mesenchymal stem cells phenotype. We found that hAMSC conditioned media (CM) inhibited prostate cancer cells proliferation. Indeed, we demonstrated that hAMSC CM treatment increased percentage of G1 cancer cells and decreased percentage of cancer cells in S and G2M phases, suggesting that the hAMSC factors slow progression of prostate cancer cells through cell cycle inhibition.Conclusions: Our study provide evidences that hAMSC microenvironment secretes soluble factors able to inhibit prostate cancer cells growth.

Our objectives were to evaluate the relationship of sex-hormones profiles and frequency of depressive symptoms in 43 obese men, in a cross-sectional study. They had 19–60 years, and body mass index 30–50 kg/m2. LH, total and free testosterone (TT and FT), estradiol (E2), sex hormone binding globulin, estradiol/total testosterone ratio (E2/T) were analyzed. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by \"beck depression inventory\" (BDI), and significant depression was considered if BDI ≥ 16.Thirty-four (80%) presented low TT levels, but only 4 (14%) had low free testosterone and hypogonadism symptoms; 12 of 43 (28%) presented increased E2. Forty five (56%) presented depressive symptoms, but 16 (28% of the 45) had significant depression. BDI correlated positively with E2 (r = 0.407; p = 0.001) and E2/T (r = 0.473; p = 0.001), but not TT or FT. Patients with significant depressive showed higher levels of estradiol (136 ± 48 versus 103 ± 48 pg/ml, p = 0.02) and E2/T (16.0 ± 9.9 versus 9.8 ± 4.6; p = 0.002) (mean ± SD).In conclusion, obese men may present relatively excess of estradiol and deficiency in testosterone, leading to an imbalance between these two hormones. The greater this imbalance, the more depressive symptoms had our patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Heart failure (HF) is considered as a cardiogeriatric syndrome. Its fundamental pathophysiological feature is autonomic imbalance (and associated abnormalities within cardiovascular reflex control), but recent evidence suggests the involvement of deranged hormone metabolism. Both these neural and endocrine pathologies have serious clinical and prognostic consequences in patients with HF. We investigated the relations between autonomic status, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and hormone status in men with mild systolic HF.Methods: We examined 46 men with stable systolic HF (age: 62 ± 10 years, NYHA class I/II: 10/36 [22%/78%], ischemic aetiology: 72%, left ventricular ejection fraction: 32 ± 8%). Serum hormone levels (i.e. total testosterone [TT], dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate [DHEAS], oestradiol [E2], insulin-like growth factor type 1 [IGF-1] and cortisol) were assessed using immunoassays. Estimated free testosterone (eFT) was estimated using the Vermeulen's equation. Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed in time and frequency domains, based on 10-min resting recordings. BRS was estimated using the sequence method (BRS-Seq) and the phenylephrine test (BRS-Phe).Results: Deficiencies in circulating TT, eFT, DHEAS and IGF-1 (defined as a serum hormone ≤the 10th percentile calculated for the adequate age category in the cohort of healthy men) were found in respectively 13%, 30%, 55% and 93% of men with systolic HF. Serum SHBG ≥50 nmol/L and cortisol ≥700 nmol/L characterised, respectively 44% and 29% of men with HF. In multivariable models after the adjustment for clinical variables, the following relationships were found in examined men: DHEAS and SDNN (time domain of HRV defined as a standard deviation of average R–R intervals) (β = 0.29, p = 0.03); E2 and: HRV-LF (ms2) (β = 0.37, p = 0.01), HRV-HF (ms2) (β = 0.44, p = 0.02) and BRS-Phe (β = 0.51, p = 0.008); TT and: HRV-HF (%) (β = 0.35, p = 0.02), HRV-LF/HF ratio (β = −0.35, p = 0.02) and BRS-Seq (β = 0.33, p = 0.04).Conclusions: The observed associations between reduced circulating androgens, oestrogens and lower HRV and depleted BRS, irrespectively of HF severity suggest the pathophysiological links between these two mechanisms. These results constitute the premises to investigate whether the pharmacological supplementation of depleted hormones would enable to restore the autonomic balance and improve the efficacy of reflex control within the cardiovascular system in men with systolic HF.",

The lower urinary tract (LUT) condition was assessed on the scales International Prostate Symptom Score, Over Active Bladder Awareness Tool and uroflowmetry. The state of cognitive status was assessed on the scales Mini-mental State Examination, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler III, Color Trails Test, California Verbal Learning Test.Results: The values of cognitive function indicators in the individuals from all groups after treatment did not significantly differ from the respective values at the baseline (p > .05). The values of most HRQoL parameters of the functional state of the LUT significantly improved in groups A and B. A significant correlation between the state of cognitive status and HRQoL, as well as LUT was absent (r <0.3).Conclusion: The combination of solifenacin in a double dosage along with tamsulosin can be recommended for elderly benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with overactive bladder symptoms.",

The aim was to determine influence in the biochemical progression in PC. To evaluate the association between clinic pathological and immunohistochemical variables, Spearman's test was performed. Log-rank test and Kaplan–Meier curves were used for survival comparisons. To explore the correlation of the studied immunohistochemical parameters and the established prognostic variables with biochemical progression, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional Hazard regression analyses were performed. Spearman analysis showed correlation between stroma expression and tumor expression of PI3K with biochemical progression (p = .009, p = .004), respectively, and tumor immunohistochemical score with biochemical progression (p = .051). In the multivariate Cox regression model, only PI3K was retained as independent predictors of biochemical progression. In stroma expression, PI3K is (HR 0.172, 95% CI 0.065–0.452, p = .000); tumor expression, PI3K is (HR 0.087, 95% CI 0.026–0.293, p = .000), and tumor immunohistochemical score (HR 0.382, 95% CI 0.209–0.697 p = .002).

Then, we administered to each group a specific therapeutic scheme. Group A: treated with FSH alone for at least 3 months; group B: treated with hCG alone twice a week for 3 months and addition of FSH for poor responders (unmodified sperm parameters); group C: treated ab initio with FSH and hCG until the pregnancy was reached; group D: treated with FSH alone for 3 months and addition of hCG for moderate poor responders (increased TV but unmodified sperm parameters) or second cycle of FSH for 3 months for severe poor responders (unmodified TV and sperm parameters). After 6 months we evaluated the therapeutic response in term of sperm parameters normalization rate, spontaneous pregnancy rate, and sperm DNA fragmentation normalization rate.40% of patients became normozoospermic after treatment, while 30% achieved spontaneous pregnancy. B was the group that best responded to treatment in terms of normalization of seminal parameters; while the highest spontaneous pregnancy rate was obtained from the D group. B group also obtained the highest sperm DNA fragmentation normalization rate.To date, no reliable predictors of response to treatment with FSH exist, but TV and serum testosterone concentrations can help the clinician to choose the best therapeutic scheme for men with idiopathic infertility. The groups treated with a sequential temporal scheme (B and D groups) showed better clinical results compared with two groups treated with conventional schemes (A and C groups).",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for erectile dysfunction (ED). Penile prosthesis implantation surgery is the final solution for diabetic patients with ED, but infections thereof are still a serious risk factor. While some studies suggest that most infections associated with penile prosthesis implantation are associated to high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, other research did support such relationship.Materials and methods: The current study assessed retrospectively, the association between HbA1c level and penile prosthesis surgery infection. We retrieved and reviewed the records of 300 diabetic patients who had penile prosthesis surgery at our Institution (January 2012–November 2016). Patients' mean age was 55.26 ± 10.9 years (31% patients were <50 years of age), and mean HbA1c was 7.60 ± 1.90%.Results: Infection rate among diabetics was 0.67%. Prevalence of prosthesis infection among patients with HbA1c ≤ 9% was 0.9%, compared with 0% among patients with HbA1c > 9%. Prosthesis infection risk did not significantly increase with higher HbA1c levels, with no meaningful difference in the median or mean level of HbA1c in the infected and non-infected diabetic patients.Conclusion: Findings do not support the use of HbA1c values among diabetic patients who are candidates for penile prosthesis implantation surgery in order to identify and exclude those who might be prone to increased risk of prosthesis infections. Future studies would benefit from larger sample sizes in order to support or refute our findings.",

Three hundred and twenty one men received TU 1000 mg/12 weeks for up to 12 years following an initial 6-week interval (T-group), while 184 who opted against TTh served as controls (C-group). T-group patients exhibited decreased fatty liver index (FLI, calculated according to Mayo Clinic guidelines) (83.6 ± 12.08 to 66.91 ± 19.38), γ-GT (39.31 ± 11.62 to 28.95 ± 7.57 U/L), bilirubin (1.64 ± 4.13 to 1.21 ± 1.89 mg/dL) and triglycerides (252.35 ± 90.99 to 213 ± 65.91 mg/dL) over 12 years.

They underwent a detailed history and hormone study including total, free, bioavailable testosterone and estradiol. They completed the Sexual Health Inventory for Men and questions 11 and 12 of the IIEF15 were used to assess impairment in sexual desire. The T/E ratio was calculated, and the relationship between the different parameters and erectile function and sexual desire were studied by univariate and multivariate analysis. The mean age was 66.32 ± 8.17 years. The percentage of patients with erectile dysfunction was 60.9% (7% severe, 14.3% moderate, 12.6% mild to moderate and 27% mild) and decreased sexual desire was 46.5%. Age, free and biodisponible testosteron were the only variables with a positive linear association with erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual desire. Age was the only independent variable for both, erectile dysfunction and sexual desire, in the multiple linear regression. There was no association between a testosterone/estradiol imbalance and an alteration in erectile function and sexual desire.

As HIIT requires preconditioning exercise in sedentary cohorts, the study required three assessment phases; enrollment (phase A), following preconditioning exercise (phase B), and post-HIIT (phase C). Serum IGF-I was determined by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay.Results: IGF-I was higher in LEX compared to SED at baseline (p = 0.007, Cohen's d = 0.91), and phase B (p = 0.083, Cohen's d = 0.59), with only a small difference at C (p = 0.291, Cohen's d = 0.35). SED experienced a small increase in IGF-I following preconditioning from 13.1 ± 4.7 to 14.2 ± 6.0 μg·dl−1 (p = 0.376, Cohen's d = 0.22), followed by a larger increase post-HIIT (16.9 ± 4.4 μg·dl−1), which was significantly elevated compared with baseline (p = 0.002, Cohen's d = 0.85), and post-preconditioning (p = 0.005, Cohen's d = 0.51).

Small increases were observed in fat-free mass in both groups following HIIT (p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.32–0.45).Conclusions: In conclusion, HIIT with preconditioning exercise abrogates the age associated difference in IGF-I between SED and LEX, and induces small improvements in fat-free mass in both SED and LEX.",

Two factors that might contribute to this paradox are: underappreciation for the number of health issues that affect men more than women and unawareness that men's health receives less attention than women's health. Therefore, the aim of this article was to summarize the data related to these two factors. First, using mostly government data, an inventory of health issues that are more common in males than females was generated, with prevalence rates listed. Second, results from two new scientometric analyses are presented: (a) number of times \"men's health\" and \"women's health\" appeared in titles or abstracts of papers in PubMed from 1970 to 2018; and (b) number of journals currently indexed in MEDLINE that specialize in men's or women's health. The epidemiological data illustrate numerous health issues are more prevalent in men than women, and scientometric data reveal men's health has been given less attention as a distinct field of biomedical research than women's health. This information can help to educate legislators, health officials, journalists, and the general public about the current paradox surrounding men's health in the United States.",

    "abstract": "Currently, China has an increasingly aging population. However, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in this high-risk population for metabolic diseases remains unknown. This study investigates the age- and gender-specific prevalence and associated factors of MetS in the middle-aged and elderly Chinese population.Data were collected and subjected to descriptive statistics. Further, univariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relevant factors, and then multivariate logistic regression was selected to construct the final model.A total of 10,834 participants were included in the present study. The overall prevalence of MetS is 32.97% as defined by International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and 29.75% under National Cholesterol Education Program-The Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria. With aging, the prevalence of MetS descends in males while ascends in females. In the >70 years old group, the prevalence of MetS is three times higher in females than that in males (50.43% versus 16.03%). Across all age groups and sexes, the prevalence of MetS in urban areas is significantly higher than in rural areas. Besides, regardless of gender, the prevalence of MetS is the highest for those living in the north region (28.41% for males and 51.74% for females) and the lowest for those living in the southwest region (13.91% for males and 31.58% for females). Finally, an afternoon nap has been identified as a positively associated factor, while blood urea nitrogen (BUN) has been identified as a negatively associated factor (p < 0.05).The prevalence of MetS varies in different age groups, sexes, living areas, and regions. An afternoon nap is positively associated with the prevalence of MetS, while BUN is negatively associated with MetS.",

This narrative review aims to shed light on the risk and pharmacological management of ADT-induced depression in PCa patients.Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases using MESH keywords \"Prostate cancer OR prostate neoplasm\" AND \"Depression\" AND \"Androgen Deprivation Therapy\" AND \"antidepressants\". Search was limited to English and studies conducted on humans. Studies' titles and abstracts were screened, and further information were obtained from the text, if necessary, to decide whether studies are to be included in this review.Results: Our review revealed 23 studies confirming the occurrence and worsening of depressive symptoms in ADT-treated patients, which frequently require pharmacological interventions; whereas 10 studies indicated otherwise. All studies were prospective, retrospective, cross-sectional or case reports. Based on the incidence of depression provided by the observational studies, the average among ADT-treated patients was 18.23% (range: 2.1–46.9%), while it was 8.42% (range: 1.4–23.3%) in the non-ADT patients. Although several treatments have been used for depression in cancer patients, current knowledge lacks observational and controlled studies as well as clinical guidelines that demonstrate efficacy and safety of antidepressants and guide clinicians to the appropriate treatment in these patients, respectively. On the other side, a few clinical studies have been published regarding the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and/or saftey on other ADT associated adverse effects.Conclusions: Our work supports the recent attention towards mood issues as an adverse effect of ADT, and that greater awareness of this is warranted among clinicians. Clinical studies published regarding the use of antidepressants for other ADT associated adverse effects established the foundation that can be adopted to examine these therapies on ADT-induced depression.",

Both intramuscular injections of the long-acting ester T undecanoate (TU) and transdermal application of T gel offer a proven efficacy. As T has marked effects on hematopoiesis, an elevation of hematocrit has to be considered during T therapy.To compare the effects of a transdermal T gel with long-acting intramuscular TU on hematopoiesis, controlling for age, diagnosis, androgen receptor susceptibility and obesity.Prospective two-arm open registry, minimum duration of 26 weeks per patient. Putative modulators of erythropoiesis entering regression models were type of medication, type of hypogonadism, delta of total testosterone concentrations, waist circumference, age as well as (in a sub-group) androgen receptor gene CAG repeat length.Tertiary university based andrological outpatient department.802 hypogonadal men, 498 receiving T gel and 304 receiving intramuscular TU, median age 40 years (interquartile range = 25).Follow-up visits after initiation of treatment occurred between treatment weeks 26-30. Serum T concentrations increased markedly in both patient groups. Men receiving intramuscular TU exhibited an increased hematocrit (>50%) to a significantly higher amount than men receiving T gel (69/304 vs. 25/498, p < 0.001). Corresponding results were seen for higher values of hematocrit (>52% and >54%). Advanced age (p = 0.009), higher waist circumference (p = 0.01), higher delta testosterone (p = 0.007) and functional vs classical hypogonadism (p = 0.04) contributed to the effect in stepwise multiple regression models. Attenuated androgen action (longer androgen receptor CAG repeats) mitigated the effect (p = 0.01) in a subgroup of 574 patients. Men with anemia (hemoglobin ≤12.7 g/dl) were more likely to move out of the pathological range when receiving TU vs T gel (41/53 vs. 49/89 p = 0.01).T substitution with intramuscular TU or T gel increase T concentrations effectively. Long-acting TU leads to a higher rate of hematocrit levels >50%, whilst at the same time it seems to be more efficient to ameliorate anemia in the subgroup of respectively affected hypogonadal patients . This applies especially to obese older men with functional hypogonadism.",

Using results from large cohort studies we explore sources of biological and technical variance, and establish a reference range for adult men. It is constitutively secreted with little within-individual variation and reflects testicular capacity to produce testosterone. The main INSL3 assays available indicate good concordance with low technical variance; there is no effect of ethnicity. INSL3 declines with age from 35 years at about 15% per decade. Like low calculated free testosterone, and to a lesser extent low total testosterone, reduced INSL3 is significantly associated with increasing age-related morbidity, including lower overall sexual function, reflecting LCI. Consequently, low INSL3 (≤0.4 ng/ml; ca. <2 SD from the population mean) might serve as an additional biochemical marker in the assessment of functional hypogonadism (late-onset hypogonadism, LOH) where testosterone is in the borderline low range. Excluding individuals with low LCI (INSL3 ≤ 0.4 ng/ml) leads to an age-independent (> 35 years) reference range (serum) for INSL3 in the eugonadal population of 0.4 − 2.3 ng/ml, with low INSL3 prospectively identifying individuals at risk of increased future morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Objective. To investigate the age-related change of serum androgen levels in healthy men and to define a cut-off value of serum testosterone for the diagnosis of androgen deficiency in the aging male.Method. 1080 healthy men aged 20 to ⩾70 years old were enrolled in Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Chongqing. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone (T), calculated free testosterone (cFT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), 17beta-oestradiol (E2), the T/LH ratio, and T/SHBG as a free testosterone index (FTI) were all determined.Results. Serum total T did not significantly decline, but the cFT, T/LH and FTI progressively decreased with aging. To determine androgen deficiency, the 10th percentile value of men <40 years was defined as the lower cut-off value for cFT, T/LH or FTI, which were 0.3 nmol/L, 2.8 nmol/IU, and 0.4 nmol/IU respectively. With the median value of cFT of men aged between 20 and 49 years as the criterion, the level of cFT was lower in 2.82% of men from 40 to 49 years, in 19.53% from 50 to 59 years, in 22.57% from 60 to 69 years, and in 33.19% of men ⩾70 years. Taking the above value of cFT as the cut-off point, the prevalence of androgen deficiency in men 40–49 years was 13.0%, 31.8% in men 50–59 years, 30.1% in men 60 to 69 years, and 46.7% in men >70 years.Conclusions. (i). While serum total T values do not decline with aging, the levels of cFT gradually decline with aging; (ii) when using the value of cFT of the 10th percentile of men aged 20 to 39 years as the cut-off point, the prevalence of androgen deficiency was <15% before the age of 50 years, and about 30% thereafter, approaching 45% after the age of 70 years; and (iii) in this study the values of T/LH paralleled those of cFT closely; therefore, T/LH could serve as a surrogate for cFT.",

    "abstract": "Aging in the male is accompanied by steroid hormonal decline, and men may develop symptoms associated with hypogonadism. Increased awareness of 'andropause' in recent years has led to greater demand for hormonal assessments, resulting in a rising burden for health economics. We conducted a cross-sectional study to define men at risk for hypogonadism, in whom further hormonal investigation should be performed.We examined 664 blue-collar workers aged 40–60 years at their workplace and determined hormonal status and body mass index (BMI). Men with an abnormal urogenital status and those on medication that might affect endocrine status were excluded from the study. All participants completed the validated Aging Male Symptom (AMS) questionnaire and obtained scores for psychological symptoms, somatovegetative symptoms, and sexual symptoms.Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed a significantly increased risk (represented by the odds ratio) of psychological symptoms for men with low levels of testosterone and/or bioavailable testosterone (BAT). Increased BMI as well as low testosterone levels and/or low BAT levels raised the risk of somatovegetative symptoms. Each decrease of BAT by 1 ng/ml caused an approximately 1.8-fold increase of the risk (odds ratio = 1.832, p = 0.005). Additional independent risk factors were increased age and low luteinizing hormone (LH) level. Men aged 55 years with BMI > 28 kg/m2 and with somatovegetative symptoms and moderate or severe psychological symptoms had a 7.2-fold increase in the risk of a BAT level < 1.5 ng/ml compared to men without these risk factors (p < 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 71%, respectively.The AMS score combined with age and BMI provides an easy and convenient method to identify men with probable androgen deficiency who require hormonal assessment.",

    "abstract": "The accurate measurement of testosterone remains a challenge. The determination of the blood testosterone concentrations in serum by conventional immunoassays is inaccurate in men and even more so in females and children. A new luminescence enzyme immunoassay (LIA) has been developed and validated. The high analytical (8.7 pmol/L) and functional (17.3 pmol/L) sensitivity allows the quantification of the very low concentration in saliva, as well as in serum, after 1/40 dilution. This study measured salivary testosterone levels and compared the results with the free levels calculated from total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin in eugonadal and hypogonadal men. Salivary testosterone concentrations in healthy men in morning hours were 369 pmol/L (mean), range 263-544 pmol/L, which was statistically significantly higher than that in men with androgen deficiency, 215 pmol/L (mean), range 51-249 pmol/L. Repetitive determination of free testosterone concentrations in saliva (once a week for 5 weeks) showed high stability of results over time, with coefficient of variation 9% (range 5-23%).

    "abstract": "Objective. We examined age associated variation in salivary testosterone values among Japanese males as well as anthropometric measurements.Methods. Salivary samples were collected in pretreated sodium azide treated tubes. The first series: 15–79-year-old males (n = 99); two morning and two evening samples were collected at home for two days. The second series: 90-year-old males (n = 29); one morning sample was collected. Testosterone values were determined using an iodine125-based radioimmunoassay kit modified for saliva.Results. Results show 1) a significant decrease in salivary testosterone values from 20s to 40s and older, 2) no significant decline after 40 through 90 years old, 3) no significant age-related differences in the degree of intraindividual diurnal fluctuation across age groups of 40–70s, and 4) higher BMI is associated with the lower salivary testosterone among 40–70s.Conclusions. These results suggest that neither a constant decrease of salivary testosterone values or markedly reduced intraindividual fluctations are universal aspects of aging. Older males may maintain relatively high testosterone levels compared to younger men and a relatively 'robust' neuroendocrinological system.",

    "abstract": "The study of the health status of the aging male takes presently a more integrative approach and it appears that ailments typical of male aging, such as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), (visceral) obesity, metabolic syndrome and erectile failure are significantly interrelated. A common denominator of the above ailments is lower-than-normal testosterone levels occurring in a significant proportion of elderly men. This review addresses the potential connections between LUTS and late-onset hypogonadism. In animal studies there appear to be androgen and estrogen receptors in the urothelium and smooth muscle cells of the urethra and bladder of the rat and rabbit, as well as in the neurons in the autonomic ganglia of the prostatic plexus of the male rat. Upon castration electrically evoked relaxations of the smooth muscle of the prostatic urethra were decreased. There is a Rho-kinase activation/endothelin pathway; possibly involved in the increased smooth muscle activity found in both LUTS/benign prostate hyperplasia. Nitric oxide (NO) appears to have a smooth muscle relaxing effect in the urogenital organs. Studies in humans have convincingly shown that phosphodiestererase inhibitors have a beneficial effect on LUTS. More intervention studies should be undertaken to test the clinical validity of the theoretically plausible interrelationship between LUTS and late-onset hypogonadism.",

    "abstract": "Although multiple forms of testosterone replacement therapy are available to treat hypogonadism, none is ideal. This article reports on the pharmacokinetics of an innovative nasal formulation of testosterone in hypogonadal men. The first study was undertaken in eight men with a baseline total testosterone (TT) of 130.8 ± 87.4 ng/dL and examined the pharmacokinetics of nasal testosterone given in a single dose of 7.6 mg, 15.2 mg or 22.8 mg, respectively. The second study examined the pharmacokinetics of nasal testosterone (7.6 mg) given either twice or three times a day in 21 severely hypogonadal men (baseline TT in 20 patients <50 ng/dL, in one patient 152 ng/dL) for 14 days. The steady-state concentration of testosterone was within the normal range in all treatment groups, but only in the 3-times-a-day group was the 95% confidence interval completely within the physiological range. The average DHT level did not exceed the upper range of normal. The clinical global visual analogue scale improved in the whole group receiving testosterone (p < 0.001). All adverse events in both studies were of mild to moderate intensity and were evaluated as unlikely or not related to the administered study drug. No patients dropped out during treatment.Comparison with the normal circadian rhythm by computer modelling suggests that nasal testosterone can be used to mimic the normal diurnal pattern in eugonadal men. Thus, nasal testosterone can be administered safely to humans in doses that approximate serum concentrations in the normal physiological range.",

The main outcomes were to identify what agreement exists in Canada, what issues were still controversial, and what research remains to be addressed.Six recommendations based on expert opinion addressed these main themes: investigate with morning total testosterone (TT) followed by repetition and reflexive testing of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) if testosterone is 8-15 nmol/L with automatic calculation of cBAT; discontinue the use of analogue free testosterone assays; and definitive methods and standards must be available to ensure standardized results.Total testosterone is a reliable marker for the initial investigation of men presenting with symptoms of hypogonadism; cBAT is a reasonable follow-up test in patients with equivocal biochemical or consistent symptomatic findings.",

Testosterone deficiency is having an increasing impact on men's health because of global aging, higher levels of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome and adverse environmental factors such as stress xenoestrogens and anti-androgens. The question addressed is to what extent the large body of evidence on the benefits and safety of testosterone therapy is applied in clinical practice.Methods. Demographic data for men over the age of 50 from different regions of the world have been compared with the number of men in that age group estimated from sales figures to be receiving testosterone treatment.Results. On the basis of estimate that 20% of men over 50 in the general population of each region could be expected to have testosterone deficiency symptoms, on average only these men (0.69%) in most European countries were receiving treatment. Proportion was higher in the UK (1.00%) and Germany (1.89%), but lower in France (0.49%), Italy (0.51%) and Russia (0.54%). Interestingly, Australia had higher figures (1.64%), in spite of tight state control measures on androgen use. The USA has the highest treatment rate (7.96%) and this is increasing rapidly.If the basis for the diagnosis was the more conventional combination of symptoms plus biochemical evidence of low total and free testosterone levels, androgen deficiency would be expected in at least 5% of men over 50, and percentage treatment rates therefore four times higher. However, even on that basis, only in the USA do these exceed 10%.Conclusions. International action is urgently needed to raise awareness in the medical profession in the various countries of these remarkably low levels of testosterone treatment. Improvement in this requires education and motivation of doctors and those regulating the healthcare systems. A public awareness campaign is needed to educate men about the symptoms of testosterone deficiency and its impact on their health.",

Further, the relationship between a positive definition and plasma testosterone (T) and calculated free T was analysed.Using the above three definitions of metabolic syndrome (MetS), there was a large degree of overlap of identifying obese men as having the syndrome, but there were quantitatively significant differences as well. So, it is relevant in studies to identify which of the present definitions of the syndrome has been used. With aging there is an increasing prevalence of the syndrome and age itself might be a factor in the lower T levels encountered in these men. But low plasma total T and calculated free T were also consistent features of men <40 years with metabolic syndrome, regardless of which definition had been applied. Including low T levels in the definition of metabolic syndrome, may be helpful.",

Obstructive azoospermia (OA) is characterized by an occlusion or partial absence of the reproductive tract with the presence of normal spermatogenesis. On the other hand, non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is characterized by impaired spermatogenesis. In these cases, spermatozoa can be obtained by percutaneous epididymal or testicular sperm aspiration (PESA and TESA, respectively) and used for intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI). To compare ICSI outcomes using spermatozoa that were surgically retrieved by PESA and TESA, azoospermic patients were divided into the following categories: (i) TESA-NOA (n = 102), (ii) TESA-OA (n = 103), and (iii) PESA-OA (n = 171). Fertilization, pregnancy, and implantation rates were compared between the groups. We noted a lower normal fertilization rate (p = 0.0017) and a higher abortion rate (p = 0.0387) among men in the TESA group who had OA when compared with men in the PESA group who had OA. On the other hand, a lower normal fertilization rate (p = 0.05) and a lower rate of non-cleaved embryos (p = 0.034) was found in the TESA group of NOA patients as compared to the TESA group of OA patients. No statistically significant differences were detected between the TESA and PESA groups and the OA and NOA groups, respectively. The clinical outcomes of embryos arising from ICSI cycles using spermatozoa harvested via PESA and TESA were similar, regardless of whether the patient had obstructive or non-obstructive azoospermia.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated areal bone mineral density (aBMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and markers of bone turnover in male competitive masters athletes representing different training profile in the past and at present, aged 40–64 (14 endurance runners, and 12 speed-power athletes), and non-sport controls (n = 13). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements of total body and regional aBMD, BMC and soft tissue composition were acquired. Serum concentrations of osteocalcin (OC), C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT) and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured. Adjusted total and regional aBMD and BMC (covariates: body mass, body height and age) were significantly greater in all measured regions in speed-power athletes than in endurance athletes and control subjects, but adjusted aBMD and BMC values were not significantly different between endurance athletes and controls. No differences in bone formation (OC), bone resorption (CTX), and serum concentrations of TNF-α, TT, FT and IGF-1 were noted. This suggests that weight-bearing exercise in young age and the training continuation in later life may be an important contributor to the aBMD and BMC in the middle age and in the elderly. It seems also that training-related bone differences in men are not caused by present alterations in bone turn-over or somatotropic effects. However, conclusions must be drawn with caution due to a large variability of biochemical markers.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis in elderly men is becoming an important health issue with the aging society. Elderly men with androgen deficiency are exposed to osteoporosis and can be treated with testosterone replacement. In this study, Eurycoma longifolia (EL), a plant with androgenic effects, was supplemented to an androgen-deficient osteoporotic aged rat as alternative to testosterone. Aged 12 months old Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into groups of normal control (NC), sham-operated (SO), orchidectomised-control (OrxC), orchidectomised and supplemented with EL (Orx + El) and orchidectomised and given testosterone (Orx + T). After 6 weeks of treatment, serum osteocalcin, serum terminal C-telopeptide Type 1 collagen (CTX) and the fourth lumbar bone calcium were measured. There were no significant differences in the osteocalcin levels before and after treatment in all the groups. The CTX levels were also similar for all the groups before treatment. However, after treatment, orchidectomy had caused significant elevation of CTX compared to normal control rats. Testosterone replacements in orchidectomised rats were able to prevent the rise of CTX. Orchidectomy had also reduced the bone calcium level compared to normal control rats. Both testosterone replacement and EL supplementation to orchidectomised rats were able to maintain the bone calcium level, with the former showing better effects. As a conclusion, EL prevented bone calcium loss in orchidectomised rats and therefore has the potential to be used as an alternative treatment for androgen deficient osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "In aging men, serum endogenous testosterone is inversely associated with common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and directly with beneficial plasma lipid levels; however, the relationship to endothelial function is poorly characterized. We examined the association between serum testosterone and endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in middle-aged to elderly men. A group of 83 men aged 40–69 years (mean 55.9 ± 7.5 [SD]) with andropausal symptoms were studied. We measured their serum lipids, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, mean carotid IMT and brachial artery FMD by high resolution B-mode ultrasound. Brachial FMD correlated inversely with vessel diameter (r = −0.38, p = 0.0004), alcohol consumption (r = −0.22, p = 0.047) and serum testosterone (r = −0.27, p = 0.01), but not with luteinizing hormone. In multivariate analysis, FMD was explained by testosterone (β = −0.17, p = 0.0226), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (β = 4.17, p = 0.0312) and vessel diameter (β = −4.37, p < 0.0001) when adjusted for age, body mass index, triglycerides, blood pressure, carotid IMT, smoking, alcohol consumption, cardiovascular diseases and use of lipid lowering medication (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). In middle-aged to elderly men, there is an inverse correlation between serum testosterone and brachial FMD. These data suggest that testosterone may have an adverse effect on systemic endothelial function.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing evidence for a link between nutrition, lifestyle and prostate cancer (PCa) development and/or progression of disease. The objective of this study was to examine the association between dietary factors and PCa incidence and aggressiveness in a case-control study. After the analysis of the anatomic pathology, subjects were classified in patients with PCa (n = 157) and controls (n = 158). Clinical data including Gleason score, PSA values and biopsy results, were compiled. Frequencies of food consumption and sociodemographic data were also obtained. The results showed that physical activity was significantly higher in control (p < .022). It was also found that some nutritional habits offer a protective effect among studied subjects, like high nuts (p = .041) and fish (p = .041) intakes. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in risk (p = .029) in cases with a higher fruits and vegetables intakes. A decreased risk of aggressive PCa was associated with fruits, vegetables, legumes and fish intakes. However, these relationships were not statistically significant when data were adjusted for covariates. In conclusion, this study found an inverse association between PCa risk and the intake of fruits and vegetables, fish and nuts. The results suggested that a diet with higher intakes of these foods as Mediterranean diet may lower the risk of PCa in the studied population. As dietary factors are modifiable, identifying food groups or dietary patterns that modulate the risk of PCa and its aggressiveness can offer effective and practical strategies for its primary prevention.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, sarcopenia in older persons has been operationalized by the assessment of lean body mass, muscle strength and/or physical performance. Several definitions of sarcopenia, using different parameters and cut-offs, have been proposed. However, which is the best definition to describe and to assess this condition is still matter of debate. Hand grip strength has been suggested as better predictor of incident mobility impairment and mortality, than skeletal muscle mass. In the light of the current knowledge, we sought to propose an operative approach for identifying and treating sarcopenic older persons according to main categories of sarcopenia: the age-related or primary sarcopenia and disease-related or secondary sarcopenia. We suggest that a quantitative assessment of grip strength alone might be sufficient to identify patients with primary sarcopenia. When chronic diseases accompany the ageing process, the combined assessment of muscle strength plus a balance test could be more appropriate. The identification of tests and pathological relevant cut-offs that facilitates the entry of sarcopenia into the clinical practice, could step forward researchers and physicians. This could be important for planning multidisciplinary models to maximize the maintenance of locomotive abilities especially in older persons affected by chronic diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",

Previously, however, a small proportion failed to lose at least 5% of their baseline weight. The reason for this is not yet understood. In the present study, we sought to identify early indicators that may predict successful long-term weight loss, defined as a reduction of at least 5% of total body weight relative to baseline weight (T0), in men with hypogonadism undergoing TRT. Eight parameters measured were assessed as potential predictors of sustained weight loss: loss of 3% or more of baseline weight after 1 year of TU treatment, severe hypogonadism, BMI, waist circumference, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), age and use of vardenafil. Among the eight measured parameters, three factors were significantly associated with sustained weight loss over the entire period of TU treatment: (1) a loss of 3% of the baseline body weight after 1 year of TRT; (2) baseline BMI over 30; and (3) a waist circumference >102 cm. Age was not a predictor of weight loss.",

Methods: Two hundred twenty-four patients with varicocele, 241 patients without varicocele who admitted to our clinic were enrolled in the study. We stratified participants by four age groups (40-49, 50-59, 60-69, >70 yr). Patients were grouped according to varicocele grade and laterality. The morning testosterone level was drawn. The subgroups were compared with each other. Results: Overall, varicocele prevalence was 48%. Of the patients, 104 had unilateral, 120 had bilateral varicocele. Of the patients with varicocele, 62 (13.30%) were found as grade 3, 99 (21.10%) were grade 2, and 63 (13.60%) were grade 1. The percentages of smaller testes in grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 varicocele group were 20.60, 79.80, and 88.70 and a significant association was detected. Age stratification of the data revealed the smaller and soft testis prevalence as well as higher grade varicocele prevalance increased in older age groups. Conclusions: Varicocele presence is associated with lower testicular size, softer testicular consistency, and lower testosterone levels, especially in older patients with bilateral and high-grade varicocele.",

Community-dwelling, self-sufficient older adults were recruited in a geriatric outpatient clinic (n = 226, 142 female, 84 male). Construct validity was based on social-worker's interview as a gold-standard method. The cut-off threshold for IMSelf-neglect questionnaire was calculated from ROC-analysis using cut-off values that predicted social-worker's opinion whether the older adult has self-neglect.Mean age was 74 ± 6.5 years. The inter-rater and test-retest reliability were excellent (r = 0.887, p < .05; r = 0.942, p < .05, respectively). The internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha: 0.708). Cut-off threshold for IM Self-neglect questionnaire was calculated as 7 with 92.1% sensitivity and 70.7% specificity. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value of IMSelf-neglect questionnaire were 38.9% and 97.8%, respectively. There was significant moderate agreement between social worker's assessment and results of IMSelf-neglect questionnaire (κ = 0.407, p < .001). The social worker confirmed 16.8% of the participants have self-neglect by the gold-standard clinical interview. Participants with self-neglect had decreased functionality, worse quality of life and tended to have more depression compared with participants without self-neglect.We developed the IMSelf-neglect questionnaire as a valid and reliable tool to screen self-neglect in outpatient clinics complementary to comprehensive geriatric assessment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Malnutrition is common in subjects undergoing hemodialysis and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Studies investigating factors associated with malnutrition and effect of various interventions to treat these patients are needed. We aimed to screen older and young patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, for malnutrition, and seek its association with clinical factors including anxiety and depression and laboratory variables including urea/creatinine ratio (UCR).Methods: Duration of hemodialysis treatment, medications taken, anthropometric measurements and routine laboratory results were recorded. Mini nutritional assessment and Beck anxiety and Beck depression inventories were applied. Study variables between subjects with malnutrition, malnutrition risk and normal nutritional states were compared. Older and younger patients were also compared regarding malnutrition and laboratory results. Linear regression analysis was performed to seek independent factors associated with malnutrition score.Results: Clinical and laboratory data except for UCR were found to be similar among young and older patients. UCR increased, while albumin, body mass index and weight circumference decreased along with worse nutritional state. Low albumin level, body mass index and UCR and higher hemoglobin level and depression score were independent factors associated with malnutrition.Conclusion: In addition to routinely used markers of malnutrition UCR may provide additional information regarding malnutrition in this population.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the fracture risk after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer in the Chinese population. All Chinese prostate cancer patients who were treated primarily by radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, with or without further ADT, from year 2000 to 2009 were reviewed. We compared the fracture risk in patients who were given ADT (ADT group) with those who were not given any ADT (non-ADT group). Potential risk factors including age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease and performance status were reviewed. The fracture risk was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Our cohort consisted of 200 patients in the non-ADT group and 252 patients in the ADT group. The ADT group was shown to have higher fracture risk (p = 0.036) upon Kaplan-Meier analysis. Upon multivariate Cox regression analyses, diabetes mellitus (HR 4.39, 95% CI 1.08-17.83, p = 0.039), poor performance status (HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.24-8.00, p = 0.016) and the use of ADT (HR 4.89, 95% CI 1.03-23.17, p = 0.045) were associated with increased fracture risk. In conclusion, the fracture risk should be considered while deciding on ADT in Chinese men, especially in diabetic patients with poor performance status.",

Age was directly associated with PAbdF and percent total body fat (PBF). Exercise intensity was negatively associated with PBF. Both PBF and PAbdF were associated with HDL and LDL, but have opposite correlation with triglyceride. Furthermore, both PBF and PAbdF were associated with the number of metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors. Men with GOb had lower levels of percent lean mass (PLM), testosterone and bioavailable testosterone, and higher insulin and glucose levels. Men with AbO had lower arm and leg fat, higher insulin levels and triglycerides.Conclusions: Men with GOb and AbO had different pattern of body composition. Age may be a contributory factor in AbO and a sedentary lifestyle may contribute to GOb. Both GOb and AbO are associated with an increased risk of MetS, with GOb more predispose to risk of diabetes, while AbO more at risk for cardiovascular diseases.",

We searched bibliographic databases through September 2017. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) lasting one month or longer published in English. Outcomes of interest were LUTS assessed by validated measures. Efficacy was interpreted using established thresholds indicating clinical significance that identified the minimal detectable difference. Twenty-three unique, generally short-term, RCTs evaluating over 9000 participants were identified. Alpha-blocker silodosin and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor tadalafil were more effective than placebo in improving LUTS (moderate strength evidence) but these drugs had more adverse effects, including abnormal ejaculation (silodosin). Anticholinergics were only effective versus placebo when combined with an alpha-blocker. Evidence was generally low strength or insufficient for other drugs. Evidence was insufficient to assess long-term efficacy, prevention of symptom progression, need for surgical intervention, or long-term adverse effects. Longer trials are needed to assess the effect of these therapies on response rates using established minimal detectable difference thresholds, disease progression, and harms.",

At baseline and 3–6 months after baseline, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire-core 30 (QLQ-C30) and prostate-specific (QLQ-PR25) questionnaires were completed by patients. Data from 1276 patients were analyzed. At baseline, mean (±SD) age was 80 (±4.1) years, 29.1% of patients had Gleason scores ≥8 and 24.9% had metastases. At baseline, increasing age, presence of metastasis and presence of comorbidity had a negative impact on QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25 scores. At follow-up, improvement in emotional-functioning (2.8; p < 0.001), social-functioning (1.7; p = 0.011), global HRQoL (1.6; p = 0.029), sleep-disturbance (−2.1; p = 0.011), appetite-loss (−4.0; p < 0.001) and pain (−4.1; p < 0.001) QLQ-C30 scores were observed. In addition, there was a worsening in treatment-related symptom (8.6; p < 0.001), sexual-activity (−5.5; p < 0.001) and sexual-functioning (−22.6; p < 0.001) QLQ-PR25 scores, and an improvement in urinary symptoms (−3.7; p < 0.001) and incontinence aid (−2.9; p = 0.023) QLQ-PR25 scores. This study shows that, apart from the expected impact on sexual functioning domains, HRQoL is not adversely affected by 3–6 months of GnRH agonist therapy in older men with prostate cancer.",

Data were also gathered based on age, BMI, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol consumption, and family history of cardiovascular diseases. Men were classified into two groups based on testosterone levels: hypogonadal (testosterone ≤12 nmol/L) and eugonadal men (testosterone >12 nmol/L).Results: When compared to eugonadal, the hypogonadal men were significantly older (56 years vs. 55 years, p = .03), had greater BMI (28 kg/cm2 vs. 26 kg/cm2, p = .01), and higher waist circumference (104 cm vs. 100 cm, p = .01). Moreover, ApoB, ApoB-to-ApoA-1 ratio, and hsCRP were significantly higher in hypogonadal men compared to eugonadal men (1.1 g/L vs. 1.0 g/L, p = .03), (0.8 vs. 0.7, p = .03), (3.3 mg/L vs. 2.0 mg/L, p = .01), respectively. On the other hand, ApoA-1 and fibrinogen levels did not differ significantly between groups (p > .05). In an adjusted multivariate regression analysis model, only ApoB showed a significant negative association with testosterone levels (β = −0.01; 95% CI = −0.02, −1.50; p = .04).Conclusion: Testosterone levels showed an inverse relation to ApoB, a biomarker implicated in subclinical atherosclerosis.

Patients with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, malignancy, late-onset hypogonadism and smokers were not included in the study. The International Erectile Function Index-Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) questionnaire was used to assess the levels of erectile function. According to this scoring system, patients were divided into two groups. IIEF score: between 17 and 25 = mild ED (Group 1) and IIEF score between 16 and 0 = moderate-severe ED (Group 2). Blood samples of the patients were taken from antecubital vein and MPV and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were evaluated.Results: Ninety patients were included in the study (Group 1: n = 41, Group 2: n = 49). The mean age of the patients was 41.07 ± 8.56 and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.59 ± 3.91. 25(OH)D levels were found to be statistically lower in Group 2 (18.85 ± 6.09; 13.98 ± 7.10; p = .001). MPV levels were found to be statistically higher in Group 2 (10.05 ± 0.81; 10.78 ± 1.16; p = .001). Correlation between IIEF-EF scores and 25(OH)D levels was positive (p = .03, r = 0.22). There was negative correlation between IIEF-EF scores and MPV and between 25(OH)D levels and MPV levels [p = .003 for IIEF-EF/MPV, p = .04, r = -0.23 for 25(OH)D/MPV].Conclusion: There is a significant positive correlation between ED severity and 25(OH)D levels and there is a significant negative correlation between ED severity and MPV levels.",

Dogs were assigned into Young Group (n = 11) and Senile Group (n = 11), additionally divided into Fresh Semen Group and Cryopreserved Semen Group. Males were evaluated for libido score and blood estrogen and testosterone assay. Sperm morphofunctional evaluations were performed based on Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis, morphology, mitochondrial activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity, and DNA fragmentation. Sperm oxidative features were: protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and production of advanced glycation end-products. Young dogs had higher libido score, sperm velocity average pathway, linearity of motility and mitochondrial activity index and lower percentage of major defects, total defects and proximal cytoplasmic droplet, despite the lack of difference between hormone profile of aged dogs. Fresh semen of senile dogs had increased percentage of spermatozoa with high mitochondrial membrane potential compared to young dogs and to cryopreserved sperm. Cryopreserved semen of young dogs had higher acrosomal membrane integrity compared to the Senile Group. In conclusion, sperm of aged dogs have reduced quality, signaled by higher morphological defects, ultimately altering sperm mitochondrial function and sperm kinetics. Furthermore, spermatozoa from senile dogs are more sensible to cryoinjury.",

    "abstract": "We have aimed to determine whether oxidants-antioxidants play a role in the etiopathogenesis of bladder tumour by measuring their levels in the serums of patients with bladder tumour.Thirty patients with bladder tumour with superficial bladder tumour and 27 normal healthy volunteers were included in the study. Four cc of venous blood was taken from these patients and volunteers in the control group and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes and divided into serum and plasma. The activities of xanthine oxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-s transferase, reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase enzymes in serum were then measured spectrophotometrically.Antioxidant parameters (glutathione-s-transferase, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase) in the serum of patients with bladder tumours were found statistically significantly lower than control group (p < .05). On the other hand, xanthine oxidase which is an oxidant indicator, was found significantly higher in patients with bladder cancer than control group (p < .05).Oxidative stress is effective in the etiopathogenesis of bladder tumour. We, therefore, believe that antioxidants are protective against bladder tumours and will be effective in the treatment of bladder tumours.",

Their body mass index (BMI) kg/m2, skeletal muscle mass (SMM-kg) and skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI-kg/m2) were calculated. The participants were regarded as having low SMMI if they had SMMI <9.2 kg/m2 according to our population specific cut-off point. Functional status was evaluated with Katz activities of daily living (ADL) and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Nutritional assessment was performed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). The number of drugs taken and chronic diseases were recorded.One hundred fifty-seven male residents were enrolled into the study. Their mean age was 73.1 ± 6.7 years with mean ADL score of 8.9 ± 2.0 and IADL score of 8.7 ± 4.6. One hundred twelve (71%) residents were aged >70 years. Thirty-five men (23%) had low SMMI in group aged >60 years, and twenty-eight subjects (25%) in the group aged >70 years. MNA scores were significantly lower in residents with low SMMI compared with having normal SMMI (17.1 ± 3.4 versus 19.6 ± 2.5, p = 0.005). BMI was significantly lower in the residents with low SMMI compared with normal SMMI (19.6 ± 2.7 versus 27.1 ± 4.1, p< 0.001). ADL scores were significantly different between residents with low SMMI and normal SMMI in those aged >70 years (8.1 ± 2.6 versus 9.1 ± 1.6, p = 0.014). In regression analyses, the only factor associated with better functional status was the lower age (p = 0.04) while the only factor associated with better nutrition was higher SMMI (p = 0.01).Low SMMI detected by LMM evaluation method of EWGSOP criteria is prevalent among male nursing home residents. There is association of low SMMI with nutritional status and probably with functional status within the nursing home setting using the EWGSOP criteria with Turkish normative reference cut-off value.",

We aimed to investigate relationship between air quality parameters and the seasons with the AHI.Methods: This was a retrospective study that included 500 adults. Polysomnography (PSG) was performed on all patients. Oxygen saturation, air temperature, relative humidity, and PM10 values were recorded in Düzce for every year. The parameters of the national air quality network and sleep parameters of 500 individuals hospitalized between 2015 and 2017 were checked.Results: A total of 500 patients were included in the study, of whom 316 (63.2%) were male and 184 (36.8%) were female. While the AHI value of patients who presented during 2016 was 27.5, it had significantly declined to 20.2 in 2017 (p = .024). A significant decline was observed in AHI values of OSA patients from 2016 to 2017 (p = .043). A significant positive correlation was observed between REM-related AHI and relative humidity (r = 0.183, p = .002). Conclusions: This study showed a clear relationship between AHI and PM10 during winter when air pollution parameters are high in the region. PM10 emerged as a parameter that substantially increases the relative risk for OSA.",

Bladder cancer incidence, recurrence, and mortality after 5-ARi treatment and ADT were assessed using risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The protocol of this study is registered in the PROSPERO database (No. CRD42018118627).We analyzed nine studies (n = 377,427) assessing the secondary effect of AST, with a mean follow-up period of 6 years (range, 2-13 years). Our result showed that the incidence of bladder cancer was significantly reduced when 5-ARi treatment (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.81; I2 =0%) and ADT (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94; I2 =33%) were initiated before diagnosing bladder cancer. When treatment was initiated after diagnosing bladder cancer, 5-ARi treatment reduced cancer-specific mortality (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.20-0.42; I2 =4.1%), whereas ADT reduced bladder cancer recurrence (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.19-0.49; I2 =0%).This study corroborates that the use of 5-ARi and ADT could be helpful in managing bladder cancer and should not be limited to prostatic abnormalities.",

Here we review the relationship between testosterone deficiency, metabolic syndrome, and hepatic steatosis reported by studies with men and rodents. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome and testosterone deficiency is higher among older subjects. Low total and free testosterone levels were positively associated with disturbs on energy metabolism, changes in body fat distribution, and body composition. Studies reported visceral fat accumulation in men with hypogonadism and castrated rats. Despite some contradictions, the association between higher adiposity, low testosterone, and metabolic syndrome was a common point among the studies. Few studies evaluated the hepatic steatosis and found an association with hypogonadism. Most of the studies with rodents combined the castration with a high-fat diet to study metabolic disturbs. The importance of proper levels of testosterone for energy metabolism homeostasis in men was also underlined by studies that investigated the metabolic effects of testosterone replacement therapy and androgen deprivation therapy.",

Normalised muscle volume (NMV) and muscle fat infiltrate (MFI) were determined bilaterally for the psoas (PS), quadratus lumborum (QL), erector spinae (ES) and multifidus (MF). MANOVA was used to compare NMV and MFI between age groups. Follow-up ANOVA compared NMV and MFI for each muscle between age groups, with physical activity (PA) as a covariate. Stepwise regression was used to explore the association between muscle morphology.Results NMV of the ES and QL were significantly lower in the older group (OG) (p = 0.040 and p < 0.001, respectively). MFI across all muscles was significantly greater in the OG (p < 0.001). PA did not moderate the relationship between aging and muscle degeneration. Non-dominant handgrip strength was associated with NMV (p = 0.003).Conclusions Age-related atrophy is muscle specific in the lumbar spine; changes in lumbar musculature is independent of PA, handgrip strength may reflect morphological changes in the postural muscles with age.

HGS, timed up and go test (TUG), and usual gait speed (UGS) were assessed. Frailty was screened by FRAIL-scale.Results A total of 1825 older adults were included (mean age, 74.5 + 7.0 years; 68.8% female). Prevalence of low-HGS were 12.2% by the EWGSOP2-recommended (27/16 kg) cut-offs and 37.5% by population-specific cut-offs (35/20 kg) (p<.001).

    "abstract": "Much like the menopause syndrome occurring among older women, a similar condition has been defined among men. Testosterone production increases rapidly at the onset of puberty, then dwindles quickly after age 50 to become 20 to 50% of the peak level by age 80. Many men older than age 50 have experienced frailty syndrome, which includes decrease of libido, easy fatigue, mood disturbance, accelerated osteoporosis, and decreased muscle strength. We investigated serum total testosterone levels and andropause syndrome in men.Serum total testosterone levels were measured in 53 symptomatic men older than age 50 and in 48 men younger than age 40 for a control group. We also analyzed andropause symptoms among the 53 men older than age 50.The mean serum total testosterone level in the symptomatic men older than age 50 (mean: 2.68 +/- 0.51 ng/ml, range: 1.21 to 4.13 ng/ml) was significantly lower than that in the control group (mean: 7.01 +/- 0.82 ng/ml, range: 5.53 ng/ml to 8.14 ng/ml). Male frailty syndrome in these men older than 50 included: decreased libido (91%), lack of energy (89%), erection problems (79%), falling asleep after dinner (77%), memory impairment (77%), loss of pubic hair (70%), sad or grumpy mood changes (68%), decrease in endurance (66%), loss of axillary hair (55%), and deterioration in work performance (51%).The serum total testosterone level showed a decline with aging, especially in the men older than age 50. Low serum testosterone levels were also associated with the symptoms of male andropause syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of erectile dysfunction rises rapidly with age and is a frequent complaint presented in clinical practice. Although the etiology of erectile dysfunction is multifactorial, 10-20% of evaluations demonstrate testosterone deficiency. Testosterone deficiency due to secondary hypogonadism increases with age. Despite a higher prevalence of secondary hypogonadism in the elderly, there are no studies addressing hypothalamic-pituitary structural abnormalities in elderly impotent men with testosterone deficiency. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all elderly men who presented for general outpatient evaluation of erectile dysfunction from 1996 to 1999. To obtain a cohort control population, the records of 300 patients without erectile dysfunction were also reviewed. Amongst the erectile dysfunction patients, 225 were found to be testosterone deficient (testosterone < 300 ng/dl). Of these patients, 29 were additionally diagnosed with secondary hypogonadism based on a luteinizing hormone (LH) < 13 mIU/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) imaging was available and reviewed in all patients diagnosed with secondary hypogonadism. Ten per cent of these patients had hypothalamic-pituitary imaging abnormalities. The prevalence of pituitary tumors within our population was not significantly elevated compared to the previous general population studies. Small-vessel white matter disease, hyperlipidemia and history of compression fractures were significantly increased in both univariate and multivariate analysis in the erectile dysfunction group compared with the control cohort. This study does not suggest that the use of hypothalamic-pituitary imaging in the evaluation of impotence in elderly men, in the absence of clinical characteristics of other hormonal loss or sella compression symptoms, will increase diagnosis of structural hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities over that of the general population. However, the yield may increase with very low testosterone levels. These data suggest that there is an increase in ischemic white matter disease in elderly men with hypogonadism that may reflect microvascular injury to the hypothalamic-pituitary. Furthermore, these data confirm that low testosterone is associated with hyperlipidemia in the elderly. Future studies are required to assess the role of hypogonadism and hyperlipidemia, and to determine if treatment of the hormone deficiency improves the lipid profile.",

    "abstract": "The prostate has only one function, namely to secrete fluid containing substances that are needed for reproduction. This requires an extremely high concentration of androgens in the tissues. Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) seems to be related to the long-term exposure of the prostate to the strong androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and, possibly, to estrogens. The relation between prostate cancer and androgens is suggested to be U-shaped, with both extremes of androgen concentrations being associated with increased risk of invasive cancer.In the treatment of patients with BPH, the lipidic liposterolic extracts of Serenoa repens were as effective as the pharmaceutical inhibitors of the 5α-reductase enzyme or α1-adrenergic blockers in relieving urinary symptoms. In addition to moderately inhibiting the 5α-reductase activity, Serenoa seems to exert anti-inflammatory and complementary cellular actions with beneficial effects on the prostate. Unlike the pharmaceutical 5α-reductase inhibitors, finasteride and dutasteride, Serenoa does not suppress serum PSA, facilitating the follow-up and the early detection of prostate cancer.We suggest a strategy to prevent prostate cancer that aims at providing men with partial androgen deficiency correct testosterone substitution with a sustained release buccal bio-adhesive tablet. In addition, food supplementation with extracts of Serenoa repens and a combination of the antioxidants selenium, (cis)-lycopene and natural vitamin E, together with fish oil rich in long-chain polyunsaturated essential fatty acids of the omega-3 group seems warranted. Clearly, a holistic approach including careful clinical and biological monitoring of the aging man and his prostate remains mandatory.",

Methods: Diabetic ED patients (n = 120), aged 43-74 years, failing to respond at least three times to 100 mg Viagra were evaluated. After at least 2 weeks' treatment with oral testosterone undecanoate (Andriol®), 100 mg Viagra was used before coitus. ED was assessed with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Serum total testosterone, prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone, lipid profile and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were determined by standard methods and prostate volume by digital rectal examination. Age-matched diabetic ED patients (n = 100) served as controls for baseline values. Results: Viagra non-responders had, at baseline, significantly lower testosterone and more depressed libido than controls. Andriol restored testosterone to normal levels and increased libido. In 84/120 (70%) Viagra non-responders, combined therapy with Andriol induced satisfactory erections, a significant increase in IIEF scale (question (Q) 3 from 2.0 ± 0.2 to 3.7 ± 0.3, Q4 from 1.9 ± 0.1 to 3.4 ± 0.2, Q12 from 1.0 ± 0.1 to 4.2 ± 0.4) and increased sexual contacts from 0.5 to 3-4 per month. No adverse events were noted, and PSA levels remained below 4 ng/ml. Conclusion: Decreased testosterone levels in patients with ED and type II DM receiving oral antidiabetic agents may be responsible for failure to respond to sildenafil citrate therapy. Combination with oral testosterone undecanoate restores sexual function in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a gradual decrease of serum testosterone with aging in men. A considerable number of men will experience hypogonadal androgen levels, defined by the normal range for young men. Thus, in addition to the long-standing use of androgen replacement therapy in the classical forms of primary and secondary hypogonadism, age-associated testosterone deficiency has led to considerable developments in application modes for testosterone. Since oral preparations of testosterone are ineffective, due to the first-pass effect of the liver, or, in case of 17 α-alkylation, cause hepatotoxicity, intramuscular injection of long-acting esters, such as testosterone enanthate, have been the mainstay of testosterone therapy. However, the large fluctuations of serum testosterone levels cause unsatisfactory shifts of mood and sexual function in some men; combined with the frequent injections, this delivery mode is thus far from being ideal. In contrast, the transdermal testosterone patches are characterized by favorable pharmacokinetic behavior and have proven to be an effective mode of delivery. Safety data over 10 years indicate no negative effect on the prostate. Nevertheless, the scrotal testosterone patch system is hampered by the application site, which is not easily accepted by many subjects; the non-scrotal patch has a high rate of skin irritations. In view of the drawbacks of the currently available preparations, the most recent developments in testosterone supplementation appear to be highly promising agents. Androgen, which has been available in the United States since mid-2000, will be introduced this year in most European markets as Testogel ® , a hydroalcoholic gel containing 1% testosterone. Doses of 50-100 mg gel applied once daily on the skin deliver sufficient amounts of testosterone to restore normal hormonal values and to correct the signs and symptoms of hypogonadism. The gel has shown to be very effective and successful in American patients, who have benefited from its availability for almost 3 years. Furthermore, in phase II and III clinical studies, the intramuscular injection of 1000 mg testosterone undecanoate every 12-15 weeks has led to extremely stable serum testosterone levels for a prolonged period of time and has resulted in excellent efficacy. It is very likely in the future that these products will be the mainstay of testosterone supplementation. Whereas the indication for testosterone substitution for men with classical forms of hypogonadism is unequivocal, the use of testosterone in men with ageassociated hypogonadism is less uniformly accepted. Yet, the few studies addressing this question indicate that men with testosterone serum levels below the lower normal limit for young adult men and with lack of energy, libido, depressed mood and osteoporosis may benefit from testosterone supplementation. However, it should be kept in mind that the experience documented in studies is limited. Nevertheless, serious side-effects, especially in regard to the prostate, did not occur, with the longest study extending over 3 years.",

    "abstract": "Studies in animals have indicated that the nitric oxide erectile pathway is testosterone-dependent. Castration induces erectile dysfunction and a reduction in nitric oxide synthase-stained nerves in erectile tissue. Furthermore, castration adversely affects penile hemodynamics and smooth muscle content, leading to veno-occlusive dysfunction. Testosterone replenishment reverses these physiological, biochemical and structural changes. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the benefits of a combination of testosterone and sildenafil. A recently published, multicenter study evaluated the safety and efficacy of testosterone gel 1% (Testogel®; Schering AG, Germany/AndroGel®; Solvay Pharmaceuticals) vs. placebo gel in conjunction with sildenafil, in producing an erectile response in hypogonadal men who did not respond to treatment with sildenafil alone for erectile dysfunction. The selection criteria required subjects to have had erectile dysfunction for at least 3 months, to be non-responsive to 100 mg sildenafil and to have low testosterone levels (< 400 ng/dl). The primary efficacy measurement was the mean change from baseline in the Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Secondary outcome measures included the mean change from baseline in the other domains and the total sum of the IIEF. Subjects were randomized to receive either testosterone gel + sildenafil, or placebo gel + sildenafil for 12 weeks. Testosterone therapy with testosterone gel improved the erectile response to sildenafil. Therefore, testosterone therapy may be considered for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men with low to low-normal testosterone levels, who have failed prior treatment with sildenafil alone. Consequently, it is important to screen for hypogonadism in men who fail PDE5 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Asia has about 60% of the world population and population aging is occurring more rapidly in Asia than in Western countries. The group aged 65 years and above will increase from 207 million in 2000 to 857 million in 2050, a staggering increase of 314%. The diversity in economic, demographic, religious, cultural and geo-political factors in Asia is unparalleled by any other continent, and is, in part, contributory to the rapid rise in population aging. By 2050, those under 15 years old will have shrunk from 30% in 2000 to 19%, while those aged 65 years and above will increase from 6% to 18%. In addition, the gender divide still persists with 100 elderly women to 70 elderly men. These projected demographic changes pose three major challenges: 1) how best to address the rising population of the group aged 65 years and above, 2) how to address the shrinking population of the young as well as the working adults, and 3) how to address the problems arising from the disproportionate increase in older women than men. From now to 2050, it will be expeditious for each country in Asia to look into ways of reversing the decline in total fertility rates (TFRs) and restore to replacement levels. If not, at least introduce measures to halt its free fall. Due to the complexity of factors that have influenced the fall in TFRs in Asia, it will be a daunting task to reverse this fall. There is no \"single size fits all\" solution to this complex problem. Research work in this short-term strategy in addressing the aging population is urgent. In the longer term, the East-West Centre have suggested four modalities, 1) establish policies and programmes that enhance traditional Asian systems of family support for the elderly; 2) introduce policy reform that encourages the elderly who are still capable of remaining in the work force; 3) create institutions and systems that support high levels of personal saving; and 4) formulate public programmes, including pension schemes and national healthcare systems.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between nutritional indices (Body mass index (BMI), serum albumin), sarcopenia, bone mineral density (BMD) and the severity of their pulmonary obstruction in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Methods. The method involved was a prospective transversal study; 82 males >65 years old, 41 stable patients with COPD and 41 healthy elderly individuals (controls). All subjects underwent spirometry, biochemical analyses and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The significance of the differences between mean values and prevalence rates was tested. The relationships between BMD and independent predictors were analysed by multiple linear regressions. Logistic regression models were applied on dichotomised variables.Results. In patients with COPD, the prevalence of osteoporosis was higher in subjects with sarcopenia (46% vs. 0%; p < 0.05) and with BMI < 25.1 kg/m2 (58% vs. 15%; p < 0.02). Multiple regression analysis indicated that BMI, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM), albumin, and forced expiration volume after 1 s (FEV1) explained the 70% of BMD variability at the hip and 56% at the spine. Logistic regression showed that a BMI < 25.1 kg/m2 was independently associated with osteoporosis risk (OR = 10.0; 95%CI 1.3–76); no independent effect emerged for FEV1% (<and ⩾50%).Conclusion. In elderly males with COPD, the BMI values ≤25 kg/m2 are more strongly related to low BMD levels than albumin values. Among those patients, BMI values within the normal range for younger adults might point out a higher risk of osteoporosis.",

Qualitative interviews were conducted based on a new conceptual model of hypogonadism and according to standards for questionnaire development. An item pool was generated from focus groups and in-depth interviews with two groups of hypogonadal patients, treated (N = 26) and untreated (N = 26), and age-equivalent controls (N = 28). Standardized scoring of the qualitative interviews was used to confirm conceptual domains in the model and to generate questionnaire items for further validation.Results. Key domains identified in both patients and controls included: (a) physical function; (b) bodily signs and symptoms; (c) sexual function and libido; (d) sleep function; (e) mood and affective function; (f) memory and cognitive function. The final domain is distress or bother associated with hypogonadism symptoms. This domain was only relevant to the patient groups.Conclusions.

    "abstract": "Vitamin D is a group of lipophilic hormones with pleiotropic actions. It has been traditionally related to bone metabolism, although several studies in the last decade have suggested its role in muscle strength and falls, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, insulin-resistance and diabetes, malignancies, autoimmune diseases and infections. Vitamin D appears to be a hormone with several actions and is fundamental for many biological systems including bone, skeletal muscle, brain and heart.The estimated worldwide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency of 50% in elderly subjects underlines the importance of vitamin D deficiency for public health.In this review, we will describe changes in vitamin D levels with age in both sexes, cut off values to define Vitamin D status, the impact of vitamin D deficiency in age-related disease and finally different therapeutic options available to treat Vitamin D deficiency in older populations.",

Self-administered questionnaire on six lifestyle factors and the General Health Questionnaire 12-item version (GHQ12) were administered to 3306 male workers. Health practice index (HPI) was calculated as a desirable lifestyle score by summing up each binary lifestyle score (0, 1), ranging from 0 to 6. To check validity of the study outcome, the authors repeated twice with 1 year interval. HPI was categorised into three groups by the score of 0–2, 3–4 and 5–6.Results. The number of subjects categorised by HPI was 532, 1967 and 807, respectively. The mean value of GHQ12 significantly decreased as the HPI increased by adjusting age. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict GHQ12 by six lifestyle scores, and age, sleep, night snacking and exercise were significantly related to GHQ12. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted and age in 50s, two-shift work, sleep, night snacking and exercise were significantly associated with GHQ12.Conclusion. Although cause–effect relationship cannot make clear, some of desirable health practices and aging were closely related to psychological wellbeing judged by GHQ12.",

EPC (CD45(neg)/CD34(pos)/CD144(pos)) and EMP (CD45(neg)/CD34(neg)/CD144(pos)) blood concentrations were evaluated by flow cytometry. Thirty patients received androgen replacement therapy (Tostrex® ProStrakan) for 6 months (group A), other 20 patients not received androgen therapy for the contraindications in their clinical history (group B).After 6 months, group B showed IIEF-5 score, peak systolic velocity and acceleration time significantly worse than group A; in addition EPCs and EMPs were significantly higher in group B compared to group A.Patients with isolated arterial ED and LOH not treated with androgen therapy showed worst vascular parameters measured by penile Doppler and higher EPCs and EMPs compared to treated hypogonadal patients, hence, LOH appears to be an additional vascular risk factor, and these markers may be considered as predictors of cavernous artery disease. Finally, androgen therapy improves endothelial dysfunction.",

Recent data suggest that HIV is becoming an increasing problem for older adults, but little attention has been devoted to understanding their HIV risk behaviors or the factors that underlie their risk taking. This study provides a comparison of these issues among younger and older MSM.The data come from a subset of younger (ages 18-39, n = 113) and older (ages 50+, n = 109) men participating in a national study of 332 men who use the Internet to find other men for unprotected sex. Men were sampled randomly from 16 websites. Data were collected via telephone interviews conducted in 2008 and 2009.Younger and older men reported comparable involvement in HIV risk, including involvement in unprotected sex, proportion of sex acts involving internal ejaculation, number of times having anonymous sex, and number of times having multiple-partner sex. Generally speaking, the factors underlying the risk practices of younger and older men were quite different (e.g. self-esteem and condom use self-efficacy for younger men, versus HIV serostatus and depression for older men).Older MSM using the Internet to find partners for unprotected sex engage in high rates of behaviors that place them at risk for contracting or transmitting HIV. They were just as likely as their younger counterparts to practice these behaviors. The factors \"fueling\" involvement in risk generally differ for older and younger men, thereby warranting the development of age-specific HIV interventions that can take into account the unique life circumstances and needs of older MSM.",

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 237 men aged 20–88 years (mean age 52 years). Serum lipids, glucose, insulin, total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E2), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and dehydroepiandosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) were measured along with body height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Free testosterone (FT) and bioavailable testosterone (BT) were calculated. Correlations were determined using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Results: Men with MS had lower levels of TT, BT, FT, SHBG and DHEA-S than men without MS. Multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age and smoking status, indicated that TT (OR: 0.909, 95% CI: 0.836–0.988, p = 0.003) and SHBG (OR: 0.948, 95% CI: 0.913–0.985, p = 0.006) were significantly associated with MS (R2 = 0.314). TT was associated with waist circumference (p = 0.008) and abnormal triglycerides level (p = 0.006); SHBG was associated with blood pressure (p = 0.003), blood glucose (p = 0.043) and abnormal triglycerides (p = 0.048). A significant trend was observed between decreasing levels of TT, BT, FT, and SHBG and increasing numbers of MS components. Conclusion: Results show that serum testosterone and SHBG levels inversely correlate with MS in an Asian population applying the Asian MS definition.",

Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known. Clinic manifestation is painless hard and fixed nodule in the subareolar region in 75% of cases, with nipple commitment earlier than in women. Breast cancer has similar prognostic factors in males and females, among which axillary adenopathy (present in 40–55% cases) is the most important one. Although mammography, ultrasonography and scintigraphy can be useful tools in diagnosis; clinical assessment, along with a confirmatory biopsy, remains the main step in the evaluation of men with breast lesions. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most frequent histological type. The established standard of care is modified radical mastectomy followed by tamoxifen for endocrine-responsive positive disease, although other options are being explored. While similarities between breast cancer in males and females exist, it is not appropriate to extrapolate data from female disease to the treatment of male. There is a need for specific multi-institutional trials to better understanding of clinicopathologic features and establishment of optimal therapy for this disease.",

The influence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics on the outcome of metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) after androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) remains poorly characterised. We evaluated the prognostic significance of PSA nadir and time to PSA nadir as well as their interactive effect on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM) after ADT.Methods. A total of 650 men with advanced or metastatic PCa treated with ADT were studied. The prognostic significance of PSA nadir and time to PSA nadir on PCSM and ACM were analysed using Kaplan–Meier analysis and the Cox regression model.Results. On multivariate analysis, clinical M1 stage, Gleason Score 8–10, PSA nadir ≥ 0.2 ng/ml and time to PSA nadir < 10 months were independent predictors of PCSM and ACM. The combined analysis showed that patient with higher PSA nadir and shorter time to PSA nadir had significantly higher risk of PCSM and ACM compared to those with lower PSA nadir and longer time to PSA nadir (hazard ratios = 6.30 and 4.79, respectively, all P < 0.001).Conclusions. Our results suggest that higher PSA nadir level and faster time to reach PSA nadir after ADT were associated with shorter survival for PCa.",

A 55-year-old patient presented for erectile dysfunction, loss of libido and fatigue. The biochemical evaluation showed very high FSH serum levels in the presence of central hypogonadism. Neither testicular enlargement nor increased sperm count was observed, thus a secretion of FSH with reduced biological activity was supposed. The histological examination after neuro-surgery showed an atypical pituitary adenoma with FSH-positive cells. Hypogonadism persisted and semen analyses impaired until azoospermia in conjunction with the reduction in FSH levels suggesting that, at least in part, this gonadotropin should be biologically active. Thus, we hypothesized a concomitant primary testicular insufficiency. The patient underwent short-term treatment trials with low doses of either recombinant luteinizing hormone (LH) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in three consecutive treatment schemes, showing an equal efficacy in stimulating testosterone (T) increase. This is the first case of atypical, giant FSH-secreting pituitary adenoma with high FSH serum levels without signs of testicular hyperstimulation, in presence of hypogonadism with plausible combined primary and secondary etiology. Hypophysectomized patients may represent a good model to assess both pharmacodynamics and effective dose of LH and hCG in the male.",

Both erectile function and PE were evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (abridged form, IIEF-5) and Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) questionnaires, respectively. Results identified 182 (60.7%) men had Met S. Prevalence of PE was significantly higher in the subjects with Met S than the controls (35.2% vs 7.6%, p < 0.001). Patients with Met S and PE had significantly higher PEDT scores (15.4 vs 6.7), smaller waist circumference (108.3 cm vs 111.5 cm) and higher fasting blood sugar (187 mg% vs 161 mg%) than those with no PE (p < 0.001, 0.047 and 0.019, respectively). The other variables including IIEF-5 score, body mass index, serum triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (14.98 vs 16.8, 30.6 vs 31.5, 192.9 mg% vs 178.1 mg% and 37.4 mg% vs 36.2 mg%, respectively) did not reveal significant differences. Both systolic hypertension and erectile dysfunction (ED) had significant associations (p = 0.047 and <0.001, respectively) with PE in Met S. In conclusion, PE has a high prevalence in Met S. Patients with Met S should be questioned about PE. Both ED and systolic hypertension may be associated with PE. Prevention of Met S should be considered, and this may be of help to decrease the prevalence of PE.",

This study reports experience with seven different methods, introduced on the market in the UK.Aim: To establish the symptom response when testosterone treatment was initiated on the basis of clinical features and symptoms of androgen deficiency, and the resulting endocrine, biochemical and physiological responses.Methods: Of 2693 patients attending the 3 Men’s Health Centers – The UK Androgen Study (UKAS), 2247 were treated. Treatments included pellet implants, oral testosterone undecanoate (Testocaps), mesterolone (Proviron), testosterone gel (Testogel), testosterone scrotal cream (Andromen) and scrotal gel (Tostran).Results: There was no correlation between initial testosterone level, initial symptom score or the success of treatment as defined by adequate resolution of symptoms. Despite the diverse endocrine patterns produced, the testosterone preparations appear equally safe over prolonged periods, with either no change or improvement of cardiovascular risk factors, especially in lowering cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure.Conclusions: It is suggested that because of excessive reliance on laboratory measures of androgens and undue safety concerns, many men who could benefit from symptom relief, improvement in related clinical conditions and given preventive medical benefits remain untreated.",

The identification of a simple screening tool with a high level of sensitivity and specificity to predict LOH has remained a challenge. To identify men with LOH, a variety of self-administered questionnaires have been developed including The Saint Louis University Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (ADAM) Questionnaire, The Quantitative ADAM (qADAM) Questionnaire, The Aging Male Symptoms (AMS) rating scale, The Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS) questionnaire and The New England Research Institutes (NERI) hypogonadism questionnaire. The applicability of these questionnaires in the clinical setting is debated because some of the symptoms associated with LOH could be attributed to the natural process of aging and comorbidities. The goal of this review is to compare the utility and the validity of the different LOH questionnaires.",

The use of salivary T (sal-T), as a determinant of systemic T, has shown promising results in recent years. However, the strength of the salivary-serum T relationship may be affected by measurement method and binding capacity with salivary proteins. The potential influence exercise may impact on this relationship is unstudied in aging men. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to examine the relationship of the delta change (Δ) in sal-T with Δserum T following six weeks exercise training. Fifteen sedentary (SED) males (aged 60.4 ± 5.0 years of age) and 20 lifelong exercising (LE) males (60.4 ± 4.7 years of age) were participated. Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed sal-T did not correlate with total testosterone (TT), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), bioactive T (bio-T), or free T (free-T) at week 0 or week 6. Δsal-T did not correlate with ΔTT, ΔSHBG, Δbio-T or Δfree-T (r = 0.271, p = 0.180; r = 0.197, p = 0.335; r = 0.258, p = 0.205; and r = 0.257, p = 0.205, respectively).

Blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff method. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides and testosterone levels were estimated in blood. Changes in expression levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS) (Ser-1177), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox, Rho A and Rho kinase (ROCK2) in CC were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Nitric oxide (NO)-mediated endothelium-dependent and neurogenic CC relaxation were evaluated by acetylcholine (ACh, 0.1 nM–100 µM) and electrical field stimulation (EFS; 30 V, 5 ms, 2–32 Hz), respectively.Results: In aged rats, NO-mediated, both endothelium-dependent and neurogenic CC relaxation, were significantly impaired as compared to adult rats. Besides, eNOS, p-eNOS and nNOS expressions decreased significantly in CC from aged rats, while gp91phox, RhoA and ROCK2 expressions increased significantly. The diminished relaxation in response to ACh or EFS as well as the changes in expression of these proteins in aged rats were significantly improved by pravastatin treatment.Conclusion: Pravastatin improves NO-mediated CC relaxations of aged rats probably by inhibiting NADPH oxidase/Rho kinase pathways, and this effect does not seem to be associated with lipid lowering effect of this drug.",

The diagnosis of sarcopenia requires documentation of decreased muscle mass and decreased muscle strength or physical function. The implication of user-friendly and inexpensive methods that could be used to assess sarcopenia in real-life settings is suggested in a recent debate paper. For muscle mass assessment, bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were described as having the same ease for muscle mass assessment in terms of applicability. However, BIA is easier to perform, has greater availability, inexpensive, and does not require specialist trained staff. The authors proposed the use of DXA as primary tool to assess muscle mass in the primary care setting. However, BIA is recommended as a first-line method both in research and clinical practice by EWGSOP. Regarding its much easier applicability, we conclude that BIA is a more practical method for muscle mass assessment in the primary care setting than the DXA. Thus, we suggest that BIA could be the method of choice for muscle mass assessment in the primary care setting.",

Common adverse events of treatment consist of sexual disorders and a negative affect balance. It was described that the prolonged use of 5α-steroid reductase inhibitors in patients with alopecia can cause persistent side effects called a post-finasteride syndrome (PFS), that is not just a simple coexistence of events, but rather a definite syndrome with an iatrogenic background. PFS occurs in susceptible individuals even after small doses of the drug and can last for a long time after the discontinuation of treatment. A deterioration in the quality of life in affected individuals does not justify use of the drug. Wider recognition of PFS symptoms, its incidence, course, prevention, and treatment possibilities will allow the indications for drug use to be reconsidered and treatment to be more personalized. Knowledge about PFS will also help to provide the best treatment for affected individuals and to properly educate patients before obtaining an informed consent for therapy with 5α-steroid reductase inhibitors.",

Comparison of four age-dependent groups (men ≤29 years, 30-35 years, 36-40 years, and >40 years) revealed a significant fall in the basic semen characteristics and sperm genomic integrity with age. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis confirmed that men >29 years had lower semen quality. In the group of men >29 years, the prevalence of men with abnormal semen parameters was higher, and these men had over a threefold higher odds ratio (OR) for abnormal semen parameters. Next, ROC analysis revealed that a threshold of 18% SDF was optimal for discriminating between men with normal and abnormal standard semen parameters. The prevalence of men with >18% SDF was higher in the group of men >29 years than in men ≤29 years. Older men had an almost twofold higher risk for >18% SDF than younger men. Our results suggest that age >29 years may be a causative factor of detrimental changes in semen quality, which may raise the risk for disorders of male fertility potential.",

    "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive tumor with a high metastatic potential, particularly affecting current or former heavy smokers. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy, often combined with radiotherapy, and immunotherapy for extensive disease. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is recommended to reduce brain metastases. Elderly SCLC patients face unique challenges due to frailty and comorbidities, leading to increased risks of treatment-related toxicity and malnutrition. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), a composite marker of nutritional and immune status, has shown promise in predicting outcomes in various malignancies. However, the optimal treatment approach for very elderly SCLC patients remains unclear, as they are often excluded from clinical trials.This study aimed to evaluate the survival outcomes of SCLC patients aged 75 years or older and their correlation with PNI.Retrospective cohort study.The study retrospectively analyzed data from 71 SCLC patients aged ≥75 years, focusing on age, gender, smoking status, chronic diseases, performance status, clinical stage, treatment modality, and pretreatment PNI. Survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of overall survival (OS).The results demonstrated that 26.8% of very elderly SCLC patients received no active treatment, resulting in a significantly shorter median survival time of 1.3 months. In contrast, patients who underwent aggressive treatment, such as palliative chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, had significantly longer median survival times. Multivariate analysis revealed that receiving chemotherapy plus radiotherapy was associated with a significant survival benefit compared to no treatment. Furthermore, low PNI (≤40) was independently associated with decreased OS.This study highlights the importance of active treatment and nutritional support in improving survival outcomes for very elderly SCLC patients. The findings suggest that low PNI and lack of oncological treatment are associated with worse survival outcomes. Therefore, integrating nutritional assessment, interventions, and appropriate treatment strategies are crucial in managing lung cancer patients. Larger, multicenter studies are needed to validate these findings and explore potential interventions to optimize nutritional status and improve outcomes for elderly patients with SCLC.",

Finally, the paper includes a short review of our knowledge of xenoestrogens and men's sexual health. A strong estrogen-deficient status is seen in male patients with mutations of the estrogen receptors or in cases of deviations of the aromatase gene. On the other hand, there are no clear age-dependent changes in estrogen secretion. But, in men with disorders of glucose metabolism and also of increased body mass index, the serum estrogen concentrations are significantly elevated. There are also strong positive correlations between serum estrogen levels and bone density, including prevalence of fractures and mood in men. New fields of interest are natural fatty esters of endogenous estrogens, e.g. lipoprotein-associated estrogens, and the role and clinical significance of tissue-specific, local estrogen biosynthesis (e.g. different promoters of the aromatase gene). Exogenous estrogen treatment is focused today on patients with normal testosterone and low levels of circulating estrogens documented on several occasions and with clinical symptoms of hormone deficiency; male-to-female transsexuals; and selected patients with prostate cancer. Some clinical studies show the benefits of estrogen treatment on some cardiovascular parameters and for treating selected signs of mental stress. An indirect estrogen replacement can occur if dehydroepiandrosterone is given orally to men. The clinical usefulness of dissociated estrogens, including non-feminizing estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators, is still an open question. The beneficial action of phytoestrogens in lowering the clinical symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia is well documented. Finally, the question about the definitive influence of so-called endocrine disruptors (xenoestrogens) on sexual functions in men is also discussed.",

Very few studies have, however, been reported among the Nigerian population on andropause-related issues. This study assesses the perspective and level of awareness of married men in Ile-Ife, South-west Nigeria, of andropause. We also assessed their experience of erectile dysfunction, using a questionnaire based on the review of the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction. The study involved 355 married men, aged between 30 and 70 years. Our result shows a high level of misconception about andropause among our respondents, with 38.9% indicating that it is a myth, and another 23.6% attributing it to various causes other than being a natural aging process. We recorded a prevalence of erectile dysfunction of 43.8% (8.0% severe dysfunction and 35.8% moderate dysfunction). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction increased significantly with age, varying from 38.5% for age 31-40 years to 63.9% for the older age group of 61-70 years. The trend in prevalence of erectile dysfunction with age was significant (p < 0.05). An odds ratio of 2.82 (95% confidence interval 1.19-6.76) was recorded for the prevalence of erectile dysfunction at age 61-70 years compared with age 31-40 years. Our findings indicate a need for health education about andropause in Nigeria, and increased attention to the reproductive health concerns of males, and the older population.KeywordsANDROPAUSE AWARENESS ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION MARRIED MEN NIGERIA",

The study group consisted of 34 males aged between 61 and 83 years, attending two hour-long training sessions a week. The comparative group consisted of 30 students. The photogrammetric method based on the Moire phenomenon was used to evaluate the body posture. The obtained data confirm characteristic tendencies of physiological spinal curvatures to change with the aging process. A decrease of the lumbar-sacral spinal-segment inclination and an increase of the upper thoracic spinal-segment inclination were observed in the elderly males. Whereas, the value of thoracic kyphosis lower-segment inclination was similar to the value obtained in young adult males. The stated differences indicate a flattening of lumbar lordosis and a deepening of the upper arch of thoracic kyphosis, which results in a characteristic body posture in the standing position with the head protruding and the upper trunk segment inclined. The above-mentioned observations indicate a dominance of the angular thoracic kyphosis value over the remaining spinal curvatures. These differences occur to a greater degree in elderly males.",

Androgens play a role in regulating trabecular smooth muscle growth and function. Further, androgens stimulate differentiation of progenitor cells into smooth muscle cells and inhibit their differentiation into adipocytes. We postulate that androgens exert a direct effect on penile tissue to maintain erectile function, and that androgen deficiency produces metabolic and structural imbalances in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in venous leakage and erectile dysfunction. To date, research efforts on the mechanisms by which androgens regulate penile erectile physiology have mainly focused on investigating the role of the NO/cGMP pathway. However, androgen-dependent mechanisms that regulate tissue remodeling have been poorly defined. Characterization of the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which androgens regulate corpus cavernosum structural and functional integrity would provide significant gains in knowledge and understanding of an important pathogenic process. In this review, we discuss the potential role of androgen in maintaining differentiation of progenitor cells into smooth muscle lineage and inhibition of differentiation into adipocytes. Androgen deficiency promotes differentiation into adipogenic lineage, and accumulation of adipocytes in the corpus cavernosum may contribute to erectile dysfunction.",

Applying 'classical' pharmacological/toxicological findings (e.g. animal studies on short- and long-term toxicity) to clinical situations is not very helpful. Molecular biological knowledge and especially evaluation of epidemiological studies, as well as intervention studies, on testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men are more useful. Potential risks include overdosage for lifestyle reasons, e.g. excessive muscle building and reduction of visceral obesity, when erythrocytosis occurs concomitantly. Modern galenic formulations of testosterone administration (e.g. transdermal gel, suitable testosterone esters for intramuscular application and newer oral preparations) avoid supraphysiological serum concentrations, therefore significantly reducing the toxicological risk. A hypothetical model of the toxicological risks of testosterone therapy is given that is based on the influence of testosterone metabolism (aromatization vs. reduction) of the respective parameter/target chosen. Finally, the great influence of polymorphisms of the androgen receptor on the assessment of toxicological risk and on the individualization of androgen therapy is shown. Already existing national, continental and international guidelines or recommendations for the testosterone therapy should be harmonized.",

    "abstract": "The role of testosterone deficiency in sexual dysfunction is an important aspect of aging, because it affects such a large proportion of men over 50 years old. A number of age-related factors can cause sexual dysfunction (in particular erectile dysfunction) and testosterone deficiency, such as chronic illness and multiple medications, and the causative link between hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction is still debated. However, studies in castrated animals have proven that addition of testosterone, and its conversion to dihydrotestosterone, can restore erectile function. It appears that testosterone achieves this by peripheral mechanisms (endothelial dependent and independent) and central mechanisms. Testosterone replacement therapy is therefore effective for erectile dysfunction in men with hypogonadism, with success rates of 35–40%. Testosterone supplementation is also important in men who fail on phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, because a minimum plasma concentration of testosterone is required for the successful restoration of erectile function with these agents. Testosterone gels are now the preferred formulation for testosterone supplementation and they can be highly beneficial in a proportion of men with erectile dysfunction.",

Twenty-one patients over 50 years of age with PADAM symptoms were included in this study. Laboratory and endocrinologic profiles were reviewed as appropriate, and PADAM symptoms were judged by means of several questionnaires such as the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, short version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). Laboratory and endocrinologic values and symptom scores were evaluated and compared before and after treatment by hCG injection. The treatment period was 8.0 ± 5.0 months (3.0 – 24.0 months). Serum concentrations of testosterone, including total testosterone, calculated free testosterone, and calculated bioavailable testosterone, increased significantly. AMS total scores and subscores decreased significantly after treatment. However, IIEF-5 and SDS scores did not improve. With respect to adverse effects, laboratory tests showed that only red blood cell count, hematocrit and hemoglobin level increased significantly after treatment, however, these values remained within the normal range. No adverse effect was identified after treatment. We conclude that hCG injection may be considered as a treatment for PADAM.",

For the purposes of discussion, it is suggested that treatment of late life hypogonodism requires the presence of symptoms, a low level of circulating free or bioavailable testosterone level and a positive response to treatment. While this may appear to be a radical proposal, we believe it represents the most rigorous scientific approach to the diagnosis of late life hypogonadism at the present time.",

The aim of this qualitative study was to provide information if and how prostate cancer affects men's daily lives 2 years after the diagnosis.Methods. A second follow-up interview with men who were diagnosed with localized or advanced prostate cancer approximately 18–24 months earlier. Twenty-two men aged 50–85 years participated, data were analyzed by hermeneutical interpretation with Gadamer's approach.Results. The men feel healthy, but prostate cancer affects their daily lives. They experience every day fatigue associated with several changes in life due to age. Three equivalent fusions which influenced the men are: ‘Age is claiming its due’, ‘Living with uncertainty’, and ‘Strengthen self-esteem’. The unifying fusion is identified as ‘Balancing a changed life situation.’Conclusions. There is need for knowledge and guidance for men with prostate cancer on how to adapt to new life situation decreasing uncertainty and increasing welfare. Men found a sense of pride, despite physical changes, in appreciating independence and close relationships. Value of life was readjusted. The findings indicate harmony in living, enjoying being frank as well as rating the ‘little’ things.",

    "abstract": "Background. It is of interest to understand whether impaired physical function is associated with health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL). We examined upper and lower body physical function and its relationship with two domains of HRQOL among men.Methods. We conducted a population-based observational study of musculoskeletal health among Boston, MA residents, the Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey. Participants were 1219 randomly-selected Black, Hispanic, and White males (30–79 years). Upper body function was measured using hand grip strength, while lower body function was measured by combining a timed walk and a chair stand test. HRQOL was measured using the physical (PCS-12) and mental health (MCS-12) component scores of the SF-12. Multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate the association between poor function and HRQOL.Results. There was a significant association of poor upper body physical function with the MCS-12 (β coefficient: −4.12, p = 0.003) but not the PCS-12 (β coefficient: 0.79, p = 0.30) compared to those without poor function. Those with poor lower body physical function had significantly lower PCS-12 scores (β: −2.95, p = 0.007), compared to those without poor function, but an association was not observed for MCS-12 scores.Conclusions. Domains of physical function were not consistently related to domains of HRQOL.",

Many risk factors included in its calculation influence or are influenced by circulating testosterone. To investigate the possible association between testosterone and cardiovascular risk, as defined by the Framingham score, a Veterans Affairs (VA) database was analyzed. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed. Inclusion criteria were male sex and age ≥ 20 years. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes. Data were collected on veterans who had total plasma testosterone checked in the year 2008. Results: The study included 1,479 patients (mean age 61 years). Framingham score was negatively associated with both total testosterone (p < 0.0001) and free testosterone (p = 0.0003). There was a positive association between total testosterone and high-density lipoprotein and negative associations between total testosterone and body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure medication use. Free testosterone was positively associated with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and current smoking status and negatively associated with age, BMI, and blood pressure medication use. The BMI was not associated with Framingham score. Conclusions: Lower plasma testosterone may suggest the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and potentially increased risk for heart disease.",

IPSS improved by an average of 9 points post-procedure. Pre-operatively their post-void residuals were 306.3 ml (range 120–499 ml SD [120.6]) and their QMAX was 7 ml/s (range 4–14 SD [2.8] ml/s). Post-procedure the post-void residual decreased by 35.4% at 4 months (mean difference – 106.3 ml). QMAX improved by an average of 1.7 ml/s, which was not statistically significant. No patients suffered any sexual dysfunction side effects and all patients were satisfied with their result. Hospital stay and theatre time were significantly reduced. Average length of stay was just 10.6 (6–18) hours and average theatre time just 18.7 (12–30) min. This is significantly faster than other surgery for LUTS. We therefore feel that there are significant benefits for both the patients, who are able to go home much faster, and also the hospital, who are able to perform far more surgeries for their patients. Patients also do not require an inpatient bed so patients should not be cancelled on the day of theatre.",

We used the search terms \"Mediterranean diet,\" \"lycopene,\" \"vitamin E,\" \"vitamin C,\" \"Selenium,\" \"resveratrol,\" \"prostate cancer,\" and combinations, such as \"lycopene and prostate cancer\" or \"resveratrol and prostate cancer.\"Results: Numerous studies investigating the effect of various dietary nutrients on PCa have suggested that selenium is probably the most promising. Several studies reported reduced PCa risk associated with vitamin C and E intake, while other studies reported no association. Lycopene inhibits cell proliferation and inducts apoptosis, thus protecting against cancer. Also, it has been found in various in vivo and in vitro studies that resveratrol, inhibits PCa development.Conclusions: The high content of bioactive phytochemicals in the MeDi is of particular interest in the prevention of PCa. Further large-scale studies are required to clarify the effect of MeDi bioactive compounds on prostate health, in order to establish the role of this diet in the prevention of PCa.",

Risk of vascular catastrophe is higher in males than females, thought, in part, due to anti-atherosclerotic effects of oestrogens in females whilst an associated age-related deficiency of testosterone is observed in men. Clinical symptoms such as high blood pressure, changes in lipid profile, insulin resistance, obesity, and blood coagulation factors often accompany declining testosterone in males and reduced total testosterone is considered a cardiovascular risk factor. In the present study, the prevalence of hypogonadism in men who had suffered ischaemic stroke was evaluated along with the efficacy of testosterone undecanoate injections (TU) in patients with testosterone deficiency and type-2 diabetes (T2DM) in the acute phase of hemispheric ischaemic stroke. Hypogonadism was present in 66.3% of patients with ischaemic stroke, 50% with T2DM, and 26.3% without T2DM, respectively. TU treatment, at both the 2 and 5-year observation points, demonstrated significant improvements in biochemical, physical, and mental parameters. This supports that testosterone deficiency is a contributing factor in ischaemic events and that long-term testosterone therapy could play an important role in patient recovery.",

Resistance exercise delays the changes of aging.Aim: This study aimed to analyze alterations of the left ventricle of aged rats subjected to resistance exercise with administration of testosterone.Methods: Wistar rats were divided into five groups: C Group (control), S Group (sedentary), ST Group (sedentary treated with testosterone), T Group (trained) and TT Group (trained and treated with testosterone), strength training protocol and testosterone treatment were 16 weeks long. All groups were sacrificed at 16 months except for C group, sacrificed at 13 months.Results: There was no change in the weight of the heart or the left ventricle between the groups. ST group showed increase in Nv [cap] density of capillaries and collagen, with no differences in interstitial space. Both trained groups (T and TT) showed increase in the numerical density of capillaries (Nv [cap]) and in the interstitial space, with no changes in collagen.Conclusion: Resistance exercise combined with testosterone triggered a response of compensatory adjustment in the increase of Nv [cap], collagen and interstitial space, increasing perfusion and nutrition to the heart.",

However, the association between partial androgen deficiency of the aging male and clinical symptoms and the ideal screening test are controversial. In this study, we investigated the association between the androgen levels and erectile function, cognitive functions and hypogonadism symptoms in aging males.We investigated the association between total (TT), calculated free (FT) and bioavailable (BT) testosterone, and various clinical and laboratory parameters in 103 healthy males, 50-80 years old. Biochemical assessment was done after overnight fasting. Questionnaires were used to test for hypogonadism symptoms, erectile and cognitive functions.TT levels were not correlated with aging in this study. However, FT and BT were found to decrease with age due to rising sex hormone binding globulin. TT levels were strongly correlated with FT and BT levels (respectively p = 0.0001, p = 0.0001). TT, FT and BT were only correlated with cognitive functions (p = 0.012, p = 0.004, p = 0.02 respectively). There was no correlation between TT, FT and BT levels and erectile function and hypogonadism symptoms.T values in our study sample did not correlate with clinical signs and symptoms of hypogonadism. Thus, according to our data, symptoms in the aging male should not be indiscriminately assigned to a decrease in TT, FT or BT levels.",

Three older men (74-88 years old) with prostate cancer, using ADT continuously for at least 12 months and regularly exercising for at least 6 months, participated in this qualitative pilot study, informed by interpretive phenomenology. Data were gathered using individual semi-structured interviews, audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Coherent stories were drawn from each transcript and analyzed using iterative and interpretive methods. van Manen's lifeworld existentials provided a framework for interpreting across the research text. Three notions emerged: Getting started, Having a routine and Being with music. Together they reveal what drew the participants to exercising regularly despite the challenges associated with their cancer and treatments. This study provides insights into the benefits of, and what it means for, older men with prostate cancer to regularly exercise individually. These findings may assist cancer clinicians and other allied health professionals to be more attuned to prostate cancer survivors' lived experiences when undergoing ADT, allowing clinicians to better promote regular exercise to their patients as a foundational component of living well.",

Their data were collected and retrospectively analyzed. A modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated for each patient based on 11 risk factors from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index. The 1-year adverse outcomes were correlated with mFI, patients' and procedure's risk factors.Results: Mean age was 64.9 ± 5.2 years. No mortality was reported in our patients, however, one-year adverse outcomes were encountered in 43 (79.6%) patients. Among all studied variables, the 1-year adverse outcomes was not significantly association with mFI, but with preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (p = 0.031) and associated Peyronie's disease (PD) (p = 0.000). HbA1c, dyslipidemia, hypertension, PD and duration of the procedure were predictive of infection complications (p < 0.05).

A total of 969 men, aged between 40 and 80 years old, were admitted. Physical examination and the sex hormones were measured, and AMS and IIEF-5 scores were assessed.Results: The oneway ANOVA analysis indicated older age groups had higher AMS total-scores, somatic and sexual sub-scores, and lower IIEF5 scores (all p < .01). Pairwise correlation (rpairwise) analyses showed the significant associations between AMS and age or sex hormone (cFT, Bio-T, SHBG, and LH) levels, and similar for IIEF5. However, when age was adjusted, the correlation coefficients (rpartial) weakened, and correlation significance disappeared, except LH (for AMS: rpartial = 0.096, p = .009; for IIEF-5: rpartial = −0.140, p = .001). Multiple linear regressions confirmed the influence of increased age and LH on the AMS and IIEF5 scores.Conclusion: CFT, Bio-T and SHBG failed to yield any additional predicting information when age was adjusted.

    "abstract": "Objective: Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is an adipokine associated with obesity. Data about the relationship of IL-18 to the metabolic syndrome (MS) are still scarce. Low testosterone (T) levels are common in men with MS, but we did not find data about the levels of IL-18 in men with low T. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of IL-18 in men with MS with or without low T. Patients and methods: A total of 251 men were included in the study. Of them 218 had MS (IDF 2005) and they were divided according to their morning total testosterone (TT) level (cutoff 10.4 nmol/l) into two groups: MS-low T (N = 84) and MS-normal T (N = 134). The control group consisted of 33 men without MS and low T. IL-18 was determined in serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A small group of eight men with MS and low T levels received testosterone therapy for three months and physical and laboratory parameters were monitored at the end of that period.Results: MS men were at mean age (±SD) = 53.77 ± 9.59 years; body mass index (BMI) = 34.0 ± 6.3 kg/m2; and TT = 12.59 ± 5.66 nmol/l. The control group was at age = 52.12 ± 5.2 years (NS); BMI = 25.6 ± 2.4 kg/m2 (p < .001); and TT = 17.8 ± 5.68 nmol/l (p < .001), respectively. The levels of IL-18 were higher in the MS group – 345 pg/ml compared to the control one – 264 pg/ml (p < .01). There was no significant difference between MS-low T (330.6 pg/ml) and MS-normal T (350.2 pg/ml) subgroups. The MS-normal T differed more significantly from the control group (p < .001). Significant correlation of testosterone with IL-18 levels was not found. IL-18 correlated with parameters of obesity, lipids, fasting blood sugar (p < .05) and the number of criteria for MS (p < .001). Three months on T treatment showed improvement in obesity parameters and only in one patient IL-18 had clear reduction while the rest showed no change.Conclusions: In this study, higher IL-18 levels were found in the presence of MS compared to healthy men, but they did not differ between men having MS with or without LOH.",

Group I (n = 325) diagnosed with MetS and mean age of 56.07 ± 8.51 years. Group II (n = 290) subjects with no MetS and mean age 54.97 ± 8.14 years. Patients filled the IIEF questionnaire, medical, personal history, and BMI data were tabulated. Metabolic syndrome was determined when three or more of the five risk factors were present according to the NCEP.Results: In Group I (79.4%) of the patients had erectile dysfunction (ED). Of these, 20.3% had mild, 22.5% had moderate, and 36.6% had severe ED and 30% of patients without MetS had ED. Of these, 17.2% had mild, 5.9% had moderate, and 6.9% had severe ED (p < .001; odds ratio 5.549; 95% CI 3.101-9.928). Patients with metabolic syndrome had lower IIEF-EF domain scores. Logistic regression analysis revealed that DM, dyslipidemia, age, and HTN were the most important criteria for ED in the MetS group (p < .01). While in the group without MetS, DM, HTN, HDL, and age were the most important risk factors (p < .01), and TG and BMI were less important.Conclusions: MetS is a potential risk factor for ED in Egyptian men.

The locomotive system includes support (bones), mobility and impact absorption (joints and intervertebral disks), drive and control (muscles, nerves), and network (blood vessels). The impairment of any of those systems can lead to a major decrease in quality of life. In recent years, several studies on methods to improve and prevent conditions impairing the locomotive syndrome have been conducted. Almost in parallel with the structure supporting mobility and body functions, testosterone levels decrease with age. Testosterone is a hormone-regulating several pathways affecting each aspect of the locomotive syndrome. Testosterone is regulated by the pituitary gland triggering several processes in the body through genomic and non-genomic pathways, affecting muscles, bones, nerves, joints, intervertebral discs, and blood vessels. The purpose of this review is to investigate the role of testosterone in each of the systems involved in the locomotive syndrome.",

    "abstract": ":Prostate cancer is a common malignancy among men, and the current screening, imaging and sampling approaches aim to detect early-stage, organ-confined disease. In such scenario, focal prostate cancer therapy currently relies on the index lesion concept as the dominant lesion that drives the disease natural history. Focal therapy demands the essential imaging and sampling techniques to strategically locate and qualify the disease, but, despite advances in technology, prostate imaging and biopsy have several limitations that need to be overcome if focal therapy is to be developed further. The I Prostate Cancer Focal Treatment International Symposium was convened to foster discussion on this topic that sits at the crossroads of multiple disciplines (Urology, Pathology, Radiology, Radiation Oncology and Medical Oncology) all of which were represented for this comprehensive multidisciplinary review of the current literature.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in aging Japanese men with late-onset hypogonadism (LOH).This study included 50 (median age: 57.7 years) Japanese men with LOH, who were consecutively enrolled and treated with TRT for at least six months at our institution. We evaluated the following measurements before and after six months of treatment with TRT as follows: blood tests, prostate volume, residual urine volume, self-ratings for International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Aging Male Symptom (AMS) and the Medical Outcomes Study 8-item Short-Form health survey (SF-8).Following six months of TRT, the levels of testosterone, red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly increased from baseline, while total cholesterol level was significantly decreased from baseline. Furthermore, TRT led to a significant increase in IIEF-5 score and a significant decrease in IPSS score. Of 30 men who were diagnosed with depression at baseline, only 11 men (36.7%) were still suffering from depression after TRT, and SDS scores were significantly decreased from baseline at month six. Treatment with TRT led to a significant decrease in all scores of the AMS scale as well as a significant improvement in all scores of the SF-8 survey, with the exception of the bodily pain score.These findings suggest that TRT is an effective and safe treatment for aging Japanese men with LOH. TRT improved depressive symptoms as well as health-related quality of life.",

All patients were assessed using The International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, uroflowmetry, post voiding residual (PVR). BWT was measured by Trans-abdominal ultrasound, and patients were divided into two groups group 1 (patients with BWT <5 mm) and group 2 (patients with BWT ≥5 mm). The patients were reassessed after 2 months of treatment with α 1 receptor blocker (alfuzosin 10 mg). Clinical parameters were analyzed and compared between groups.Results: There were significant difference between both groups as regard IPSS, voiding symptoms, and storage symptoms (p = 0.005), (p = 0.010) and (p = 0.041) respectively. After medication, there were improvements in the total IPSS, voiding symptoms, storage symptoms, Qmax, PVR and Qol in both groups and these improvements were more effectively in (group 1) than (group 2) with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05).Conclusion: BWT has positive correlation with the total IPSS, voiding symptoms subscores and storage symptoms subscores. The response to medical treatment is found statistically less in patients with BWT greater than 5 mm.",

We used MDRD, CKDEPI-CR, and CKDEPI-CC formulas for GFR estimation and corrected these for body surface area. Muscle strength was assessed by HGS.Results: 209 men (mean age 67.8 ± 6.4) were enrolled. Sixty-two patients (29.7%) had sarcopenic HGS. Subjects with sarcopenic HGS were older, had higher rate of a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, had lower mid-upper arm circumference; tended to have lower creatine kinase, albumin, CKDEPI-CC-GFR levels; and higher BUN/creatinine ratio and cystatin C. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a CKDEPI-CC lower than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 as the only independent factor underlying sarcopenic HGS. Higher age tended to have an independent association. Only higher age was independently associated with low HGS when other estimations were used (p = 0.013 and p = 0.021 when MDRD and CKDEPI-CR were used, respectively).Conclusions: There is a strong association of a GFR level of <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 with sarcopenic HGS, when CKDEPI-CC formula is used.",

The aetiology of ED is often multifactorial but evidence is being accumulated in favor of the proper function of the vascular endothelium that is essential to achieving and maintaining penile erection. Uric acid itself causes endothelial dysfunction via decreased nitric oxide production. This study aims to evaluate the serum uric acid (SUA) levels in 180 ED patients, diagnosed with the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) and 30 non-ED control. Serum uric acid was analyzed with a commercially available kit using ModularEVO (Roche, Monza, Italy). Within-assay and between-assay variations were 3.0% and 6.0%, respectively. Out of the ED patients, 85 were classified as arteriogenic (A-ED) and 95 as non-arteriogenic (NA-ED) with penile-echo-color-Doppler. Uric acid levels (median and range in mg/dL) in A-ED patients (5.8, 4.3-7.5) were significantly higher (p < .001) than in NA-ED patients (4.4, 2.6-5.9) and in control group (4.6, 3.1-7.2). There was a significant difference (p < .001) between uric acid levels in patients with mild A-ED (IIEF-5 16-20) and severe/complete A-ED (IIEF-5 ≤ 10) that were 5.4 (range 4.3-6.5) mg/dL and 6.8 (range 6.4-7.2) mg/dL, respectively. There was no difference between the levels of uric acid in patients with different degree of NA-ED. Our findings reveal that SUA is a marker of ED but only of ED of arteriogenic aetiology.",

We assessed the relationship between aging male symptomatology and eating behavior in middle-aged and older men.Method: We distributed anonymous questionnaires to men aged 40–75 years living in or near Innsbruck, Austria, covering demographic items, current eating disorder symptoms (as defined by DSM-5), and associated measures of eating pathology, body image, and sports activity (including exercise addiction). We also administered the Aging Males' Symptoms scale (AMS), and classified respondents as \"high-AMS\" (AMS score ≥37; N = 82) or \"low-AMS\" (AMS score <37; N = 386).Results: High-AMS men reported a significantly higher mean current BMI, a greater prevalence of eating disorder symptoms, higher scores on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, greater risk of exercise addiction, and more negative body image than low-AMS men.Discussion: We found a marked association between aging-male symptomatology and eating-disorder symptomatology in aging men. Our findings suggest that clinicians should carefully inquire about eating disorder symptoms in men aged 40 and above reporting aging-male symptomatology. Importantly, several men in the study reported \"purging\" via excessive exercise (as opposed to the more common methods of vomiting or use of laxatives or diuretics), and therefore this should be a subject of inquiry in clinical evaluations. To pursue these findings, subsequent studies of eating disorders in older men should consider assessing endocrinological measures, particularly testosterone levels, and should use longitudinal designs.",

Both excised PD and post-traumatic plaques were analyzed by blind pathologists with an 80kV potential acceleration electron microscope.Results Five patients were identified with a post-traumatic plaque (Group 1) and therefore an equal number of PD patients were enrolled for Group 2. The ultrastructural characteristics of the two types of preparations were very similar. In all the samples we showed an inflammatory reaction of the structure of the tunica albuginea, a production of the disorganized extracellular matrix, a proliferation of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. Furthermore, we have found an increase in the density and collagen deposits grouped in the extracellular space and within the fibroblasts.Conclusions These findings support the theory that attributes lesions and symptoms typical of PD to the effects of cavernous body trauma.",

We started our cryotherapy program in 2008 for selected patients with localized PC. Our objective is to evaluate the oncologic and functional outcomes of primary cryotherapy in men with clinically localized PC.We retrospectively evaluated all patients who underwent primary cryotherapy for localized PC treatment at our center between January 2008 and December 2017. In order to downsize prostates between 40 and 60cc neoadjuvant 3-month hormonal therapy was administered. Primary endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) rate as defined by the Phoenix criteria. Secondary endpoints were cancer-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), patient reported functional outcomes and complication rates. Factors influencing de BPFS were evaluated individually using Kaplan-Meyer and Cox regression models and in a multivariate model using Cox regression.During the mentioned period, a total of 177 men were treated with cryotherapy. With a mean follow-up of 60 months (SD 32.9), the Kaplan-Meier analysis shows an overall BPFS rate was 67%. BPFS by risk group was 70.2%, 70.3% and 50.0% for the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively (p = 0.925). Overall time to BR was 93.67 months (SD 2.84, IC95%: 88.10-99.24): 95.91 (SD 3,44), 93.23 (SD 4.81) and 89.77 (SD 6.67) months for the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, the only predictor of biochemical progression was de PSA nadir (HR 1.56 IC95%: 1.50-1.63). Continence was fully maintained in 95% of patients after the procedure. Postoperative complications included UTI (17.5%), hematuria (9.6%), perineal hematoma (11%) and postoperative pain (4.5%). No fistulas were reported. 8.5% of patients had acute urinary retention solved conservatively.Cryotherapy is a safe option for selected patients with localized prostate cancer that provides competitive oncologic outcomes and a low morbidity profile.",

    "abstract": "Disability is utmost important on an aging population's health. Obesity is associated with increased risk for disability. On-the-other-hand, higher-BMI is reported as associated with better functionality in older people in some reports defined as \"obesity paradox\". There is some evidence on differential relationship between body weight status and functionality by living setting gender, and different populations. We studied the relation between body mass index and functionality in Turkish community dwelling older males accounting for the most confounding factors: age, multimorbidity, polypharmacy and nutritional status. This is a cross-sectional study in a geriatric outpatient clinic of a university hospital. Functionality was assessed with evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scales. Nutrition was assessed by mini-nutritional assessment test. Two hundred seventy-four subjects comprised our study cohort. Mean age was 74.4 ± 7.1 years, BMI was 25.8 ± 4.4 kg/m2. Linear regression analysis revealed significant and independent association of lower BMI with higher ADL and IADL scores (B = 0.047 and B = 0.128, respectively) (p < 0.05) and better nutritional status (B = 1.94 and B = 3.05, respectively) (p < 0.001) but not with the total number of medications. Higher IADL score was associated with younger age and lower total number of diseases (B = 0.121, B = 0.595, respectively) (p < 0.05) while ADL was not. We suggest that lower BMI is associated with better functional status in Turkish community-dwelling male older people. Our study recommends longitudinal studies with higher participants from different populations, genders and living settings are needed to comment more.",

    "abstract": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) causes an increase in total body fat, leading to a net gain in body weight. Moreover, the use of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in ADT causes a decrease in serum androgen levels, leading to the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Androgen blockade significantly increases plasma adiponectin levels, which has some efficacy against MetS, whereas ADT increases fasting plasma insulin and decreases insulin sensitivity, suggesting that there are other mechanisms involved in the onset of MetS besides adiponectin activation. We investigated the effects of ADT on serum aP2 and adiponectin in PCa patients. Six months post-ADT, serum aP2 and adiponectin levels were significantly increased, although there were no changes in patient body weight and no correlation between the changes in serum aP2 and total adiponectin levels. The serum adiponectin and aP2 levels have independent implications in ADT for PCa; therefore, their combined measurement will clarify the impact on the development of obesity-related diseases during ADT. Contrary to adiponectin, high serum aP2 levels were correlated with the late development of MetS. Further studies are needed to investigate the future occurrence of metabolic diseases post-ADT.",

    "abstract": "Background Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (CaP) are among the most frequently occurring prostatic diseases. When CaP progressed to castration-resistant CaP (CRPC), the prognosis is poor. Although CaP/CRPC and BPH frequently coexist in prostate, the inter-relational mechanism between them is largely unknown.Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk-RNA sequencing, and microarray data of BPH, CaP in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were obtained and comprehensively analyzed. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and lasso regression analysis were performed to explore the potential biomarkers.Results With WGCNA, five modules in BPH, two in CaP, and three in CRPC were identified as significant modules. Pathway enrichment analysis found that the epigenetics and chromosomal-related signaling were dominantly clustered in the CaP group but not in BPH and CRPC. Lasso regression analysis was used to analyze further the mutual genes between the BPH module and the CRPC module. As a result, DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L were significantly correlated with the transcriptomic features in both BPH and CRPC. More importantly, the role of the four gene signatures was validated in two independent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy cohort.Conclusion This study revealed the shared gene signatures and immune microenvironment between BPH and CRPC. The identified hub genes, including DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L, might be potential therapeutic targets for facilitating immunotherapy in prostate cancer.",

With the growing use of testosterone products, there is concern about the long-term risks of androgen supplementation therapy, particularly on the prostate. This article reviews what is known about the safety of testosterone replacement therapy in terms of the potential risks for development of symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and prostate cancer. Androgens are undoubtedly involved in the growth of benign prostatic nodules, as a permissive factor in the etiology of prostate carcinoma and in the enhancement of the growth of active prostate cancer. Their role in the initiation of either disease is less clear. Available data support the safety of such treatment in the short term. Caution is still advised in the interpretation of these findings, as the studies producing the data have involved relatively small numbers of participants. Until large, long-term, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted and analyzed, questions about the long-term safety of testosterone supplementation therapy in older men will remain.",

Forty-eight middle-aged men, with type 2 diabetes, (visceral) obesity and symptoms of androgen deficiency, were included in this open-label study. Twenty-four subjects received testosterone undecanoate (TU; 120 mg daily, for 3 months); 24 subjects received no treatment. Body composition was analyzed by bio-impedance. Parameters of metabolic control were determined. Symptoms of androgen deficiency and erectile dysfunction were scored by self-administered questionnaires. TU had a positive effect on (visceral) obesity: statistically significant reduction in body weight (2.66%), waist-hip ratio (-3.96%) and body fat (-5.65%); negligible changes were found in the control group. TU significantly improved metabolic control: decrease in blood glucose values and mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (from 10.4 to 8.6%). TU treatment significantly improved symptoms of androgen deficiency (including erectile dysfunction), with virtually no change in the control group. There were no adverse effects on blood pressure or hematological, biochemical and lipid parameters, and no adverse events. Oral TU treatment of type 2 diabetic men with androgen deficiency improves glucose homeostasis and body composition (decrease in visceral obesity), and improves symptoms of androgen deficiency (including erectile dysfunction). In these men, the benefit of testosterone supplementation therapy exceeds the correction of symptoms of androgen deficiency and also includes glucose homeostasis and metabolic control.",

A survey of diabetic men was conducted by anonymous questionnaire to investigate the associations of erectile dysfunction with various predictive factors. A total of 112 diabetic males without an obvious history of erectile dysfunction were available for analyses. The mean age and duration of diabetes were 53.7 +/- 12.2 years and 10.2 +/- 8.6 years (mean +/- standard deviation), respectively. The questionnaire included questions on the presence or absence of smoking, hypertension, libido and subjective symptoms of diabetic neuropathy that may be associated with erectile dysfunction. Analysis of the answers to the questionnaire revealed that 40% of the patients complained of erectile dysfunction (erection 'always insufficient'). Erectile dysfunction was significantly correlated with age (p = 0.005), but not with duration of diabetes (p = 0.25), adjusted for age. Erectile dysfunction was also associated with sensory neuropathy and reduced libido, independently of age. The logistic regression analysis revealed that erectile dysfunction was positively associated with reduced libido and age. The odds ratio of erectile dysfunction for reduced compared to unreduced libido was 18.21, suggesting that psychogenic factors have a marked influence on erectile dysfunction. It is concluded that the presence of erectile dysfunction should be considered when symptoms related to diabetic neuropathy are observed; psychological approaches, such as sexual counseling, could be applied for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.",

This study aimed to explore perceptions of ED among men with ED and how these perceptions came about.Methods. This qualitative study utilized in-depth interviews involving 17 urban men aged between 40 and 75 years old.Results. Misconceptions existed regarding the definitions of ED. Most men perceived impotence to be more serious than ED. Although most were aware of the medical causes of ED, 'overuse of penis' and black magic were mentioned as culturally-related causes. ED was perceived as a serious problem associated with loss of manhood and it had a significant impact on relationships with their partners. However, some adopted an 'accepting' view and attributed it to aging and fate. Most men were only familiar with PDE-5 inhibitors and traditional therapies. PDE-5 inhibitors were perceived to be effective but they were concerned about side effects and costs.Conclusions. Identifying men's perceptions of ED and its treatment would help doctors in their consultation, and inform health policy makers in planning appropriate public education and services.",

This new testosterone formulation (1000 mg testosterone undecanoate in 4 ml castor oil) possesses nearly ideal long-term kinetics, i.e. sustained close mimicking of eugonadal testosterone serum levels without supra- or sub-physiological serum concentrations. The generally accepted administration scheme recommends the second injection 6 weeks after the first one followed by further injections every 12 weeks. Applying this regimen, administration intervals are drastically reduced in comparison to conventional i.m. testosterone preparations (e.g. about 16 injections of testosterone enanthate vs. 4-5 injections of testosterone undecanoate per year). Depending on the testosterone serum levels, individualized therapy is possible by shortening (every 10 weeks) or prolonging (every 14 weeks) the injection intervals. In hypogonadal patients with ED 58% respond to testosterone undecanoate alone. Best results are seen in diabetic hypogonadal patients. The regimen of injectable testosterone undecanoate administration ideally fits recommendations regarding pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety monitoring.",

The exact sampling conditions in relation to circadian and seasonal variations, diet, alcohol, physical activity and posture.Physiological and medical factors. Androgen levels vary according to the patient's general health, stress, sexual activity and smoking habits.Analytical variables. Sample preservation and storage variables are often unknown.The different androgen assays used have widely differing accuracy and precision and are subject to large inter-laboratory variation, which especially in women and children can render the results of routinely available direct immunoassays meaningless.Interpretation of results. Laboratory reference ranges vary widely, largely independent of methodology, and fail to take into account the log-normal distribution of androgen values, causing errors in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Other unknowns are antagonists such as SHBG, estrogens, catecholamines, cortisol, and anti-androgens. As well as age, androgen receptor polymorphisms play a major role in regulating androgen levels and resistance to their action.Conclusions. Though laboratory assays can support a diagnosis of androgen deficiency in men, they should not be used to exclude it. It is suggested that there needs to be greater reliance on the history and clinical features, together with careful evaluation of the symptomatology, and where necessary a therapeutic trial of androgen treatment given.",

This aim of this review is to assess evidence for both organizational and activational effects of gonadal steroids as the principle cause of sex difference in visuo-spatial ability. Additionally, the implications of this relationship are discussed in the context of decreasing levels of gonadal steroids in aging males and psychological theories of generalized age-related cognitive decline. Based upon human and non-human research gonadal steroids have organizational effects on visuo-spatial ability in adulthood. Activational effects of gonadal steroids on visuo-spatial ability appear most dominant in older men and are necessary for maintaining optimal visuo-spatial ability; randomized clinical trials show that testosterone supplementation improves performance. Additionally, decreasing gonadal steroid levels in aging males may contribute to generalized age-related cognitive decline. Future supplementation studies in men should attempt to control for constituent abilities related to visuo-spatial task performance, and investigate interactions between dosage levels and baseline gonadal status. Further future animal research is required to investigate changes in gonadal steroid levels and their relationship to neurotransmitter systems, neural plasticity, and behavioral correlates.",

The social position was expressed using their educational level, commonly accepted as a reliable and specific index of social status in Poland.Male aging in Poland was accompanied by an increase in the intensity of all groups of evaluated symptoms (psychological, sexual and somato-vegetative symptoms, respectively: r = 0.36, r = 0.72, r = 0.59, all p < 0.0001). The results of ANOVA revealed the independent effects of both age and social status on the intensity of psychological symptoms (F = 17.89, p < 0.0001 and F = 9.51, p < 0.0001 for age and educational level, respectively), sexual (F = 114.70, p < 0.0001 and F = 5.90, p < 0.01), and somato-vegetative symptoms (F = 52.86, p < 0.0001 and F = 3.85, p < 0.05). The better the education of Polish men, the less intense the aging males' symptoms, irrespective of their age.Age and social position constitute major determinants of the intensity of aging males' symptoms in Poland.",

Twenty-two eugonadal patients over 40 years of age with LOH-related symptoms were included in this study. SKRBT was given orally to these patients three times daily to a total of 7.5 g/day for more than two months. Laboratory and endocrinological profiles were reviewed, and LOH symptoms were judged by means of several health assessment instruments such as the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, Self-rated Depression Scale (SDS), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ). Total AMS scores and AMS subscores were significantly decreased after the treatment. The KHQ, general health perception and impact on life scores were also significantly decreased, although no significant improvement was observed in other KHQ factors or the SDS score or IPSS. The serum concentrations of testosterone fractions did not change with treatment. Laboratory values did not change, and no adverse effects were identified after treatment. We conclude that SKRBT may be considered for treatment of patients with LOH-related symptoms for eugonadal patients.",

Height (cm), weight (kg), waist circumference (cm) and blood pressure were measured. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and blood lipids were determined. BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry on a Hologic QDR 4500 bone densitometer. In men around 59.3% had a waist circumference > 94 cm (abdominal obesity). Among them 58.7% showed abnormal BP values. Around 30.7% had FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L and 22.7% had low high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and 36.6% had hypertriglyceridemia. In men with the metabolic syndrome, mean lumbar spine BMD was 0.986 ± 0.210 g/cm2 and total hip BMD – 1.012 ± 0.209 g/cm2. The corresponding values in men without this syndrome were 0.934 ± 0.179 g/cm2 and 0.894 ± 0.189 g/cm2, respectively. The inter-group BMD difference reached statistical significance only at the hip (p = 0.039). Respectively, the prevalence of osteoporosis at the central sites was significantly higher in men without the metabolic syndrome (MS) (13.2 versus 20.8%, p = 0.03). Our data confirmed the trend for higher BMD in the studied men with the metabolic syndrome.",

The most appropriate Japanese traditional herbal medicine was administered to patients according to their pathogenic alteration. After 4 weeks, the clinical efficacy was evaluated based on improvement of LOH symptoms and the score of the simplified menopausal index (SMI). Additionally, predictive factors of efficacy of Japanese traditional herbal medicine were analyzed.Among 151 patients with LOH, 63 (41.8%) achieved both relief from LOH symptoms and normalized SMI score (Excellent response group), whereas 44 (29.1%) achieved either relief from LOH symptoms or normalized SMI score (Fair). However, 44 (29.1%) patients displayed neither relief from LOH symptoms nor normalized SMI score (Poor). Adverse reactions were observed only in four (2.6%) patients. Patients displaying excess conditions and mild LOH symptoms appeared to be superior candidates for Japanese traditional herbal medicine.Japanese traditional herbal medicine is an effective and safe treatment for LOH.",

Hot flashes were detected objectively through sternal skin conductance and by patients via electronic event marking. Activity levels were recorded on a wrist actigraphy device.The mean frequency of objectively measured and patient-reported hot flashes was 13.6 (SD = 14.3) and 12.6 (SD = 9.6), respectively. There were significant 24-h circadian rhythms of both hot flashes and activity levels. The peak of the rhythms occurred in early afternoon. There was no significant cross correlation between hot flashes and activity levels.The acrophases of hot flashes and elevated activity levels in this study may represent a normalisation of circadian rhythms following ADT, pointing to the need for more research, including controlled, prospective chronobiologic studies. Future research may have important implications for the survival of prostate cancer patients and the identification of new and safe hot flash treatments.",

Methods: A cross-sectional postal survey of 2325 Canadian community dwelling men aged 55–97 years old was conducted in 2008 to gauge older men's level of concern for 24 different health items, to determine the impact of age, education and health status on these perceptions, and to ascertain whether men perceive that their health concerns are being attended to. Results: Health issues of greatest concern to men were mobility impairment (64% of respondents), memory loss (64%), and medication side effects (63%). Respondents with lower educational attainment expressed greater concern about their health and were almost 2-fold times more likely to report being concerned about stroke, heart disease and prostate disorders in analyses that controlled for age and health status. Physical and mental health were independently associated with various concerns about health, but old age was not a reliable predictor, with only younger men (<75 years old) differentially preoccupied by conditions such as erectile dysfunction. Health items of greatest concern to men tended to be those with the lowest screening or counseling rates: these included incontinence, osteoporosis, mobility impairment, falls, anxiety issues, memory loss and depression. Conclusion: An improved consumer-guided agenda for addressing older men's health in the coming decade is urgently required.",

Testosterone replacement therapy is used widely to treat LOH. However, the side effects of it should not be ignored, such as fluid retention, hypertension and spermatogenic suppression. Therefore, alternate treatment modalities have been pursued. Herbal medicines used widely in China have achieved satisfying results with little side effects. Nonetheless, there are few pharmacological researches on them. In this study, 24-month-old mice were used as LOH animal models to explore the pharmacological effects of a herbal medicine, saikokaryukotsuboreito (SKRBT), on serum testosterone levels and sexual functions. Furthermore, the expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein, a kind of rate-limiting enzyme of testosterone synthesis, was also examined. As a result, SKRBT improved the serum testosterone levels of these mice at a dose of 300 and 450 mg/kg. Multiple measures of sexual behavior were enhanced. The expression of StAR was also increased. Therefore, this study suggested that SKRBT can improve the serum testosterone levels by activating the expression of StAR and might be a viable option to treat sexual symptoms caused by LOH.",

On the other hand, evidence has been accumulating that anemia reflects poor health and increased vulnerability to poor outcomes in older persons. Moreover, alcohol consumption has also been reported to be associated with mortality. However, no studies have reported on a possible association between height and risk of anemia in relation to drinking status.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1287 men aged 40–89 years undergoing general health check-ups.Results: Independent from classic cardiovascular risk factors, we found a significant inverse association between height and anemia for non-drinkers and a J-shaped association for drinkers. The multivariable odds ratio (ORs) of an increment of 1 SD (standard deviation) in height (6.68 cm) for anemia for non-drinkers was 0.59 (0.45–0.77). For drinkers, with the second quartile of height (Q2) as the reference group, the multivariable OR of anemia was 2.68(0.90–7.96) (p = 0.075) for the lowest height quartile (Q1), 2.73(0.92–8.08) for the third quartile (Q3) and 4.82(1.65–14.10) for the highest quartile (Q4) (p = 0.004).Conclusion: Height was found to be associated with anemia for rural Japanese men and drinking status is likely to affect those associations.",

Patients and methods: A case-control study is based on consecutive cases treated for low energy distal radius fracture at our department and age-matched controls. Thirty-nine men treated between 1997–2004 and 45 age-matched controls underwent calcaneal bone density measurements (t-score) and analyses of T, Bio-T and serum hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Results: The fracture group had lower BMD (p < 0.01) and lower FAI (p = 0.01). Linear regression analysis showed a correlation between Bio-T and t-scores (p = 0.03). Using analysis of covariance, a significant difference with lower Bio-T in the fracture group was shown. Conclusion: Bio-T seems to correlate with BMD in elderly men and may serve as a marker for increased fracture risk in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the association between handgrip strength and erectile dysfunction (ED) in community-dwelling older men.This cross-sectional study included 1771 participants of the Dong-gu Study. Handgrip strength was measured with a handheld dynamometer. ED was assessed with the Korean version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). ED was categorized as none to mild (IIEF-EF scores of 13-30) and moderate to severe (IIEF-EF scores of 0-12). Multivariable logistic regression was conducted with adjustment for potential confounders.The proportion of men with moderate to severe ED was 48.8%. The age-adjusted ED score increased with increasing quartile of handgrip strength (11.0, 12.4, 13.4, and 14.0 in the lowest, second, third, and highest quartiles, respectively). After adjustment for potential confounders, greater handgrip strength was associated with a lower risk of ED (odds ratio (OR): 0.82 per 5 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.90). In addition, a high level of moderate to vigorous physical activity was associated with a lower risk of ED (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.61-0.93).In this study, aging men with greater handgrip strength had a lower risk of ED. This result suggests that reduced physical functioning may contribute to ED.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sarcopenia in patients with diabetic ED.Methods: The study included 98 male patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) aged 18–80 years. Blood chemistry and hormone levels were obtained. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire was administered to the patients. The patients were divided into three groups according to the IIEF-5 score; a score of 5–10 points indicated severe ED, a score of 11–20 indicated moderate ED, and a score of 21–25 points indicated no ED. The muscle mass, handgrip strength, timed up and go test, upper mid-arm circumference, calf circumference, and body mass index were obtained. The statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc Statistical Software version 12.7.7. All parameters were compared between the three groups.Results: Of 98 patients included in the study, 84 patients had severe sarcopenia, 13 had moderate sarcopenia, while only one patient had normal muscle mass. The mean age was 56.59 ± 11.46 years. When patients were divided into three groups according to IIEF-5 score, 38 had severe ED, 39 had moderate ED, and 21 had no ED. There was a significant difference between the three groups in terms of handgrip strength, timed up and go test scores, upper mid-arm circumference, and calf circumference (p < .05 for all).Conclusions: Although muscle mass remains unchanged, muscle strength and physical performance decrease in diabetic ED patients. Diabetic patients with severe and moderate ED have lower muscle strength and physical performance.",

We aimed to compare the knowledge about the contribution of modifiable risk factors to the pathogenesis of CVD and ED. The impact of patients' having modifiable risk factors on the awareness of their negative influence on the development of CVD and ED was examined.Methods: To this multicenter cohort study, we included 417 patients with CHD who had been hospitalized in the cardiology or cardiac surgery department during the previous six weeks and underwent cardiac rehabilitation in one of the five centers. Knowledge about modifiable risk factors was collected. ED was assessed by an abridged IIEF-5 questionnaire. Comparisons between groups were conducted using the Student's t-test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Kruskal–Wallis test.

Smoking was the most recognized risk factor both for CVD and ED. Dyslipidemia was least frequently identified as a risk factor for CVD. Sedentary lifestyle was the only risk factor whose incidence did not affect the level of patient knowledge.Conclusions: Cardiac patients with ED know more about risk factors for CVD than ED.

Since little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of PD, we compared the biochemical make-up of PD plaques with normal tunica albuginea to clarify pathological processes in the scarred tissue. Protein and mRNA levels were measured in plaques and in unaffected pieces of the tunica albuginea. We investigated the presence of myofibroblasts, the deposition of collagens, and some key elements of Wnt and YAP1 signaling at protein level. The expression of 45 genes, all related to collagen homeostasis and extracellular matrix proteins, was quantified. In plaques, more myofibroblasts were present, and we observed an activation of Wnt signaling and YAP1 signaling. Increased levels of the collagens types I and III confirm the fibrotic nature of plaques. The mRNA ratio of collagen types III, IV, and VI to type I was increased. The expression of lysyl hydroxylase 3 was higher, whereas a decreased expression level was seen for fibronectin and cathepsin K. The biochemical composition of plaques was different from unaffected tunica albuginea: the relative and absolute abundance of various extracellular matrix proteins were changed, as well as the quality of collagen and the level of the collagen-degrading enzyme cathepsin K.",

Here, we report the results of a meta-analysis of a randomized controlled trial, evaluating the effectiveness of IHT versus CHT for patients with locally advanced PCa. Types of intervention were IHT versus CHT. The primary endpoint of this study is overall mortality and the secondary endpoints are any progression of disease, quality of life (QOL) and adverse effects between two groups. Six randomized controlled trials totaling 2996 patients were included. Results are as follows: after hormone therapy, patients undergoing IHT demonstrated no significant difference from those undergoing CHT in terms of the overall mortality (OR = 1.0, 95% CI [0.86, 1.17]) and disease progression (OR = 1.16, 95% CI [0.86, 1.57]). Men treated with IHT also reported better QOL, fewer adverse effects and considerable economic benefit for the individual and the community. With no difference in overall mortality and incidence of progression, current clinical studies confirm that both therapeutic methods were safe and effective. However, our study also takes into account QOL. When these secondary measures are considered, IHT may be a better option over CHT as patients report a more affordable treatment with improved QOL and fewer adverse effects.",

Thus, BPH should be addressed with surgical procedures. To contribute to the relevant literature, the present study aims to investigate the effects of surgical therapies for BPH on the patients quality of life.Materials and methods: This study included 120 patients who underwent surgery for BPH at a Training and Research Hospital. The short-form health survey (SF-36) was administered to the patients before the surgery and at three months after the surgery. Eight parameters of the SF-36 and mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component summary scores were calculated. The Student's t-test, Wilcoxon, and chi-square test were used in the statistical analysis.Results: When the eight parameters within the SF-36 health questionnaire were examined separately, the findings showed that patients quality of life increased significantly with respect to physical functioning, social functioning, and role limitations because of emotional problems , vitality, bodily pain, general health perceptions, and mental health domains three months after surgery (p < .001). The PCS and MCS significantly increased after surgery (p < .001).Conclusion: The SF-36 questionnaire results showed that a significant improvement in the patients quality of life was observed in patients who underwent surgery for BPH. Our findings suggest that SF-36 could be considered a reliable evaluation test to be used in the patients with BPH after surgery.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between quality of life, erectile function and group psychotherapy in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy. Sixty patients were evaluated for erectile function (IIEF-5), quality of life (SF-36SF), urinary incontinence (ICQI-SF and ICQI-OAB). Thirty of them had group psychotherapy two weeks before and 12 weeks after surgery. Patients who underwent group psychotherapy had better scores in IIEF-5, satisfaction with life in general, satisfaction with sexual life and in partner relationship; better results of SF-36SF, excepting two domains: bodily pain and role emotional. There were significant correlations between IIEF-5 and perception of discomfort (p = .030), physical functioning (p = .021), physical component (p = .005) and role emotional (p = .009) in patients undergoing group psychotherapy. In patients who didn't have group psychotherapy there were significant correlations between ICQI-OAB and perception of discomfort (p = .025), social functioning (p = .052) and role emotional (p = .034); between ICQI-SF and perception of discomfort (p = .0001). Group psychotherapy has a positive impact in quality of life and erectile function. There was no difference in the urinary function of the two groups. Further studies are necessary to identify the impact of self-perception and self-knowledge in the postoperative management of radical prostatectomy.",

    "abstract": "The testosterone decline is one of the potential causes of oxidative stress-induced anxiety and depressive behaviors, and cognitive impairment induces irreversible neuronal damage, which is not clearly understood. The orchidectomized rat model was used; the hippocampal neurons and anxiety behavior were analyzed. Adult male albino rats were divided into control and orchidectomy (ORX) groups, orchidectomy (ORX + T), and normal (Cont + T) groups. Testosterone propionate was used as a testosterone supplement. The anxiety and depressive-like behavior observed in ORX animals in the open field (OF) and elevated plus-maze experiments were effectively overturned in the ORX + T group. Studies on isolated hippocampus showed reduced antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and glutathione (GSH) compounds), increased lipid peroxidation (LPO), elevated caspase3, and reduced anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and increased apoptotic nuclei in TUNEL staining of the hippocampus in the ORX rats. These observations indicate free radical-mediated neural damage. Testosterone presence promoted the antioxidant defense system and restored normal pyramidal neuron morphology in ORX + T. This study confirms that testosterone is indispensable in the normal adult hippocampus and deficiency seems to be a potential risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders. Besides, androgen appears to be a possible therapeutic strategy for treating depression/neurodegenerative diseases in aging men.",

In this study, we aim to evaluate the relationship between AIP, AC, and CRI-1/2 with increased risk of ED. Between April 2018 and February 2019, 253 patients, who were diagnosed as a vasculogenic ED in our clinic, were enrolled in the study. While the first group (n = 134) consisted of patients with moderate and mild ED (IIEF-EF: 17-30), the second group (n = 119) consisted of patients with severe ED. In addition to the mean values of lipid parameters; CRI-1 (total cholesterol/HDL), CRI-2 (LDL/HDL) AIP (log10(triglycerides/HDL), and AC (non-HDL/HDL) were calculated. The mean age was 44.02 ± 10.41 (24-70), and the mean BMI was 27.80 ± 4.12 (18.52 ± 41.97). However, CRI-1 and AIP values were found to be higher in the severe ED group compared to the mild ED group (CRI-1: 4.50 ± 1.47, 4.88 ± 1.30; p = .039; AIP: 0.489 ± 0.315, 0.617 ± 0.283; p = .007). Our results demonstrated that CR-1 and AIP have a positive correlation with the severity of ED. Moreover, we can suggest that patients with higher CR-1 and AIP values are likely to have more severe ED in the future.",

Men without a history of treatment for LUTS were evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), transrectal ultrasonography.Of 1345 individuals, 603 (44.8%) had MetS. Older age, higher IPSS values, higher prevalence rates of BPH and overactive bladder, higher triiodothyronine, and lower testosterone and sex-hormone binding globulin were observed in individuals with MetS than in individuals without MetS. The severity of LUTS significantly increased in the individuals with MetS (p = .002). In individuals with MetS, age, HbA1c, and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) were associated with IPSS. For OABSS, age, HbA1c, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), coronary artery occlusive disease, and CVD were identified as predictors.We confirmed the positive correlation between MetS and BPH/LUTS in Korean. Factors including TSH and atherosclerosis affected LUTS in individuals with MetS. These findings suggested a potential role of thyroid hormones and atherosclerosis in the etiology and treatment of BPH/LUTS in patients with MetS.",

The prevalence of various urinary tract problems and diabetes among male older adults was estimated by background characteristics using bivariate cross-tabulation. In addition, multivariate logistic regression was applied to examine the likelihood of urological disorders associated with diabetes.The prevalence of incontinence was highest among male older adults with diabetes, followed by kidney stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and chronic renal failure. Multivariate logistic regression estimation showed that men diagnosed with diabetes were 80% more likely to experience chronic renal failure, 78% more likely to suffer from incontinence, and 37% more likely to suffer from kidney stones than those without diabetes when controlling for various socio-demographic, behavioral, and co-morbidity status of the older adults.The study findings suggest that diabetes is associated with multiple urinary complications among male older adults in India and needs more careful investigation of the phenomenon. Independent risk factors such as changes in lifestyle with regular monitoring and diagnosis may help to prevent the progression of diabetes and reduce the risk of diabetes-associated lower and upper urinary tract diseases among male older adults.",

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify the CAF-associated modules and hub genes. Univariate Cox and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression analyses were used for constructing CAF signatures and calculating CAF scores. The ability of the CAF signature to predict prognosis and response to immunotherapy was validated using the data from three cohorts.WGCNA identified two CAF-associated modules and constructed a CAF signature containing 27 genes. In all three cohorts, patients with high CAF scores had markedly worse prognoses than those with low CAF scores, and CAF scores were independent risk factors.

    "abstract": "Low androgen levels in men are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, through unclear mechanisms. We measured arterial stiffness ('compliance') in 21 men receiving complete testosterone suppression therapy for prostate cancer, and in 25 controls. Systemic arterial compliance (SAC), which assesses proximal aortic stiffness, was calculated by simultaneous recording of aortic flow and carotid artery pressure (the 'area method'). Aorto-femoral (A-F), aorto-radial (A-R) and femoral-dorsalis pedis (F-DP) pulse-wave velocities (PWVs) were recorded using the 'Complior' system. SAC was significantly lower in the androgen-depleted men compared to controls (0.81 +/- 0.53 vs. 1.18 +/- 0.43 arbitrary compliance units, p = 0.01, mean +/- SD). Correspondingly, their A-F PWV was higher (14.1 (10.1-21.8) vs. 12.4 (9.6-17.4) m/s, p = 0.03, median (range)). Cases tended to be older (75 +/- 7 vs. 71 +/- 6 years, p = 0.07), and to have higher systolic blood pressure (148 +/- 22 vs. 143 +/- 17 mmHg, p = 0.40); however, SAC was still significantly lower (p = 0.03) after adjustment for age and stratification for central systolic pressure (< or = or > the median). Adjustment of A-F PWV for age and central systolic pressure reduced significance to p = 0.07. There was no significant difference in peripheral PWVs between groups. In conclusion, testosterone suppression is associated with increased aortic stiffness, only partly explained by age and blood pressure. Loss of androgens in men might therefore adversely affect cardiovascular risk.",

    "abstract": "Due to the highly variable concentration of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and the many factors affecting it, the evaluation of the androgen status may require the measurement of a parameter of bioactive plasma testosterone. As, however, no practical, clinical useful direct method for measurement of plasma androgen bioactivity is available, indirect biochemical parameters are used. All have their limitations and pitfalls. In this paper are discussed some of the factors influencing the values obtained with different methods (direct measurement of free testosterone by analog radioimmunoassay, dialysis, ammonium sulfate precipitation, free testosterone index, calculated free and bioavailable testosterone), all of which may explain the variability of data reported in the literature. It is concluded that, whereas determination of bioavailable testosterone by dialysis or ammonium sulfate precipitation of SHBG-bound testosterone is work-intensive and not really suitable for clinical routine, while direct measurement of free testosterone by analog immunoassay yields unreliable results, only the free testosterone index and calculated bioavailable testosterone are adapted for clinical routine. The limitations of the free testosterone index, a dimensionless parameter which does not reflect a defined bioavailable testosterone concentration, are discussed. As the same measurements of testosterone and SHBG required for determination of the free testosterone index permit the calculation of bioavailable testosterone, which yields a defined androgen concentration, it is advisable to prefer the latter over the free testosterone index, which should no longer be used.",

Here we review various controlled studies of testosterone supplementation in aging males.Methods: We performed a PubMed search using the terms “testosterone/therapeutic use” with the limits “>65 years of age”, “randomized controlled clinical trials”, and “male gender”, starting in 1999.Results: Forty-three articles have been published since 1999. Some of these studies also included patients in middle-age or younger. Findings reported in these articles were not entirely consistent. After weighting studies by the number of patients, hints are found that testosterone supplementation increases bone mass, lean body mass, muscle mass and hematopoiesis, and improves sexual functioning and perhaps mood, but does not affect serum lipids, cardiovascular parameters, prostate-specific antigen level, or cognition. Considering studies including only men older than 65 years, and in which testosterone supplements were compared with placebo treatment, slightly different results are obtained. In these patient groups, testosterone does not improve sexual function or mood.Conclusion: The overall benefit of testosterone supplementation for the aging male remains unclear. Any supplementation in men with age-normal testosterone levels only on grounds of subjective symptoms is not advisable.KeywordsTestosteroneaging malesubstitutionorgan functions",

    "abstract": "A survey was carried out on 307 healthy men and 774 women, aged between 30 and 70 years to evaluate the determinants of sex life in the highly urbanized Singapore population. The results showed that significantly more women (28.8%) as compared to men (16.3%) were currently sexually inactive. The main reason for sexual inactivity for women was being divorced or widowed (37.9%) and for men, the loss of interest in sex (42.8%). Relationship problems and being stressed out in life were the next two most common reasons for both men and women. Coital frequency for men and women between the ages of 30 and 55 years averaged about five to six times monthly and was significantly reduced to about three times monthly in those above 55 years old. More men (25.7%) wanted to have more frequent sex than women (5.4%), but were unable to fulfill their desire and the primary reason was that they were too stressed out in life. Results from this study revealed that sex life is determined not only by physiological, but also cultural, social and lifestyle factors. In Singapore, lifestyle factors accounted largely for sexual inactivity, and the inability to fulfill the desire for more frequent sex. The term ‘lifestyle impotency’ was coined to describe the group of men and women who were too stressed out in life to have sex. Therefore, there is a need to evolve a paradigm for the management of sexual dysfunctions by taking into account the underlying etiological factors which, as we have shown, may not be resolved by pharmaceutical interventions.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe skin is a target organ of several hormones. Specific diseases appear in consequence of hypo- or hypersecretion of endocrine organs, particularly in the elderly patient. There, knowledge of skin alterations is important not only for dermatologists, but also for endocrinologists and other physicians, because a clinical diagnosis of the underlying disease is often possible. In this review, a number of representative skin diseases having an endocrinological basis are described. These include acanthosis nigricans, diseases due to alterations of androgen metabolism, carcinoid syndrome, diseases due to alterations of corticosteroid metabolism, diseases in association with diabetes mellitus, diseases due to alterations of estrogen metabolism, genetic syndromes including dermatological and endocrine symptoms, the glucagonoma syndrome, diseases due to dysfunctions of growth hormone secretion, diseases in association with Merkel cells of the skin, diseases due to dysfunctions of the thyroid gland, diseases to alteration of vitamin D metabolism, and vitiligo and disorders of pigmentation.",

In addition, the treatment-seeking behaviour of Thai patients suffering from ED is also investigated.In a cross sectional study using a standardized questionnaire with a multi-stage stratified random sampling, 2,269 men aged 40-70 were interviewed. The questionnaire was designed to investigate the effects of socioeconomic factors, medical conditions and unhealthy lifestyles on the development of ED. Furthermore, the questionnaire was designed to characterize the treatment-seeking behaviour of Thai patients suffering from ED.Compared to the first report dated the year 2000, the prevalence of ED has increased from 37.5% to 42.18%. In terms of socioeconomic factors, the highest prevalence of ED was observed among unemployed men (78.51%). Prostatism and/or prostatitis (Odd ratios (OR) = 2.02) and long histories of smoking (more than 30 years, OR = 2.36) were identified as statistically significant risk factors for ED, with p-values of <0.001. It is important to notice that 38.78% of the ED patients wanted to discuss their problem with spouses or partners. Three quarters of the ED patients (74.54%) preferred oral medication as therapy.The epidemiology of ED in Thailand is changing. An increased prevalence of ED does require further epidemiological studies on a regular basis in order to better understand the etiology of ED and look for measures (such as education) to counter the disease.",

A total of 130 patients (mean age, 70.1 ± 2.4; range, 58–97 years) undergoing either prostate biopsy or radical prostatectomy between October 2006 and March 2008 were included. Additionally, 61 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (mean age, 69.9 ± 1.1; range, 60–92 years) were included as a control group. The normal cells were isolated from each prostate cancer specimen by microdissection. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA4977) deletion mutations were identified by polymerase chain reaction. Gleason scores were determined by histopathology.Results. Among the 130 Pca samples vs. 61 BPH samples, mtDNA4977 deletion mutation was detected in 98 cases (98/130, 75.4%) vs. in 9 cases (9/61, 14.7%) (P < 0.01, P = 0.001). There was a significantly higher prevalence of the mtDNA4977 deletion mutation in patients with prostate cancer compared to patients with BPH (P < 0.01). The incidence of the mtDNA4977 deletion in normal cells isolated from cancer specimen was 10.76% (14/130), which was significantly lower than that in prostate cancer group(P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference versus BPH group (P > 0.5). Gleason scores were significantly higher in the group of patients with cancer with the mutation (7.6 ± 2.4), compared to those without the mutation (6.2 ± 1.1, P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Gleason scores (OR = 1.642, 95% CI: 1.232–2.183) and age (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.041–1.082) are both independent predictors of the mtDNA4977 deletion mutations.Conclusions. mtDNA4977 deletion mutation frequency may be useful as a biomarker in malignant degree appraisal in patients with Pca.",

We investigated the validity of an Arabic version of the Saint Louis University androgen deficiency in ageing men (ADAM) questionnaire to screen for androgen deficiency in Saudi and non Saudi Arabic speaking men.Methods. It was a cross sectional study of ambulatory community-based Arabic Saudi men recruited from Volunteers in Riyadh city, Capital of Saudi Arabia, aged 18–80 years. Seven hundred thirty men agreed to fill the Arabic ADAM questionnaire, they were invited to a morning blood sample for total testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin and those who agreed to complete the whole study were only 407 men. Low serum bioavailable testosterone (BT) levels (androgen deficiency) were defined as <10th percentile of serum BT levels in young healthy Saudi men (18–30 years).Results. Cronbach's Alpha of 0.71 (n = 730) showed a good internal consistency of the Arabic ADAM questionnaire. Among participants, 18.2% and 77.6% had low serum BT levels and a positive ADAM questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of positive ADAM and low serum BT is increasing with age. The Arabic ADAM questionnaire had a high sensitivity of 86.5%, a low specificity of 24.3%, and positive predictive values (+PVs) and negative (−PVs) of 20.3% and 89%, respectively.Conclusion. The Arabic ADAM questionnaire has a very good sensitivity but very low specificity for screening of androgen deficiency in Saudi men, therefore biological confirmation is needed especially when clinical symptoms of androgen deficiency are present.",

Moreover, most of the bioavailable sex steroid is made up of albumin-bound fraction. We examined the age-related change in serum free, albumin-bound and bioavailable estradiol levels in comparison with each fraction of testosterone and its relationship with serum albumin level in elderly men. Albumin-bound as well as bioavailable estradiol levels declined with age, and their decreases were associated much more with the decrease of albumin level than the increase of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) level in sixties and seventies, and similar results were recognized in the level of each fraction of testosterone, suggesting albumin levels have an important role for maintaining bioavailable sex steroid levels in males aged over sixty. Moreover, our study showed that SHBG levels associated inversely with bioavailable sex steroid levels particularly when serum albumin level was low. It seems likely that the decrease of bioavailable estradiol as well as testosterone is induced by the decrease of albumin-bound fractions in combination with the increase of SHBG-bound fractions in males aged over sixty, and that their physical characteristics of aging could be induced by the decrease of albumin-bound fractions caused by the decrease of serum albumin regardless of total sex steroid levels.",

Fasting total testosterone (TT), sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinising (LH) and follicle stimulating (FSH) hormones, glucose (FPG) and lipid profile were measured. Bioavailable (cBT) and free testosterone (cFT) were calculated. Waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) were collected. Subjects also answered the modified International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF-5) and Ageing Male Symptom (AMS) questionnaires.Among non-diabetic males (N = 201), no change was noted for TT, although SHBG and gonadotrophins rose, while cBT and cFT declined, significantly with age. Sex hormones were negatively related with WC, BMI and FPG. SHBG displayed a stronger association with metabolic components than testosterone. Testosterone was not related to lipids, IIEF-5 or AMS scores. WC, not BMI, was a key determinant of TT, cBT and cFT in younger subjects, while FSH seemed a more sensitive indicator of primary hypogonadism than LH in older males.The preferred measures of serum testosterone in older men are cBT and cFT. Visceral adiposity and SHBG, rather than testosterone, appeared to be the link between androgen deficiency and poorer metabolic status. QOL scores correlate poorly with androgen concentrations.",

This study aimed to investigate aging symptoms in male psychiatric outpatients and their relationship with anxiety and depression.Method: About 176 male psychiatric outpatients aged 40–80 years were enrolled into this single-center cross-sectional study, and completed self-reported questionnaires including \"Aging Males' Symptoms\" (AMS) scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).Result: Age was correlated with less anxiety (r = −0.23), less psychological (r = −0.16) and more sexual symptoms (r = 0.31). After controlling demographic variables, the partial correlation coefficients of HADS and AMS scores ranged from 0.30 to 0.73. Four groups were defined by HADS: control (C; n = 103), depression (D; n = 18), anxiety (A; n = 26) and mixed anxiety and depression (M; n = 29). The M group had the most severe aging symptoms, and the C group the least. The A group had more psychological and less sexual symptoms than the D group. \"Impaired sexual potency\" was the only aging symptom in males not significantly different among the four groups.Conclusions: Anxiety and depression was associated with more severe aging symptoms in male psychiatric outpatients. Sexual dysfunction could be regarded as the core manifestation to differentiate aging symptoms from syndromal emotional distress.",

Methods: A total of 887 subjects (761 males, 126 females) were included in the present study. Early atherosclerosis was assessed by measurement of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries. Results: The carotid arterial intima-media thickness on both the right and left sides significantly increased as the number of components of MetS increased. The maximum intima-media thickness values in the right (left) carotid arteries in the male and female subjects who fulfilled the criteria for MetS were 0.65 ± 0.18 (0.66 ± 0.17) mm and 0.58 ± 0.12 (0.59 ± 0.11) mm, respectively. After adjustment for several factors, the intima-media thickness related significantly with aging, some components of MetS and serum C-reactive protein by multiple regression analysis. β-coefficient of age was largest, presenting 0.457 in right side and 0.479 in left side.

Therefore, we evaluated the relationship of climacteric symptoms as assessed by the \"Aging Males' Symptoms\" (AMS) Questionnaire with circulating androgen levels. Methods: 146 ambulatory men (age, 27–85 years) were surveyed with the AMS Questionnaire and sampled for serum values of total testosterone (tT) and sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Free testosterone (fT) was calculated from tT and SHBG. A total AMS score ≥37 was considered pathological; the lower limits for tT and fT were set to 8 nmol/l and 180 pmol/l, respectively. Results: A significant deficit in tT and fT was shown in 25 (17.1%) and 34 (24.5%) men, respectively; the AMS Questionnaire showed pathological results for 66 (45.2%) men. In predicting a tT deficit, the AMS Questionnaire rendered a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 61.6%, only. However, multiple regression analysis revealed a significant correlation of lowered tT with a pathological somatovegetative and psychological AMS subscore (p = 0.042 and p = 0.01) and a correlation of lowered fT with a pathological sexual subscore (p = 0.039).

They were requested to fill IPSS and VPSS. The patients were divided into two groups as middle-aged and elderly with a cutoff point of 65 years. They were divided into six groups based on educational level. SPSS was used for the statistical evaluation.Results: The mean age of the patients was 61.5 ± 8.9 years. The correlation was found between IPSS and VPSS (p < .05). Education was found not to contribute for answering IPSS and VPSS (p = .332 and .138, respectively). No difference was found between the middle-aged and elderly groups in terms of the rates of inability to answer IPSS and VPSS (p = .177 and .681, respectively).Conclusions: There is a correlation between VPSS and IPSS. VPSS can be used as an auxiliary or alternative tool instead of IPSS in evaluating LUTS; however, has no superiority to IPSS in elderly group. Currently, the best option to exclude bias in illiterate group is VPSS.",

Subjects and methods: One hundred and eighty-one men older than 45 years selected from of a population attending to Urology departments screening for PCa, (78 participants without PCa and 103 patients with PCa). All participants were assessed for body mass index (BMI), age, Gleason score, and PSA. Endocrine profile was determined for LH, total testosterone (TT), 17β-estradiol (E2), prolactin and leptin. Biochemical profile (HbA1c, triacylglycerols and lipoproteins) was also determined. In vitro experiments were also performed, involving the study of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and E2 in the presence of adipocyte-conditioned medium (aCM). Results: All variables were continuous and described a Gaussian distribution unless mentioned. To determine the relation of aggressiveness, variable were transformed into categories. Thus, PCa aggressiveness is associated with the increase of age and BMI (p < .0001) but with is decreased with TT and E2 (p < .05). Moreover, adipocyte-secreted molecules increase aggressiveness of PCa cells in vitro. Lastly, DTH but not E2 enables invasiveness in vitro. Conclusions: It was observed a coexistence of hormone axis profile alteration with sex hormones and BMI in PCa patients, in accordance with the new perspective of PCa pathogenesis.",

Patient data were collected from March 1 2017 to July 31 2017. All men were assessed by the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) and Intravaginal Ejaculation Latency Time (IELT). Besides, sexual desire, force of ejaculation, and the five-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score were recorded. The couple's attitudes towards PE were evaluated by a self-designed questionnaire.Results In total, 1033 males diagnosed with PE and their sexual partners and 3176 males without PE were enrolled. The mean PEDT and IELT scores of the patients with PE were 14.38 ± 3.68 and 1.59 ± 0.85, respectively. IIEF-5, sexual desire, and force of ejaculation significantly decreased in patients with PE. Among the 1033 couples, 44.3%, 21.39%, and 33.98% of the couples were seeking PE because of the dissatisfaction of the males, the females or both partners, respectively. In terms of the males who were dissatisfied with PE, 49.51% and 17.86% complained of short IELT and inability to control ejaculation. In terms of the females dissatisfied with PE, 41.61%, 19.93%, 21.68%, and 14.51% complained of arousal difficulty, weak sexual desire, failing to have organism and poor relationship, respectively.Conclusions PE has a negative impact on erectile function, sexual desire, and force of ejaculation. Sexual partners play important roles in the medical procedures for addressing PE.",

    "abstract": "\"LEOPIN ROYAL®\" (LER), a non-prescription health-promoting medication in Japan, is a preparation containing six natural medicines, namely, aged garlic extract, ginseng, oriental bezoar, velvet antler, cuscuta seed and epimedium herb. To determine the effect of LER on symptoms of aging in males, we conducted an open-labeled, randomized clinical trial using Kampo (mainly kamishoyosan) as a control. Forty-nine male patients (age, 62.7 (SD 11.8) years) with mild or more pronounced symptoms of aging were enrolled and randomly assigned to the LER (n = 24) or Kampo group (n = 25) for 6 months. The Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale and the International Index of Erectile Function with 5 questions (IIEF-5) were tested at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of administration of the medications. In the AMS scale, the somatic and psychological sub-scores and total score decreased depending on the time course in both groups. However, the decrease in the slope of the LER group was greater than that of the Kampo group. There was a significant difference between the groups and the group and month interaction (G × M), as revealed by a linear mixed model analysis (p < 0.05). The IIEF-5 score increased in the LER group (p = 0.02 with regard to G × M). In conclusion, the present results indicate that LER is possibly superior to mainly kamishoyosan on the rate of improvement of symptoms of aging, including erectile dysfunction, in males.",

The preferred medical treatment for many men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia is either an α-adrenergic receptor antagonist (α-blocker), or a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a powerful tool for successful implementation of individualized treatment.Methods: Eighteen SNPs associated with drug efficacy in a Chinese population were genotyped in 790 BPH cases (330 aggressive and 460 non-aggressive BPH cases) and 1008 controls. All BPH patients were treated with α-adrenergic blockers for at least 9 months. We tested the associations between tagging single nucleotide polymorphism and BPH risk/aggressiveness, clinical characteristics at baseline, including the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and total prostate volume, and changes in clinical characteristics after treatment.Results: There were nine SNPs associated with BPH risk, clinical progression and therapeutic effect. (1) There were nine tSNPs been chosen in CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and RANBP3L genes. (2) The SNP, rs16902947 in RANBP3L at 5p13.2 (p = .01), was significantly associated with BPH. (3) We found two SNPs, rs16902947 in RANBP3L at 5p13.2 (p = .0388) and rs4646437 in CYP3A4 at 7q21.1 (p = .0325), associated with drug effect.

    "abstract": "Prostatic calculi (PCal) are commonly present with prostate disease; we aim to map the incidence and associated clinical risk factors of PCal in Han Chinese.We retrospectively selected men who sought a medical check-up in 2018. Basic clinical items, including age, weight, height, prostate specific antigen (PSA), uric acid (UA), fasting blood glucose (FBG), urinalysis results, and transabdominal prostate ultrasound, were recorded. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate whether these factors were associated with the presence of PCal.We recorded the parameters of laboratory tests and clinical information from 14,427 men; men with PCal comprised 51.65% of the total group and 76.61% of the subgroup of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients. All the enrolled parameters showed meaningful differences, but the logistic regression analysis only indicated significant effects related to age (OR = 1.044, 95% CI = 1.040-1.047, and p < .001), body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.035, 95% CI = 1.022-1.048, and p < .001), UA (OR = 0.999, 95% CI = 0.999-1.000, and p = .029), BPH (OR = 2.923, 95% CI = 2.678-3.191, and p < .001), and prostate cysts (OR = 0.609, 95% CI = 0.471-0.788, and p < .001). The odds ratio of the predicted combined model is 1.068.PCal was detected in 51.65% of men among healthy Han Chinese and in 76.61% of BPH patients. Age, BMI, UA, BPH, and prostate cysts were independent risk factors for the presence of PCal.",

    "abstract": "The white blood cell (WBC) count was one of the first inflammatory markers associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Recently, two longitudinal studies have demonstrated a cause and effect relationship between MetS and WBC counts among middle-aged adults. However, no study has used WBC cutoff values to predict MetS in the elderly.Subjects who underwent routine health checkups, and were above 60 years of age, were enrolled. All subjects were followed-up until they developed MetS or until 4 years from the date of entry, whichever came earlier. Of the 4539 subjects eligible for enrollment, 3428 subjects comprised the study group and 1111 subjects comprised the validation group.WBC counts were significantly different between subjects with and without MetS in both genders. Using the ROC curve, WBC cutoff values of 5.7 × 10(3)/µl in males and 5.0 × 10(3)/µl in females were associated with the increased risk of developing MetS (all p values <0.001). Using these WBC cutoff values, the hazard ratio (HR) for females was significant in both the study group and validation group. However, the HR for males failed significance in the validation group. Kaplan-Meier plots and κ coefficients confirmed that the WBC cutoff value could predict development of MetS in women but not in men.The association between WBC count and MetS was gender specific. A WBC cutoff value greater than 5.0 10(3)/µl may predict the development of MetS in elderly women.",

A purposive sampling approach was used to recruit all participants. We conducted qualitative analysis using the framework approach for applied health research.Main findings: Participants perceived the following factors to have influenced TRT prescriptions and use in adult men: provider factors (diagnostic ambiguity of age-related hypogonadism and beliefs about appropriateness of TRT) and patient factors (access to information on TRT and drug seeking behavior). They perceived that these factors have perpetuated a rise in prescription in the absence of clear clinical guidelines and unclear research evidence on the safety and efficacy of TRT.Conclusion: The findings of this study highlight that much work still needs to be done to improve diagnostic accuracy and encourage appropriate TRT prescription in adult men. In addition, both patients and providers need more information about the risks and long-term effects of TRT in men.",

An abnormal DRE or a raised prostate specific antigen (PSA) level are part of the criteria for primary care referral to secondary care due to a suspicion of prostate cancer. The current Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the rapid adoption of virtual consultations in the form of telephone or video consultations making clinical examination difficult. In the case of prostate cancer diagnostic pathways, often clinicians now rely on PSA measurements and MRI, where radiological services are available, without the requirement for a DRE. We discuss the limited role DRE has in the modern prostate cancer diagnostic pathway due to the widespread adoption of MRI particularly in the COVID-19 era.",

In total, 13 343 prostate cancer patients were included in the final study cohort who exclusively used gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. The primary outcomes that were registered during the follow-up of this study were overall CVD death.Results: There was a higher risk of CVD death in the cohort of patients treated with ADT than in ADT non-users (HR 2.14, 95% CI [1.86-2.45], p < 0.001). Moreover, there was an increased risk of death from ischemic heart disease and stroke (HR 1.42, 95% CI [1.16-1.73] and 1.70, 95% CI [1.18-2.45], respectively) among ADT users. Finally, the risk of CVD-related mortality was highest in the 70-79 age group of ADT users (HR 4.78, 95% CI [3.79-6.04]).Conclusions: This study shows that ADT usage is associated with increased CVD-related mortality risk for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with ADT non-users. The highest mortality risk was found for ischemic heart disease and stroke. CVD-related mortality was increased in the elder group of patients also.",

However, some patients remain unresponsive, necessitating further investigation. To investigate the association between systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) and tadalafil unresponsiveness in erectile dysfunction patients. A total of 106 male patients who applied to the Andrology outpatient clinic with ED complaints between January and June 2024 were included in the study. Patients were started on daily tadalafil 5 mg therapy, and response was assessed after one month using the International Index of Erectile Function Erectile Function domain (IIEF-EF). SIRI values, calculated using neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, were compared between tadalafil-responsive and unresponsive groups. Tadalafil unresponsiveness was observed in 48.1% of patients. Non-responders had significantly higher mean age(57.44 ± 12.52 vs. 47.22 ± 11.49, p < 0.001), BMI(27.22 ± 3.17 vs. 25.85 ± 2.92, p = 0.023), and SIRI values(1.33 ± 0.82 vs. 1.02 ± 0.40, p = 0.016) compared to responders. Multivariate analysis identified age(OR = 1,641, p = 0.001) and SIRI(OR = 2.420, p = 0.014) as independent predictors of tadalafil failure. ROC curve analysis revealed a SIRI cutoff of 1.03 (AUC = 0.617) with 69.1% sensitivity and 61.2% specificity. Findings suggest that systemic inflammation plays a key role in ED pathophysiology and may impair PDE5i efficacy.",

We calculated indices related to central obesity for each participant and then employed univariate logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) analysis. we found that the indices of Weight, Waist Circumference (WC), waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), and Body Roundness Index (BRI) were significantly elevated in the BPH group. In terms of dietary intake, we found that the intake of total fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol was significantly higher in the BPH group, with polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol meeting the criteria for both univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Weight, WC, WHtR, and BRI can effectively improve the prediction of BPH, which may be associated with the high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Appropriately adjusting the types and total amount of fat intake may prevent the occurrence of prostatic hyperplasia.",

Thus, we aimed to study the extent of cognitive and emotional discomfort in communicating and sharing ED treatment by creating a new tool, called INTIMA (Impact of Negotiating Treatment Intake on Marital Intimacy/Alliance Assessment). 134 men diagnosed with ED completed a series of validated psychometric questionnaires, including INTIMA, the Fear of Intimacy Scale (FIS), and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ). Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were conducted to assess the dimensionality and factorial validity of the INTIMA and its psychometric strength. CFA confirmed a single-factor structure with robust goodness-of-fit indices (ꭓ2[9] = 11.7, p = 0.234; SRMR = 0.030; CFI = 0.991; TLI = 0.985; RMSEA = 0.047). The INTIMA demonstrated excellent internal consistency. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlation with FIS and adequate Average Variance Extracted. ROC analysis revealed high discriminatory power for detecting insecure attachment patterns, with an optimal cut-off score of 17. INTIMA is a reliable psychometric tool for assessing perceived VJ and predicting the risks of involving or not the partner in ED treatment and to identify optimal strategies for better adherence and outcomes.",

In this prospective multicenter study, male patients with clear-cell mRCC were assessed. Erectile function was evaluated using the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and general health status was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI-19). Associations between clinical factors and IIEF-5 scores were analyzed using multiple regression models. Among 357 patients (median age 62.9 years), 69% reported negative changes in sexual life, and 77.8% had some degree of ED. 62% of patients reported no sexual activity. Although older age, poor or intermediate IMDC risk, and greater symptom severity were associated with lower IIEF-5 scores in univariate analyses, age was not an independent predictor of ED. Instead, ECOG performance status, hemoglobin levels, and FKSI-19 scores significantly predicted ED level. ED is highly prevalent among patients with mRCC and appears to be more strongly associated with general health and disease burden rather than age. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating sexual health in oncology settings, irrespective of age.",

A graded association was observed, with the highest quartile demonstrating approximately 1.5 times the risk compared to the lowest. Restricted cubic spline analysis indicated a steep risk increase at approximately 9.81 s.

Transcriptomic datasets for AF (GSE79768) and OSA (GSE135917) were retrieved from the the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OSA and AF comorbidity were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Cytoscape, and hub genes were identified with the CytoHubba plug-in. A diagnostic model was then built based on these hub genes, and its performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in both the test and validation datasets. Immune cell infiltration analysis was conducted using CIBERSORT. A total of 1,462 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for the comorbidity of AF and OSA. Five hub genes were selected: IFNG, IL4, IL15, CD19, and FASLG. Immunoassay infiltration analysis revealed elevated levels of activated macrophages in both OSA and AF samples. The diagnostic model we developed demonstrated excellent predictive performance in the validation set. We identified five hub genes common to both OSA and AF: IFNG, IL4, IL15, CD19, and FASLG. Moreover, a diagnostic model based on these five hub genes can predict the risk of OSA in patients with AF.",

The increase of PM2.5 predicted by gene was significantly correlated with the increased risk of ED (IVW or = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.12 - 2.43, P = 0.010), which was still significant after Bonferroni correction (p < 1.67 × 10-2) After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate MR analysis confirmed that PM2.5 had an independent causal effect on ed. Mr egger regression showed no horizontal pleiotropy (intercept P > 0.05), and no heterogeneity or abnormal single nucleotide polymorphisms were found. This is the first genetic evidence that PM2.5 is an independent risk factor for ED. it is emphasized that air pollution control is the key public health strategy for global ed prevention.",

    "abstract": "Phytochemicals have played a vital role in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Although synthetic drugs can produce dramatic results in most cases, the side-effects associated with them are a major concern. The source of many compounds used in modern medicine today can be traced down to plant origin. Whether or not scientific justification is available for the use of most plant products, the continued use of these compounds is due to their safety profile, ease of availability and also economic reasons. Each medicinal plant that has been used in the traditional system of medicine must be scientifically tested in order to bring forth its active principle that might be effectively used as a phytomedicine. In this vast resource of phytoproducts there are various plants that are claimed to improve the sexual deficiency in man. Tribulus terrestris Linn. (TT) is one such plant that has been used for a long time in both the Indian and Chinese systems of medicine. The plant is also said to possess various other pharmacological properties. The extract obtained from the air-dried aerial parts of this plant contains mainly steroidal glycosides, the major saponin being protodioscin (PTN). In our study on this plant product it was observed that PTN produced a moderate increase in testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in primates following bolus intravenous administration of the TT extract at doses of 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg body weight. It also improved libido, sexual activity and intracavernous pressure in rats following TT extract administration orally (for 8 weeks at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight) and had a proerectile effect on the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle of rabbits (orally for 8 weeks at doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight). In this article, the various pharmacological effects of TT have been reviewed and our studies based on TT extract in relation to male erectile dysfunction have been summarized.",

The positive effects on bone mineral density were greater in the spine than the hip. There were minimal effects on lipid levels. Levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increased with testosterone treatment but, in general, remained in the normal range. Three subjects (1.8%) were shown to have elevated PSA and biopsy-proven prostate cancer. It was not possible to determine if this incidence is above the background rate.

Methodological characteristics of the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale point towards a high standard measurement and comparison of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) over time or intervention. However, the scale was neither developed nor standardized as a screening instrument for androgen deficiency.Methods. Data of the Austrian ANDROX study suggested to develop a composite screener for androgen deficiency based on AMS, age, and BMI, to determine sensitivity and specificity to detect low total testosterone (TT) levels. The findings were compared with those of an independent sample of urological patients with suspicion of androgen deficiency (AD) from Germany (n = 803).Results. A graphical solution for a composite-screening tool was proposed, with three levels of suspicion for AD: positive screening result (high suspicion), equivocal result, and negative screening result (no suspicion, AD unlikely). The percentage of TT values < 4 ng/ml were 18.7%, 40.7% and 58.8% in the three categories: negative, equivocal and positive, respectively. The findings were confirmed in the independent German sample. In both instances, neither sensitivity nor specificity was very high, i.e., between about 50% and 75%.Conclusion. The results of the development and initial validation of the new screener are promising. Further information, and experience from the practice, is needed to confirm or refute the hypothesis that this screener is a useful tool for medical practice.",

Self-administered questionnaires were developed for family physicians and general practitioners. Each questionnaire included questions in three domains: 1) General knowledge, beliefs and exposure; 2) Knowledge of diagnostic and treatment options and; 3) General demographics.Results. A very high percentage of PCPs had heard of andropause (96.3%). Of the physicians who completed the survey, 92.6% agreed that men experience something similar to women's menopause when they age and 98.0% agreed that andropause is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis. Almost all PCPs (91.5%) agreed that prostate cancer is a contraindication to treatment while around one-third (33.9%) agreed that breast cancer was a contraindication. Slightly more than half of physicians (57.4%) felt that they encountered obstacles to their investigation of andropause with the most prevalent complaint being a lack of access to education resources. There is a need for improved continuing medical education (CME) programmes in the Greater Victoria region to give PCPs the skills to diagnose and manage andropause with confidence.",

Thirty-one patients over 40 years of age with LOH-related symptoms were included in this study. SKRBT was given orally three times daily to a total of 7.5 g/day for 15 eugonadal patients and ART was give to 16 hypogonadal patients by intramuscular injection of testosterone enanthate at 125 mg each time every 2 weeks. Plasma levels of testosterone and 18 cytokines, as well as LOH-related symptoms scored according to the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, were compared before and more than 2 months after treatment. In the ART group, the total AMS score was decreased and testosterone was increased significantly after treatment. No cytokine variables were altered significantly after the treatment. In the SKRBT group, although the total AMS score was significantly decreased, testosterone did not change. From the evaluation of cytokines, a significant increase was found in interleukin (IL)- 8, IL-13, interferon-γ and tumour necrosis factor-α. We conclude that SKRBT might improve LOH-related symptoms in eugonadal patients through the beneficial effect of cytokines, a mechanism that is quite different from ART.",

Reduction of the relative content of the saturated palmitic and stearic fatty acids and a slight increase of different unsaturated fatty acids was observed in phosphatidylcholine (PC). TRT also induced decrease of the cholesterol/total phospholipids ratio and fluidization of the EM.The TRT induced increase of PE content and the reduction of saturation in the PC acyl chains induced alterations in the structure of EM could result in higher flexibility of the erythrocytes. The increase of the SM-metabolizing enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase, which regulates the content of ceramide in membranes has a possible impact on the SM signaling pathway.We presume that the observed effect of TRT on the composition and fluidity of the EM contributes for improvement of blood rheology and may diminish the thrombosis risk.

However, the prevalence and clinical events of aspirin resistance in elderly male patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) have not been reported.We enrolled 304 elderly male patients with CVD receiving daily aspirin therapy (≥ 75 mg) more than 1 month. Platelet aggregation was measured by light transmission aggregometry (LTA) and thrombelastography platelet mapping assay (TEG). The median follow-up time was 1.8 years. The primary outcome was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke and transient ischemic attack.By LTA, 25 (8.2%) of elderly patients were aspirin resistant and 106 (34.9%) patients were semiresponders. According to TEG, 62 patients (20.4%) were found to be resistant to aspirin therapy. Of the 62 patients with aspirin resistance by TEG, 21 patients were aspirin resistant by LTA. Twenty-two of the 106 semiresponders by LTA were aspirin resistant by TEG. Patients with aspirin resistance or aspirin semiresponders were at increased risk of the composite outcome compared with aspirin-sensitive patients by LTA (18.3% vs 9.8%, Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.864, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.046-3.324 p = 0.039). However, aspirin resistance was not associated with an increased risk of clinical vascular events compared to aspirin-sensitive patients by TEG (17.7% vs 10.9%, p = 0.452). In addition, Cox proportional hazard regression modeling demonstrated that aspirin resistance or semiresponders (HR = 3.050, 95% CI: 1.464-6.354, p = 0.003) and diabetes (HR = 2.055, 95% CI: 1.060-3.981, p = 0.033) were associated with major adverse long-term outcomes.Aspirin resistance or semiresponders, defined by LTA, are associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events in elderly male patients with CVD.",

These goals were possible only by combined work of specialists and researchers of different and intertwined medical disciplines. Currently, tadalafil (5 mg/d) is the best choice; other phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i) are not included among options, despite the growing evidence of therapeutic effects. Different regimens of tadalafil may be prescribed based on patient needs, severity of LUTS/BPH - ED profile, and clinical experience. An integrated approach is necessary to choose for a combined therapy with PDE5i and α-blockers following urological and cardiac counseling in terms of outcomes and adverse effects.",

In each patient, 51CrEDTA clearance, serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, and estimated glomerular filtration rate using different equations were determined on the same day and patients were then followed for 11 years or until their death.Results: The means are as follows: 51CrEDTA clearance 53.3 ± 17.4 ml/min/1.73 m2, serum creatinine 1.62 ± 0.5 mg/dl, serum cystatin C 1.79 ± 0.5 mg/l, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation 40.1 ± 14 ml/min/1.73 m2, Berlin Initiative Study 2 (BIS2) equation 38.9 ± 10.7 ml/min/1.73 m2, full age spectrum (FAS) creatinine equation 43.8 ± 13.8 ml/min/1.73 m2, FAS cystatin C equation 40.1 ± 11.7 ml/min/1.73 m2. In the follow up period, 47 (81%) patients died. Cox regression analysis showed different hazard ratios (HRs) for death: for 51CrEDTA clearance HR 1.022 (95% CI 1.004–1.042; p = .015), serum creatinine HR 1.013 (95% CI 1.006–1.019; p = .001), serum cystatin C HR 2.028 (95% CI 1.267–3.241; p = .003), CKD-EPI creatinine equation HR 1.048 (95% CI 1.019–1.076; p = .001), BIS2 equation HR 1.055 (95% CI 1.021–1.088; p = .001), FAS creatinine equation HR 1.046 (95% CI 1.017–1.074; p = .001), FAS cystatin C equation HR 1.039 (95% CI 1.010–1.071; p = .009).Conclusions: Our results showed the highest HR for serum cystatin C among kidney function markers for prediction of outcome in elderly CKD patients.",

The Health Literacy Scale of the European Union was filled out by all of the participants. Costs related to COPD were taken into account.Compared to health literacy, the total cost of health care and the cost of admission to the emergency room seemed to be higher for subjects with inadequate health literacy levels than for subjects with significant levels of illness (p = .05 and p = .006, respectively). As the number of comorbidities increased, total and emergency department admission costs increased (p < .001 and p = .003, respectively). There was a difference between GOLD stages according to total, pulmonary disease and emergency service costs.In this study, it was determined that health literacy is an important factor affecting health expenditures with COPD subjects. With the improvement of health literacy, subjects are expected to reduce the overall cost burden of the disease.",

Methods: 164 consecutive patients were stratified into two groups: age <70 (group I, n = 93) and age ≥70 (group II, n = 71) years. Transurethral PVP was performed using a GreenLight HPS™ side-firing laser system. Voiding parameters were measured preoperatively and at 1 and 4 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months postoperatively. Results: Among the preoperative parameters evaluated, there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in prostate volume (I: 58.7; II: 73.6 mL) and serum prostate-specific antigen (I: 1.9; II: 2.9 ng/mL), while American Urological Association Symptom Score (AUASS), Quality of Life (QoL), maximum flow rate (Qmax), Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) and post void residual (PVR) were similar (p > 0.05) between groups. No significant differences in laser utilization, energy usage and operating time were noted. Clinical outcomes (AUASS, QoL, Qmax, PVR) showed immediate and stable improvement from baseline (p < 0.05) within each group, but no significant differences between the two groups were observed during the follow-up period. The incidence of adverse events was low and similar in both groups. Conclusions: The results suggest that age has little effect on the efficacy and safety of GreenLight HPS™ laser PVP.",

The association of fasting glucose and nocturnal hypoglycemia based on CGM data was analyzed, comparing with bedtime glucose.Based on CGM data, patients with nocturnal hypoglycemia had significantly lower fasting glucose (5.88 ± 1.29 versus 6.92 ± 1.32 mmol/L) and bedtime glucose (7.33 ± 1.70 versus 8.01 ± 1.95 mmol/L) than patients without nocturnal hypoglycemia (both p < 0.01). Compared with the highest quartile, the lowest quartile of fasting glucose had a significantly increased risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia after the multiple adjustments (pfor trend < 0.001). However, this association did not appear in bedtime glucose. When the prediction of nocturnal hypoglycemia either by fasting glucose or bedtime glucose using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, fasting glucose but not bedtime glucose, was an indicator of nocturnal hypoglycemia, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.714 (95% CI: 0.653 ∼ 0.774, p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Objectives: Erectile dysfunctions (EDs) are in part caused by hormonal causes; but in men over 65 years of age, testosterone deficiency seems to play an important role. However, in population of Polish men over 65 years of age with relative poor health status, the prevalence of testosterone deficiency in patients with ED is unknown. Material and methods: 286 men over 65 years of age with EDs were invited to complete an erectile function questionnaire (IIEF-5), as a diagnostic tool for EDs. Serum total testosterone (TT) levels were measured. Linear regression model was used to analyze the factors that are associated with testosterone deficiency. Results: The prevalence of testosterone deficiency was 17, 33, 42 and 57% for testosterone levels of less than 200, 250, 300 and 350 ng/dL, respectively. Only 47% patients had testosterone levels in the normal range (>350 ng/dL). The degree of ED was significantly higher in men with lowest testosterone levels (p < 0,002), and it was mild in 39.5% of cases, mild-to-moderate in 26.2%, moderate in 18.2% and severe in 16%. There was significant inverse relationship between age and TT (r = −0.3328, p < 0.05), IIEF-5 score and TT (r = −0.3149, p < 0.05) and IIEF-5 score and age (r = −0.3463, p < 0.05). The most common metabolic disorders were: obesity (68% in men with TT levels >350 ng/dL and 91% in men with TT levels <350 ng/dL) and dyslipidemia (54 and 95%, respectively). Obesity, age and hyperlipidemia all correlated with significantly decreased testosterone levels. Impaired fasting glucose did not affect the testosterone levels. Conclusions: Testosterone deficiency was very common in population of Polish men presenting with EDs and correlated negatively with age, obesity and dyslipidemia. These results can be associated with relative poor health status of Polish population.",

    "abstract": "Varicocele is one of the most common causes of male infertility. Leptin that has a role in sperm motility may have a role of varicocele. We aimed to study the effect of varicocelectomy on the serum and seminal leptin in patients with asthenozoospermia and the correlation between leptin levels, sperm parameters and varicocele grade.Thirty-six male patients with varicocele having isolated asthenozoospermia were included in this study. Thirty normal fertile controls were included. Semen analysis, serum and seminal leptin measurements were performed for all participants at baseline and for patients three months after varicocelectomy. Microsurgical varicocelectomy has been performed for patients.Seminal and serum leptin levels were significantly higher in patients than controls. Seminal leptin was positively correlated with varicocele grade (r = 0.357, p < .05) while no correlation was found between serum leptin varicocele grade (r = 0.056, p = .37). Both seminal and serum leptin were inversely correlated with sperm motility (r = -0.92 and r = -0.87, p < .001; respectively). Seminal and serum leptin were significantly improved after varicocelectomy.Varicocele is associated with higher levels of seminal and serum leptin especially in higher grads and this was correlated with negative effects on sperm motility. Leptin levels were significantly decreased after repair.",

The aim of this study was to present our eight-year experience regarding the management of patients with brucellar epididymo-orchitis (BEO).Materials and method: The medical records of male brucellosis patients treated in two centers, between 2010 and 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. The diagnosis of epididymo-orchitis was made when the patients had scrotal pain, swelling, and enlarged tender testicles and/or epididymis on clinical examination. Brucellosis was diagnosed with a positive standard tube agglutination test or a positive blood culture.Results: Brucellosis was diagnosed in 996 male patients. Of these patients, 25 had a diagnosis of BEO (2.5%). All BEO patients suffered from enlarged painful testicles, however, testicular complaints were the only presentation symptoms in three of them. All patients received medical treatment alone except one patient with testicular abscess who underwent surgical drainage besides medical treatment. All patients recovered completely and no relapses have been detected during six-month follow-up.Conclusion: Patients with epididymo-orchitis should be investigated for brucellosis especially in endemic regions. To our knowledge, BEO patients may present with isolated testicular symptoms that make a diagnostic challenge.",

In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of andropause health education on the level of knowledge and attitude of retired men.Methods: This controlled trial was conducted on 80 retired men (40 in intervention group, 40 in control group), who had been employed by the Department of Education, Shiraz, Iran. Data collection tool was a 38-item questionnaire, designed by the researcher, on participants' knowledge and attitude about andropause. Data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 22 and statistical tests such as independent and paired t tests were used.Findings: There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups before the intervention. There was a significant difference in knowledge and attitude scores in each group immediately and 1 month after the intervention. The mean score of knowledge in the intervention group increased from 2.92 ± 1.68 before to 16.22 ± 1.34 after the intervention, and the attitude score increased from 14.9 ± 1.08 to 28.52 ± 1.44. Comparison of the two groups and repeated score analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups over the time (p < .001).Conclusion: Educational intervention improved the knowledge and attitude of retired men toward andropause, which can have a positive impact on the timely recognition and proper treatment of the complications of andropause.",

This study aimed to determine whether IGF-1 is a mediator in age-related decline of bone health status measured by calcaneal speed of sound (SOS) in Malaysian men.Methods: The study recruited 279 Chinese and Malay men. Their demographic data, weight, height, calcaneal SOS were taken and fasting blood was collected for total testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin and IGF-1 assays. The associations between the studied variables were assessed using multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. Mediator analysis was performed using Sobel test.Results: There was a significant and parallel decrease of IGF-1 and SOS with age (p < 0.05). Serum IGF-1 was significantly and positively associated with SOS (p < 0.05) but after further adjustment for age, the significance was lost (p > 0.05). The strength of the association between age and SOS decreased after adjusting for IGF-1 level but it remained significant (p < 0.05). Sobel test revealed that IGF-1 was a significant partial mediator in the relationship between age and SOS (z = −4.3).Conclusion: Serum IGF-1 is a partial mediator in the age-related decline of bone health in men as determined by calcaneal ultrasound. A prospective study should be performed to validate this relationship.",

Linear regression with the stepwise method, and multivariate analyses of the General Linear Model with the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons were carried out with the SPSS 21.0 package.Results: High blood pressure and HDL were not significantly associated with either short-term memory or perceptual capacity. Age and glucose level were negatively associated but regular physical exercise was positively associated with perceptual capacity. On the other hand, high triglyceride level (TG) was positively associated but high waist/height ratio was negatively associated with short-term memory. When men without any component of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) were compared with men with one, two or three or more components of MetS, no significant differences in cognitive performance were noted.Conclusion: Not all the metabolic factors were significantly associated with short-term memory or the perceptual capacity domains. Those that were did not show a sufficiently consistent pattern of association to support a role for MetS as a whole in cognitive decline with aging. It may not be meaningful to evaluate the association of MetS as a whole with cognition.",

Carnitine deficiency is frequently observed in HD patients, playing a role in CVD. We examined whether carnitine deficiency was independently associated with LOH and depression in these patients. Twenty-six male HD patients underwent determinations of serum levels of free carnitine and testosterone. Status of LOH and depression were evaluated by questionnaires using aging male symptoms' (AMS) scale and self-rating depression scale (SDS), respectively. Free carnitine and testosterone levels in male HD patients were significantly lower than those in age-matched healthy male subjects. Linear regression analysis showed that AMS scale was positively associated with SDS. Univariate regression analysis revealed that total carnitine (inversely), free carnitine (inversely) and HD duration were correlated with AMS scale. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that free carnitine was an independent determinant of AMS scale. Furthermore, free carnitine was also independently correlated with SDS in male HD patients. This study demonstrated that decreased free carnitine levels were independently associated with AMS scale and SDS in male HD patients. The observations suggest that decreased free carnitine levels could be a marker and therapeutic target of LOH and depression in uremic men with HD.",

    "abstract": "An international expert consensus conference regarding testosterone deficiency (TD) (also known as hypogonadism) and its treatment was held on 1 October 2015, in Prague, Czech Republic. The impetus for this meeting was to address several key scientific issues that have been misunderstood or distorted during the recent intense media attention to this topic. Eighteen experts from 11 countries participated, from the disciplines of urology, endocrinology, andrology, diabetology, and basic science research. The goal was to identify scientific concepts for which there was broad agreement. It was noted that recent public controversies regarding testosterone therapy have been anchored by two retrospective studies reporting increased cardiovascular (CV) risks. Both these studies contained major flaws, and are contradicted by a large body of evidence suggesting CV benefits with testosterone therapy. Other topics discussed included the negative impact of TD on male health; the questionable validity of restrictions on treatment based on age-specific cut-offs, presence of identified underlying conditions, or application of rigid biochemical thresholds; and the lack of evidence regarding prostate cancer risks. Final consensus statements (resolutions) are under development. It is hoped these will serve as a scientific foundation for further discussion, and will thereby reduce misinformation regarding TD and its treatment.",

The researchers found a significant difference between pre- (4.36 ± 56 ng/mL) and post- (5.51 ± 0.35 ng/mL) testosterone levels, as well as pre- (0.88 ± 0.20) and post- (7.46 ± 1.25) androstenedione levels, but no significant differences between pre- and post-estradiol levels for either group. It appears that short-term androstenedione supplementation augmented acute testosterone responses to resistance exercise in older men. However, further study of this supplement is needed to determine any potential it may have in mitigating andropause.",

The results for soldiers were not as unambiguous, but biological parameters were generally closer to those for professionals. Inborn biological predispositions and long-term impact of the working environment can influence on the biological condition of various professional groups. Knowledge of the determinants of biological condition might result in efficient use of predisposition to work or may be of help in extending their time of work ability.",

    "abstract": "Hypogonadism is associated with a wide range of physical and psychological symptoms that can affect the overall health of men. However, in a developing country, there are several imposing challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism, including a lack of awareness and understanding of the condition among healthcare providers and patients, limited resources and the high cost of treatment. This review aimed to examine the potential benefits and risks of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and provides a perspective of a developing country on the topic.A comprehensive literature review was conducted to gather relevant information on the impact of testosterone deficiency on ageing males and the effectiveness of TRT for treating hypogonadism. Published peer-reviewed articles were analyzed to evaluate the benefits and risks of TRT. Additionally, the unique challenges faced in the diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism in a developing country were considered.Testosterone replacement therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for hypogonadism, particularly in symptomatic men with low testosterone levels. It offers potential benefits such as improvements in symptoms and overall quality of life. However, there are associated risks and side effects that need to be considered. In a developing country, challenges such as limited awareness and understanding of hypogonadism, resource constraints, and high treatment costs pose additional barriers to accessing TRT and comprehensive care.In conclusion, TRT holds promise as a treatment for hypogonadism, but its implementation and accessibility face significant challenges in a developing country. Addressing these challenges, including raising awareness, allocating resources, and finding cost-effective solutions, is crucial for ensuring that men with hypogonadism in such settings receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Further research and efforts are needed to improve the management of hypogonadism in developing countries and optimize the potential benefits of TRT for affected individuals.",

We established Peyronie's model by injecting intratunical TGF-beta and 3% disodium phosphate dihydrate into four groups. One group received intratunical saline. The control group for the Peyronie's disease model was one group. In the other groups, the first had castration orchiectomy. The second group was the Peyronie's disease model control. The third group received intratunical saline injections. The fourth group received intraperitoneal testosterone injections, while the fifth received 0.5 mg of 5-alpha reductase inhibitor orally daily. We excised penile tissue for histopathology after a 30-day follow-up. Masson's trichrome staining found collagen and smooth muscle, picro-sirius staining found collagen III and collagen I, and hematoxylin and eosin staining found fibrosis. Histopathological examination revealed significant differences in fibrosis, smooth muscle/collagen ratios, and collagen III/collagen I ratios. Comparing groupings without a control group revealed no statistically significant differences. This study explored testosterone's effect on Peyronie's disease in rats.

The aim of this study is to examine the expression of the LHCG receptor in the human vulvar tissue to determine whether LH could have an effect on the vulva. Vulva tissue was obtained from three patients (ages 68, 76 and 71) undergoing surgery due to squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. Immunohistochemistry was used for the detection of the LHCG receptor. Positive immunoreaction for LHCG receptor was detected in the different cell types of the human vulva. This study provides clear evidence of LHCG receptor expression in various cell types within the human vulva. These findings reinforce the idea that elevated postmenopausal gonadotropin levels may directly impact vulvar tissue. Further studies are indicated.",

The unique constellation of symptoms spanning multiple organ systems and health domains necessitates specialized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Neglecting the specific needs of this population can precipitate a considerable decline in quality of life and overall health outcomes. Our recommendations advocate for a multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinologists, urologists, geneticists, mental health professionals, and other specialists, to address the complex interplay of hormonal imbalances, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular risk factors including arrhythmia, bone health concerns, psychological and sexual challenges, ophthalmological problems, and dental issues. By providing a structured framework for comprehensive and individualized care, these recommendations aim to bridge existing healthcare gaps, optimize well-being, and enhance the overall quality of life for aging men with KS.",

Multi-variable adjusted logistic regression models were used to analysis the association between aspirin use and UI. A total of 6844 male participants were evaluated in the study. Compared to participants without aspirin use, the individuals on aspirin with or without coronary heart disease (CVD), respectively, had higher incidences of urinary dysfunction including UI, urgent micturition, and nocturia. In addition, in multivariable logistic adjusted models, the risk of UI (OR = 2.44; 95%CI = 2.10-2.83; P-value = 0.0000) and urgent micturition (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.35-1.83; P-value = 0.0000) in use participants was significantly greater versus the reference those who not taken aspirin.

Administration of testosterone (T) pellets offers consistent blood levels based on the implantation of pellets that dissolve over months. Guidelines for pellet dosing has been absent and often men are overdosed with T. The goal of the study was to evaluate the effect of pellet dose versus surface area on blood levels over 3 months in healthy men. One group of men were administered small individual pellets that resulted in higher surface than the other group, but at a lower dose. Within 2 weeks the T levels had risen over two times the baseline level in both groups, but the cohort administered the lowest T dose (but highest surface area) had the greatest response whether calculated as peak change or when analyzed according to age-adjusted values. Increasing the pellet surface area resulted in fewer extrusions, no adverse events, and higher serum T levels compared to subjects that received a higher dose with a lower surface area. Presently there appears to be no negative consequences of administering T pellets using methods that maximize the total pellet surface area.",

This article uses Mendelian randomization (MR) to analyze the causal relationship between clinical indicators and ED, and explores the potential metabolic mechanisms involved. Two-sample MR analysis was performed to analyze the causal relationships between 1,400 metabolites and clinical data and ED for revealing its potential metabolic mechanisms using GWAS (Genome-wide association studies) data. The stability of MR analysis was assessed using sensitivity analysis. We then used clinical data to confirm the MR analysis results. The research results indicated that elevated lymphocyte count (LC) can lead to ED risks. To confirm that LC and ED are causally related, we gathered clinical data. We further revealed potential metabolic mechanisms and found that LC can not only reduce the metabolite 4-methylcatechol sulfate levels, lowering the metabolite 4-methylcatechol sulfate levels to increase the risk of ED, and can also increase the metabolite X-24801 levels, raising the metabolite X-24801 levels to increase the risk of ED. A rise in LC could raise the risks of ED by negatively regulating the metabolite 4-methylcatechol sulfate levels and positively controlling the metabolite X-24801 levels.HighlightsThis article uses Mendelian randomization analysis to determine the causal relationship between lymphocyte count and erectile dysfunction, and uses sensitivity analysis to determine its stabilityRevealed the potential mechanism by which lymphocyte count increases the risk of erectile dysfunctionCollecting clinical data validated the results of Mendelian randomization analysisAt present, the methods and efficacy of treating erectile dysfunction in clinical practice are limited.

In the absence of longitudinal (cohort) studies, we tried to find cross-sectional, population-based studies with a broad age span to find a preliminary answer. We obtained six surveys that contained information for at least some of the symptoms. We re-analyzed these databases, which included over 8000 males and 8000 females, in a pooled fashion. Sixteen symptoms of predominantly somatic, psychological and urogenital origin were identified and the age-dependent increase of the relative frequencies was compared between genders. A general tendency for women to report more symptoms was confirmed; however, no significant differences were found between genders regarding the time trend of these symptoms. The analyses suggest that males experience a similar symptomatology in the same age span as women. One may thus be tempted to conclude that aging males experience similar phenomena to women during their menopausal transition. This should be confirmed in a specifically designed study.",

    "abstract": "After middle age, some men show androgen-deficiency symptoms leading to so-called PADAM (partial androgen deficiency in aging males). We tested the oral form of testosterone, testosterone undecanoate (Andriol, NV Organon, The Netherlands), in men with PADAM and evaluated its efficacy and safety in Korean male patients.We included those patients with the clinical symptoms of PADAM who had decreased levels of serum total testosterone (< 2.8 ng/ml) or free testosterone (< 13 pg/ml). We excluded patients with biopsy-confirmed prostrate cancer, abnormal findings in digital rectal examination or prostate specific antigen testing (until prostrate cancer was ruled out), breast cancer, severe voiding symptoms and secondary hypogonadism. At the first visit, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Korean Andropause Questionnaires were administered; complete blood count, the lipid profile, and levels of total and free testosterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prostate specific antigen were measured and a digital rectal examination was given. Patients were administered oral testosterone undecanoate 160 mg daily for 3 weeks. The dosage was then decreased to 80 mg daily and changes in symptoms were assessed at every visit. After 3 months, serum tests, including testosterone, were repeated.We evaluated 28 patients who had received testosterone undecanoate for more than 3 months. The patients' mean age was 56.1 (48-68) years. The score of the Korean Andropause Questionnaire changed from 56.2 +/- 21.7 at baseline to 52.9 +/- 21.3 (p = 0.03) after 3 weeks, to 49.3 +/- 19.3 (p = 0.03) after 8 weeks, and to 46.5 +/- 25.6 (p = 0.028) after 12 weeks. With respect to sexual function, mean IIEF scores were 37.2 +/- 19.6 at baseline and 38.7 +/- 19.2 and 40.2 +/- 22.0 (p = 0.033) after 3 and 12 weeks, respectively. Serum total testosterone increased from 2.13 +/- 1.20 ng/ml at baseline to 6.04 +/- 3.08 ng/ml (p = 0.005) after 12 weeks, and free testosterone was marginally significantly changed from 8.60 +/- 2.25 pg/ml to 11.40 +/- 3.81 pg/ml (p = 0.13). However, there were no significant changes in liver function tests, red blood cell count or lipid profiles. There were no significant adverse reactions that led to the cessation of the administration of oral testosterone.Oral administration of testosterone undecanoate can improve symptoms of PADAM in Koreans. It may, therefore, be an appropriate treatment option with few adverse effects for PADAM patients.",

    "abstract": "We have previously reported seasonal variations in both total and free testosterone in men living in north Norway. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether seasonal variation in testosterone also occurs in men living in geographical areas with less extreme seasonal variation in sunlight and temperature. In 915 men aged 24-91 years from Rancho Bernardo, a suburb of San Diego in southern California, we found that neither total nor bioavailable testosterone varied by season, with or without adjustments for age and anthropometric measurements. Of all examined covariates, only physical activity showed a seasonal variation, with a peak in August (p < 0.001), and adjusting for physical activity did not change the lack of seasonal variation in testosterone. In addition, there was no association between testosterone and mean air temperature, or testosterone and possible hours of sunshine. We conclude that men living in southern California show no seasonal variation in testosterone levels. One possible explanation, besides the difference in climate, for the diverging findings between our previous study and the present study is different sleep patterns.",

Stone sizes, locations, opacity, and pre-operative drainage procedures matched in both groups. The overall stone-free rate was 91% for both groups. Complications were recorded in 1% of the older patients and 3.7% of the younger ones. No treatment-related mortality was recorded.Age itself has no effect on the success rate of SWL with the HM3 lithotripter for ureteral stones.

All the subjects had completed clinical data and answered questionnaires.

In multiple logistic regression analysis, age and IPSS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.013, respectively) were significantly associated with ED after controlling other comorbidities. In a further age-adjusted multiple regression analysis, our results showed that irritative symptoms (p = 0.042) have a more significant association with ED than the obstructive symptoms (p = 0.101).Our results indicate that age and LUTS are the two most independent risk factors for ED. Aging Taiwanese males with LUTS are at increasing risk for ED, especially for those with significant irritative symptoms.",

Middle-age (n = 41, 54 ± 4 yrs) and older (n = 40, 69 ± 5 yrs) men underwent grip and knee extensor strength tests, total body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry with regional analyses and a graded exercise treadmill test.Results. Bone-free lean mass (BFLM) and, to a lesser extent, fat mass (FM) were correlated with bone mineral variables in middle-age men. In older men, BFLM and, to a lesser extent, FM were related to bone mineral content (BMC) at most sites, but inconsistently to bone mineral density (BMD). Knee extensor strength related to bone mineral (BMC and BMD) at most sites in middle-age men, but none in older men. Grip strength inconsistently related to bone mineral in both groups. Aerobic capacity related to bone mineral in middle-age men, but none in older men. In multiple regression, body weight or BFLM predicted bone mineral in middle-age men (R2 = 0.33–0.68) and BMC in older men (R2 = 0.33–0.50). Predictors of BMD were inconsistent in older men.Conclusions. Relationships of body composition, muscular strength and aerobic capacity to bone mineral are stronger in middle-age versus older men.",

We previously examined the inverse relationship between total serum testosterone (T) and the occurrence of the metabolic syndrome in ageing men using baseline data from two lipid treatment studies. We further examined baseline data from a subset of US men participating in one of these two studies to assess the relationship between T and the cardiovascular risk factor lipid, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)].Methods. Baseline T, lipid, glycaemic and anthropometric data were obtained from 107 men (mean age: 55 years). Inclusion criteria included low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥3.4–4.9 mmol/l and triglycerides ≤4.0 mmol/l. Baseline Lp(a) levels were examined across the following baseline T subgroups: <15 nmol/l (low/low-normal T) and ≥15 nmol/l (normal T).Results. There was an overall trend for a higher incidence of clinically significant Lp(a) elevations in men with low T; 17.1% of men in the low/low-normal T subgroup had an Lp(a) level ≥3 times the upper limit of normal compared to 8.1% in the normal T subgroup.Conclusions. The data from this descriptive analysis suggest that ageing men with low serum T levels may have an increase in marked elevations in Lp(a), which would be expected to be associated with a significant increase in their cardiovascular event risk.",

Both doses of PTH (1–84) partially (low dose) or totally (high dose) restored the ORX-induced changes. Serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen/5b isoenzyme of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (CTX/TRAP) resorption index increased after orchidectomy. Osteocalcin (bone Gla protein; BGP) levels were not affected by orchidectomy. PTH (1–84) treatment did not produce any changes in the levels of CTX/TRAP with respect to the ORX group. BGP levels increased with PTH treatment.Conclusion: PTH (1–84) is able to restore the adverse effects of orchidectomy on bone as measured by BMD, microstructural and biomechanical properties and bone remodeling markers.",

Today, a variety of medical therapies and minimally invasive BPH treatment modalities are available. Medical therapy includes α1 blockers, 5α reductase inhibitors and combination therapy. When these options fail, surgery is indicated. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is still considered the gold standard surgical treatment for BPH. Nevertheless, numerous minimally invasive treatment alternatives are available that are comparable in effectiveness to TURP, with significantly less morbidity. In this article, current treatment options for BPH are reviewed with respect to their indications, long-term safety and efficacy in relieving BPH related LUTS. The selection of the type of BPH treatment should be based on the physician's experience, patient's co-morbidities as well as the prostate size and clinical disease progression.",

The present study sought to examine the association between physical exercise as a lifestyle habit with anthropometric parameters and body composition and aging in men.Methods. Intensity of exercise was scored as metabolic equivalent-min/week (MET-min/week) from data of the questionnaire, while anthropometric parameters and body composition were carried out by standard measuring instruments and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner, respectively.Results. Age was associated with decreases in bodyweight, height, total lean mass and bone mass, but an increase in fat mass. The negative association of lean mass with age was predominantly due to the negative association of lean masses in the legs and arm, while the positive association of fat mass with age was primarily due to the positive association of fat masses in the trunk and abdomen. Exercise of intensity greater than 1000 MET-min/week was significantly associated with higher lean and bone masses and lower fat mass. The increase in lean mass was predominantly in the legs, while the decreases in fat mass were in the trunk and abdomen.Conclusion. The study showed that the high intensity of physical exercise, equivalent to greater than 1000 MET-min/week, is required to effect beneficial changes in the body composition. Hence, results from the study support the importance of promoting a lifestyle habit of exercise of sufficient intensity in order to mitigate the increase risks of sarcopenia and obesity and their attendant ill effects on health in men as they age.",

Three-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 46) were divided into three experimental arms, baseline, buserelin, and orchidectomy. In the buserelin arm, the rats received a daily subcutaneous injection of either normal saline or buserelin acetate at 25 µg/kg or 75 µg/kg. In the orchidectomy arm, the rats were either sham-operated or orchidectomized. The rats were euthanized after the three-month treatment.

A significant increase in serum C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen was observed in the orchidectomized group compared with the sham group (p < .05). Structural histomorphometry analysis showed that both buserelin (25 µg/kg and 75 µg/kg) and orchidectomy significantly decreased the trabecular bone volume, number and significantly increased trabecular separation in rats compared with their respective controls (p < .05). Osteoclast number and eroded surface were significantly increased in both buserelin (25 µg/kg and 75 µg/kg) and orchidectomized group compared with their respective controls (p < .05). As a conclusion, buserelin causes deterioration of bone microarchitecture and increased bone resorption similar to orchidectomy after three months.",

BASMI scores were significantly lower in the mild dependency subgroup as compared to those with moderate or severe dependency (p = .005 and p = .007, respectively). Total IIEF score and IIEF categories correlated significantly with BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI, ASQoL, pain, fatigue, and cumulative smoking. BDI showed an inverse correlation with the IIEF score and IIEF category (p < .001 r = –0.520, p < .001 r = –0.508, respectively).Conclusions: Sexual function in AS patients is associated with the pain, fatigue, disease activity, functional status, quality of life, depression as well as the cumulative exposure to smoking, and that sexual functions tend to decline with increasing degree of cigarette dependency.",

Each patient collected age, medical history, height, weight, body mass index, as well as a full examination of sex hormones, and transrectal ultrasound results.Results: Estradiol (E2) was significantly associated with prostate volume (r = 0.151, p = .02) and transitional zone volume (r = 0.136, p = .035). The association was more significant after adjusting age and BMI (r = 0.253 and 0.250, p <.001). Patients were divided into two groups according to prostate volume and E2, respectively. E2 in patients with prostate volume ≤50 ml was significantly lower than those with prostate volume >50 ml. Prostate volume, transitional zone volume and age were all significantly higher in the patients with E2 ≥ 160 umol/l than those in the patients with E2 < 160 umol/l. Through logistics regression, E2 (p = .012, OR = 1.004) are the only independent risk factor for prostate volume.Conclusions: E2 is significantly associated with prostate volume. High concentrations of E2 may be a risk factor for the large volume of prostate.",

The patients had received at least 6 months of treatment via conventional medical treatments. NIH-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI), International Index of Erectile Function-Erectile Function part (IEEF-EF), and Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP). The intravaginal ejaculation latency times (IELT) of the patients were recorded before and 6th months after the procedure. Bipolar radiofrequency thermotherapy was applied with TEMPRO system containing a16Fr applicator. The mean age of the patients was 42.62 ± 8.25 years. All patients were treated with local anesthesia, and three patients were unable to complete the procedure. After 6 months, significant improvements were observed in the NIH-CPSI total (20.25 vs. 12.18; p < .001) and subgroup scores, PEP scores (0.98 ± 1.12 vs. 2.06 ± 1.03; p < .001) and IELT (68.24 ± 56.78 vs. 103.02 ± 188.56; p < .001). There was no significant difference between IIEF-EF scores. Symptomatic improvement was observed in 78.57% (33/42) of the patients. Bipolar radiofrequency thermotherapy, which is a transurethral method in patients with CP/CPPS, decreases the severity of the disease and improvement of the symptom scores on urinary and sexual function.

Objective: To assess current clinical practices of European physicians regarding diagnosis and management of TDS compared with current guidelines. Methods: Postal survey conducted June–November 2008 in France, Germany, Italy and Spain among urologists, endocrinologists and general practitioners to collect information regarding knowledge of TDS. Results: Among 801 respondents, the majority of endocrinologists and urologists had received training on TDS, either initially or as part of continuous medical education. TDS was recognized by 86.5% of physicians as a true clinical entity, and estimated the prevalence at 10–15% of the male population; 73.5% considered that symptoms and a low level of testosterone were required for diagnosis. Treatment preferences were quarterly intramuscular injections (26.3% of physicians), percutaneous gels (23.9%), matrix patch (21.2%), semi-monthly injections (15.4%) and oral therapy (13.4%). Adverse effects of testosterone replacement therapy, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, were a concern for physicians. Conclusions: TDS management appeared to be close to that recommended in international guidelines. Signs and symptoms of testosterone deficiency were fairly well known, but some diagnostic and treatment variations were observed.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The presence of concomitant erectile dysfunction (ED) with heart failure (HF) is not surprising, because endothelial dysfunction is pathophysiologic signature of both ED and HF. ED significantly and adversely affects quality of life in patients with HF. It was demonstrated that ivabradine treatment can improve endothelial function and ED in experimental models. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of ivabradine treatment on ED in patients with HF via International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionaire.Material and methods: Consequently, 29 patients, between 18 and 70 years of age, male with chronic HF known for at least 1 year, New York Heart Association functional class I–II, left ventricule ejection fraction less than 40%, in sinus rhythm with a resting HR of at least 70 beats per minute (b.p.m.), who were intended to be treated with ivabradine according to the decision of their physicians were evaluated to determine ED. We used the Turkish version of the IIEF-5 questionnaire to evaluate ED on the last 6-month period. Twenty-four of 29 patients who scored ≤21 were considered to have ED and included to the study. IIEF-5 scores for each question and domains were calculated for all responders at baseline and at 6-month follow-up visit in order to determine any effect of ivabradine treatment on ED in patients with HF.Results: According to the data of survey, Cronbach's alpha coeffient for all of the patients who were included into the study were 0.84 and detected highly reliable. IEFF-5 questionnaire scores increased significantly (p = .003) after the ivabradine treatment, on the contrary, significant decrease in HR was revealed as expected. HR is decreased steadily after ivabradine treatment and mean decrease in HR was 11.5 ± 9.4 in this study population. Likewise, negative correlation was demonstrated between decrease in HR (p < .001) and increase in IEFF-5 scores (p = .003).Conclusion: Although lack of patients with HF have been evaluated in this study population, initial results seem promising that ivabradine has favorable effects on ED. These findings were postulated to be dependent exclusively on HR reduction. As a sequel, cardiologist should avoid neglecting ED to improve medical compliance as well as quality of life in patients with heart failure. This pilot study provide some data for further randomized controlled studies.",

The patients were divided into two groups according to PHQ-9 score: those with depression symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 6, depression group), and those without depression symptoms (PHQ-9 < 6, non-depression group). Two groups were compared using t-tests and correlation coefficients, as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p < .05.There were no significant correlations between PHQ-9 scores and any of the parameters in the patients overall. In subgroup analysis, a positive correlation was found between the duration of ADT and PHQ-9 score in the patients with depression symptoms (p = .03). In addition, univariate analysis showed a positive association between the duration of ADT and PHQ-9 score, and a longer duration of ADT was further independently associated with increased PHQ-9 score in multivariate analysis in the patients with depression symptoms.This study demonstrated that in patients with prostate cancer and depression symptoms, the severity of the depression symptoms was positively correlated with the duration of ADT.

However, there are some cases reported in which surgical treatment has paradoxically improved erectile function. Here, we present a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the effect of surgery on sexual function, focusing on reports of improvement in erectile function following surgery.We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and SCOPUS databases for the following keywords: ((\"sexual function\" OR \"erectile function\") AND \"improvement\" AND \"benign prostatic hyperplasia\" AND \"surgery\").Sixteen studies (total n = 2087) were reviewed which reported a significant improvement in any aspect of erectile function. Ten of these studies had a follow-up period of 12 months or more while five had a follow up less than 12 months. Various surgical methods were included in the 16 studies; however, five reported TURP outcomes specifically. Eleven studies reported outcomes using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Overall, a further 87 studies showed no significant change and 8 studies showed a significant reduction.The majority of studies report no change in erectile function following surgical intervention for BPH. There seems to be no obvious correlating factor between the studies reporting an improvement in erectile function. Further research is needed to guide us in how to consent our patients for erectile function outcomes for BPH surgery.",

Patients who referred the preliminary diagnosis of OSAS were included in this study. D-dimer levels of all patients were measured, and D-dimer (+) patients were evaluated by Doppler USG of the lower-extremity. Mean age of the patient group was 52 ± 12 years and 31.8% (76/239) were women. The rate of D-dimer positivity among severe-OSAS cases (15/85) was significantly higher compared to the rest (13/154) (17.6% and 8.4%, respectively; p = 0.034). The risk of D-dimer positivity was elevated by 2.3 folds in severe-OSAS cases (OR: 2,324, 95% confidence interval: 1.048-5.152). Among 28 D-dimer (+) cases, 4 (14.2%) had DVT as demonstrated by USI of the lower-extremity. All four cases with DVT had severe OSAS. D-dimer was positive in 17.6% (15/85) of all severe OSAS cases. DVT was diagnosed in 4.7% (4/85) of severe-OSAS cases. DVT frequency was 26.6% (4/15) in D-dimer (+) severe-OSAS. Findings of this study indicate that severe-OSAS can be a significant risk factor for DVT. Additionally, data obtained in this study underline the benefits of questioning severe-OSAS patients with respect to DVT symptoms, investigating D-dimer levels and evaluating D-dimer (+) severe-OSAS cases for DVT prophylaxis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Increased systemic oxidative stress is considered as an important risk factor for prostate cancer occurrence; however, the relationship between impaired redox homeostasis of prostate tissue and aging remains unclear.Objective: In our study, we hypothesized that age-related deterioration of redox homeostasis in prostate tissue may be considered as a predisposing factor for prostate cancer occurrence.Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into two groups as young control (5 months) and naturally aged (24 months). We investigated the levels of oxidant and antioxidant parameters in prostate tissue.Results: Advanced oxidation protein products, protein carbonyl, non-protein thiol and lipid hydroperoxides levels of aged rats were significantly higher than in the young control rats (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively). Additionally, antioxidant activity of Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutase in elderly group was significantly lower than young controls (p < 0.05).Conclusions: We suggest that increased non-protein thiol levels found in aged rats may prevent further dissemination of oxidative protein damage. We also propose that the increased levels of oxidative protein damage markers and decreased Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase activity in aged prostate may be considered as a predisposing factor for prostate cancer. Further studies are warranted to clarify all these oxidative changes as initiation factors for prostate cancer in the association of aging with prostate cancer.",

There are some other \"non-traditional\" risk factors such as hematogram components that are also related to the same endpoints as MetS. In this four-year longitudinal study, we used hematogram components to build models for predicting future occurrence of MetS in older men and women separately.Methods: Subjects above 65 years without MetS and related diseases were enrolled. All subjects were followed up until they developed MetS or until up to four years from the day of entry, whichever was earlier.Results: Among the 4539 study participants, 1327 developed MetS. Models were built for men and women separately and the areas under the receiver operation curves were significant. The Kaplan–Meier plot showed that the models could predict future MetS. Finally, Cox regression analysis showed that the hematogram model was correlated to future MetS with hazard ratios of 1.567 and 1.738 in men and women, respectively.Conclusion: Our hematogram models could significantly predict future MetS in elderly and might be more practical and convenient for daily clinical practice.",

Physicians have a greater awareness that T deficiency can be an element in cardiovascular and metabolic disease, but more education of physicians on diagnosis and treatment of hypogonadism are needed. Problems with reimbursement of T are barriers in the prescription of T and its use by patients.",

Methods: In a cross-sectional survey 93 men, age 70 or greater, responded to a random mailing to a suburban community. Sixty-eight men were eligible and 47 participated in the study. Two health status questionnaires, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Short-form 36 (SF-36), were mailed to participants with instructions to complete the surveys on the same day and return them by mail. Blood samples were obtained for bioavailable and total testosterone measurements. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to compare the responses to the SF-36 and SIP and testosterone levels. Results: Of the eligible volunteers 69% participated and were able to self-administer the SIP and the SF-36. Summation scores for the surveys were above those reported in similar age populations. Perfect scores were reported frequently in all subsets of the SIP; perfect scores were reported in 43-92% of men on various subscales. The responses to the SF-36 were also frequently perfect although perfect scores ranged from 2 to 82% on various subsets. There was moderate correlation between the results from the two surveys. There was no correlation between age, SIP or SF-36 and testosterone level. Conclusions: Healthy older men volunteering for clinical research were able to self-administer both the SIP and SF3-6. Responses to both surveys were skewed toward perfect scores; the SIP failed to reveal many men with functional deficits. Bioavailable testosterone levels did not predict perceived health in this group of men.",

Following international methodological recommendations, the AMS scale was translated in a standardized way consisting of forward translation, quality control, backward translation and a pretest. Five experienced bilingual translators and reviewers were involved. Many difficulties of compatibility between the cultural backgrounds of Germany, the UK and North America were identified and resolved by consensus. This resulted in one version for British and American English. A pretest in volunteers demonstrated clarity and understandability across social classes, but also suggested minor changes in the instrument. A preliminary test-retest comparison of the final scale showed high reliability with a correlation coefficient of 0.93 for the total AMS score. The AMS scale is a valuable tool for assessing symptoms in the aging male. This scale can be used in German and English speaking countries. Flemish and Finnish versions are also in use.",

All men completed a questionnaire containing 38 items covering a number of aspects of the aging male. Questionnaires were compiled by using items from previously published and validated questionnaires. Several socioeconomic parameters were also determined. In parallel, serum levels of testosterone, free testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), DHEA-S, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were quantified by commercially available immunoassays.A total of 375 men with a mean age of 59.9 +/- 9.2 years (mean +/- standard deviation) were analyzed. Average DHEA-S and estradiol levels of 135.8 +/- 90.9 micrograms/dl and 29.7 +/- 14.6 pg/ml, respectively, were recorded. DHEA-S serum levels were negatively correlated to patient age, sexual function score, total score and PSA. Estradiol serum levels were positively correlated to testosterone and free testosterone. None of the other scores or questions revealed a correlation with DHEA-S or estradiol serum levels.This prospective study elucidates only small interactions between partial androgen deficiency of the aging male (PADAM)-related symptoms and serum levels of DHEA-S and estradiol. Nevertheless, the data suggest an impact of DHEA-S on sexual function.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a complex process modulated by multiple interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Myotonic dystrophy (DM 1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an unstable (CTG)n repeat expansion in the DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The affected male patients' life expectancy at birth (53.2 years) is more than two decades below that observed in most occidental populations. The DMPK gene expression is pleiotropic and includes the premature expression of several agerelated signs, symptoms and metabolic disturbances including hormonal dysfunctions, progressive decrease in muscular mass, presenile cataracts, alopecia, reduced alertness, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between aging covariates and the severity of DM1 expression in 136 DM1 male subjects. DM1 clinical expression was assessed on a validated neuromuscular disability rating scale and was correlated with plasma total testosterone (rs = -0.31, p < 0.001), luteinizing hormone (LH) (rs = 0.52, p < 0.001) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (rs = 0.54, p < 0.001) levels. Following LH releasing hormone stimulation, FSH and LH concentrations increased as a function of DM1 severity (p < 0.05). Muscular disability in DM1 was also positively associated with fasting plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations (p < 0.05). The association of plasma apolipoprotein B and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with DM1 was not linear across their distribution and tended to reflect cell membrane damage progression. These results suggest that DM1, a simple M endelian trait, can represent a valuable model to illustrate the complex relationships between variables associated with male aging.",

With life expectancy increasing, postmenopausal estrogen/gestagen replacement therapy has been under discussion for some time with the aim of achieving a higher quality of life in old age. For a long time, the relevance of hormonal aging was only discussed with reference to women; however, more recent work deals with concepts that affect both sexes. According to recent studies, numerous symptoms and complaints which may impair quality of life, can be attributed to hormonal changes in old age in both women and men. The majority of age-related complaints, such as a decline in physical performance, decreased sexual activity and a deterioration of general well-being, are strongly reminiscent of the symptoms of classical pituitary disorders in adulthood. Since the early 1990s, scientific studies have also been investigating the influence of hormone 'replacement' in elderly men, using, for example, growth hormones. However, until now there has been no suitable measure for assessing the quality of life specifically in elderly men. In a research project aimed at developing a questionnaire (the VITA™ questionnaire), roughly equal numbers of elderly men and women were asked about their subjective health and quality of life. It was found that men assessed their health-related quality of life very positively in a number of different dimensions of the questionnaire. In the present article the individual aspects of the quality of life of men are described and examples of gender-related differences are presented and discussed.",

The aim of this paper is to report on experiences gained from the application of the French version of the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale, to show correlations with other relevant scales and to provide population reference values for France.Methods. A representative survey based on an existing, representative population panel was performed in France (963 males, aged 15 + years). Other AMS data from Europe were then used for comparison. Mean scores of the French AMS scale do not systematically differ from the data of other European studies. The population reference values obtained for France strongly suggest that the scale measures can appreciate the level of well-being whatever the patients' age; however, some variables, such as age and family income, can influence the total AMS scores. Comparisons with the generic quality-of-life scale, SF-12, and a depression scale, HAD, have shown good correlations, as have comparisons with the ADAM questionnaire.Conclusion. The French AMS scale is a standardized, valid and simple health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scale, with results comparable to other published European findings. The results also indicate that the AMS scale can be used to measure and compare HRQoL in those less than 40 years of age.",

These markers may allow quantitative evaluation of rates of bone loss, and thereby identify persons at risk for osteoporosis at an earlier stage. As far as we know, this is the longest longitudinal study on bone turnover markers conducted in adult men. The objectives of this study were to determine whether markers of bone formation (type I procollagen amino-terminal propeptide, PINP, and carboxy-terminal propeptide, PICP), and of bone resorption (type I collagen carboxy-terminal telopeptide, ICTP), are predictive of changes in lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD over a 5-year period, and to determine the ability of the bone resorption marker urine amino-terminal telopeptide (NTx) to explain the variance in BMD change over the past 5 years in a group of men 35–69 years old. In this group, NTx was the only marker to correlate significantly with BMD changes at the femoral neck (r = −0.21), but not at the spine. The use of the biochemical markers studied to predict change in bone density in adult men in middle-aged years is of very limited value.",

    "abstract": "Accurate measurement of serum testosterone (T) is essential for proper diagnosis of androgen deficiency. There are now several modern assay technologies, including automated ones, for measurement of T. In this study, we compared analytical performance of five modern immunoassay technologies commonly used for measurement of total T: Vitros ECi (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics; normal range (n.r.) 4.6–34 nmol/L); Architect (Abbott Laboratories; n.r. 9.7–34 nmol/L); Access (Beckman Coulter; n.r. 5.3–23 nmol/L); Delfia (Perkin-Elmer; n.r. 9.3–34 nmol/L); and manual EIA DRG kits (n.r. 8.3–42 nmol/L), with the classical RIA (3H–T), after extraction (n.r. 11–33 nmol/L), as a reference method. Total T was measured using all above-mentioned methods in serum samples from 100 male patients, aged 16–65 years. Mean T concentrations in these 100 serum samples assayed by all non-isotopic methods were statistically significantly higher than those obtained by RIA. Delfia showed the highest T levels (19.3 nmol/L versus 12.1 nmol/L by RIA) with a positive bias 60–100%. Almost similar results were obtained using Architect, with a positive bias 40–70%. The closest correlation in results was found between Vitros ECi and RIA (12.7 nmol/L versus 12.1 nmol/L). In the studied samples, the median of differences ranged from minimal (−0.4 nmol/L for Vitros ECi) to maximal (−7.25 nmol/L for Delfia). For all non-isotopic methods, with the exception of Vitros ECi, differences in subjects with low T level (<10 nmol/L) were statistically significantly larger than in the subjects with high T (T > 10 nmol/L). All other methods showed different degrees of dissimilarities with the RIA, especially in the range of low testosterone concentrations, which is of importance in the clinical assessment of women and pubertal boys.",

    "abstract": "The Aging Males' Symptoms scale (AMS) is an internationally used scale to analyse health related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of this paper is to provide evidence that the Nigerian AMS scale measures HRQoL with similar accuracy as in other language versions. We also intended to show the severity of complaints of aging in males in advanced old age. More generally, we aim to demonstrate that the Nigerian AMS scale is an applicable, validated, sensitive instrument to measure HRQoL in Nigeria.We performed a representative survey in Nigeria to get data of the AMS scale in a group of males in old age. The survey was a household-based population sample conducted in March 2006. The Nigerian data were compared with existing data from other European countries. Only community-based data were used for this comparison.The internal structure of the AMS (factorial analysis) was sufficiently similar with the comparison group of other countries in Europe to conclude that the scale really measures the same phenomenon. The sub-scores and total score correlations were high (0.8-0.9) but lower among the sub-scales (0.4-0.8). This suggests that the domains are not fully independent. The reliability (consistency) was found to be good and almost identical with European countries. Mean scores of the Nigerian AMS did systematically differ from data of other European studies. There were much higher because of older age. The same applies for the population reference values obtained in Nigeria. It is the first time that population norm values are available for very old age.The Nigerian AMS scale is a standardized HRQoL scale that showed good psychometric characteristics (reliability, validity) similar to other international versions. We suggest that the results obtained with the Nigerian AMS scale should be used preliminarily as reference for 'norm values' for highest age, i.e. in absence of other data. Confirmation in future studies is needed.",

Hence, this study explored the relationship between environmental stressors covering adverse weather conditions as well as key socioeconomic and political events and fluctuations in the oldest old mortality rates in Hong Kong during the period 1977 to 2006. The oldest old mortality rates in Hong Kong were observed to have a likelihood of being associated with these environmental stressors. Furthermore, men appeared to be more susceptible to these risk factors than did women. More care and attention should be given to the oldest old men, in particular, during periods of socioeconomic or political upheavals.

However, the report concerning the clinical outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP) in the low incidence Asian population is still limited. We aimed to compare the clinical outcome in patient treated with RP among different ethnic groups and to identify significant prognostic factors in Taiwanese patients.Methods. A total of 341 patients with clinical localized prostate cancer undergoing curative RP in three medical centers in Taiwan were included in this study. Ethnic group comparison was performed using the CaPSURE, SEARCH databases from United States (US) and one large European series. The Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard model were used to identify significant predictors for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence.Results. Compared to the Caucasian white population in the US and Europe studies, the Taiwanese population have higher age at surgery and higher pre-operative PSA level. With mean and median follow-up of 39.1 months and 31.0 months (range 5–120 months), 127 men (37.2%) had PSA recurrence which was significant higher than the Western series. Significant predictors for PSA recurrence identified in the post-operative overall model were PSA level, pathological Gleason Score, pathological tumor stage and lymph node metastasis.Conclusions. The clinical outcome of Taiwanese male with prostate cancer post-RP appears inferior to the Western country, which is largely due to delay surgery at higher PSA level. Earlier diagnosis and treatment may improve the cancer control of RP.",

Although the role of nutritional deficiency in the development of age-related frailty was suggested long ago, research conducted in this area is relatively recent. The critical role of micronutrients in this context suggests the need to improve the quality of food eaten by elderly people whereas quantity of food appears to be less relevant.

Overall, 100 (13.4%) participants reported to be sexually inactive in previous 6 months. Older age, lower education levels, loss of a partner, erectile dysfunction, and increased number of comorbidities were found to be independent predictors for sexual inactivity. In conclusion, most middle-aged and elderly Taiwanese men remain sexually active. In addition to erectile dysfunction and loss of a partner, lower education levels and increased number of comorbidities were found to be predictors for sexual inactivity. Further research would need to elucidate whether improvement of those factors could help to preserve sexual activity.",

Factor analysis was performed on each questionnaire to clarify the LOH-related factors. Correlational analysis between the subscale scores representing such factors and the serum hormone profiles was also performed.Factor analysis of the JAMQ revealed an internal structure consisting of three subgroups: somatic, psychological and sexual factors with good categorization of the indicators to the appropriate subgroup. In contrast, the indicators of the AMS showed incomplete conformity to the subgroups of the JAMQ. Correlational analysis showed that each score on the JAMQ subgroups had the highest coefficient of correlation with the corresponding AMS subgroup (p < 0.001). There was no significant association between total and free serum testosterone levels and the total and subscale scores on either AMS or JAMQ.The results of factor analysis suggest that the sexual perceptions of Japanese populations might differ from those of Caucasian populations.

This possibly suggests how calcium is linked to prostate cancer development through its link with the reproductive system. We studied serum calcium and sex steroid hormones in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).Methods: Serum calcium and sex steroid hormones were measured for 1262 men in NHANES III. We calculated multivariable-adjusted geometric means of serum concentrations of total and estimated free testosterone and estradiol, androstanediol glucuronide (AAG), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) by categories of calcium (lowest 5% [<1.16 mmol/L], mid 90%, top 5% [≥1.30 mmol/L]).Results: Levels of total and free testosterone, total estradiol or AAG did not differ across categories of serum calcium. Adjusted SHBG concentrations were 36.4 for the bottom 5%, 34.2 for the mid 90% and 38.9 nmol/L for the top 5% of serum calcium (Ptrend = 0.006), free estradiol levels were 0.88, 0.92 and 0.80 pg/ml (Ptrend = 0.048).Conclusions: This link between calcium and sex steroid hormones, in particular the U-shaped pattern with SHBG, may, in part, explain why observational studies have found a link between serum calcium and risk of prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is one of the most common diseases affecting elderly persons. Male patients with osteoporosis have rarely been the focus of earlier studies. This study explores health related quality of life (HRQoL) indicators in a sample of German male patients with osteoporosis to determine potential avenues for clinical practice changes.This cross-sectional study describes two HRQoL indicators (EQ5D and QUALEFFO-41) in a sample of male patients being treated for osteoporosis. Questionnaires were sent to all male patients being treated at the Dresden University Hospital outpatient endocrine clinic. Of the 344 patients invited to participate in the study 155 (57.2%) were included.Overall HRQoL EQ-5D-scores for male patients with osteoporosis were greater than those of comparable groups of the German population. Patients with ≥2 fractures had the highest level of impairment in HRQoL. Of all the dimensions of EQ-5D-scores, pain/discomfort was the most affected. Better HRQoL (median values <10.0/QUALEFFO-41 scores) were detected in the whole sample for jobs around the house, activities of daily living and mobility compared to other dimensions. The highest levels of impairment were observed in the QUALEFFO-41 domains of general health perception, mental function and pain.This analysis confirms the association between number of fractures and worse estimation of HRQoL in male patients. Because men are 3 times less likely to suffer from osteoporosis than women, the specific HRQoL characteristics of male patients with this disease can often be overlooked. Clinicians should consider mental health referral especially for osteoporotic male patients having experienced ≥2 fractures.",

The vertebral body was cut into two halves along the median sagittal plane, keeping the upper and lower end plates of each half, which were subsequently used for biomechanical, morphological and density experiments. From the age of 20–29 to 30–39 years, both the horizontal trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and vertical Tb.Th decreased; the horizontal and vertical Tb.Sp increased; the plate-like trabecular Tb.Th decreased; the apparent density and volume ratio decreased; and the elastic modulus and the ultimate stress decreased; with all changes being statistically significant (p < 0.01). Similar trends were obtained from ages 40–49 to 50–59, although the changes were not significant (p > 0.05), except for the reduction in ultimate stress (p < 0.05). With aging, the collagen cross-linking capacity declined; the thicknesses of the collagen fibrils were variable, ranging from almost the same to loose, sparse or disordered thickness; and the finer collagen fibrils between the thick filaments were disorganized. In males aged from 20 to 59 years old, the horizontal and vertical Tb.Th and the plate-like Tb.Th of the vertebral body decreased, while the horizontal and vertical Tb.Sp increased. Additionally, the density, elastic modulus and the ultimate stress of the cancellous bone decreased with age. Thus, the associated changes of bone microstructure, density and biomechanics with age may lead to an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture.",

Eight hundred and seventy subjects from 259 outpatient units scheduled to visit the clinic six times were included. Effectiveness and tolerability of TU administration were assessed on a 4-point scale. Body weight, waist girth, blood pressure, hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and digital rectal prostate examination were assessed. Over 90% of subjects completed the observational duration of 52.8 ± 9.7 weeks (mean ± SD) and 56% judged effectiveness as very good, 30.8% as good. 63.1% judged tolerability as very good, and 24.4% as good. No adverse effects on indicators of cardiovascular risk were observed. Polycythemia occurred in one subject and a supranormal hematocrit in one subject. Four subjects developed supranormal PSA levels. Prostate carcinoma was found in one subject, one subject had recurrence of a previously surgically treated prostate carcinoma, and the other two showed no indication of malignancy.

Patients who are not fit for surgery often undergo aspiration and sclerotherapy of the hydrocele. There is a range of sclerosing agents used in the literature. I performed a literature search to assess whether one sclerosant was better than the others. STDS is the sclerosing agent with the best cure rate after a single injection and low side effect rates. The cure rates of sodium tetradecyl sulphate (STDS) after a single aspiration and injection were 76%. After multiple treatments 94% achieved a cure. Patient satisfaction rates at mean 40 months were 95%. Complication rates were generally low and much lower than surgical repair. Aspiration and sclerotherapy have a role in treating symptomatic hydroceles. This literature review shows that this is over and above its current use in the UK, where it is used for patients unfit for general anaesthetic. If the patients are carefully selected for this procedure, they can have a good outcome and avoid the higher complication rate and longer recovery rates of surgical repair. Patients should be counselled about aspiration and sclerotherapy as part of the informed consent process.",

    "abstract": "Male obesity is known to be associated with hypogonadism, which can be reverted after surgical weight reduction. However, the evidence about how rapidly this effect rises after surgery and what consequences each procedure have on prostate function and prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) concentration is scarce. So, we evaluated total testosterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and PSA plasma levels in a group of 29 Caucasian obese men (BMI - 43.4 ± 8.5 kg/m2) before and one month after sleeve gastrectomy. 19 lean healthy male subjects were considered as controls. As expected, obese patients showed a high prevalence of hypogonadism (51.6%) at baseline, with reduced total testosterone compared to lean controls (10.8 ± 3.5 vs 15.7 ± 4.2 nmol/l, p < .01), higher estradiol (124.4 ± 46.5 vs 78.7 ± 39.6 pmol/l, p < .01), lower luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone (3.6 ± 1.3 and 2.5 ± 0.9 vs 5.2 ± 2.4 and 5.9 ± 3.8 U/L, respectively, p < .05) plasma levels. One month after surgery, patients showed a significant body weight reduction (-17.2 ± 6.7 kg) with increased total testosterone (from 10.8 ± 3.5 to 18.9 ± 4.9 nmol/l, p < .001), reduced estradiol (from 124.4 ± 46.5 to 96.1 ± 34.3 pmol/l, p < .05) and increased PSA (from 0.74 ± 0.38 to 1.0 ± 0.51 μg/l, p < .001). These results confirm that hypogonadism is highly prevalent in obese males, but they also show that it can be early reversed after sleeve gastrectomy, further confirming the strong indication to surgery of hypogonadal patients with severely reduced quality of life. Higher testosterone levels may be responsible for the increase of PSA observed after surgery; however, PSA concentration has to be monitored over time to avoid underrating of potential severe prostate diseases.",

In Group1 (n = 21) routine COPD medical treatment plus kinesiotaping and in Group2 (n = 21) only routine COPD medical treatment was given. KT was changed on every fifth day (for a total of three times and 15 days). The patients were assessed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for difficulty experienced by the patients during respiration, respiratory function test (RFT), modified medical research council (mMRC) dyspnea scale and beck depression inventory (BDI). The data were obtained before treatment and posttreatment.Results In Group 1; statistically significant improvement was found in all parameters except for FVC and FVC % following treatment compared to pretreatment values. Comparison of the difference scores (the amount of recovery between posttreatment and pretreatment) of the two groups showed significantly superior improvement in Group1 for all parameters except for FVC, FVC % and FEV1% following the treatment (p < .05).Conclusions The results of this study showed that supplementary kinesiotaping improved respiratory function and depression significantly compared to only routine medical treatment in COPD patients who were in stable condition.",

However, the relationship between resistance exercise and the level of insulin-like growth factor 1 in the serum is conflicting. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship.Methods A systematic literature search up to May 2020 was performed and 22 studies were detected with 680 subjects. They reported relationships between resistance exercise and the level of insulin-like growth factor 1 in the serum. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated comparing the resistance exercise and the level of insulin-like growth factor 1 in the serum using the continuous method with a random or fixed-effect model.Results Significantly higher insulin-like growth factor 1 was observed in subjects performing resistance training for less than 16 weeks (OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 2.49–5.57, p<.001); subjects performing resistance training for more than 16 weeks (OR, 11.55; 95% CI, 6.58–16.52, p<.001); subjects older than 60 years (OR, 11.88; 95% CI, 9.84–13.93, p<.001); females (OR, 3.87; 95% CI, 2.26–5.49, p<.001) and males (OR, 16.82; 95% CI, 7.29–26.35, p<.001). However, significantly lower insulin-like growth factor 1 was observed in subjects younger than 60 years (OR, −4.80; 95% CI, −7.74 to −1.86, p=.001).Conclusions However, the resistance exercise significantly increases insulin-like growth factor 1 in subjects older than 60 years, both males and females, and subjects performing resistance exercise for all any period. Surprisingly, resistance exercise significantly decreases insulin-like growth factor 1 in subjects younger than 60 years. This relationship forces us to recommend the resistance exercise to improve insulin-like growth factor 1 in serum.",

In the men with MetS, HT, overweight and obesity, the concentration of TT was lower than in the men without these problems. We found statistically significant positive correlations (DHEAS– total cholesterol [TCh], DHEAS– low-density lipoprotein [LDL], TT– high-density lipoprotein [HDL], TT–waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]) and negative correlations (DHEAS–age, TT–body weight, TT– body mass index [BMI], TT–abdominal circumference [AC], TT–hip circumference [HC], TT– triglyceride [TG], TT– fasting plasma glucose [FPG], TT– serum insulin levels [I], TT– Homeostasis Model Assessment–Insulin Resistance [HOMA–IR]). Using logistic regression it was ascertained that lower TT levels increase the risk of HT, and were also associated with obesity.Conclusion: Our research indicates relationships between TT and the occurrence of MetS and its individual components. Excess body weight in men is a factor associated with lower TT levels. It seems necessary to determine TT in men with MetS and overweight or obesity. DHEAS did not show any significant relations with MetS and its parameters. Age was the most crucial factor responsible for the decrease in DHEAS.",

Urodynamic parameters were obtained, such as Uroflowmetry, those of Filling Cystometry and those of pressure flow study (PFS).Mean age was of 66.1 years old. Most the patients included in the analysis were categorized as Schafer score 2-4. Correlation analysis of uroflowmetry parameters revealed statistically significant decrease in voided volume (p = 0.013), Qmax (p = 0.023) with aging. Cystometric parameters revealed significant age-related decrease in bladder capacity (p < 0.001) and bladder compliance (p = 0.004).

    "abstract": "A substantial proportion of men with prostatic disease have an increased risk of bone loss. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Rubus coreanus Miquel (RCM) extracts on osteoporosis that occurs with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced prostatic hyperplasia. The rats used in this study were categorized into groups of healthy controls, rats treated with MNU, and rats treated with MNU and RCM. The rats were sacrificed after 10 weeks of RCM treatment, after which ultrasonography, serum biochemical tests, histopathological examinations, immunohistochemical analysis, and semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis were performed. There were no marked differences in body weight gain and the size and weight of the prostate gland between the MNU group and the MNU and RCM group. However, treatment with RCM inhibited osteoclastic osteolysis and reduced dysplastic progress in the prostate gland, as observed by histopathological evaluation and by analyzing changes in the levels of bone regulatory factors. In addition, the group treated with MNU and RCM had higher expression levels of cannabinoid receptors-1, -2, and osteoprotegerin. These results indicate that the anti-osteoporotic effect of RCM in prostatic hyperplasia is attributable to the cannabinoid receptor-related upregulation of osteoblastogenesis and inhibition of prostatic hyperplasia. The results of the present study suggest that treatment with RCM may benefit osteoporotic patients with prostatic disease by simultaneously altering the activation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts.",

A total of 825 adult males aged 40 years or above were surveyed, and observed that 80% of the population was living with little-to-mild levels of aging symptoms with mean total scores ranged between 26.02 ± 7.91 and 32.99 ± 7.91 in different age groups. Such symptoms were correlated with age, especially for the somato-vegetative and sexual symptoms. The most severe AMS symptoms were observed in the oldest age group at 70 years or above, with 76%, 34% and 70% living with moderate-to-severe levels of somato-vegetative, psychological and sexual symptoms, respectively. The result was highly correlated with the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Secondly, the Hong Kong Aging males' symptoms (AMS) scale was shown to have good reliability with test-retest coefficient at 0.79 (ranged 0.66-0.87) and Cronbach's alpha coefficient at 0.88 (ranged 0.70-0.84). In summary, the population of Hong Kong male adults was commonly living with little-to-mild levels of aging symptoms, whereas their severity was correlated with age.",

DNA from tumor tissue and from blood leukocytes was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and ATP6 and ND3 were sequenced. We included 77 men: 20 had normal BMI, 38 were overweight and 19 had obesity; ages ranged from 52 to 83. After sequencing ATP6 and ND3, from DNA obtained from leukocytes and tumor tissue, we did not find any somatic mutations. All changes observed, in both genes, were polymorphisms. In ATP6 we identified, in six patients, two non-synonymous nucleotide changes and in ND3 we observed that twelve patients presented non-synonymous polymorphisms. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first report where the complete sequences of the ATP6 and ND3 have been analyzed in Mexican–Mestizo men with prostate cancer and diverse BMI. Our results differ with those reported in Caucasian populations, possibly due to ethnic differences.",

With the increase in aging male population, life span in Iran, and focus on quality of life, andropause will become a major health issue that needs to be addressed in order to prevent disability. General practitioners, as the first level of health care providers, are in the best position to assess their knowledge and attitude about andropause period, so a structured instrument is necessary to assess them. This study aimed at the assessment of the validity and reliability of the self-made questionnaire on knowledge and attitude of general practitioners about andropause.Method: This is a descriptive study done on 402 general physicians working in public and private sectors. The instrument used was a self-administered questionnaire that was developed based on the literature review and recourses available on andropause and was designed to find out the level of knowledge and attitude of andropause. In order to determine the content and face validity of the questionnaire, judgments of experts were used. Cronbach's coefficient was used to determine the reliability of the questionnaire. SPSS 18 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was used to analyze the data.Results: Content and face validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by experts. The reliability was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha of (0).895 for the part on knowledge and (0).839 for the part on attitude.Conclusion: Based on the results of the study, this questionnaire had appropriate validity and reliability to assess the knowledge and attitude of general practitioners about andropause.",

Total testosterone determination misdiagnosed hypogonadism in 8.4% (12/143) of men with sexual symptoms and in 2% (3/152) with infertility. In subjects with borderline total testosterone, only 24.7% (19/77) had hypogonadism confirmed by free testosterone levels. Free testosterone levels significantly correlated with age, haematocrit, gonadotropins, gynecomastia, BMI, and number of co-morbidities, whereas total testosterone associated only with the latter two. Furthermore, age, haematocrit, BMI, and the presence of erectile dysfunction and of low libido were significantly different between men with normal and low free testosterone, whereas only BMI and low libido were significantly different between patients with normal and low total testosterone.Routine assessment of free testosterone allows a more accurate diagnosis of functional hypogonadism, especially in men with sexual symptoms. Free testosterone levels associate with clinical and biochemical parameters of androgen deficiency better than total testosterone levels.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, there has been a significant augmentation in the corpus of evidence pertaining to functional hypogonadism. Despite this, prevailing clinical guidelines continue to advise against the universal screening for hypogonadism in middle-aged and elderly males.Numerous randomized controlled trials have scrutinized the effects of testosterone therapy in males afflicted with type 2 diabetes and/or obesity. However, these guidelines uniformly assert that lifestyle modifications and weight reduction should be the primary intervention strategies in overweight and obese males, relegating testosterone therapy to a secondary, selective option. It is extensively documented that testosterone therapy can yield substantial improvements in various metabolic parameters as well as ameliorate symptoms of erectile dysfunction. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of testosterone therapy in reversing type 2 diabetes in males with low-normal testosterone levels who are at elevated risk for this condition, in comparison to the outcomes achievable through lifestyle modifications alone.This focused review article aims to present a comprehensive update on the latest data concerning the innovative aspects of testosterone therapy in males with functional hypogonadism, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes and/or obesity. Additionally, it will delve into the cardiovascular safety of such interventions within this high-risk demographic, with a special emphasis on insights gleaned from the TRAVERSE trial.",

There was a weak but significant correlation of the levels of inhibin B with age (r = 0.064, p < 0.05). A significant negative correlation of FSH and inhibin B was documented in all age groups (r = -0.423, p < 0.01). Also, the LH levels increased significantly with low inhibin B levels (r = -0.289, p < 0.01). Testosterone levels showed no significant correlation with inhibin B. We conclude from our study that Sertoli cell function as documented by serum levels of inhibin B is stable throughout life. In addition, the ongoing correlation of FSH and inhibin levels also indicates no significant decline of Sertoli cell function in the aging male.",

    "abstract": "The sex difference in cardiovascular morbidity is traditionally ascribed to the effects of testosterone on the lipid profile. Epidemiological studies show, however, that men with cardiovascular disease have low rather than high circulating testosterone. The factor responsible for both the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and the low testosterone might be visceral obesity. Men and women differ in their pattern of fat distribution. Women have predominantly gluteofemoral fat depots and men preferential abdominal/visceral depots. In puberty testosterone favors abdominal/visceral fat deposition. Visceral fat has a high metabolic turnover and the free fatty acids drain on the portal vein. With a large visceral fat depot the liver is flooded with free fatty acids inducing high levels of triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, impairment of insulin metabolism and reducing insulin sensitivity. These factors contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes type II. High insulin levels suppress sex hormone-binding globulin thus lowering circulating testosterone. The fat cell produces leptin signalling to the brain to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. High leptin levels suppress testosterone. Some studies suggest that testosterone supplementation reduces visceral obesity and improves cardiovascular risks but more evidence is needed.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population – are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint.",

    "abstract": "Deficiencies of anabolic hormones are common in men with heart failure (HF). It remains unclear whether the deranged metabolism of these hormones is the pathophysiological element of HF itself or is the consequence of co-morbidities or/and treatment in HF.We examined 382 men with systolic HF. Serum hormones (i.e. total testosterone [TT], DHEAS, IGF-1) were assessed using immunoassays, serum free testosterone (eFT) - using the Vermeulen equation.Prevalence of TT and eFT deficiencies was similar in men with HF aged < versus ≥60 years (23% and 32% for TT and eFT deficiencies). Deficiencies in DHEAS and IGF-1 were more common in younger (63% and 92%) than older patients (48% and 73%). In men <60 years, TT deficiency was accompanied by the therapy with digoxin, eFT deficiency - the therapy with digoxin and the presence of diabetes, DHEAS deficiency - the therapy with loop diuretic (all p < 0.05). In men ≥60 years, TT deficiency - the therapy with loop diuretic, DHEAS deficiency - the therapy with spironolactone and digoxin, and hsCRP, IGF-1 deficiency - the high hsCRP (all p < 0.05).Deficiencies in anabolic hormones are common in younger and older men with HF. Some therapies (but not major co-morbidities) may contribute to anabolic deficiencies.",

The survey consisted of questions associated with present physical and mental status and desire to resume ART. The Aging male's symptoms (AMS) scale, IIEF-5 and SF-36 were also evaluated at pre-initiation, termination of ART and the time of the survey.The mean duration from the last treatment was 55 months. Compared with the treatment period, more than half of patients (57.5%) answered that their present condition was better. Scores on the AMS scale, IIEF and SF-36 were all improved significantly in the early stages of treatment and not worsened a long period of time after ART was discontinued.For symptomatic Japanese hypogonadal patients, subjective effects of treatment were observed during the early treatment period and remained unchanged after discontinuation of ART. A short treatment period may thus be adequate in Japanese hypogonadal patients as regards symptomatic changes.",

To eliminate the influence of age on BP, subjects were initially grouped in each age stratum.

Finally, all the low-tertile subgroups in each age stratum were gathered to form Group-1. Similarly, Group-2 (middle-tertile) and Group-3 (high-tertile) were also created. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was regarded as having risks for future CVD and diabetes.Age, waist circumstance (WC), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and log triglyceride (TG) were independently and significantly correlated with SBP by multiple linear regression analysis. On the other hand, logistic regression showed that Group-3 had significant higher odds ratios (ORs) for having abnormal WC, FPG and TG. In addition, Group-3 presented a 1.55-fold OR (p < 0.001) for having MetS than Group-1.In normotensive older men, the risk for having MetS was significantly associated with higher SBP.

Since it is known that EPCs express a testosterone receptor, we wanted to assess the prevalence of testosterone deficiency in patients with CHF and its impact on circulating EPCs. Methods: 137 male patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) were included (age 61 ± 13 years; BMI 29 ± 5 kg/m2; New York Heart Association classification (NYHA) I: n = 47, NYHA II: n = 51, NYHA III: n = 39). Numbers of different populations of circulating EPCs were quantified using flow cytometry. Levels of free testosterone and EPC-regulating cytokines were determined using ELISA. Results: The prevalence of testosterone deficiency in our University CHF clinic was 39%. However, there was no difference between patients with and without testosterone deficiency regarding their levels of EPCs. Testosterone levels were inversely correlated with age (R2 = −0.32, p = 0.001) and NYHA status (R2 = 0.28, p = 0.001) and correlated with cardiorespiratory capacity (R2 = 0.26, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Testosterone deficiency is frequent in male patients with CHF but does not appear to impact the regenerative EPCs.",

However, resistance to enzalutamide invariably develops.Methods: To understand the underlying mechanisms of resistance to enzalutamide, we performed integrative analysis on multiple transcriptome datasets to identify those genes constantly up- or down-regulated in response to enzalutamide treatment.Results: There were 703 and 581 differentially expressed genes derived from enzalutamide-sensitive and -resistant cell lines, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis on these genes demonstrated that biological processes of cell proliferation and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathway are specifically disturbed in sensitive cell lines but not resistant ones. Such divergence explained why enzalutamide ineffective for resistant prostate cancer.Conclusions: Taken together, the present study revealed a set of critical genes, which can provide etiologic clues as to enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer and guide novel therapeutic approaches.",

The objective of this study was to examine the application of multivariate longitudinal models in SIRT6, FBS, and BMI analysis in the elderly men after eight weeks concurrent training with supplementation of l-arginine (l-Arg).Methods: Thirty two elderly men with mean age of 63.09 ± 3.71 years were randomly divided into four equal-sized groups (each n = 8); Exercise + supplement (ES) group; exercise + placebo (EP) group; supplement (S) group and control (C) group. The ES and EP groups performed the eight weeks of concurrent training, three sessions per week. Group ES and group S consumed 1000 mg of l-Arg per day at 8:00 pm. Measurements of biochemical variables were done by ELISA Reader method. For analytical purposes, we used the paired sample t-test and multivariate longitudinal modeling with generalized estimating equation (GEE) methodology. All analyses have been implemented in R-3.4.1. p Values less than .05 were considered statistically significant.Results: With respect to significant association between sirt6, FBS, and BMI, this study showed that synergy effect of training and supplementation was greater than the sum of their individual effects on SIRT6 (β = 0.79, p < .001), FBS (β = −5.56, p = .022), and BMI (β = −3.89; p = .041). Also exercise alone had a significantly larger effect than supplementation alone on responses.Conclusions: It can be concluded that the joint usage of concurrent training and supplement of l-Arg for elderly men could improve the metabolism and body composition.",

Stalwart findings are a decline in T during the day, decline with obesity, and decline with advancing age. Here seven previously reported correlations are tested among older American men in the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), their salivary T measured by enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Few significant correlations are found, with most tests producing weak or null results. These findings, overall, suggest that T does not \"work\" much among older men. However, a threat to this conclusion is raised by Welker et al. namely that EIA of salivary T may contain large errors, invalidating the tests. To check this possibility, these correlations from the literature were tested among older British men whose salivary T was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), a technique noted for its specificity. Not all could be tested, but the relationships of T with age, obesity, and health are significant among British men, indicating that T remains active in older men, and throwing doubt on the adequacy of EIA for measuring salivary T.",

We analyzed patient’s characteristics, doses of midazolam, and lidocaine used, regions of lymph node biopsies, and complications. Also, functionality and general physical status of patients over 65 years of age were evaluated.Results During study period 132 cases of EBUS-TBNA were evaluated. 39 (29.5%) cases were aged 70 years, and over. There were more comorbidities in older group. Performance status of older group was worse. Furthermore, when evaluated according to American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), the older group was found to be composed of the riskier patients. When patients aged between 65 and 69, and over 70 compared, older patient’s Barthel, EQ 5-D, SGA, and G8 scores were found to be worse. Despite that, there was no difference in the frequency, and types of complications between both groups. Diagnostic performance was not different between age groups.Conclusions Independent from comorbidities, general health status, and functionality EBUS-TBNA procedure in 70-year-old and over patients is a safe minimally invasive procedure.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study investigated the efficacy of 5-year testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) on lipid profile and glucose tolerance in Japanese hypogonadal men.Methods: Fourteen patients, who received continuous TRT for 5 years, and 22 controls with 5-year observations were enrolled. The patients in the TRT group had received intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate (250 mg) every month for 5 years. We collected the following data: blood pressure, fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-Chol values, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) level at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 5-years from initial intervention. These data were compared between the two groups.Results: There were no statistically significant differences in any other baseline characteristic, excluding SBP, between the two groups. FBS was significantly improved at 3- and 5-year visits in the TRT group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the HbA1c level and TG value demonstrated a significant decrease at 1-, 3-, and 5-years in the TRT group. However, no significant difference in changes to PSA levels from baseline in both groups was observed.Conclusions: Five-year TRT could improve FBS, HbA1c, and TG levels among Japanese hypogonadal men with no significant increase in PSA.",

The meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3.Results We identified eight relevant studies involving a total of 1032 patients. We found that patients that underwent TURBT + TURP exhibited significantly lower recurrence rates [odds ratio (OR), 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.53–0.93; p = .01] and increased maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax) (WMD, 5.92; 95% CI, 4.67–7.16; p < .001) compared with patients that underwent TURBT-only. However, rates of recurrence at the prostatic urethra/bladder neck and bladder tumor progression, as well as the time to recurrence did not differ significantly between these two groups.Conclusions Simultaneous TURBT + TURP can be safely performed in patients with NMIBC and BPH and improves patient quality of life, without any risk of increasing tumor recurrence or metastasis rates. Comprehensive RCTs are needed to confirm the results of this study.",

Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were used to analyze study data.Results: Of these patients, 55.2% had mild-to-moderate periodontitis and 44.8% had severe periodontitis. The severity of periodontal disease was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidity, the number of comorbidities, age, gender, income level, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Patients with severe periodontitis were more likely being a current smoker, to report drinking alcohol sometimes or every day, to be a male, to have a pulmonary disease, to have an endocrinological and metabolic disorder, to have a cardiovascular disorder and to have a neurological disorder than those with mild/moderate periodontitis. Having a hematological disorder, having a muscle, skeletal and connective tissue disorder, to be a current smoker and lower age were found to be predictors of moderate periodontitis whereas being a female and lower number of comorbidities were predictors of mild periodontitis.Conclusions: The severity of periodontitis was associated with socio-demographic, behavioral, and comorbidity characteristics of periodontal patients.",

Ear diagnosis was conducted in three ways: inspection, electrical skin resistance measurement, and tenderness testing.Results: Quality of life was lower among the LUTS+ve cases than among the LUTS−ve cases. The tenderness and electrical conductivity of a number of auricular points, including the \"angle of superior concha\", the \"urinary bladder\", the \"ureter\", the \"kidney\", the \"urethra\", and the \"internal genitals\" were associated with LUTS in the Chinese aging males. In terms of electrical conductivity, the \"angle of superior concha\" on both ears exhibited the highest sensitivity among the other auricular points under testing. This auricular point also demonstrated considerable sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values for both ears during the tenderness testing.Conclusions: Auricular diagnosis has a pre-diagnostic value and could be considered as a screening method for the aging population with relatively high LUTS risk.",

In multivariable logistic regression models, significant inverse associations were found between modifiable lifestyle factors – both underweight and overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, smoking and high alcohol consumption – and \"good health\". Low-risk alcohol intake and living with a partner were positively associated with \"good health\". Sexual activity was also positively associated with \"good health\" (p < 0.001) with elevated odds ratios (ORs) for each category of frequency of sexual activity (1–4, 5–8, 9–12 or 12+ times in the past 4 weeks) relative to zero frequency (ORs 1.68 to 2.16).Conclusion: This study suggests that sexual activity is an important correlate of retaining good health in middle- and older-aged men, independent of other behavioral determinants.",

Treatment options for PPUI include conservative care like Pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME), which is a physiotherapy performed by the patients themselves; Pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT), a physiotherapy performed under the guidance of a therapist, and duloxetine treatment; and surgical interventions. In this study, network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed for direct comparison of these treatment options.Materials and Methods The NMA pooled the odds ratios and 95% credible intervals using the number of patients achieving urinary continence and the total number of patients in an intention-to-treat population. The treatments were ranked based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probabilities and the rankograms.Results The pooled overall ORs of patients achieving urinary continence compared with no treatment was 1.73 (95% CrI: 0.657, 4.71) in PFME, 2.62 (95% CrI: 0.553, 13.5) in PFME plus Duloxetine, and 4.05 (95% CrI: 1.70, 10.2) in PFMT. The SUCRA values of ranking probabilities for each treatment showed high rates of continence in the order of PFMT, PFME plus Duloxetine, and PFME.Conclusion The results suggest that patients with PPUI should undergo PFMT and consider duloxetine as an additional treatment option.",

CAG repeat length ranged from 14 to 39, with the highest proportion of CAG repeat number at 21 repeats(16.4%). In a multivariable model, using men with CAG repeat numbers of 22-23 as the reference, men with a lower number of CAG repeats(<22) showed a trend for a higher mortality in the follow-up period (HR 1.46 (0.75, 2.81)) as did men with higher number of repeats (>23) (1.37 (0.65, 2.91)).Our data suggest that CAG repeat number may partially influence the risk of mortality in men. Further larger studies are required to quantify the effect.",

    "abstract": "Background Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a relatively rare type of mesenchymal neoplasm that occurs most frequently in the pleura. However, SFT originating from the prostate is particularly uncommon and only approximately 39 cases were reported before. Herein, we reported a rare case of a patient diagnosed with prostate SFT and presented a literature review.Case presentation: A 50-year-old Asian with irritative urinary symptoms was admitted to our hospital and almost all the evidence indicated that benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) caused his symptoms. Therefore, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) was performed, but histopathological and Immunohistochemical (IHC) assessments showed that spindle cells arranged disorderly in the TURP specimen with a cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) highly expressed and SFT was diagnosed. Finally, the patient underwent a radical prostatectomy and there was no disease progression observed thereafter.Conclusions Prostate SFT is extremely rare, and to our knowledge, this is the first case of prostate SFT that is difficult to differentiate from small volume BPH. IHC examinations are of great diagnostic value. Radical resection of the tumor appears to be the most effective method at present and continuous follow-up is highly recommended.",

    "abstract": "Aging in healthy men is accompanied by a progressive decline of gonadal function with, in particular, a decline of Leydig cell function and decreased testosterone production. Population means for total serum testosterone decrease by about 30% between the ages of 25 and 75 years. Over the same period, mean serum levels of free or bioavailable testosterone decrease by as much as 50%. The decline of Leydig cell function in aging is the consequence of primary testicular changes, with decreased numbers of Leydig cells, and alterations in neuroendocrine regulation of the pituitary secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH), with an inappropriately low LH drive in the face of a persistent relative hypoandrogenism. The changes in neuroendocrine regulation of LH secretion are situated primarily at the hypothalamic level with, in particular, an increased sensitivity to the negative feedback effects of sex steroids. The testicular changes and the altered regulation of LH secretion are accompanied by an independent, age-associated increase of serum sex hormone binding globulin levels, which explains the steeper decline of serum bioavailable testosterone levels as compared to total serum testosterone levels. More limited information indicates that global Sertoli cell function and spermatogenesis are relatively well preserved in elderly men, although this appears to require increased follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) drive to compensate for primary testicular changes. Thus, whereas aging is accompanied by testicular changes affecting both Leydig cells and Sertoli cells, there appears to be a dissociation in neuroendocrine response with deficient LH secretion but appropriately increased FSH release.",

It is based on a qualitative study on perceptions of erectile dysfunction in the Malaysian multicultural society. Six focus groups were conducted, consisting of 69 women, aged between 40 and 70 years, recruited from the general public and who had given informed consent. The findings revealed that the women were aware of erectile dysfunction and Viagra. Due to their concern about the negative aspects of Viagra, the Chinese and Malay traditional methods of treatment were commonly mentioned. The women from three ethnic groups viewed the possibility of their husband starting to take Viagra with lots of suspicion, mistrust and fear. They would prefer their husband discussing with them the issue of resorting to taking Viagra. The Chinese and Indian women perceived that if a man takes Viagra, it will boost his ego and he will feel more manly. Indian women felt that a man taking Viagra is proof of his love for his wife. The Malay women felt that a man would be ashamed and have a low self-esteem if he were to resort to taking Viagra. Although Viagra is meant for the male, understanding of women's perception of it is beneficial for a couple's sexual relationship.",

    "abstract": "Due to a decrease in Leydig cell function, a considerable proportion of men over 50 years of age will develop hypogonadism. Consequently, loss of libido and several other testosterone-dependent symptoms may become evident. When decreased levels of biologically available testosterone are found, and corresponding symptoms are present, these men could be eligible for testosterone substitution therapy. Testosterone treatment in testosterone-deprived men has been shown to improve general well-being, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, libido and - if present - anemia. Despite these positive effects, testosterone treatment has to be performed with caution. Although it has not been proven that elevation of the serum testosterone level to the normal range results in a greater risk of developing prostate cancer, the effects of testosterone on a prostate cancer already present are well established. Several studies have demonstrated that testosterone treatment does not result in a significant increase in serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or prostate volume. The long-term effects, however, are currently unknown. For these reasons, testosterone treatment should be performed only when the presence of prostate cancer is unlikely; i.e. when PSA levels are within normal limits and digital rectal examination does not reveal any suspicious findings. These examinations may still miss some small prostate cancers that could be promoted by testosterone treatment. The determination of PSA levels under testosterone treatment is necessary every 3 months, at least for the first year. Steadily rising PSA levels require immediate cessation of testosterone administration and the initiation of further diagnostic procedures (prostate biopsy), to rule out prostate cancer.",

The primary inclusion criterion was symptomatic testosterone deficiency, as confirmed by laboratory testing (morning total testosterone <12 nmol/L) on two separate occasions. The study was performed in 43 centres in Austria and a dosage of oral testosterone undecanoate of 2×80 mg/day was used for three months. The ADAM questionnaire, the AMS scale and the SF-36 questionnaire were administered by the patients and specific questions were asked to the prescribers.Results. A total of 189 patient report forms and 185 doctor report forms were completed. The average age of the participants was 54.7 ± 12.3 years and average treatment duration was 13.9 ± 2.2 weeks. Serum testosterone level increased by more than 50% from 8.7 ± 4.3 nmol/L to 13.2 ± 6.7 nmol/L (p < 0.001). Treatment improved symptoms on the ADAM and AMS scales, whereas no changes were observed on the SF-36. There were no significant effects on serum PSA levels.Conclusion.

Cancer is a disease associated with the aging population, and as the population ages the incidence of cancer would be expected to rise as well. This in itself poses a great challenge. In addition, the aging population demographics with the projected rise in the numbers of senior citizens, especially the over 80 group in the next decade, poses its own creative challenges to health planners. In Canada, health care is centrally administered, and controlled by the provincial governments of Canada, under the Canada Health Act. The challenge of developing comprehensive programs for the geriatric population requires changes in the care models and care pathways. The patient-centred models that have been adapted require a multidisciplinary approach to the clientele and their families that integrates cancer therapy and geriatric care and realities. This requires changes in the nursing and medical approach, as well as education in the subtleties of the two intersecting medical realities.",

Four years after implementing the MCS, half of the men were still being treated with ADT and the average treatment length doubled.

The aim of this study was to investigate different aspects of the relationship between insomnia and aging symptoms.This cross-sectional study included 231 males from a men's health clinic. Participants completed a set of general data and screening assessments, including the AMS rating scale, insomnia severity index (ISI), Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) and Beck anxiety inventory Chinese version (BAI), to investigate the severity of aging symptoms, insomnia, depression and anxiety.The ISI correlated significantly with the AMS scale, both with (partial correlation coefficient = 0.470) and without (r = 0.580) controlled variances of depression and anxiety. Using linear regression, aging symptoms were statistically predicted by the severity of the ISI, and a substantial proportion of the variance was explained (adjusted R(2) = 0.410). When all variables were included, this proportion rose to 55.3% (adjusted R(2) = 0.553).We suggest that insomnia is a good predictor of aging symptoms across all age groups of men.",

On the other hand, to avoid adverse effects of ART, Kampo medicine (traditional Chinese-Japanese medicine) is often a first choice to treat LOH in Japan. However, their pharmacological studies are few. In this study, castrated mice was used as an LOH animal model for examining the pharmacological effects of a Kampo formula, saikokaryukotsuboreito (shortly SKRBT) on serum testosterone levels and seminal vesicles weights. Furthermore, an attempt to elucidate its pharmacological mechanism, inhibition of SKRBT and its components against aromatase were also examined with the enzyme-based assay. As a result, SKRBT improved significantly both the decline of serum testosterone levels and decrease of seminal vesicles weight of castrated mice at a dose of 125 mg/kg with a non dose-dependent manner. SKRBT and two components Scutellariae radix and Rhei rhizoma exhibited inhibitory activities with the IC(50) values of 145, 29.2 and 29.7 µg/ml, respectively. These results suggested that the aromatase inhibitory activity of SKRBT may contribute, to a different extent, to the improvement of serum testosterone levels.",

This study aimed to evaluate safety, efficacy and acceptance of newly formulated orally disintegrating tamsulosin tablets in Taiwanese patients with LUTS/BPH.This single center, non-comparative, observational study enrolled 45 male patients over age 50 years. All patients received 0.2 mg tamsulosin orally disintegrating tablets daily and were evaluated at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12 of the 12-week treatment period. Tamsulosin efficacy was evaluated by International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) with 7 questions on urinary symptoms and one disease-specific quality-of-life question, with scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 35 (highly symptomatic). Maximum flow rate (ml/s), voided volume (ml), flow time (s), and mean flow rate (ml/s) were measured. Danish prostatic symptom sexual function scale rated severity and associated concerns of erection quality, ejaculatory function and pain/discomfort were also assessed.Patients' mean ± SD age was 62.47 ± 7.77 (range: 50-89) and mean ± SD I-PSS was 13.98 ± 5.50. Statistically significant changes from baseline were found in post-test I-PSS and quality of life (both P < 0.001). Mean ± SD I-PSS decreased from 14.30 ± 9.34 to 6.73 ± 0.88 at patients' final visit. Statistically significant increases in mean maximum flow rate and mean flow rate were found over 12-week study period (P < 0.05). No adverse events were reported. No significant differences were found in pulse, SBP/DBP or sexual function.Orally disintegrating tamsulosin tablets demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy for acceptance and well tolerance by Taiwanese LUTS/BPH patients.",

We set out to study whether hypoandrogenism influences bladder wall cell damage in castrated and senile male rats. Methods: Thirty male Wistar rats were divided into three groups of 10 animals each: group I (3 months old), sham animals; group II (27 months old), senile animals; group III (3 months old), subjected to bilateral orchiectomy, and sacrificed 8 weeks after the procedure. Bladders were excised, weighed and sent for analysis. Stereological assays on collagen fibers and immunohistochemical analysis with active 3-caspase were performed on bladder cells. Results: Bladder weights were greater in the senile group than in the others. Stereological collagen fiber analysis demonstrated higher density in group III than in groups I and II (p < 0.05). The absolute density was 4.15 mm3 in group I, 22.3 mm3 in group II and 19.3 mm3 in group III. Semiquantitative active 3-caspase analysis showed greater percentages in the senile group II than in groups I and III. Conclusions: We can state that low plasma testosterone levels are related to higher collagen fiber density and active 3-caspase percentages in the bladder walls of orchiectomized and senile rats, respectively.",

We aimed to compare STOPP version 2 representing one of the most commonly used excplicit tool with the implicit comprehensive geriatric assessment mediated clinical evaluation considered as gold standard.Methods: Two hundred and six (n = 206) outpatients ≥65 years old were included. The study was designed as retrospective, cross-sectional, and randomised. STOPP version 2 criteria were systematically used to assess pre-admission treatments followed by implicit clinical evaluation regarding two questions: Were the STOPP criteria recommendations valid for the individual patient and were there any potentially inappropriate-prescription other than depicted by STOPP version 2 criteria? The underlying reason(s) and associated clinical-features were noted.Results: About 62.6% potentially inappropriate-prescriptions were identified (0.6 per-subject) according to systematic application of STOPP v2 while it was 53.4% (0.5 potentially inappropriate-prescriptions per subject) by clinician’s application of STOPP v2. Prevalence of non-compliance was 14.7% in 18 (21.7%) of 83 patients identified by systematic application. Suggestion to stop a drug was not accepted because of need of treatment despite likelihood of anticipated side-effects in about 2/3 and with no-anticipated side-effects in about 1/3 of non-compliances. Not following STOPP v2 was significantly associated with lower functional level. According to clinician’s implicit-evaluation, there were an extra 59.2% potentially inappropriate-prescriptions (0.6 per subject) in 80 (38.8%) patients yielding a total of 112.6% potentially inappropriate-prescription.Conclusions: Most of the STOPP v2 directed drug cessations are decided valid by the clinicians. In patients with higher functional dependency, it is likely that they are not followed due to palliation focussed care/patient–family preferences. There may be as much as STOPP v2 identified potentially inappropriate-prescriptions by implicit evaluation in a significant percent of geriatric patients signifying need for comprehensive geriatric evaluation in practice.",

This study aimed to examine the associations of testosterone and SHBG levels with leukocyte count in 451 Korean men aged ≥50 years.Methods: Serum testosterone and SHBG levels were categorized into tertiles. High leukocyte count was defined as ≥7340 cells/μl, which corresponded to the 75th percentile of the current sample. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for high leukocyte count were calculated across testosterone and SHBG tertiles using multiple logistic regression analysis.Results: The mean leukocyte counts significantly decreased with increasing testosterone and SHBG tertiles. The ORs (95% CIs) of high leukocyte count for the first tertile of testosterone and SHBG were 3.27 (1.34–7.95) and 2.38 (1.05–5.96), respectively, compared with the referent third tertile, after adjusting for age, smoking status, alcohol drinking, regular exercise, body mass index, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level.Conclusion: We found inversely graded associations of low testosterone and SHBG levels with leukocyte count. These findings suggest that low testosterone and SHBG levels may be interpreted as a state of low-grade inflammation.",

The relationship between urosepsis and age, serum PCT, C-reactive protein, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, PSA density and pathologic results following biopsy was assessed. Serum PCT level was measured in all patients immediately before the biopsy and at the post-biopsy day 2.Results Of the 227 patients, 11 (4.8%) developed UTI with positive urine culture without urosepsis and 5 (2.2%) developed urosepsis within 30 days after biopsy. The concentration of PCT was within the normal range before the biopsy. Procalcitonin concentration at post-biopsy day 2 was significantly higher in patients who developed urosepsis (1.91 ± 2.99 ng/ml vs. 0.05 ± 0.08 ng/ml; p = .004) compared with non-UTI patients. Only elevated PCT level at post-biopsy day 2 was a statistically significant independent predictor of post-biopsy urosepsis. The area under the ROC curve for the prediction of urosepsis was 0.976 (95%CI: 0.941–1.000) and a cut-off 0.095 ng/ml in the level of PCT at post-biopsy day 2 yielded a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93.8% in detecting urosepsis following biopsy.Conclusions Procalcitonin appears to be a useful early biomarker to predict the urosepsis following prostate biopsy. Patients with elevated PCT value should be closely monitored after the biopsy.",

MRI studies are more sensitive than CT studies to diagnose and plan surgical intervention. Introduction of antibiotic impregnated devices attributed to the reduction of infection rates with superiority proven for certain types; the no-touch technique had further reduced this rate. The Mulcahy salvage remains the most widely used surgical approach for treatment despite modifications and novel techniques described; conservative management of PP infections is recently reported with promising results.Conclusions Despite absence of strict guidelines for the management of infected PPs, we reviewed and discussed numerous panel opinions and suggestions throughout literature.

    "abstract": "Objective: The study was aimed to evaluate the influences of erectile dysfunction (ED) in a rat model of stroke combined with hyperlipidemia (HLP).Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into control and hyperlipidemia (HLP) groups. HLP model was constructed by feeding with high-fat and cholesterol diets. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and non-HDL were identified to check the model was success. Stroke model was established by FeCl3. ICP/MAP value was detected to evaluate the erectile function of rats. Serum level of lipoproteins and the expressions of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected by ELISA. Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining of corpus cavernosum and measurement of penis length were utilized to assessment erectile function. Western blot was used.Results: TC, TG, LDL, and non-HDL-C in serum were up-regulated, while HDL level was attenuated. After treatment, the serum lipid level recovered. From the ICP/MAP values, the erectile function of both two treatment groups recovered. The expression of PDE5A was up-regulated, while the levels of eNOS and cGMP were suppressed after surgery. The length of penis was decreased, and corpus cavernosum was damaged following HLP and stroke. However, the erectile function was recovered after treatment.Conclusion: Stroke combined HLP caused ED through NO-cGMP-PDE5 pathway.",

    "abstract": "In this commentary, we highlight important findings from a notable RCT by Ng Tang Fui et al. 2016 which investigated the effects of testosterone treatment in dieting obese men. First, a myopic focus on weight loss can detract from important improvements in body composition. Second, while weight loss in obese men may increase testosterone levels, this increase is commonly not enough to result in an improvement in symptoms associated with testosterone deficiency. Third, the RCT by Ng Tang Fui et al. adds evidence to the growing number of clinical trials showing that testosterone therapy should not be restricted to men with classical hypogonadism. Finally, the beneficial effects of testosterone therapy are not maintained after cessation of treatment. Currently, the British Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines are the only clinical guidelines which acknowledge that weight loss per se does not automatically translate to resolution of hypogonadal symptoms, that testosterone therapy can greatly benefit men with testosterone deficiency who do not have classical hypogonadism, and that cessation of testosterone therapy causes reappearance of symptoms and reversal of benefits. Lifelong testosterone therapy is therefore recommended for persistent health benefits in most men with testosterone deficiency. Physicians and patients need to be informed of this.",

Change regularity of prostatic anatomical factors with aging was analyzed.Patients were classified into four groups according to different age decades. All prostatic anatomical factors assessed in this research increased with age growth (p < .0001). However, these anatomical factors sustained stably when older than 70 years. By analyzing the detailed correlation between age and prostatic morphological parameters, transitional zone index (TZI) (Pearson r = 0.358, r2 = 0.128, p < .0001) and transitional zone width (TZW) (Pearson r = 0.344, r 2= 0.118, p < .0001) showed the best correlation coefficient with age. After adjusted the influence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM), the result remained still similarly.Prostatic morphological parameters increase progressively with age growth when patients were younger than 70 years, indicating reasonable interventions to be provided to BPH patients before 70 years. In addition, TZI and TZW are two practical, easy-to-measure prostatic parameters that are significantly associated with the growth of age compared to others.",

The results of pulmonary function tests, 6-minute-walking test (6MWT), Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), COPD assessment test (CAT), and BODE scores were recorded together with ECHO results showing right and left ventricular functions.Results: 126 COPD patients were evaluated. Of these, 37.3% was in group A, 28.6% in group B, 12.7% in group C, and 21.4% in group D. Most common comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH); these were most frequently seen in groups D and B. Regarding ECHO parameters, differences were present among groups in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) and left ventricle end-systolic diameter (LVEF) (p < 0.001 and 0.004, respectively). sPAP was highest in groups D and B whereas LVEF was lowest in group D.Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients' symptoms in symptomatic COPD groups B and D might be related to increased PAP and concomitant cardiovascular comorbidities.

In this paper, we performed a retrospective study and discussed the prevalence of testosterone deficiency (TD) and its relationship to body mass index (BMI) in aging Chinese men with BPH who have surgical intervention.We reviewed the clinical data by age, BMI, medical history, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, serum total testosterone (TT) levels, biochemical analysis, and transrectal ultrasound. BMI and other variables were considered to be independent variables in an effort to evaluate any potential associations between these factors and TD status using non-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted regression models.Of the 795 BPH participants, 27.2% (216) patients had TD. After adjusting for all potential covariates, there was a similar J-shaped relationship between BMI and TD, with an inflection point of 19.2 kg/m2. The effect sizes and the confidence intervals on the left and right sides of this inflection point were 0.6 (0.4-1.0) (p = .043) and 1.2 (1.1-1.3) (p < .001), respectively.Nearly one-third of the aging Chinese BPH patients had TD in this study. The association between BMI and TD is not simple. A J-shaped curve correlation was detected. BMI was positively correlated with TD when it was over 19.2 kg/m2 and inversely correlated with TD when it was below 19.2 kg/m2. Long-term prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

The hip geometric parameters and the bone mineral density (BMD) taken before and after 1 year of ADT were retrospectively examined. With ADT, we not only confirmed significant BMD annual changes in the lumbar spine, the femoral neck, and the total hip of -1.65%, -1.91%, and -2.20%, respectively, but we also confirmed significant annual changes in cross-sectional areas, cross-sectional moments of inertia, and section modulus in the narrow femoral neck of -2.55%, -3.50%, and -3.14%, respectively. The annual rate of decrease in the femoral neck BMD was significantly higher in patients with visceral fat obesity than in those without visceral obesity (-1.79% vs. -0.28%). One year of ADT for Japanese men with prostate cancer might decrease the strength of bending and the structural rigidity as well as BMD at the femoral neck.",

TT was measured every 3 months after cessation of nADT, and some predictive factors affecting TT recovery were analyzed.The cumulative incidence rates of TT recovery to normal levels (TT ≥ 3.0 ng/mL) after 12 and 24 months cessation were 49.6% and 81.6%, respectively. The median interval to recover to normal TT was 15 months. In multivariate analysis, the use of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist as nADT significantly earlier improved to recovery to normal TT level (p = 0.046). Conversely, higher body mass index (BMI) and hypertension significantly prolonged TT recovery to normal (p = 0.026 and p = 0.026, respectively).Approximately one-fifth of patients still had low TT levels 2 years after the cessation of 6 months nADT before LDR brachytherapy. Use of a GnRH agonist, higher BMI, and hypertension were the predictive factors for slower TT recovery to normal TT levels after the cessation of nADT.",

It was considered that the degeneration of detrusor muscle was the main etiology. In recent years, more articles focus on relationship between UAB and decreased muscle strength. Besides, handgrip strength (HGS) is an early indicator to detect frailty and muscle weakness in systemic reviews.Method Our study involved 2258 males from NHANES datasets (2011–2012, who were divided into quartiles by urine flow rate (UFR), which was measured by uroflowmetry. Multivariate regression models were performed to analyze the associations between UFR and HGS.Results The UFR had a positive correlation to the HGS by multivariate regression models in males (β coefficient: 1.348, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.530, 2.166, p = 0.001). The male participants with the highest quartile of UFR have a greater HGS than those with lowest quartile of UFR (β coefficient: 4.546, 95% CI: 2.462, 6.630, p < 0.001). Higher UFR was associated with lower odds of low HGS (OR: 0.489, 95% CI: 0.350, 0.684, p < 0.001) in the fully-adjusted model.Conclusions Our research highlighted that the UFR had a strong associated with the HGS in the healthy group.",

We determined whether the prolonged treatment with sodium nitrite (NaNO2) as a storage form of NO ameliorates ED in aged rats. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided: younger, aged and NaNO2-treated (20 mg/kg per day) aged groups. The erectile (intracavernosal pressure [ICP]/mean arterial pressure [MAP]) and corpus cavernous (CC) responses were evaluated after 12 weeks. The ICP/MAP in aged rats was lower than in young controls, which was not improved by the NaNO2 treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for endothelial NOS and collagen deposition was performed. We assayed NO indirectly by measuring the level of its stable end products, nitrite/nitrate, using the Griess reagent. The relaxations to ACh and EFS in the aged group were considerably less than in the younger group, which were normalized by acute incubations of l-arginine or BH4 of aged CC. In conclusion, NaNO2 treatment did not restore erectile response while nitrate levels were enhanced in aged penis. The cofactor or substrate administrations, but not chronic exogenous modulation of NO system may be beneficial in aged men with ED.",

Statistically, the Pearson correlation coefficients test was used.Results: Total cases, the cases of PV ≤ 25 ml, and the cases of PV > 25 ml were evaluated respectively. Total cases and the cases of PV > 25 ml showed a positive significant correlation with testosterone (T), but the cases of PV ≤ 25 ml showed no such correlation. The cases of PV > 25 ml had a positive significant correlation with estradiol (E2), but total cases and cases of PV ≤ 25 ml did not. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) showed no correlation with any case of PV, however it decreased significantly with age and had a correlation with alopecia. The E2/T ratio had no correlation with any case of PV, but on the other hand, the T/DHEAS and E2/DHEAS ratios had significant positive correlation with PV > 25 ml.Conclusions: Serum T and E2 had significant positive correlation with measured PV especially in larger prostates. This result seems to correspond with the conventional theory that T and E2 have an etiological effect on benign prostatic hyperplasia. DHEAS did not show direct correlation with PV, however it appeared to suppress the role of T and E2 on benign prostatic hyperplasia growth. DHEAS might be a key to understanding the etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia with aging.",

Sex steroid levels were assessed using radioimmunoassay (RIA). BMI was used as a measure of general adiposity. WHR was used to estimate distribution of adipose depots. The relationships between sex steroids, BMI, WHR and age were evaluated by use of non-parametric statistics (Spearman coefficients). Aging was related to a reduction of all hormone levels (correlation coefficients with age: free testosterone r = -0.52, p < 0.001; total testosterone r = -0.25, p < 0.001; estradiol r = -0.18, p < 0.001; DHEAS r = -0.45, p < 0.001) and an increase of BMI and WHR for BMI r = 0.23, p < 0.001; for WHR r = 0.47, p < 0.001). A one way analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) was applied separately in the two subgroups of subjects to assess the relationships between hormonal and anthropometric variables. In men aged 22-39 years, the total (but not free) testosterone and DHEAS (when controlled for age) significantly differentiated BMI values. In subjects aged 40 years and over, no associations between sex steroids and BMI were revealed. In younger males DHEAS differentiated WHR values (even when controlled for age and BMI), whereas after the age of 40 years an increased WHR was accompanied by increases in both estradiol and DHEAS levels. The associations between the androgen-estrogen activity and the anthropometric parameters of adiposity vary in younger versus older healthy men.",

Results: After treatment, the symptom scores were significantly improved (all p < 0.001). Serum levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone were suppressed, and free testosterone and albuminbound testosterone levels were elevated. However, they were not significantly different from the pretreatment values. Waist/hip ratio and blood pressure were markedly decreased, but no changes were found in serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin and prostate specific antigen. Conclusions: Two months of treatment with oral testosterone undecanoate clearly improved the symptoms related to PADAM. No statistical relationship was found between symptom improvement and androgen levels. Androgen therapy for 2 months was beneficial to the waist/hip ratio and blood pressure, and no harm was done to the prostate gland or lipid metabolism.",

The median age was 59 (range 53-66) and mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.4 ± 3.3 kg/m2. Mean testosterone was 479.8 ± 149.0 ng/dl and mean free testosterone was 10.0 ± 3.0 ng/dl. Only 7.1% of all patients were diagnosed with 'idiopathic' ADAM. The majority of patients presented with erectile dysfunction. A wide variety of conditions were diagnosed, including hemo chromatosis, micro- and macroprolactinoma, hypothyroidism, benign prostate hypertrophism and prostate carcinoma. The scores of AMS psychological, somatovegetative and sexual subscales were 12, 16 and 13, according to AMS classification corresponding to severe, moderate and severe complaints, respectively. There was no correlation between AMS (total and subscales) and testosterone levels. A positive correlation between the somatovegetative subscale of the AMS and both BMI and insulin was found. In conclusion, we observed that in a group of selfreferred men andropause is not a frequent diagnosis, and other pathology needs to be addressed requiring a multidisciplinary approach.",

    "abstract": "Androgen levels decline over a man's lifetime. In a proportion of men (increasing with age), levels fall below values that have been established by conventional laboratory criteria as indicative of hypogonadism. Testosterone has a wide range of non-reproductive actions: it preserves bone and muscle mass, it acts on non-sexual mental functioning and it stimulates red blood cell formation. Long-term androgen deficiency has a great impact on quality of life. The first intervention studies provide indications that androgen treatment of men with true androgen deficiency is helpful. Obviously, only men who are testosterone-deficient will benefit from androgen supplementation. The diagnosis of testosterone deficiency in old age is not unambiguous. Signs and symptoms of aging sometimes clinically overlap with those of testosterone deficiency. The groups that are at higher risk of testosterone deficiency are those men with disease (pulmonary disease, gastro-intestinal disease, rheumatoid disease, etc.). Usually, sex hormone binding globulin levels increase with aging, leading to lower levels of free, biologically available testosterone. For the time being, arbitrary criteria for testosterone deficiency in aging men have to be adopted. The best practical approach is to calculate the free testosterone level. The calculation can be found at www.issam.ch under 'Tools'.",

However, it is unclear how the prostatic lesions are signallised in the prostate. Thus, the aim of this study is to characterise the structural, the ultrastructural and the proliferative aspects of the peripheral prostatic zone in the elderly men with and without diagnoses of prostatic lesions and with potential precursors of prostate cancer. Sixty samples of prostatic tissue, from 60 to 90-year-old patients with and without lesions obtained from autopsied or prostatectomised patients were divided into four groups (15 samples per group): standard group (no lesions), benign prostatic hyper-plasia group, high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia group and prostatic carcinoma group. The samples were submitted to morphometrical, structural and ultrastructural analyses in addition to cellular apoptosis and proliferative analyses. The results showed morphological damages in the stroma and cellular organelles involved in the secretory process of the prostate. Moreover, the prostatic lesions in elderly men demonstrated disturbance in the proliferation/apoptosis rate, indicating a prevalence of the proliferative process. Finally, the imbalance in prostatic stroma-epithelium interaction was a harmful feature in the elderly men as a result of structural changes, which are crucial factors for the development and progression of carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "There are increasing data indicating profound ethnic differences in the levels of virilization of males [1–4]. It is well understood that the intensity of testosterone-mediated effects is modulated by sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) [5] and the CAG repeat lengths in the androgen receptor (AR) gene [6]. We determined the serum testosterone, estradiol and SHBG levels and average CAG repeat lengths among a group of healthy older Indian men living in Connecticut, USA and compared these parameters with those of a reference group of white Caucasian men. We also compared various parameters that represent the end-manifestations of testosterone activity – serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, lean body mass, skeletal mineralization and visceral fat. Our data suggest that men from the Indian subcontinent are smaller, manifest lower levels of circulating free testosterone, lower mean PSA levels and lean body mass, but are comparable to white Caucasian men in terms of SHBG, estradiol, levels of visceral fat and CAG repeat length. These data suggest that Indian men manifest a lower level of virilization compared to white Caucasian males and that this might be due to lower mean circulating testosterone levels rather than higher AR CAG repeat length or SHBG.",

Since experimental tests of this possibility in humans are unethical, indirect studies have been relied on for evidence. The present study offers such indirect evidence by comparing life spans of female and male opera singers, since sex hormones are known to influence development of voice. Life spans of sopranos were found to be significantly greater than those of lower voice registered contraltos, even after controlling for birth year. Differences among male opera singers were not statistically significant. The data support the hypothesis that females live longer than males because of the beneficial effects of estrogens on longevity-related genes.",

Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP-5b) and aminoterminal propeptide of collagen I (PINP) were analysed for resorption and osteocalcin (BGP) for bone formation.In both studies, ORX resulted in significant femoral and vertebral bone loss and microarchitectural deterioration after 5 months of ORX, and became more pronounced after 11 months. Biomechanical strength was also decreased. Serum levels for TRAP-5b and BGP increased while PINP levels were reduced or unchanged.

From 2000 to 2012, 176 consecutive patients with low-risk PCa underwent BT. ED was evaluated with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Cox regression analysis was performed to assess significant predictors of mild-to-severe ED and BRFS after BT, including covariates. The 10-year actuarial rate of ED was 66%. Subjects with severe ED had higher values of D90 (183.0 versus 177.0; p < 0.05) and V100% (40.1 versus 31.4; p < 0.05) compared with normal. At the multivariate logistic regression analysis, D90 (OR: 1.10; p < 0.05) was an independent predictor of ED.

We recruited a convenient sample of 1787 men (age: mean (SD) = 43.8 (11.5) years) who visited a men’s health polyclinic in Taiwan and completed the AMS scale. The scale was first assessed using MSA. The remaining items were assessed using Rasch analysis. We used a stepwise approach to remove items with χ2 item statistics and mean square values while monitoring unidimensionality. The item reduction process resulted in a 6-item version of the AMS scale (AMS-6). The AMS-6 scale included a 5-item psychosomatic subscale (original items 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9) and a 1-item sexual subscale (original item 16). Analyses confirmed that the 5-item psychosomatic subscale was a Rasch scale. The AMS-6 correlated well with the AMS scales: the 5-item psychosomatic subscale correlated with the AMS scale (r between 0.50 and 0.92); the 1-item sexual subscale correlated with the sexual subscale of the AMS scale (r = 0.81). A 6-item short form of the AMS scale had satisfactory measurement properties. This version may be useful for estimating psychosomatic and sexual symptoms as well as health-related quality of life with a minimal burden on respondents.",

There are only dozens of primary cases reported in the literature. Here, we describe a rare case of primary UCP and review the literature.Case presentation A 67-year-old widowed male, was referred to our hospital due to the frequency, and urgency of dysuria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed prostate size was about 57 mm × 50 mm × 54 mm, increased prostatic transitional zone, and surrounding of prostatic duct indicate bar isointense T1, short T2, hyperintense DWI, and hyposignal ADC (PI-RADS 3); posterior of peripheral zone indicate patchy isointense T1, short T2, hyperintense DWI, and hyposignal ADC (PI-RADS 5). Subsequently, the patient underwent a transrectal prostate biopsy. Histopathological and immunohistochemical (IHC) assessments showed prostatic high-grade urothelial carcinoma with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finally, the patient underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Four months after surgery, CT plain and enhanced scan revealed thickening of the bladder wall. On further workup, cystoscopy revealed lymphoid follicular changes in the cut edge of the radical prostatectomy, and cystoscopic biopsies showed the malignant tumor.Conclusions Prostatic urothelial carcinoma should always be considered if the patient with severe lower urinary tract symptoms or hematuria, PSA, and digital rectal examination without abnormalities, without a personal history of urothelial cancer, but contrast-enhanced MRI showed the lesion located in the prostate. As of right now, radical surgical resections remain the most effective treatment. The effectiveness of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy is still controversial.",

However, the role that androgens play in the development of coronary artery disease in adult men is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not there was a correlation between plasma androgens and angiogrrahically defined coronary arteriosclerosis in men. A total of 201 non-obese men aged 28–60 years (mean, 48.1 years; SE ± 5.7 years) with coronary heart disease (CHD) were included in the study.Plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), lipids and lipoproteins were determined. Arteriosclerotic lesions in the 201 patients with CHD were assessed by determining the score of coronary arterial narrowing on coronary angiograms. When comparing plasma DHEAS and testosterone levels among coronary arteriosclerosis groups with progressively increasing degrees of arteriosclerotic lesions, a negative correlation was found between both of these hormones and the level of arteriosclerosis. A positive correlation was demonstrated between serum lipoprotein(a) concentrations and the degree of arteriosclerotic lesions. Lower concentrations of DHEAS and testosterone were found in those men with more severe arteriosclerotic lesions.These results suggest that, in men, androgens may play a preventive role in the development of coronary arteriosclerosis.",

This review addresses the known and proposed mechanisms for melatonin actions on the hypothalamic circadian 'clock', the anterior pituitary gland, and certain other target organs. The major signalling pathways, through which the recently cloned melatonin receptors operate, appear to be highly variable and tissue-specific, and are examined here in detail.

    "abstract": "The metabolic syndrome is well recognized as the association between obesity, elevated blood lipids, hypertension, hepatic steatosis, impaired glucose tolerance/diabetes mellitus type II and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Recently, several publications have demonstrated that uisceral accumulation of fat seems to be more important than general obesity and that several endocrine disturbances should be included in this syndrome. The first observations concerning the importance of body fat distribution and endocrine disturbances, however, were made in the 1940s and later confirmed by further research. Concerning the endocrine disturbances, we have specifically found that abdominal, i.e. visceral, type of obesity is associated with low levels of sex steroids in both men and women, increased Cortisol activity as well as a blunted growth hormone action. In several hormonal intervention studies, we have also demonstrated favorable effects on visceral obesity, insulin sensitivity, blood lipids and blood pressure. Furthermore, recent results from our research group have indicated that this complex of signs and diseases is associated with psychiatric signs such as mental stress, signs of melancholy and decreased life satisfaction. In order to explain better the possible pathogenesis of these risk factors and diseases, the term ‘the neuroendocrine syndrome’ seems to be more adequate. This article willfocus on important biological mechanisms in hormonal intervention strategies, especially androgen treatment, for patients with this syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), an adrenal steroid in humans, shows a certain anticarcinogenic effect in rat liver when it is administered simultaneously with strong carcinogens such as N-nitrosomorpholine (NNM). On the other hand, DHEA is an hepatocarcinogen in the rat when administered at high doses for more than 18 months. The hepatocellular tumors arise from amphophilic cell foci and exhibit a well-differentiated pheno-type. Wlien administered subsequent to NNM, DHEA acts as a tumor promoter in rat liver. Preneoplastic lesions of the glycogenotic/basophilic cell lineage induced by NNM are modulated to amphophilic lesions by DHEA. Female animals are more sensitive than males in respect of the carcinogenic and tumor-enhancing effect of DHEA. The higher sensitivity in females may be due to higher blood levels of DHEA andlor different metabolism and elimination of the drug, as compared to males. DHEA markedly induces cytochrome P450IVA, particularly in the liver of male rats. This effect may explain the rapid metabolism and elimination of the substance and the lower carcinogenicity in males. Both preneoplastic amphophilic foci and neoplasms are characterized by a strong proliferation of mitochondria. DHEA also induces peroxisome proliferation and susceptibility to lipid peroxidation in both genders. Furthermore, DHEA causes a reduction in activity and expression of key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism and of glycogen content in the liver, which may be related to modulation of hepatocarcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Partial androgen deficiency or the andropause in the aging male is a complex clinical and biochemical entity that needs to be analyzed at two levels of the constituent structure: the 'deep structure' should come to light with more intensive research, while the 'surface structure' holds the attention of investigators who focus on hormone measurements in the blood to help diagnose the andropause. In this study, it is recognized that bioavailable testosterone decreases progressively during the aging process. This physiological decline may be so important, or so close to castration levels, that aged men may experience numerous symptoms of hypogonadism. The assay for bioavailable testosterone was indirectly validated with a set of equations derived from our knowledge of the law of mass action at equilibrium, as proposed by Vermeulen and colleagues in 1999. With this mathematical model, we have shown that calculated free testosterone was highly correlated with bioavailable testosterone. It is therefore concluded that the evaluation of aged men's androgenicity should rely on at least one of these free testosterone assessments (bioavailable or calculated free testosterone) for the sake of reproducibility in the construction of the 'surface structure' of the andropause in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "Some population-based studies on male aging measure testosterone and cortisol in saliva instead of serum, but very few measure estradiol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), suggesting further testing is needed for reliability and comparative validity. In addition, the effects of interview stress and circadian hormone secretion need to be checked. In a pilot study on the overall sexual capacity of aging men, 48 randomly selected, healthy, heterosexual, cohabiting men aged 50–80 years, from Mannheim, Germany, and 50 from the State College, Pennsylvania, USA, were administered a standardized interview covering medical biography, present and previous life and work, marriage and emotional status. Two saliva samples were collected from each subject for measurement of testosterone, cortisol, estradiol and DHEA-S levels before and after the interview, and each subject completed a confidential self-administered questionnaire on intercourse, masturbation, orgasm, fantasies, libido and arousal. Questionnaires, hormone measurement techniques and the survey protocol had been extensively pretested. Prior to the pilot study, the kits for measuring testosterone and DHEA-S in saliva were checked for comparative validity against established measuring techniques in serum in 31 cases for testosterone and in 24 different cases for DHEA-S. These 55 cases underwent clinical diagnosis and were not otherwise involved in this study. The cases had been referred to the Andrology Unit of the University Hospital, Marburg, for reasons unrelated to this study. Given the biological differences for both steroids between their presence in blood and in saliva, a perfect correspondence between the two values was not expected and was not observed. The correlations obtained, however, support the assumption that all statistical relationships between testosterone and DHEA-S values in serum and clinical, as well as behavioral, variables reported to date may be replicated for testosterone and DHEA-S values in saliva.",

    "abstract": "The history of science has been described as 'paradigm shifts' of sequential overthrow, each new paradigm replacing the previous one. A paradigm is an overarching view-point which guides the articulation of theories and other activities in a particular field. In the exploration of health, two different types of approach can be identified. The pathogenic view, which has dominated the orientation of medicine over the last hundred years, focuses on disease states and underlying factors that modify the chances of entering into one of those states. The competing salutogenic view appears to be undergoing a renaissance in the new strategies of public health and health promotion, and producing theories of health based on more holistic approaches and diverse methods. The two paradigms exist side by side, and both are in a constant state of flux. The advocates of the health-oriented paradigm say it is difficult to reach a true, in-depth understanding of human health on the basis of a disease-oriented approach or from the traditional vantage-point of risk-factor epidemiology, whereas opponents point out that health does not lend itself to exact measurements or experimentation in keeping with the Galilean natural science ideal. The importance and utility of health orientation need to be explored and ascertained in further research. The approach seems, however, to have a number of crucial assets that might help avoid the limitations of the established disease and risk-factor epidemiology approaches and promote new directions of pursuit, including a better understanding of the complex relationships between aging and health, and other current challenges in creating healthy public policy.",

The subjects included ten men with primary hypogonadism and 29 with andropause with sexual dysfunction as the most common problem. The changes in subjective symptoms were evaluated by the PNUH QoL scoring system and the St. Louis University Questionnaire for androgen deficiency in aging males (ADAM). Digital rectal examination (DRE) was performed and serum testosterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and liver profile were monitored. Testosterone undecanoate treatment (n = 33) significantly improved sexual dysfunction and symptom scores of metabolic, cardiopulmonary, musculo-skeletal and gastrointestinal functions compared to baseline and to placebo (n = 6). ADAM score also significantly improved after 3 months of treatment. Serum testosterone was significantly increased compared to pretreatment levels only in the testosterone undecanoate group. In the placebo group, no significant changes compared to baseline were found for testosterone levels and QoL questionnaires. No abnormal findings were detected on DRE or laboratory findings in either group. Adverse events, such as gastrointestinal problems and fatigue, were mild and self-limiting. It is concluded that androgen supplement therapy with oral testosterone undecanoate (Andriol) restores the quality of life through improvement of general body functions in men with testosterone deficiency.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSeveral epidemiological studies have demonstrated a gradual decrease of serum testosterone with aging in men. A considerable number of men will experience hypogonadal androgen levels, defined by the normal range for young men. Thus, in addition to the long-standing use of androgen replacement therapy in the classical forms of primary and secondary hypogonadism, age-associated testosterone deficiency has led to considerable developments in application modes for testosterone. Since oral preparations of testosterone are ineffective, due to the first-pass effect of the liver, or, in case of 17 α-alkylation, cause hepatotoxicity, intramuscular injection of long-acting esters, such as testosterone enanthate, have been the mainstay of testosterone therapy. However, the large fluctuations of serum testosterone levels cause unsatisfactory shifts of mood and sexual function in some men; combined with the frequent injections, this delivery mode is thus far from being ideal. In contrast, the transdermal testosterone patches are characterized by favorable pharmacokinetic behavior and have proven to be an effective mode of delivery. Safety data over 10 years indicate no negative effect on the prostate. Nevertheless, the scrotal testosterone patch system is hampered by the application site, which is not easily accepted by many subjects; the non-scrotal patch has a high rate of skin irritations. In view of the drawbacks of the currently available preparations, the most recent developments in testosterone supplementation appear to be highly promising agents. Androgen, which has been available in the United States since mid-2000, will be introduced this year in most European markets as Testogel ® , a hydroalcoholic gel containing 1% testosterone. Doses of 50-100 mg gel applied once daily on the skin deliver sufficient amounts of testosterone to restore normal hormonal values and to correct the signs and symptoms of hypogonadism. The gel has shown to be very effective and successful in American patients, who have benefited from its availability for almost 3 years. Furthermore, in phase II and III clinical studies, the intramuscular injection of 1000 mg testosterone undecanoate every 12-15 weeks has led to extremely stable serum testosterone levels for a prolonged period of time and has resulted in excellent efficacy. It is very likely in the future that these products will be the mainstay of testosterone supplementation. Whereas the indication for testosterone substitution for men with classical forms of hypogonadism is unequivocal, the use of testosterone in men with ageassociated hypogonadism is less uniformly accepted. Yet, the few studies addressing this question indicate that men with testosterone serum levels below the lower normal limit for young adult men and with lack of energy, libido, depressed mood and osteoporosis may benefit from testosterone supplementation. However, it should be kept in mind that the experience documented in studies is limited. Nevertheless, serious side-effects, especially in regard to the prostate, did not occur, with the longest study extending over 3 years.KeywordsTESTOSTERONE DEFICIENCY TESTOSTERONE SUPPLEMENTATION TESTOSTERONE UNDECANOATE INJECTIONS TESTOSTERONE TRANSDERMAL PATCH TESTOSTERONE CONTAINING GEL",

There were two slightly different Italian AMS scales, which both underwent an up-to-date linguistic & cultural translation process, i.e., were both valid to be applied in clinical research. However, there are potential long-term problems associated with having two Italian language versions of the scale in the same country. Therefore, an ad hoc committee of key persons related to both versions met with the scale's developer, to create a harmonized single Italian AMS.Results. The harmonization meeting came up with a consensus item-by-item and the new Italian reference scale was agreed upon. It was decided that this scale should be published to avoid any confusion among future users.Conclusion. The Italian AMS scale published in this paper should be used for future clinical and other research.",

    "abstract": "A descriptive study of the awareness, knowledge and attitude of health professionals toward andropause was conducted in Ile-Ife, Nigeria with the aim of assessing the influence of sociodemographic variables of the respondents on their perspectives of the subject matter. The study employed a structured questionnaire to assess respondents' level of awareness and knowledge, and Likert-type scales to rate respondents' attitudes. A total of 187 (45%) respondents indicated previous awareness of andropause, with younger people (aged below 40 years) displaying better awareness compared with the older ones (p = 0.05), and more doctors than 'other technical health professionals' displaying better awareness when compared with health administrators (p < 0.001). However, only 93 (23%) respondents demonstrated a good knowledge of andropause, with more females compared with males recording good knowledge scores (p = 0.01). While a slightly higher proportion of older respondents (aged 40 years and above) compared with younger ones demonstrated good knowledge of andropause, age and marital status were not significantly related to knowledge of the subject matter. While only 23 (5.4%) respondents displayed a positive attitude toward andropause, and respondents' knowledge was found to positively influence their attitude toward it, none of the sociodemographic variables of age, sex or marital status was significantly related to respondents' attitudes. The study concluded that there is still a low level of awareness and knowledge of andropause among health workers in Nigeria, unlike what obtains in more developed countries of the world, and called for active education of both health professionals and the general public on the subject matter of andropause and other related male reproductive health concerns in the country.",

Practitioners sometimes distrust the symptoms and the diagnostic tools. The clinical manifestations are however the reflection of a lack of anabolism commonly associated with a decreased production of testosterone which is translated in decreased serum values of total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and calculated values of testosterone. Because of the similarity between the age of the control group and of andropausal men in this study, the Sex Hormone Binding Globulin dogma postulating a modest increase of the glycoprotein with age is evacuated from the argument and therefore it is proposed to rely on total testosterone as a first line assay to support the diagnosis of andropause; however the presence of confounding factors to the diagnosis sometimes require an easy access to calculated values of free or bioavailable testosterone.",

    "abstract": "Our findings indicate that the participants of an 18 week intensive endurance exercise training program experienced significant (p < 0.001) reductions in resting testosterone (−25 to −45% decrease from pre-training), with some reaching the clinical criteria for androgen deficiency during the training regimen. Nonetheless, none of the participants displayed any running performance decrement, in fact, the opposite occurred (+18.6% improvement; p < 0.05). These preliminary findings suggest acute decreases in testosterone in and of itself may not be entirely indicative of a compromised exercise performance potential although elements of reproductive and bone health may still be compromised.",

For the study, patients with perineural invasion (N = 86) were recruited into group I and underwent open retropubic prostatectomy, regardless of clinical stage; cases with prostate cancer but without perineural invasion on biopsy, who received radical prostatectomy as the treatment modality, were placed into group II (n = 90). Perineural invasion was detected preoperatively in 43% of cases that revealed surgical margin positivity postoperatively, while 85% of the remaining cases (group II) had negative surgical margins. There was no correlation on prostate biopsy between perineural invasion and Gleason score or PSA, based on Sperman's rank-order correlation analysis. However, there was strong positive correlation of perineural invasion with clinical stage and patients age. Additionaly, we demonstrated that perineural invasion on biopsy is a non-independent risk factor for metastatic occurrence, although the correlation was significant in univariate analysis. Nevertheless, we found strong correlation between invasion on initial biopsy specimen with biochemical cancer recurrence, suggesting that perineural invasion on prostate biopsy is a significant predictor of worse prognostic outcome.",

Although aerobic exercise is suggested to improves circulating testosterone levels, physical fitness, depressive symptoms, and sexual function, the effect of regular aerobic exercise on aging-induced disorders has not yet been clarified. Here we performed cross-sectional and interventional studies to identify the effect of aerobic exercise on aging-induced disorders assessed by the Aging Males' Symptoms questionnaire (AMS). In study 1, the relationship between aerobic exercise capacity (i.e. peak oxygen consumption) and AMS scores were cross-sectionally examined in 169 adult men. In study 2, the effect of a 12-week regular aerobic exercise on AMS scores was longitudinally investigated in 18 adult men. In study 1, the AMS-total, AMS-somatic, AMS-psychological, and AMS-sexual scores were significantly correlated to aerobic exercise capacity even after considering age and testosterone levels. In study 2, 12-week aerobic exercise training significantly improved AMS-sexual and tended to improve AMS-total scores. Additionally, an increase in vigorous physical activity was correlated to improve in the AMS-sexual score. These results suggest that regular aerobic exercise is an effective strategy to improve aging-induced disorders in men.",

After a month of treatment, serum samples were obtained from rats to measure dihydrotestosterone and total testosterone. Nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) immunoreactivity and levels of NOS enzyme isoforms, NO and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were evaluated in the harvested penile tissues. Also, corporal smooth muscle and collagen were examined.Results: Staining intensities of neuronal NOS and endothelial NOS were significantly lower in group D (p < .05). They were similar between group C and group D + T. Immunoreactivity of inducible NOS was observed higher in group D than group C (p = .01) whereas group D + T had the highest iNOS (p<.001). ELISA revealed similar outcomes in terms of NOS enzyme isoform levels. The mean of smooth muscle to collagen ratio was the lowest in group D (p < .001) and it was similar among group C and group D + T (p = .072). Group D had the lowest cGMP and NO levels (p < .05) and they did not differ between group C and group D + T (p>.05). Group D and group D + T had significantly decreased dihydrotestosterone and increased testosterone, compared to group C (p < .001).

    "abstract": "Aging is inevitable, every day we live we age. The mouth is referred to as a mirror of overall health, reinforcing that oral health is an integral part of general health. Oral health reflects overall well being for the elderly population. Compromised oral health may be a risk factor for systemic diseases commonly occurring in age. Diagnosis and proper treatment is essential for healthy aging. Timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment and regular follow-up of both oral and systemic diseases are a prerequisite for active aging. Oral diagnostics is a revolutionary development with high potential to replace other investigative modalities. Changing demographics, including the increase in life expectancy and the growing numbers of elderly, has focused attention on the need for dental research activities to be expanded for geriatric dentistry. This paper is aimed to shed light on the growing elderly population and their ailments. It also aims to create awareness among health care providers about oral diagnostics and their application in geriatrics.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of age and abnormal metabolism on sex hormones in Chinese male.Methods: Three hundred and thirty-seven elder men were enrolled into this single-center, cross-sectional study, and their sex hormone levels and metabolic parameters were assessed.Results: Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations increased with age, while free testosterone index (FTI), testosterone secretion index (TSI), estradiol (E2)/SHBG and progestin (PROG) decreased. Abnormal metabolisms were related to androgen indices (TT, FT, BT, FTI, TSI, T/E2), SHBG and E2/SHBG even after adjusting by age and macrovascular disease. Obesity and overweight, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia were the most important abnormal metabolism that related to decreased androgen indices. Including SHBG in the stepwise regression increased the explanation effect of TT and BT by 32.7% and 28.5%, respectively, and all metabolic indices were excluded. Abnormal metabolism indies (BMI and PBG) were correlated to the decrease in SHBG levels, while age and LH was positively correlated to SHBG levels.Conclusions: Age and abnormal metabolism were independently important factors associated with the sex hormone levels in elderly Chinese men, which were all mediated by SHBG.",

Sixty participants diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia were given 0.5 mg of dutasteride daily for 52 weeks. Measures of TT and DHT levels, TPV and uroflowmetry were obtained before and after dutasteride treatment. Forty-three patients demonstrated a TPV reduction of ≥5% (Group 1), whereas the remaining 17 patients demonstrated a TPV reduction of <5% (Group 2).

The rate of TT increase and improvement in voiding symptoms were significantly higher in Group 2A than Group 2B. Dutasteride-induced TPV reduction is dependent on individual 5-α reductase inhibitor activity. Some patients demonstrating smaller dutasteride-induced TPV reduction may experience an improvement in voiding symptoms owing to an increased level of testosterone.",

Seven of the 12 included studies provided test–retest coefficients, and these were used in the meta-analyses of test–retest reliability.Results: The AMS scale had excellent internal consistency [α = 0.89 (95% CI 0.88–0.90)]; the mean alpha estimates across the AMS subscales ranged from 0.79 to 0.82. The AMS scale also had good test–retest reliability [r = 0.85 (95% CI 0.82–0.88]; the test–retest reliability coefficients of the AMS subscales ranged from 0.76 to 0.83. There was significant heterogeneity among the included studies.Conclusions: The AMS scale and the three subscales had fairly good internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Future psychometric studies of the AMS scale should report important characteristics of the participants, details of item scores, and test–retest reliability.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the old hypothesis about the important influence of the human intestinal microbiota (IM) on the mental and somatic health, expressed in the second half of the 19th century, received its scientific confirmation. Back then, Mechnikov predicted the discovery of the infectious agents responsible for carcinogenesis and for the development of the “sugar disease”. The results of the recent years’ long-term researches alter the traditional picture of the pathogenesis of many diseases and initiate more profound and deep investigation of the human IM. These achievements were facilitated by the development of the novel technologies of the molecular genetics, which make possible the identification of various bacterial species previously not available for cultivation and for traditional microbiological research methods. As a result, at the moment researchers have no doubt about the contribution of the microbiota into the development of many pathologies: metabolic, autoimmune, allergic, functional, oncological, cardio-vascular, etc. Essential contribution to the studies of the IM made the “Human Microbiom” project (HMP). One of the main goals of the project was the decoding of the genomes of more than 1000 bacteria from all biotopes of the human body contacting with the environment. The intestinal microbiome contains 100 times more genes than human genome. Each person has his own unique microflora [Citation1].IM is not only a large metabolic organ, but also a largest organ of the human body. Its mass can be up to 2.5–3 kg. However, Ley and coauthors proved that factors of the diet could lead to the changes in the IM content. Moreover, the levels of bifidobacterium and faecalibacterium have correlations with the anti-age effects.Due to widely spread metabolic syndrome and connected pathologies, like obesity and type 2 diabetes in the last decades, the role of the IM in the development of all pathogenic stages of the “20–21 century epidemic” is in the focus of the attention of the researchers. Essential difference in the IM content of the persons with under-weight and overweight allows one to suppose the importance of the role of IM in the development of obesity. Particularly, Cani and coauthors have shown that the decrease in the diversity of the gram-positive butyrate-producing anaerobic bacteria is associated with the endotoximia, chronic inflammation and development of the insulin resistance in mice. Ley and coauthors have found the changes in the ratio of the concentrations of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (decrease of the former and increase of the latter) in mice with obesity. The increase of the body mass in mice with obesity is connected with the additional extraction of energy by the colon microbiota from the meal polysaccharides.Thus, there is substantial progress in the research of the IM and in the understanding of its influence on the human health, particularly in its role in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes type 2. Although, many questions are still open and are the subjects for further research, but applying the methods of the IM correction such as special diet, probiotics and prebiotics, aiming at normalization of the IM facilitates the reduction of insulin resistance, normalization of the glycemic background and body mass, improvement of the other indexes of the metabolic syndrome.",

Testicular progesterone has been regarded as a by-product of steroidogenesis, which is not converted into testosterone. In many conditions, including aging, the testicular progesterone/androgen ratio increases and absolute progesterone concentrations can reach high levels. Only during the past few years has the role of progesterone as a modulator of male reproductive function become evident. Progesterone has been shown to act through binding to a protein at the cell membrane in sperm as well as in interstitial Leydig cells. The current review elaborates on the importance of progesterone in testicular physiology.Key Words: PROGESTERONEPROGESTINSTESTISLUTEINIZING HORMONE RECEPTORSTEROIDOGENESISDOWN-REGULATIONCALCIUM",

    "abstract": "AbstractIt is generally considered that the much higher frequency of cardiovascular disease in men than in women is related to the atherogenic effects of male sex hormones. This idea is supported by the increase in total cholesterol and the decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in boys at puberty, as well as by the well-known atherogenic effects of pharmacological doses of testosterone, as used by body builders.Most studies concerning the relationship between endogenous testosterone levels and the lipid profile show, however, an inverse correlation between (free) testosterone levels and the atherogenic lipid profile, as well as with insulin levels. It is likely that this favorable correlation between endogenous testosterone levels and plasma lipids is mediated by the increased insulin sensitivity induced by testosterone. Exogenous testosterone, in as far as physiological levels of testosterone are achieved, has apparently no unfavorable effects on cardiovascular morbidity. When, however, supraphysiological, pharmacological doses of testosterone or synthetic anabolics are administered, a severe atherogenic lipid profile with an impressive decrease of HDL-C levels is observed.In hyperandrogenic women, insulin resistance as well as an atherogenic lipid profile is observed, and these women are also at increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.The adverse effects of testosterone on cardiovascular risk factors in women may be mediated by many factors besides insulin resistance such as stimulation of endothelin secretion, inhibition of prostacyclins, stimulation of thromboxane and effects on the vascular wall.Favorable effects of physiological levels of testosterone on the lipid profile may be related to increased insulin sensitivity and the fibrinolytic and lipolytic effects of testosterone, whereas the apparent discordance between the favorable effects of testosterone on the plasma lipid profile and cardiovascular disease, on the one hand, and the absence of any effect on cardiovascular mortality, on the other hand, suggests direct effects of testosterone on the vascular wall.Key Words: Cardiovascular DiseaseCardiovascular MortalityTestosteroneDehydroepiandrosterone (Sulfate)Polycystic Ovary SyndromePlasma LipidsInsulinObesity",

    "abstract": "Arterial diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke are major causes of male morbidity and mortality. Steroid hormones have been linked to the process of atherosclerosis that often underlies these conditions, both through indirect mechanisms (such as lipoprotein metabolism) and direct mechanisms (such as vascular reactivity). Attempts to develop androgen therapies for the aging male are hindered by the perception of such steroids as being atherogenic. In part, this prejudice is based on the higher rates of arterial disease seen in young men compared to young women, together with the sporadic reports of premature vascular disease in athletes who abuse anabolic androgenic steroids. There are as yet no acceptable clinical trial or epidemiological data on arterial disease in men treated with androgens. The claim that male castration delays the onset of arterial disease is not based on fact. The metabolic risk profile in androgen users involves both positive and negative changes. ‘Risk factor’ studies must be interpreted with caution, given the recent demonstration of the failure of postmenopausal estrogen therapy to prevent heart disease. Studies in fat-fed primates have their limitations, as do studies of androgen therapy in women. In contrast, much of the positive vascular data involve studies of men with coronary heart disease. Overall, the existing evidence suggests that androgens are as likely to prevent arterial disease as they are to cause it. Consideration should be given to undertaking randomized, placebo-controlled trials using non-invasive methods of arterial assessment, such as carotid artery intima-media thickness.",

Unfortunately, the association between physical exercise and BMD in adult population is controversial. Our aim was to assess relations between recreational physical activity and BMD in middle-aged men. We performed densitometry and hormonal measurements (total testosterone, free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol) in a homogenous group of 38 subjects. Among them, we distinguished 22 who had not engaged in any physical activity, and 16 who had recreationally exercised for about 10 years. Both groups did not differ in regard to hormonal status. Similarly, densitometry did not reveal any statistically significant differences in BMD between both groups of men.

    "abstract": "Normally there is a gradual continual loss of cortical and trabecular bone in both men and women as they age. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are conditions in which the loss results in brittle bones that fracture easily. Males with low testosterone and hypogonadism are predisposed to osteoporosis and prevention tends to be overshadowed by the greater problem in postmenopausal women. The ability of the skeleton to resist external forces depends partly upon the amount of bone present and partly upon other factors including cancellous bone microarchitecture. This is examined in iliac crest bone biopsies from idiopathic osteoporotic men, mean age 60 ± 12 SD years [n = 16]. These were compared with a healthy control group (autopsy samples), mean age 30 ± 8.9 years [n = 28] with the aim of examining the pattern of cancellous atrophy in male idiopathic osteoporosis. Undecalcified specimens were embedded in methylmethacrylate and prepared for histomorphometry. Sections were analysed using an automated trabecular analysis system (TAS), whereby a binary image was created. Area measurements including the trabecular surface and distance measurements including the trabecular width were made. The binary image was thinned to its medial framework and the node and terminus number as indices of trabecular interconnection were recorded, together with the strut length. Results (median (range)) showed a lower percentage bone volume in the elderly osteoporotic male, 10.2% (5.4–23.1) compared to young normals 25.2% (14.6–43.9), p < 0.001. The trabeculae tended to be thinner, 95.7 µm (66.7–170.7) c.f. 120.8 µm (75.8–208.6) and considerably fewer in number, 11.1 (2.1–31.4) c.f. 48.3 (25.4–66.9), p < 0.001 per field and in particular the number of nodes, 2.1 (0.15–14) c.f. 40.6 (10.3–74.1) per field and the node: terminus ratio fell to 0.13 (0.01–1.19) c.f. controls 0.98 (0.24–6.69), p < 0.001. It was concluded that the pattern of cancellous atrophy in male idiopathic osteoporosis differs from normal aging and resembles that in postmenopausal women. Results using the automated TAS confirm previous observations made manually.",

The aim was to assess the long term survival and quality of life in this patient population.Patients who underwent cardiac surgery between 1995 and 2007 were identified and case notes reviewed. Follow-up was undertaken by personal interview with the patient or the nearest kin to complete a pre-planned questionnaire.Sixty six (M:F; 45:21) octogenarians had Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) only (55%), Aortic valve replacement (AVR) only (12%), Mitral valve replacement (MVR) only (3%), Valve and CABG (25%) and complex procedures (5%). Fifty-eight percent were elective procedures. Operative mortality was 8% (n = 5). Multivariate analysis identified complex procedures, prolonged bypass time and re-do/emergency surgery as predictors of death (p < 0.05). Median Intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 206 h (range 43-1176 h), with >70% leaving ICU in 72 h. Late mortality involved five patients (8%) who died at 10 yr; 7 yr; 3 yr; 1 yr; and 8 months; and 2 yr and 7 months, respectively. Survival by Kaplan-Meir was 8.8 yr (Standard Error (SE) = 0.66, Confidence interval (CI) 7.6-10.1), median survival was 10 yr and mean Barthel's index 17.7 (min 0, max 20).Cardiac surgery can be accomplished in octogenarians with good long-term survival and quality of life. However, complex procedures, prolonged bypass and re-do/emergency surgery contribute significantly to mortality.",

Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed to identify the LEA and mortality risk according to CHADS2 score. The discriminatory properties of the score in predicting the outcomes were quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the Cox C-index.Results: The AUROC of the CHADS2 score in predicting LEA and death were 0.75 (95% CI = 0.73–0.77) and 0.70 (95% CI = 0.69–0.71), respectively. The CHADS2 score had an acceptable stratification capacity for LEA (C-index = 0.79) and death (C-index = 0.76) based on Cox-regression analysis.Conclusions: This study correlates the CHADS2 score with risk of developing LEA and death in patients with PAOD. The acceptable discriminative power of the score diversifies its predictive role in this population.",

    "abstract": "Around 400 million people across the globe will suffer from asthma in the next 10 years. Although most asthmatics use asthma medications regularly, they occasionally visit the emergency department for aggressive treatment amidst family anxiousness. Vitamin D (VD) not only regulates the expression of genes associated with calcium homeostasis, but also the genes associated with cancers, autoimmune diseases, and infection. VD has also non-genomic activities e.g. it is a potentially safe and effective novel strategy for decreasing the asthma episodes and controlling exacerbations. Our review assessed the dose, serum level, duration of administration and outcomes of VD in cases of asthmas. Although a body of research evidences the effectiveness of VD supplementation in asthma, other studies showed the insignificant response of VD to asthma either with low dose or low achieved serum VD levels. Nevertheless, recent reviews suggest that manipulating VD status holds promise for primary prevention and treatment of asthma. Future research on the relationship between VD and asthma should consider utilizing adequate doses of VD preparations for sufficient duration (likely to be >12 months) aiming to achieve appropriate level of serum VD (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentration (likely to be at least >40 ng/mL).",

Jefferson Scale of Empathy and the other questionnaire forms were sent to the nurses by email, and completed forms from those who accepted to participate in the study were also received by email.There was a positive significant relationship between donor declaration and empathy score. An increase was observed in empathy score as donor declaration increased. Cronbach's alpha coefficient of Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) in general was α = 0.71. JSE is an acceptable tool of measurement in terms of internal consistency. Turkish validation of JSE was provided.There was a direct relationship between empathy levels of intensive care nurses and donor declarations and organ finding. Therefore, it can be assumed that a preference for nurses with a high level of empathy to work in intensive care units would be effective in increasing organ donations. Alternatively, empathy increasing trainings during in-service trainings and seminars for intensive care nurses may increase organ donation and thus provide hope for patients awaiting organ donations.",

This study aims to assess whether a combined auriculotherapy (AT) using laser AT (LAT) and magneto-AT (MAT) is more effective than using MAT alone or placebo for managing LUTS of aging males.Methods: A randomized controlled, double-blinded trial was conducted. Sixty-two aging males with moderate or severe LUTS symptoms were randomly allocated into groups: Group 1, placebo LAT plus placebo MAT (n = 20); Group 2, combined AT approach using LAT plus MAT (n = 20); and Group 3, placebo LAT followed by MAT (n = 22). Six ear acupoints assumed to be suitable for alleviating LUTS were used. The total treatment period was 4 weeks, with follow-up visits till 3 months. Generalized estimating equations model was used for the examination of the interactions among the groups over time.Results: A combined AT approach exhibited a stronger treatment effect in relieving voiding problems, improving the peak urinary flow rate, and reducing the post-void residual urine than the placebo group or MAT alone.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the AT protocol used in this study for aging males with LUTS is feasible and can be adopted in future study of increased scale.",

The tumour detection rates in the 12-quadrant biopsies were compared with PV, PSA levels, and DRE results of the grouped patients.The tumour detection rate decreased with increasing PV in patients 45-75 years of age and with a PSA level ≤ 14.5. No decrease was detected in patients 45-60 years of age or those aged 61-75 years with a PSA ≤ 6.99 and suspicious DRE findings.

QoL was assessed with the functional assessment of cancer therapy-prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire scores. Determinants for postoperative poor QoL were investigated using univariate and multivariate regression analysis.Three-year overall survival, biochemical progression-free survival, and clinical progress-free survival were 88.89%, 62.96% and 77.78%, respectively. Preoperative symptoms of hematuria, urinary frequency, and dysuria were well alleviated after cystoprostatectomy. Moreover, FACT-P questionnaire scores at 6 months and 1 year after cystoprostatectomy were significantly higher than preoperative scores. Univariate and multivariable analysis (p < .05) showed that postoperative complication was the independent risk factor for the loss of postoperative QoL.Patients' QoL can be improved after cystoprostatectomy as the treatment for LAPC with the bladder invasion, which is associated with ameliorative urinary symptoms after the surgery. Besides, surgical complication is identified to be a risk factor for postoperative poor QoL.",

In one theory, prostatitis has been proposed to be associated with pelvic venous diseases such as varicocele and hemorrhoids, dilatation of the Santorini plexus. In this study, we investigated the effect of micronized flavonoid fraction (an agent used in venous insufficiency) in the treatment of type III CPPS.Methods Patients diagnosed with type III chronic prostatitis were randomized and divided into 3 groups. Group 1 consisted of patients using antibiotics + anti-inflammatory + alpha-blocker (n = 47), Group 2 consisted of patients using antibiotics + anti-inflammatory + purified micronized flavonoid fraction (n = 45), and Group 3 consisted of patients using only purified micronized flavonoid fraction (n = 35).Results The mean age of the patients was 32.93 ± 4.70 (range; 23–44) years. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the 6th month NIH-CPSI (National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index) total scores (p = .000). Also, it was found that NIH-CPSI total scores at month 12 in Group 3 were significantly higher than those in Group 1 and 2 (p1 = .000, p2 = .002). NIH-CPSI total scores at month 12 in Group 2 were significantly higher than those in Group 1 (p = .000).Conclusion The use of purified micronized flavonoid will decrease prostatic inflammation occurring due to increased perineal venous return.it can also be preferred as part of multimodal therapy because of its profile with relatively less side effects and being more affordable compared with alpha-blockers.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients show multiple physiological deficits and several neuropsychological comorbidities. The aim of this study was to investigate the eating attitudes in OSAS patients.Polysomnography records of 157 were performed. Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were applied to all participants.The mean age of the 157 individuals included in the study was 47.2 ± 11.4 (18-76) years and 36% (n = 56) of the individuals were female and 64% (n = 101) were male. When the patients were ranked according to the severity of OSAS, 38.2% (n = 60) were severe, 20.4% (n = 32) were moderate, 24.2% (n = 38) were mild, and 17.2% (n = 27) were OSAS negative. There was a significant difference in terms of the age-and-BMI-adjusted EAT score according to OSAS severity (p = .042). There was a significant difference in the age-and-BMI-adjusted value of the EAT according to the presence of OSAS (p = .011). After controlling age and BMI, no significant correlation was found between the EAT and the BDI (r = 0.012, p = .890) in patients with OSAS while there was a significant positive correlation EAT and the BAI (r = 0.177, p = .046).Considering the association of OSAS with psychiatric disorders, the presence of eating disorders (EDs) becomes an important and special topic. Treatment of patients with OSAS should not only aim to improve the patient's sleep apnea, but also to improve the patient's quality of life by evaluating the patient's psychological and physical functions.",

Qmax, prostate volume, IPSS score, quality of life score, and presence of catheters were recorded before the procedure and analyzed with the outcomes after the procedure.The ASA scores were calculated as 3.0 ± 1.0 (IQR). Before the procedure, Qmax values (mean (SD)) were 5.11 ± 5.37 ml/s, while in the 6th month after the procedure Qmax values were identified as 10.45 ± 3.8 ml/s (p < 0.001). Of 53 patients (55.2%) with chronic catheters who could not be operated, 30 (61.2%) no longer required urinary catheter.Bipolar RF thermotherapy appears to be an effective method for patients with BPO who cannot be operated. Due to the surgical risks of patients dependent on the catheter in spite of receiving medical treatment, it is a good alternative to remove catheter dependence. It may be one of the methods that should be remembered, especially in this patient group.",

In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between erectile dysfunction (ED) and MPI. Methods: The study included 45 male patients admitted to the urology outpatient clinic for ED and 48 healthy male volunteers. Echocardiographic evaluation of all participants was performed. Isovolumetric contraction time (IVCT), isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) and ejection time (ET) were measured. MPI was calculated using the IVCT + IVRT/ET formula. Results: The average age of the study population was 50 ± 5.3. Early diastolic mitral inflow (E)/late diastolic mitral inflow (A) ratio was significantly lower in the ED group (p ≤ 0.05). In the TDI evaluation between the groups, while early diastolic mitral annular velocity (Em) was significantly higher in the ED group, there was no significant difference in late diastolic mitral annular velocity (Am) and systolic peak velocities (Sm) (p < 0.01 and p = 0.417 and p = 0.092, respectively). While IVRT was significantly lower in the ED group (p < 0.05), there was no significant difference in IVCT and ET (p = 311 and p = 0.261, respectively). MPI was statistically significantly higher in the ED group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: ED has been found to affect MPI. This parameter, which is easily and non-invasively measured, can be used to predict the risk of CVDs in ED.",

Also, these samples were IHC stained for EGFR, HER2, P16, and PTEN. The cases were divided into two groups based on low and high Gleason scores. All findings were compared with the clinicopathological parameters of the patients.Results While KRAS mutation was in 3/24 (12.5%) of our cases, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were not detected. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of KRAS mutation frequency. HER2 was immunohistochemically negative in all samples. There was no correlation between EGFR, P16 immunopositivity, and clinicopathological features.Conclusion KRAS mutation frequency is similar to those in Asian populations. BRAF and PIK3CA mutation frequencies have been reported in the literature in the range of 0–15% and 0–10.4%, respectively, consistent with our study findings. HER2 immunoexpression is a controversial issue in the literature. EGFR and p16 expressions may not correlate with the stage.",

Men with 6-month history of ED and in monogamous heterosexual relationships were included.

ED was defined according to the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire score: no ED (≥26), mild ED (22-25), and others (<22). The review identified 70 patients with mild ED (6.0%, group A) and 1098 patients with more severe ED (94.0%, group B) were included. Of the patients in group B, 365 had mild-to-moderate ED (30.5%), 505 had moderate ED (43.2%), and 233 had severe ED (20.0%). Mean ages and body mass indices showed no differences between groups A and B. Group A had shorter mean duration of ED (p = 0.025). Although patients in group A had milder ED with shorter duration than group B patients, cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension and lipid disorder were still common for group A. The most common comorbidity was diabetes, which was twice as likely for patients in group B. Except for diabetes the prevalence of all diseases was comparable between the two groups. In conclusion, patients with mild ED should be closely evaluated for cardiovascular comorbidities.",

Whilst the benefits of testosterone (T) replacement are well-evidenced, the long-term data for TTh on metabolic and endocrine parameters is limited. Here we present the effect of TTh on endocrine parameters in hypogonadal men at a 12-year follow-up. In this single-centre, cumulative, prospective, registry study, 321 hypogonadal men (mean age: 58.9 years) received testosterone undecanoate injections in 12-week intervals for up to 12 years. Blood samples were taken at every other visit to measure levels of total T (TT), calculated free T, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone and prolactin. We observed an increase in TT of 15.5 nmol/L (p < 0.0001), a reduction in SHBG of 10.5 nmol/L (p < 0.0001) and an increase in calculated free T of 383.04 pmol/L (p < 0.0001) over the study period. This was accompanied by an increase in estradiol levels by 14.9 pmol/L (p < 0.0001), and decreases in progesterone (0.2 ng/mL, p < 0.0001), LH (10.4 U/L, p < 0.0001) and FSH (8.4 U/L, p < 0.0001) were demonstrated at 12-years. The levels of prolactin remained unchanged. Long-term TTh altered hormonal parameters to predictably modify the endocrine system. These effects were sustained during the entire observation time of 12 years.",

A novel technique for quantification of iron and fat content by MRI IDEAL-IQ can visualize hematopoietic areas and fatty deposits in bone marrow; however, the relationship between these indices and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) remains unclear. In this study, the proximal femur of 104 men who underwent pelvic MRI and bone densitometry prior to treatment for non-metastatic prostate cancer was retrospectively examined to investigate the R2* value to quantify iron and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) to assess bone marrow fat content. R2* was significantly positively correlated with BMD (r = 0.6017, p < 0.0001), and PDFF was not correlated with BMD (r = −0.1302, p = 0.0512). Patients with BMD T-score ≤ −2.5 had significantly lower R2* than patients with BMD T-score > −2.5; however, there was no significant difference in PDFF. In the ROC analysis, which examined the predictive ability of R2* with BMD T-score ≤ −2.5 as an outcome, the cut-off value of R2* was 50.7 s−1 (AUC 0.817). These results show R2* correlated with BMD.

The 21–30 year group presented lower sperm concentrations in comparison to those aged 31–40 and 41–50, yet shared a similar concentration to those over 50 years of age. Moreover, grades A and B decreased significantly in men aged over 50 years. The highest progressive motility and normozoospermia were observed in the age group 31–40 years while men over 50 years of age had the highest rates of asthenozoospermia and oligoasthenozoospermia. Furthermore, live birth results were reported in 5583 of the patients who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and were found highest between 31–40 years of age. To our knowledge, this is the largest study in Turkey focusing on male age-related semen parameters and ICSI pregnancy outcomes.

We conducted this single-center cross-sectional study on medical records of men aged 18 and above undergoing annual health check-ups to evaluate the correlation of age and metabolic components with testosterone. A total of 5,374 healthy men were included in the analysis. Total testosterone levels peaked at 18 years and gradually declined to age 40, followed by a mild increase. Based on the American Urology Association guideline, age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone were 14.61 nmol/l, 12.74 nmol/l, 12.70 nmol/l, and 13.98 nmol/l for those under 30, 30-40, 40-50, and over 50 years old respectively. Triglyceride - Glucose index showed a consistent negative correlation with testosterone across all age groups. In conclusion, testosterone levels demonstrated an age-related decline in early adulthood but a potential increase thereafter among healthy Vietnamese men. Metabolic components, rather than aging, had a consistent negative correlation with testosterone. Age-specific cutoffs for low testosterone may improve the detection of functional hypogonadism.",

Methods: 1,134 men participated between January 2019 and June 2021. 803 men, achieving a hardness of 80% or more, were included. Circumferences of the penis' base and tip in its flaccid and erect states were documented, and averages were compared across age groups and Chinese regions. Age-related correlations were explored. Results: Flaccid penile base and tip averaged 7.25 ± 0.60 cm and 7.20 ± 0.71 cm. At 80% erection, they were 9.70 ± 0.65 cm and 9.65 ± 0.75 cm. The increase in circumference from flaccid to 80% erect for the base and tip was approximately 25.31% and 25.47%, respectively. Correlations between flaccid and erect states were significant (tip: R = 0.807, base: R = 0.828, both p < 0.01). No significant age or regional variations in penile circumference were found. Conclusion: Our data on 803 subjects measured with Rigiscan showed that penile circumferences in flaccid and erect states show a strong correlation, in Chinese population. Penile size does not seem significantly influenced by age or region.",

    "abstract": "Androgen receptors that are of similar character to those in classical androgen target tissues have been reported in primary cultures of human osteoblasts, and a stimulatory effect of androgens on osteoblastic cell proliferation and differentiation has been demonstrated. In addition, recent evidence suggests that androgens may also affect bone resorption by inhibition of osteoclastic differentiation. In line with these anabolic androgen effects noted in vitro, animal studies in different orchidectomized rat models have provided evidence that androgen secretions are needed for normal skeletal growth and maintenance in vivo. The increasing evidence for the involvement of androgens in bone remodeling has given rise to considerable speculation as to whether bone loss and fracture occurrence in aging men might, at least partially, result from androgen deficiency. Numerous studies have provided evidence that the aging process in men is accompanied by changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that result in notable declines in serum levels of testosterone and, to a lesser degree, dihydrotestosterone. However, the skeletal impact of these deficiencies remains to be clarified. The extent to which bone loss in older men is accounted for by androgen status has only been studied cross-sectionally and no attempts have been made as yet to examine the antifracture efficacy of androgen substitution. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of different degrees of androgen deficiency on skeletal maintenance in aging men and to define the clinical potential of testosterone substitution in attenuating bone loss and reducingfracture risk.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOn February 9, 2002, Serono Symposia sponsored a workshop at The 3rd World Congress on The Aging Male that was held in Berlin, Germany at the Hotel Inter-Continental. The title of the workshop 'Is aging a disease?', was intended to convey recent interest in the subject of aging as a clinically relevant entity and to discuss causes and approaches to its management. The Workshop was co-chaired by Drs Viktor Büber and Richard F. Walker. Speakers included Drs George R. Merriam, Heinrich M. Schulte, Felice Strollo and Richard F. Walker. Topics were arranged to proceed from a general overview of fundamental aspects of the aging process and their clinical consequences to specific aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of age-related disorders that could be associated with neuroendocrine dysfunction. F. Strollo initiated the series of lectures by reviewing some of the biological theories of aging and suggesting that maladaptive changes within the central nervous and endocrine systems play a major role in contributing to the cascade of events defined as senescence. R. Walker expanded upon this background by differentiating aging and disease. He suggested that while the process of aging is not a disease, it is directly responsible for the development of functional decrements causal of the intrinsic disease, frailty and general morbidity that occur in direct relation to advancing chronological age. From this generalized approach of linking age and disease, G. Merriam discussed a specific example in which age-related decrements in neuroendocrine dysfunction could contribute, at least in part, to senescent changes in body composition and physiological function. Specifically, he provided evidence that the gradual decline in growth hormone (GH) and testosterone secretion during aging is accompanied by anatomical and functional changes resembling pathogenic hormone deficiency. He went on to discuss possible interventions into this process, specifically showing data to support the view that a combination of GH secretagogues and sex hormones may be of value in sustaining health and vitality in the elderly. As an extension of this discussion, H. M. Schulte compared and contrasted age changes in sex hormone secretion between genders, and also stressed that the diagnosis and management of endocrine changes during life has become a serious challenge to those physicians intending to intervene in the aging process. Because the relationship of reduced hormone secretion to disease in the elderly is presently unclear, the Workshop concluded on a note of caution that guidelines for the replacement of endocrine substances as a prophylactic approach to aging have yet to be defined.KeywordsAGING THEORIES PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF AGING EVOLUTIONARY BASIS FOR AGING NEUROENDOCRINE ASPECTS HORMONE REPLACEMENT GROWTH HORMONE",

    "abstract": "According to current basic science as well as the clinical literature, human growth hormone has become an important topic in the field of anti-aging medicine. It is well known that the administration of human growth hormone compensates for the dwarfism syndrome in growth hormone-deficient children and growth hormone is also established as a substitution therapy for adults with pituitary deficiency. The effects mediated by growth hormone comprise an increase in muscle mass, a decrease in body fat, improved physical condition, oxygen consumption and overall quality of life, an improvement of the ratio of high-density lipoprotein to low-density lipoprotein, as well as an increase in bone density. Due to the insulin antagonistic effect of growth hormone as well as its insulin-like growth factor-1-mediated mitogenic effect, there is reason to doubt the safety of administering growth hormone outside the framework of approved indications. In an ongoing study, we are evaluating whether growth hormone and somatomedins might be of importance in the regulation of male sexual performance, including penile erection.",

    "abstract": "Low androgen levels in men are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, through unclear mechanisms. We measured arterial stiffness ('compliance') in 21 men receiving complete testosterone suppression therapy for prostate cancer, and in 25 controls. Systemic arterial compliance (SAC), which assesses proximal aortic stiffness, was calculated by simultaneous recording of aortic flow and carotid artery pressure (the 'area method'). Aorto–femoral (A–F), aorto–radial (A–R) and femoral–dorsalis pedis (F–DP) pulse-wave velocities (PWVs) were recorded using the 'Complior' system. SAC was significantly lower in the androgen-depleted men compared to controls (0.81 ± 0.53 vs. 1.18 ± 0.43 arbitrary compliance units, p = 0.01, mean ± SD). Correspondingly, their A–F PWV was higher (14.1 (10.1–21.8) vs. 12.4 (9.6–17.4) m/s, p = 0.03, median (range)). Cases tended to be older (75 ± 7 vs. 71 ± 6 years, p = 0.07), and to have higher systolic blood pressure (148 ± 22 vs. 143 ± 17 mmHg, p = 0.40); however, SAC was still significantly lower (p = 0.03) after adjustment for age and stratification for central systolic pressure ( ≤ or > the median). Adjustment of A–F PWV for age and central systolic pressure reduced significance to p = 0.07. There was no significant difference in peripheral PWVs between groups. In conclusion, testosterone suppression is associated with increased aortic stiffness, only partly explained by age and blood pressure. Loss of androgens in men might therefore adversely affect cardiovascular risk.",

In contrast, a possible therapeutic use of GH in idiopathic osteoporosis and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is speculative and not established. Reduction of osteoporosis risk is an argument brought up for a use of GH in healthy elderly persons (anti-aging medicine). However, since only very limited data are available yet, this cannot be based on scientific evidence, and there are important concerns about the safety of use of GH in healthy elderly persons.",

    "abstract": "The aging male is fast becoming a global concern. The problem is predicted to become a major health issue that should be addressed immediately in order to prevent disability, morbidity, and, more importantly, mortality. As part of its commitment to increase awareness and create interest in the care of Filipino aging males, The Philippine Society for the Study of the Aging Male Foundation, Inc. (PhiSSAM), a multi-specialty society established in 2000, embarked on a survey among Filipino physicians to determine their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding male aging. Results showed that the majority of doctors (about 87%) thought that men may experience andropause. Most would diagnose patients based on symptoms alone, while only 20-30% used testosterone levels to make a diagnosis of andropause. Decreased libido and less strong erections were the symptoms very closely associated with low testosterone. Of those doctors responding, 89% agreed that andropause can affect the quality of a man's life as much as menopause can affect a female; only 38% had already prescribed/instituted treatment for andropause. Of the 62% non-prescribers, 58% said they were either very likely or fairly likely to institute treatment in the future if there were more clinical trials, more medical information, and more information on drugs. Major concerns on testosterone replacement therapy included prostate cancer, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and heart disease. The findings in this pilot survey indicate a need among the doctors in the Philippines for education about andropause and the available treatments.",

The study was conducted on 40 healthy men aged between 65 and 85 years (mean 74.0 +/- 7.55 years). The study population was divided into two groups with respect to the level of physical activity: 22 less active subjects (energy expenditure related to physical activity below 1600 kcal per week) and 18 more active subjects (above 1600 kcal per week). To estimate the physical activity of the study population, weekly energy expenditure was measured in each subject with use of Caltrac accelerometer. In the blood serum levels of bone formation marker--osteocalcin and resorption marker--the C-terminal telopeptide of collagen I (ICTP), and interleukin-1beta were determined. Concentrations of osteocalcin and ICTP in less active subjects were significantly higher (by 3.62 ng/ml and by 1.21 mug/l respectively, p < 0.05), reflecting the higher bone turnover in comparison to values determined in more active subjects. Positive correlations between ICTP and osteocalcin levels (r = 0.5814 and r = 0.6526; p < 0.05), and between ICTP and IL-1beta (r = 0.5823 and r = 0.6040; p < 0.05) in less and more active men were found. On the ground of the presented study it can be concluded that the decreased bone turnover occurred in men with higher level of habitual physical activity. This study showed the relationship between serum level of IL-1beta and bone resorption but the habitual physical activity has no effect on this cytokine activity.",

To determine the age-related pattern of DHEAS and its relationship to nutritional status in a subsistence population, we sampled Turkana nomads from northern Kenya. Subjects were 108 nomadic and 90 settled Turkana males, estimated ages 20 to 80+. Measures included blood DHEAS, height, weight, skinfolds, and waist circumference. Overall nomads exhibited less adiposity (5.7 ± 1.8% versus 9.0 ± 3.3% body fat) and higher blood DHEAS levels (5.2 ± 3.3 µM versus 4.1 ± 3.1 µM; p = 0.03). Age pattern of DHEAS was curvilinear, peaking in the 30s and 40s. General linear models (GLM) showed that blood DHEAS levels among men over 70 years of age were significantly lower than those in their 30s and 40s.

In addition, DHEAS levels rose more slowly than described in other populations, peaking in the fourth decade of life.",

    "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an early form of atherosclerosis and subclinical myocardial dysfunction. Epicardial fat tissue (EFT) is associated with impaired left ventricular (LV) function, even in the absence of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between EFT and LV systolic function in patients with erectile ED by speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) method.A total of 129 consecutive patients with ED were compared with 145 age- and sex-matched control subjects. ED was evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire. Thickness of EFT was measured by TTE. Global LV longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) and global LV circumferential strain (LV-GCS) were measured by 2D-STE method.The EFT thickness was significantly higher in the patients with ED (p <.01). LV-GLS and LV-GCS were revealed to be more deterioration in the ED group compared to controls (-18.2 ± 2.7 vs. (-21.1 ± 3.9, p<.001; -19.5 ± 4.1 vs. -21.9 ± 3.9, p<.001, respectively). It has been shown that EFT thickness is an independent predictor of LV dysfunction.These results indicate that EFT thickness is associated with subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in patients with ED.",

We calculated the dietary inflammatory index (DII) based on a 24 h diet recall and evaluated male LUTS. Clinical LUTS was defined as two or more coexisting symptoms. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, the smooth curve fitting to analyze the relationship between clinical LUTS and the DII score. Subgroup analyses were conducted.We observed a positive non-linear relationship between clinical LUTS and DII. We found that when DII was higher than the inflection point 2.39, a 1-unit increase in DII was associated with 26.1% higher adjusted odds of clinical LUTS. Subgroup analyses showed that the DII score was only positively correlated with clinical LUTS risk in non-drinkers, smokers, and non-obese people (DII >2.39).Inflammation might be the key mechanism bridging dietary consumption to male LUTS. Excessive pro-inflammatory food intake (DII >2.39) warrants special vigilance, especially for non-drinkers, smokers, and non-obese men.",

The aim of our study was to determine the characteristics of bone tissue and bone turnover in men with idiopathic osteoporosis. Transiliac crest bone samples were histomorphometrically analyzed after double tetracycline labeling in 32 men aged 37-65 years who were diagnosed with idiopathic osteoporosis by densitometry of the lumbar spine and hip. Bone volume, osteoid surface, osteoblast surface, eroded surface, osteoid thickness, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, and mineral apposition rate (MAR) were determined in all trabecular bone specimens. Bone volume and structural parameters indicated trabecular bone loss in most patients. Cellular parameters and MAR indicated variations in bone cell actions. No age-related decrease in histomorphometric parameters was found. After the patients were grouped according to MAR values, osteoblast and eroded surfaces were found to be lower in the group with decreased MAR values and elevated in the group of patients with increased MAR parameter. Trabecular thickness was greater in patients with lower than normal MAR, due to reduced resorption and probably loss of very thin trabeculae. Our results suggest that idiopathic osteoporosis in man resembles many characteristics of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women resulting in impaired trabecular structure due to unbalanced cellular activity and bone turnover rate.",

In aging men, circulating testosterone (T) declines which is associated with an increase in the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) , albeit insufficient to maintain T at its original level.

To compare the effect of experimentally varied plasma levels of estradiol on the LH and FSH secretion in young and old castrated male-to-female transsexuals, in almost absence of T.Design, subjects, and interventions. In 10 healthy, young (mean age 37.6 ± 6.2 years) and 11 healthy, old (mean age 68.1 ± 7.0) male-to-female transsexuals after gonadectomy plasma estradiol levels were experimentally varied with estradiol patches (the first week 100 μg/day patches, the second week 50 μg/day, the third week 25 μg/day and the fourth week no patch was applied) and plasma levels of LH and FSH were monitored after every week.Results. Mean plasma bioavailable estradiol (E2) levels in the two groups ranged between 13.6 and 104 pmol/l. LH and FSH were inversely related to peripheral estradiol levels, were lower in the old group at all time points reaching statistical significance in the last week of the study when no patch was applied and estradiol levels were extremely low.Conclusions. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis of an age related increasing sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary compartment for the negative feedback of E2, but suggest a deficient feed-forward drive in older male-to-female transsexuals.",

Yet, the health-care systems have so far made surprisingly little effort to reduce these pronounced differences. Consequently, investigation into the state of health of the aging male and relevant health care is breaking new ground in science. From a scientific perspective, the conspicuous differences in physical conditions can be ascribed to a number of causes. Medical, social, and psychological factors are evidently linked by complex interactions out of which interdisciplinary approaches for improving the state of health, in particular that of older men, are derived. Fundamental research questions, necessary for the adaptation of sex-specific health care to benefit both sexes, can then be developed.Key Words: HEALTH CARESEX-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCESMALE ROLE",

The hormones analyzed in serum included melatonin, total testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin, Cortisol, total thyroxine, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Blood was collected at 4-hourly intervals over one complete 24-h cycle from 18 patients with prostate cancer, from 20 patients with unoperated benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) serving as age-matched controls, and from 18 young men. The single cosinor method was used for the mathematical analysis of circadian rhythmicity. The most obvious result was that the circadian amplitude of melatonin was drastically depleted in prostate cancer patients compared to those with BPH (-71%). Prostate cancer patients with primary tumors staged as T2 and higher showed extremely low melatonin levels, leading to the loss of detectable circadian rhythms. A similar trend was observed for prolactin in prostate cancer patients. A further prominent finding was that the MESOR (rhythm-adjusted 24-h mean) of TSH was clearly depleted in prostate cancer patients compared to those with BPH (-46%), showing very low values in patients with T2 and T3/T4 tumors in spite of normal total thyroxine concentrations. The circadian profiles of total testosterone, LH and Cortisol did not exhibit any marked cancer-specific changes, indicating that neither the pituitary-gonadal nor the pituitary-adrenal axis was affected by malignant growth. The observed circadian endocrine disturbances in prostate cancer patients thus show clear central endocrine disturbances. It is at present unclear whether these changes may bear any direct functional significance for the progression and prognosis of prostate cancer. It is, furthermore, unknown how these changes are generated and whether the depression of pineal melatonin secretion may be functionally involved in the observed disturbed circadian secretion of prolactin and TSH.",

    "abstract": "The albumin-bound testosterone diffuses easily from the systemic circulation to organs and tissues and it is now common knowledge that ‘free’ (1–2%) and albumin-bound testosterone (30–40%) should be considered as the steroid signals at work in the cell nucleus. Currently, these two androgen fractions are put together under the appellation of bioavailable testosterone while the rest of the testosterone pool is bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). In this paper, we have brought to life a method we published 25 years ago which was based on the utilization of the ammonium sulfate precipitation of SHBG in order to determine bioavailable testosterone. The method is applied to the evaluation of bioavailable testosterone in 304 healthy men. Bioavailable testosterone was measured directly by a radioimmunoassay in the supernatant of 100μl serum exposed to a 50% cold and saturated ammonium sulfate solution (100 μl). With each decade of life, we show a progressive and rather linear decrease of bioavailable testosterone with an unequivocal interindividual variability. By the age of 60, very few individuals have bioavailable testosterone values lower than 2 nmol/l. The setting up of such a threshold below which a man should be considered as hypogonadal is of paramount importance. It is currently justified, both for the security of the patients and for the evidence-based practice of physicians, and also in terms of clinical trials which will be sponsored for a few decades to assess the benefits of androgen therapy in milder cases of hypogonadism or partial androgen deficiency in men who have reached the age of 50 years or more.",

Following oral administration of the melatonin preparations, the concentrations of both melatonin in serum (dogs and humans) and its main metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMEL6s) in urine (humans) were analyzed by means of specific radioimmunoassays. The following mean peak concentrations of melatonin in human serum were reached at 0.5–0.75 h (Cmax1pmol/ml): 20.7(A), 16.4 (B) and 9.1 (C). Capsules B and C released a second melatonin pulse after about 3.5 h, with Cmax2 of 13.0 and 17.5 pmol/ml, respectively. Dose proportionality for the melatonin preparations studied was calculated by determining the area under the curve (AUC0-10h) (pmol/ml, h): 18.4 (A), 36.1 (B) and 42.4 (C). The terminal serum half-lives of melatonin in male subjects ranged between 0.64 and 0.84 h. The time course of the renally excreted aMEL6s correlated with that of the respective melatonin serum concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Objective. To determine the prevalence of osteoporosis at the distal forearm in a male cohort referred for bone density testing and to compare it to published data of Bulgarian women.Design and subjects. 315 consecutive Bulgarian men aged 20 to 84 years were included (mean age 53.74 ± 14.67 years). 59% of them were self-referrals. The comparative female group consisted of 8869 Bulgarian women whose forearm bone mineral density (BMD) was measured in another study.Measurements. BMD was measured by single X-ray absorptiometry at the distal forearm (distal and ultradistal sites) in all men. T-scores were calculated from manufacturer-provided Danish male reference data.Results. The ratio of female to male patients was 28.2 (8869 to 315). Peak BMD was observed in men aged 30 to 39 years: 0.560 ± 0.065 g/cm2 (distal site) and 0.490 ± 0.070 g/cm2 (ultradistal site). A steady BMD decline followed reaching 0.492 ± 0.064 g/cm2 at the distal and 0.412 ± 0.069 g/cm2 at the ultradistal site in age group >70. Age had a rather weak negative impact on forearm BMD described by a linear model. In men aged over 50 years the prevalence of osteoporosis at the distal site was 21.19%, compared to 20.45% in women. Low bone mass was seen in 48.77% of men and 32.50% of women. Normal BMD was more frequent in women (47.05%) than in men (30.04%).Conclusions. We found a high prevalence of forearm osteoporosis in Bulgarian men which is comparable to that already known in women.",

In contrast, the effect of endogenous sex hormones, specifically estrogen, on cardiovascular disease, inflammation and clotting parameters in men has not been well-studied. Men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer provide a unique model to study the effect of estrogen alone on inflammation and clotting factors. In a short-term randomized controlled trial of 17-β estradiol (E2) versus placebo, we measured sex hormones, markers of inflammation including homocysteine (HC), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and coagulation factors including fibrinogen, plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and anti-thrombin-III (AT-III) in 27 older men without bone metastases receiving androgen deprivation therapy or neoadjuvant treatment for prostate cancer. After 9 weeks of E2 treatment, there was no difference in inflammation or clotting parameters between groups, but after 9 weeks of treatment AT-III increased in the E2 treated group and decreased in the placebo group. CRP, homocysteine and IL-6 did not show any significant differences. We also evaluated the above parameters in 12 men 3 weeks after acute steroid withdrawal with androgen deprivation therapy and found no significant changes.We found an increase in AT-III in men receiving E2 which may be related to gonadal steroid withdrawal, but no significant differences in other inflammatory or clotting factor parameters. While the current report is very preliminary in a small group of subjects, further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of E2 in this population of hypogonadal men.",

To assess physical activity level over the previous week, we used the International Physical Activity Questionnaire 8 (IPAQ). Pelvic floor muscle strength was assessed via anorectal manometry. The results shows a negative correlation between resting pressure and MET, a positive correlation between rectal pressure and resting and maximum pressure.

Testosterone (ng/mL) was measured by immunoassay among men who participated in the morning examination session. We analyzed 24-h dietary recall data to estimate caffeine intake (mg/day). Multivariable weighted linear regression models were conducted.Results: We identified no linear relationship between caffeine intake and testosterone levels in the total population, but there was a non-linear association (pnonlinearity < .01). Similarly, stratified analysis showed nonlinear associations among Mexican-American and Non-Hispanic White men (pnonlinearity ≤ .03 both) and only among men with waist circumference <102 cm and body mass index <25 kg/m2 (pnonlinearity < .01, both).Conclusion: No linear association was identified between levels of caffeine intake and testosterone in US men, but we observed a non-linear association, including among racial/ethnic groups and measurements of adiposity in this cross-sectional study.

At 12 months, the patients were divided into two groups according to an improvement grade in BOO index (BOOI). Patient characteristics including age, serum total testosterone level (TT), PSA, and prostate volume, and subjective and objective parameters on LUTS were set as candidates of pre-treatment factors, and the parameters that influenced the improvement of BOO were statistically analysed.A total of 69 patients with mean age of 69.8 years and mean prostate volume of 48.8 mL were included. Subjective symptoms and BOOI were significantly ameliorated after 12 months. In terms of an improvement of BOOI, 30 patients (43.5%) showed insignificant improvement in BOO, whereas 39 patients (56.5%) exhibited excellent improvement. Comparison of pre-treatment factors between the groups showed that TT was the only independent predictor related to the improvement in BOO. The improvement of BOO was significantly better in patients with higher TT.Pre-treatment TT was considered to be a useful predictor of therapeutic effects of tadalafil for BOO.",

We recorded age, prostate volume, PSA level, and pathology report findings. Patients grouped according to PSA levels and compared for PCa detection rates, and several parameters. We created 16 prostate biopsy scenarios (S1-S16) and applied these to our database to find out the best biopsy protocol to detect PCa.A total of 336 patients with a mean age of 70.5 (47-91) years were included. Mean PSA level was 190.6 (20-5474) ng/ml. PCa detection rates were 55.3%, 81.0%, and 97.7% in patients with PSA levels 20-49.99, 50-99.99, and ≥100 ng/ml, respectively. PSA level was correlated to clinically more important digital rectal examination findings. We selected 2 cores in S1-S6, 4 cores in S7-S12, and 6 cores in S13-S16. We calculated the sensitivity of each scenario and found that all scenarios in PSA Group 3 had a sensitivity >95%. In Group 2, S8, S10, S13, and S14 and in Group 1, only S14 had sensitivity >95%.It is not necessary to take 10-12 core biopsy samples in men with PSA levels >20 ng/ml. We recommend taking 2, 4, and 6 samples for patients with PSA levels ≥100 ng/ml, 50-99.99 ng/ml, and 20-49.99 ng/ml, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Background: It is well known that erectile dysfunction (ED) is associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) development. On the other hand, prolongation of the duration of atrial electromechanical delay (AEMD) is known to be a precursor for AF development. We aimed to evaluate AEMD in patients with ED patients without documented AF.Methods: Total of 68 outpatients with previously documented vascular ED and 44 participants without ED were enrolled to the current study. Sixty-eight patients with ED called as ED group and 44 participants without ED served as control group. We performed International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire for all participants to determine the disease severity of ED groups and to diagnose ED in control groups. Patients with a IIEF-5 score ≥22 were defined as having normal erectile functions. Both intra- and inter-AEMD were measured with tissue Doppler imaging. P-wave dispersion (PWD) was measured on a 12-lead electrocardiogram.Results: Basal characteristics were similar between the two groups. PWD, inter- and right intra-AEMD were significantly prolonged in patients with ED, compared to the control group (p = .02, p < .001 and p < .001, respectively). In the correlation analysis, IIEF-5 score was significantly negative correlated with systolic blood pressure, right intra- and inter-AEMD (r = -0.37, p = .02; r= -0.27, p = .02; r = -0.39, p = .001, respectively).Conclusions: According to current study results, AEMD is significantly correlated with ED severity and may be useful to stratify ED patients to the high-risk group for future development of AF as a cheap and easy method.",

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of a combined treatment (CT) involving intramuscular testosterone injection and testosterone ointment application [Glowmin® (GL)] with intramuscular injection monotherapy (IMIM).Materials and methods Patients were randomly assigned as follows: Group 1 received IMIM for 12 weeks and CT for 12 weeks and Group 2 received CT for 12 weeks and IMIM for 12 weeks. Patients were then asked about their treatment preferences: (A) IMIM, (B) a combination of IMIM and ointment, or (C) either A or B.Results Patients (n = 43) completed the study without any adverse effects. No significant differences between each treatment period were found. In Group 1, most patients chose B (n = 13) while in Group 2, most chose A (n = 10). In each group, patients preferred the second treatment phase; however, statistical significance was not reached between A and B (Group 1, p = 0.11 and Group 2, p = 0.47, respectively).Conclusion TRT by CT is compatible with TRT by IMIM. Patients who cannot continue TRT because of polycythemia from IMIM may be suited to CT.",

Twenty patients with bilateral kidney patients (group 2) were included in the analysis, which constituted an age-matched control group. The patients' characteristics, stone characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, including bleeding and transfusion rates, operative time, complications, hospital stay, stone-free rates (SFR) and renal function were evaluated.Mean age of the patients in groups 1 and 2 were 63.7 (range 48-73) and 64.8 (range 48-77). Mean stone size was 814 ± 390 mm2 in group 1, and 820 ± 405 mm2 in group 2 with no statistical significance (p = .35). The final SFR in the solitary kidney and bilateral kidney group was 87.5 and 90% (p = .07). Bleeding requiring transfusion, prolonged leakage from nephrostomy tract, mean operation time and access number were comparable between two groups (p > .05). However, the nephrostomy removal and hospital stay time were longer in the solitary kidney group (p < .05). The rate of perioperative DJ insertion was also higher in solitary kidney patients. A significant improvement was detected in creatinine and glomerular filtration rate levels in the sixth months after surgery in solitary kidney patients (p < .05).These results indicate that PCNL is a safe and effective method in aging male patients with a solitary kidney.",

Age ranged from 17 to 64 years with a mean of 35 years old. PCL was separated for sampling in femoral and tibial portions. Topographic distribution and frequency within the ligament texture were determined employing the Pro-Image digital analysis system. Mechanoreceptors were counted and classified according to the criteria proposed by Freeman & Wyke.Results: A total of 1820 mechanoreceptors were found, Type II being the most frequent one. Analysis of the femoral portion of the ligament showed an equivalent predominance of Types II and IV mechanoreceptors. Tibial portion had a predominance of Type II mechanoreceptors, followed by Type IV. At this portion, receptors Types I and III were less commonly identified.Conclusion: In the tibial portion of the PCL, there is predominance of Type II mechanoreceptors followed by Types IV, I and III mechanoreceptors, respectively.

We then investigated patients with adverse drug events (ADEs) or unexpected illnesses transferred to our hospital during the whole year of 2010.We analyzed the medicine of elderly patients in long-term care institutions. Four long-term care institutions with different types and sizes located near Fong-Yuan Hospital in downtown Fong-Yuan were investigated. In this study, the researchers divided potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) into two categories: (a) those with or without the drug-drug interaction (DDI) and (b) those with narrow therapeutic index drugs. Variables were reclassified as inferential statistics for analysis by using the independent t-test or Mantel-Haenszel test.The data for age, gender, presence or absence of dementia, brain damage and Parkinson's disease were divided into two groups for those patients with or without PIMs. There were no statistically significant differences among the groups. However, the numbers of chronic diseases for the group with PIMs were higher, and the numbers of drug items with PIMs were also higher. In addition, we investigated the presence or absence of PIMs for patients transferred to our hospital with ADEs and unexpected illnesses. The results showed no statistically significant differences among the groups.Our results showed that elderly patients who had consultations with doctors and the hidden problems about medication were detected by pharmacists in the privileged hospital had no direct risk with DDI or narrow therapeutic index drugs.

Two research strategies help to define a possible role for DHEA and DHEAS in human behavior: first, to correlate endogenous hormone levels with measures of well-being, mood, aggression, and memory and, second, to administer DHEA and to observe any resulting behavioral changes. A few controlled studies and quite an amount of correlational evidence from very heterogeneous studies on females and males from 4 years of age to senescence suggest weak positive effects of DHEA and DHEAS on well-being and memory functions. Levels of aggression in males are associated with higher DHEA and DHEAS concentrations. However, in women, the antiaggressive effect, predicted from brain research and animal studies, has been partly confirmed. Effects on mood are inconsistent, but DHEA substitution may be beneficial in middle-aged and elderly individuals with decreased endogenous DHEA and DHEAS levels.",

This slow metabolism is due, largely, to its strong binding to serum albumin, and its renal tubular reabsorption. It is metabolized mainly by hydrolysis to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and is also converted to androstenedione and testosterone in peripheral tissues. In contrast, DHEA is metabolized much more rapidly with a t1/2 of 60 min, and a metabolic clearance rate of 2050 1/day. Dehydroepiandrosterone is bound to albumin less strongly than is DHEAS. There is conversion of DHEA back to DHEAS as well as conversion to androstenedione and testosterone. When DHEA is given orally, there is a marked increase in circulating DHEAS, greater than the increase in DHEA, and a lesser increase in circulating androgens.Key Words: DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE SULFATEDEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONEMETABOLISMCLEARANCECONVERSIONS",

    "abstract": "It is believed that the only possibility of an important decrease in death from prostate cancer is the diagnosis and treatment of the disease at a localized stage. As a response to this need, the present study was started in a population of 46 193 men aged 45–80 years registered in the electoral roll of Quebec City and its metropolitan area. These men were randomized between screening and no screening in a study aimed at assessing the impact of prostate cancer screening on cancer-specific death. At first visit, screening included measurement of serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA) using 3.0 ng/ml as the upper limit of normal, and digital rectal examination. Transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate was performed only if PSA and/or digital rectal examination were abnormal. At follow-up visits, only PSA measured annually was used as a screening test during the recent years. The prostate cancer death rates during the 8-year period of this study were 48.7/100 000 and 15/100 000 man-years in the unscreened and screened groups, respectively, for a 3.25 odds ratio in favor of screening and early treatment (p < 0.01), or a 69% decrease in the incidence of prostate cancer death.The present data show that screening is an efficient, reliable and acceptable technique for detecting localized prostate cancer in the general population. Coupled with treatment of localized disease, the present approach demonstrates, for the first time, that early diagnosis and treatment result in a dramatic decrease in death from prostate cancer. If the current trend continues, the data suggest that, among the male population in the United States, the present approach could save 2.0 million lives of the 3.0 million men expected to die from prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "We use data from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study to approximate the total current knowledge about prostate cancer and to evaluate the relative contributions of various risk factors. The sum total of current knowledge is assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and by the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic in a logistic regression model that includes 30 risk factors identified in the literature that are available in the data set. Relative contributions are measured using the adjusted generalized R2 (AR2). To measure relative contributions, we group risk factors with similar etiology and then remove groups and compare the AR2 attained without each group to the AR2 with all variables included. The overall model fits adequately. The A UROC is 0.788, relatively far from its default value of 0.5, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic has a p value of 0.926. We conclude that, while some knowledge about prostate cancer has been accumulated, there are still more risk factors yet unsuspected. The relative importance analysis shows that immutable factors (i.e. age, genotype) contribute 42%, dietary factors 30%, other lifestyle factors 15%, and endocrinological factors 11%. We recommend that age and other unchanging factors should be the primary focus of screening and risk evaluation and that future interventions should center on nutritional behavior.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by numerous functional and phenotypic changes in T cells, B cells and monocytes/macrophages; moreover, increases in autoimmunity, infections and occurrence of cancer have been reported in aged people. Healthy elderly persons, defined according to the criteria of the SENIEUR protocol, show various alterations in immunocompetent cells. Recent data have shown that the distribution of the subsets of peripheral blood, T-cell subtypes, is influenced by age. With increasing age, CD45RA(+) naive cells are replaced by CD45RA(-) memory CD4(+) T cells. In the CD8(+) T-cell subset, we found an increased proportion of cells co-expressing CD57. In monocytes also, some alterations of the immunophenotype, for example the expression of the adhesion molecule CD54, were observed. A relative deficit of transendothelial migration with aging was found in T cells, whereas this function was not impaired in monocytes. The immunophenotype and the function of dendritic cells do no t appear to be affected by aging. Due to their capacity to present antigens to T cells and to induce T-cell proliferation, dendritic cells may provide a useful tool for immunotherapy. In conclusion, investigations of immune functions in aging people reveal that there is an alteration of the immunophenotype of T cells and monocytes. Several functions of T-cell accompanying mechanisms, for example cytokine production and cell migration, are also affected by aging. In contrast, dendritic cells do not seem to be influenced by the aging process.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: After middle age, some men show androgen-deficiency symptoms leading to so-called PADAM (partial androgen deficiency in aging males). We tested the oral form of testosterone, testosterone undecanoate (Andriol®, NV Organon, The Netherlands), in men with PADAM and evaluated its efficacy and safety in Korean male patients. Methods: We included those patients with the clinical symptoms of PADAM who had decreased levels of serum total testosterone (< 2.8 ng/ml) or free testosterone (< 13 pg/ml). We excluded patients with biopsy-confirmed prostrate cancer, abnormal findings in digital rectal examination or prostate specific antigen testing (until prostrate cancer was ruled out), breast cancer, severe voiding symptoms and secondary hypogonadism. At the first visit, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Korean Andropause Questionnaires were administered; complete blood count, the lipid profile, and levels of total and free testosterone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prostate specific antigen were measured and a digital rectal examination was given. Patients were administered oral testosterone undecanoate 160 mg daily for 3 weeks. The dosage was then decreased to 80 mg daily and changes in symptoms were assessed at every visit. After 3 months, serum tests, including testosterone, were repeated. Results: We evaluated 28 patients who had received testosterone undecanoate for more than 3 months. The patients' mean age was 56.1 (48-68) years. The score of the Korean Andropause Questionnaire changed from 56.2 ± 21.7 at baseline to 52.9 ± 21.3 (p = 0.03) after 3 weeks, to 49.3 ± 19.3 (p = 0.03) after 8 weeks, and to 46.5 ± 25.6 (p = 0.028) after 12 weeks. With respect to sexual function, mean IIEF scores were 37.2 ± 19.6 at baseline and 38.7 ± 19.2 and 40.2 ± 22.0 (p = 0.033) after 3 and 12 weeks, respectively. Serum total testosterone increased from 2.13 ± 1.20 ng/ml at baseline to 6.04 ± 3.08 ng/ml (p = 0.005) after 12 weeks, and free testosterone was marginally significantly changed from 8.60 ± 2.25 pg/ml to 11.40 ± 3.81 pg/ml (p = 0.13). However, there were no significant changes in liver function tests, red blood cell count or lipid profiles. There were no significant adverse reactions that led to the cessation of the administration of oral testosterone. Conclusion: Oral administration of testosterone undecanoate can improve symptoms of PADAM in Koreans. It may, therefore, be an appropriate treatment option with few adverse effects for PADAM patients.",

    "abstract": "There are many explanations for the sex-specific difference in life expectancy. An important reason for this difference can be found in the genome difference of one sex chromosome. It is obvious that testosterone, as an effective hormonal product of this genome difference, influences not only morphology, physiology and risk profiles of diseases but also social behavior and lifestyle. Statistical simulations are, for physicians, an unusual way to demonstrate differences in human mortality, but they may help to show other, and more abstract, aspects of nature. The Penna model of biological aging is a well-established model for simulating the influence of genetic factors on sex-specific mortality. In this study, the Penna model is explained and modified to take into account the potentially detrimental effects of testosterone on male mortality. This is achieved by a modification of the Verhulst factor, starting with male puberty. We demonstrated that about one-third of the sex-specific difference in life expectancy may be caused by the influence of testosterone in this mathematical aging model. These results do not show that male vices (smoking, drinking, risk-taking behavior, etc.) can be attributed only to testosterone even though it may appear so from the statistics. There are some correlations but not causal relations. It seems, even from the view of a mathematical–statistical simulation, that males are discriminated against regarding mortality and life expectancy. This underlines the need for sex-specific research, social policy and preventive programs (e.g. sports, nutrition) for minimizing the negative impact of male-specific genetic and hormonal factors.",

However, it was felt to be unfortunate that two versions of one language in one country existed. Therefore, an ad hoc committee of both translation teams were asked to develop a harmonized single French AMS Scale. The harmonization meeting developed a consensus item-by-item and the new French reference scale was agreed upon. It was agreed that only this scale should be published to avoid confusion among future users.

On day 0, a sham or orchiectomy surgery was performed according to the groups. Thirty and sixty days after surgeries, the animals from OCX + T group received testosterone intramuscularly, and the rats in all groups were euthanized on day 77. The femurs were removed for micro-CT scanning and biomechanical test.Results: Orchiectomy resulted in a marked trabecular bone damage (p < 0.05), which was not reversed with testosterone treatment (OCX + T group). The femoral strength was lower in orchiectomized animals (p < 0.05), while the bone strength in OCX + T group was similar to that observed in the sham animals (p > 0.05) and correlated to this parameter the deformation of rupture was smaller in OCX + T group.Conclusion: In conclusion, testosterone depletion induced by orchiectomy established an osteoporotic environment, mainly affecting the trabecular bone. Moreover, even though testosterone treatment did not enhance these variables, the hormonal replacement improved the femoral fracture strength and promoted beneficial effects on the biomechanical parameters compromised by castration in femoral bone.",

An anthropologically homogeneous group of 236 males, aged 22–67 years, was subdivided into eight 5-year age categories. The men were healthy and occupationally active inhabitants of the city of Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland. The investigated hormones were measured using standard immunoassays. Trabecular, cortical and total BMC at the distal radius of the non-dominant hand were separately assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) using the Stratec 960 apparatus. All correlations among hormone and densitometric parameters and age were evaluated by use of non-parametric statistics (Spearman coefficient). Reductions in trabecular, cortical and total BMC of approximately 40.0%, 28. 1%and 30.8%, respectively, were found in the peak mass between the age category with maximal BMC values and men aged 55 years and older. The declines in trabecular and total BMC with age appeared to be statistically significant, whereas no analogous correlation between cortical BMC and age was found. We observed a decrease in total testosterone, DHEAS and estradiol levels of approximately 45%, 55% and 32%, respectively, in the maximal concentrations between the age category with peak values and men aged 55 years and older. A distinct decline in hormone levels commenced around 25 years of age. All evaluated steroids demonstrated a significant reduction with age. In our findings, the total testosterone level did not correlate at all with either trabecular, cortical or total BMC at the distal radius. DHEAS levels appeared to be insignificant for mineralization of cortical BMC, whereas a significant correlation was demonstrated between DHEAS and both total (r = 0.18; p = 0.02) and trabecular BMC (r = 0.22; p = 0.003). The last association was the strongest relationship established in the entire study. Estradiol levels, but not total testosterone values, appeared to correlate with all trabecular (r = 0.16; p = 0.02), cortical (r = 0.14; p = 0.04) and total BMC (r = 0.16; p = 0.02) at the distal radius. Total testosterone levels appeared to be insignificant for the degree of age-related changes in male bone mineralization. From the three sex steroids measured in healthy males, the adrenal androgen (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) seems to be the best endocrinological measure of the degree of male skeletal mineralization, especially of the trabecular component, which is clearly the most sensitive to all hormonal fluctuations. However, BMC is traditionally associated with gonadalfunctions, and is not always monitored reliably by total testosterone levels (and by concentrations of estradiol, which is usually converted peripherally from testosterone).",

Loss of androgens in later life is associated with increased bone resorption.The decreases in levels of testosterone, estrogen and vitamin D concomitant with increased parathyroid hormone levels are important mechanisms in the pathogenesis of bone fragility in elderly men. Many men with fractures have underlying causes of bone loss, e.g. alcohol abuse, glucocorticoid medication, intestinal bowel disease.In women, similar changes have been implied in the pathogenesis of senile osteoporosis. The role of estrogens in osteoporotic men is suggested by the association of low bone density and decreased estradiol serum levels in male hypogonadism. The estradiol serum levels of healthy men seem to have clinical impact for the pathogenesis of male osteoporosis, as already investigated for postmenopausal women, albeit less well recognized.At present, no antifracture efficacy studies are available in male osteoporosis. The use of vitamin D in the treatment of male osteoporosis and prevention of hip fractures is justified since vitamin D deficiency is frequently found in elderly men. Testosterone treatment studies have shown a decline of biochemical parameters and an increase in bone formation. More data are needed for the potential therapeutic use of androgens in elderly men with osteoporosis; however, bisphosphonates appear to be beneficial for these patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the independent 'net' effects of hormonal variables (estradiol, free testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels) and lifestyle variables (alcohol consumption, coffee drinking, cigarette smoking, physical activity and muscle strength) on trabecular, cortical and total bone mineral content (BMC) in a group of 236 healthy males, aged 22–67 years. The men were occupationally active inhabitants of the city of Wroclaw, Lower Silesia, Poland. Trabecular, cortical and total bone mineral content, at the distal radius of the non-dominant hand, were assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) using the Stratec 960 apparatus. Sex steroids levels were measured using standard immunoassays. Data on lifestyle variables (alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, coffee drinking and physical activity) were obtained through a questionnaire. Hand-grip strength of the dominant hand was assessed using a standard dynamometer. All statistical analyses were made separately in two subgroups, younger males (aged 22–39 years) and older males (aged 40 years and over). The impact of a particular independent variable on BMC and the extent of determination on BMC by the complex of chosen variables were evaluated using a path analysis. In younger males, the effects of physical activity and muscle strength were the most important among all the factors that influenced BMC, as they contributed to 16.2%, 16.9% and 16.5% of the variability of trabecular, cortical and total BMC, respectively. Taking into consideration cigarette smoking, alcohol and coffee drinking together, the coefficients of determination of the variability in trabecular, cortical and total BMC were 10.6%, 11.3% and 16.1%, respectively. The variances in trabecular, cortical and total BMC levels were determined in only 5.8%, 11.5% and 13.0% by sex steroids, respectively. The influence of free testosterone on trabecular BMC was greater compared with that of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and estradiol; for cortical BMC, the impacts of estradiol and DHEAS were similar and greater than that of free testosterone, and the variability of total BMC was affected mainly by estradiol. In contrast, in older men the effects of physical activity and muscular strength were the least important among all the complexes of independent variables, as they contributed to 4.5%, 7.8% and 7.0% of the variability in trabecular, cortical and total BMC, respectively. Taking into consideration the influences of cigarette smoking, alcohol and coffee drinking, the coefficients of determination of the variability in trabecular, cortical and total BMC were 16.5%, 14.8% and 17.4%, respectively. Among the older men, the variances in trabecular, cortical and total BMC were determined in only 9.4%, 6.3% and 13.6% by sex steroid levels, respectively. The influence of DHEAS on trabecular BMC was greater when compared with that of estradiol and free testosterone, whereas the variability of both cortical and total BMC in older men was affected mainly by estradiol. It is quite striking that, in younger healthy subjects, both physical activity and muscle strength contributed to a greater extent to BMC variance when compared with sex steroids levels, whereas, in older men, physical activity and muscular strength were less important than androgen- estrogen activity in determining the variability of BMC. This may suggest that the tropic effect of mechanical force influences bone structure mainly in younger men; probably male bone tissue becomes less prone to mechanical stimuli during aging. It is astonishing that both in younger and older men the coefficients of determination of physical activity and muscle strength were the highest for cortical BMC, which would indicate the greatest response of that part of the bone tissue to mechanical force. It is worth noting that the coefficients of determination of the complex of lifestyle factors (alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and coffee drinking) were higher in older men compared to younger Polish males. This can be explained by the longer exposure of male bone to environmental influences (ethanol, nicotine, caffeine) during a lifetime. Our study revealed that all the evaluated variables were related to the variability in BMC in healthy Polish men, but the coefficients of determination differed depending on the age of the examined subject and on the BMC of a particular bone component. This suggests that the responsiveness of male bone tissue to environmental factors changes with age, and that these effects vary significantly between particular parts of the male bone structure.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, prostate cancer has become the mostly common diagnosed malignancy in the United States. Because prostate cancer preferably affects elderly males and usually progresses slowly, there is an increasing interest in the significance of co-morbid conditions complicating the course of the disease. Several scores have been applied to assess the co-morbidity in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and to estimate the impact of concomitant diseases on survival. Patients in their eighth decade of life, diagnosed with well or moderately differentiated localized prostate cancer and suffering from severe co-morbidity, are likely to die of causes other than the malignancy. Clinical trials evaluating different treatment modalities for localized prostate cancer need controlling and stratification for age and co-morbidity. The life expectancy of patients with only one controlled concomitant disorder, however, is not significantly compromised and the management of these patients remains controversial.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis of hypoandrogenism in the aging male is still difficult, since the symptomatology is aspecific and multifactorial, and it is unknown whether the androgen requirements of elderly men are the same as those of young men. Indeed, there are arguments for decreased (increased androgen feed-back sensitivity) as well as for increased (decreased concentration of androgen receptors) requirements in elderly men. In the absence of a reliable, clinically useful, parameter of androgen activity, we have to rely on plasma androgen level, an indirect parameter. In the absence of convincing arguments for altered requirements with age, we consider that the normal range of (free) testosterone levels in young adults is also valid for elderly men, the lower normal limit being 11 nmol/l for total testosterone and 0.225 nmol/l for free testosterone. There are indirect, suggestive clinical arguments for accepting these limit values. The diagnosis of hypoandrogenism in elderly males requires both the presence of clinical symptoms and decreased (free) testosterone levels. The best methods for determining free or bioavailable testosterone, are equilibrium dialysis and ammonium sulfate precipitation, respectively. They are, however, time-consuming techniques which are not easily automated. Calculation of the free androgen index (testosterone/sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) is not a valid method for male serum. Calculation of free testosterone from total testosterone, SHBG and albumin concentration, yields values that are in good agreement with values obtained by dialysis or ammonium sulfate precipitation. Several conditions should, however, be fulfilled: reliable methods for the determination of testosterone and SHBG, SHBG measurement in serum and not in plasma, use of fresh serum (not repeatedly frozen and thawed), absence of (exogenous) steroids competing for binding sites on SHBG and blood samples taken between 08.00 and 10.00 in the fasting state. Under these conditions an excellent correlation with dialysis and bioavailable testosterone (ammonium sulfate precipitation) is generally obtained.",

It is based on a qualitative study on perceptions of erectile dysfunction in the Malaysian multicultural society. Six focus groups were conducted, consisting of 69 women, aged between 40 and 70 years, recruited from the general public and who had given informed consent. The findings revealed that the women were aware of erectile dysfunction and Viagra. Due to their concern about the negative aspects of Viagra, the Chinese and Malay traditional methods of treatment were commonly mentioned. The women from three ethnic groups viewed the possibility of their husband starting to take Viagra with lots of suspicion, mistrust and fear. They would prefer their husband discussing with them the issue of resorting to taking Viagra. The Chinese and Indian women perceived that if a man takes Viagra, it will boost his ego and he will feel more manly. Indian women felt that a man taking Viagra is proof of his love for his wife. The Malay women felt that a man would be ashamed and have a low self-esteem if he were to resort to taking Viagra. Although Viagra is meant for the male, understanding of women's perception of it is beneficial for a couple's sexual relationship.",

    "abstract": "Andropause (also known as androgen decline in aging males) has implications for the reproductive health and quality of life of older males. Very few studies have, however, been reported among the Nigerian population on andropause-related issues. This study assesses the perspective and level of awareness of married men in Ile-Ife, South-west Nigeria, of andropause. We also assessed their experience of erectile dysfunction, using a questionnaire based on the review of the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction. The study involved 355 married men, aged between 30 and 70 years. Our result shows a high level of misconception about andropause among our respondents, with 38.9% indicating that it is a myth, and another 23.6% attributing it to various causes other than being a natural aging process. We recorded a prevalence of erectile dysfunction of 43.8% (8.0% severe dysfunction and 35.8% moderate dysfunction). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction increased significantly with age, varying from 38.5% for age 31-40 years to 63.9% for the older age group of 61-70 years. The trend in prevalence of erectile dysfunction with age was significant (p < 0.05). An odds ratio of 2.82 (95% confidence interval 1.19-6.76) was recorded for the prevalence of erectile dysfunction at age 61-70 years compared with age 31-40 years. Our findings indicate a need for health education about andropause in Nigeria, and increased attention to the reproductive health concerns of males, and the older population.",

To analyse the relation between results of the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) questionnaire for aging males, and of quality of life (QOL) questionnaire SF-12 and cardiovascular risk factors.Methods. 1,927 men aged 55–85 years were interviewed by 56 general practitioners. During the interview the men were asked to fill in the AMS scale and the QOL questionnaire SF-12.Results. Of 1,927 men 1,806 men filled correctly the AMS questionnaire. The mean SF-12 mental index was respectively 55.9 in men with a total AMS score indicating no impairment, 50.9 mild, 42.8 moderate, and 32.8 severe impairment. The corresponding values for the physical index were 51.2, 46.7, 40.8 and 32.3.A history of diabetes was associated with an increased risk of reporting moderate/severe impairment: in relation to the total AMS score the odds ratio, (OR), of moderate/severe impairment in comparison with no impairment was 1.6 (95%CI 1.2–2.1). A history of myocardial infarction and hypertension increased the risk (respectively OR 1.4 (95%CI 1.1–18) and 1.7 (95%CI 1.2–2.4)).Conclusions. This study shows that higher AMS scores are associated with lower SF-12 indices and suggests that elevated values of the AMS score are associated with cardiovascular risk factors or diseases.",

The number of men with erection disturbances increases significantly simultaneously with the elevated LH concentrations between 40 and 70 years. It is possible that the elevated LH concentrations may influence locally the erectile mechanisms. The precondition for this is the expression of LHCG receptors in the penis. Penile tissue was obtained from three patients undergoing total or partial penectomy due to a rectal cancer with secondary penile metastasis or squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. Immunohistochemistry was used for the detection of the LHCG receptor. Positive immunoreaction for LHCG receptors was discovered in the endothelial cells of cavernous spaces in the corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum penis, also in the endothelial cells of the capillary walls in all patients. Our results show that LHCG receptor is expressed in the spongious and cavernous tissue of the human penis. This finding suggests that LH can affect the spongious and cavernous tissue in human and play a significant role in the development of erectile dysfunction among the aging men.",

    "abstract": "Background Cryptococcosis is a major opportunistic invasive mycosis that mostly affects immunocompromised patients.Methods This was an observational study of all culture-confirmed cases of cryptococcosis conducted in the State of Qatar from January 2005 to December 2016. Cryptococcus fungi were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).Results Fourteen culture-confirmed cases of cryptococcosis were identified during the study period. Four patients had a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection with low CD4 count and five were receiving immunosuppressant medications. The rest of the patients were apparently immuno-competent. The central nervous system was the most common site of infection (57%) followed by bloodstream infection (36%) and pneumonia (14%). One patient had a cryptococcal scrotal infection. Twelve isolates were Cryptococcus neoformans and 2 were Cryptococcus laurentii. All isolates were within the wild type ECV values to amphotericin B and fluconazole. Only 2 patients with bloodstream infection (HIV negative) died. The rest were cured of the infection.Conclusion Cryptococcosis is a rare fungal disease in the State of Qatar, mostly diagnosed in Asian immigrants. The central nervous system is the most common site of infection. The presence of the fungus in the blood carries a high mortality.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of the If channel inhibitor, ivabradine on human corpus cavernosum (HCC) smooth muscle tone.HCC samples were obtained from erectile dysfunction(ED) patients (n = 12) undergoing penile prosthesis surgery. Concentration-response curves for ivabradine were exposed to various inhibitory and stimulatory agents. The relaxant and contractile responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS, 10 Hz and 80 Hz) were examined in the presence or absence of ivabradine (10 μM). HCN3 and HCN4 channel expression and localization were determined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of HCC tissues.Increasing ivabradine concentrations dependently reduced the maximal contractile responses of isolated HCC strips induced by KCl (59.5 ± 2.5%) and phenylephrine (84.0 ± 9.8%), which was not affected by nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitors after phenylephrine-induced contraction. Nifedipine and tetraethylammonium inhibited the maximum relaxation to ivabradine by 75% and 39.3%, respectively. Fasudil and sildenafil increased the relaxation response to ivabradine without altering the maximum response. Pre-incubation with ivabradine significantly increased relaxant responses to EFS (p < 0.01) and reduced the contractile tension evoked by EFS (72.3%) (p < 0.001). Ivabradine incubation did not affect the expression and localization of HCN3 and HCN4 channels in the HCC smooth muscle cells.Ivabradine exhibits a relaxant effect on HCC tissues, which is likely to be attributed to the blocking of L-type Ca2+ channels and the opening of K+ channels, independent of changes in the activation of the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate system. Inhibition of HCN channels localized in cavernosal smooth muscle cells may offer pharmacological benefits for patients with cardiovascular risk factors.",

Visceral obesity rather than overall obesity is held more responsible for this relationship. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship of adipose tissue areas and their distribution (subcutaneous and visceral) with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in male patients.The medical data and abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) examinations of male patients diagnosed with PDAC who underwent surgery or a biopsy in our hospital between January 2015 and January 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. An age-matched control group was formed from 49 male patients who underwent CT with a preliminary diagnosis of urinary stone without a history of malignancy and weight loss and no malignancy on CT at the time of presentation. Adipose tissue areas (total [TAT], visceral [VAT] and subcutaneous [SAT]) were measured in both groups, their VAT/TAT, VAT/SAT and SAT/TAT ratios were calculated, and the data were compared between the two groups.Patients with PDAC had significantly greater TAT, VAT and SAT areas than the control group (p = 0.002, p = 0.01, and p = 0.003, respectively). However, there was no significant differences in the VAT/TAT, VAT/SAT and SAT/TAT ratios between the two groups (p = 0.60, p = 0.60, and p = 0.73, respectively).In this study, all adipose tissue areas (VAT, SAT, and TAT) were shown to be increased in male patients with PDAC.

Patients who successfully met the inclusion criteria were interviewed using a structured interview schedule. Information regarding the patient’s medication, demographic data and presence of co-morbidities was collected. Content analysis was compared with patient demographic and medical data, contributing to the analysis.Results: Problems with medication-taking were reported in 58% of patients. All patients without co-morbidities reported issues regarding their medications, whereas only 27% of patients with co-morbidities reported concerns regarding their medications. Statistical analysis revealed that patients without co-morbidities were significantly more likely (p = 0.002) to have complaints with their medications compared to those with co-morbidities. Furthermore, patients with co-morbidities who required help of caregivers to assist with their medication-taking were significantly less likely (p = 0.05) to have complaints with their medications compared to patients who self-managed.Conclusions: Older patients with caregivers who assisted managing their medication-taking had better adherence. Those receiving aid from their caregivers were significantly less likely to have complaints regarding their medications as opposed to those not requiring a caregiver. This highlights the importance of having support for medication-taking in patients with co-morbidities to assist with better adherence.",

    "abstract": "Spirometric obstruction is a prevalent problem in older adults and related to life-style risk factors. Symptoms related to chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease (COPD) are also prevalent symptoms with diverse etiologies – not limited to pulmonary obstruction. Older adults may have unrecognized airway obstruction due to functional limitations or symptoms mis-attributed to age/other co-morbidities. Therefore, spirometric obstruction may clinically be over/under diagnosed. Over last few decades, the burden of smoking-related diseases has increased in older adults. Additional evidence regarding older adults is required. We aimed to study frequency of spirometric obstruction, its over/under diagnosis and tobacco exposure in a group of male nursing-home residents. For spirometric obstruction diagnosis, two different thresholds [(fixed value: 0.70) versus (age-corrected value: 0.65 in residents >65 years of age)] were compared for better clinical practice. One hundred and three residents with 71.4 ± 6.3 years-of-age included. Spirometric obstruction prevalences were 39.8 and 29.1% with fixed and age-corrected FEV1/FVC thresholds, respectively. Age-corrected FEV1/FVC threshold underdiagnosed COPD in 1.9% while fixed threshold overdiagnosed spirometric obstruction in 8.7%. Active smokers were 64.1%, ex-smokers 23.3% and non-smokers 12.6%. Our study suggests high prevalences of spirometric obstruction and smoking in male nursing-home residents in Turkey. We suggest the use of age-corrected FEV1/FVC threshold practicing better than the use of fixed FEV1/FVC threshold in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "There is indisputable evidence that advancing age is associated with a decline in the production of several hormones. The most prominent alterations are related to the sex steroids, but other hormones such as growth hormone and melatonin are also profundly affected. The clinical syndrome of androgen decline in the aging male, or andropause, has been described, but a direct causality between its manifestations and the alterations in a specific hormone is not yet fully established.Concerns exist about the effect of exogenous androgens in various organ systems. The most serious refer to the prostate in general and the development of carcinoma in particular. Current evidence indicates that, with the exception of severe lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms or prostate cancer, the use of androgens is safe. However, experience with chronic androgen administration in the elderly is still limited and caution is needed. Prostate assessment by digital rectal examination and measurement of prostate-specific antigen are mandatory prior to and during treatment. Careful, long-term monitoring must be a serious commitment by both the patient and the physician. A set of general recommendations for androgen supplementation in the aging male is included, with emphasis on prostate safety issues regarding lower urinary tract obstructive symptoms and prostate cancer.",

The current study, a first in Asia, sought to examine the effects of GH therapy on body composition and other endocrine and metabolic functions in a group of healthy elderly Chinese men.Methods A total of 23 healthy elderly Chinese men, aged between 60 and 69 years, were injected subcutaneously, three times weekly, with 0.08 U/kg of recombinant GH for 6 months. Various hormones and biochemical parameters, together with percentage lean body mass and body fat, were measured before, 3 and 6 months after the start and 3 months after the cessation of GH therapy.Results A significant increase in lean body mass, up to 9.1% over baseline values at 3 months post-therapy, and a significant decrease in body fat, up to 3.1%, were noted. GH therapy also induced variable and significant increases in levels of insulin growth factor (IGF-I), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), insulin, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and triglyceride and significant reductions in glucose and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels. No changes in testosterone, free androgen index and cholesterol were noted. A significant and independent correlation was noted between IGF-I and insulin, TSH, DHEAS, glucose and triglyceride levels.Conclusions GH augmentation therapy was effective in improving the body composition of a group of elderly Chinese men. GH-induced positive changes in body composition in the elderly were probably a result of the direct effect of the GH. It is also possible that some of the changes were mediated through GH-induced changes in thyroid hormones, insulin, glucose, triglyceride and DHEAS. However, the mechanism of GH- induced changes in body composition remains to be defined.",

(Percentage of positive cells ? 68.1 +/- 3.7 vs. 81.7 +/- 5.1, p<0.001). The HSCORE yielded similar results (HSCORE 3.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.2, p<0.001). p63 protein expression was significantly positively correlated with spermatogenic function (r=0.87, p<0.01).p63 developed important effect on spermatogenesis and the regulatory effect of p63 on spermatogenesis mainly occurred in the early stage of spermiogenesis in testis.",

A total of 4278 men between the ages of 20 and 59 years participated in the study. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) III criteria.Results. Overall, the prevalences of metabolic syndrome according to the IDF and NCEPIII criteria were 13.6% and 14.8%, respectively. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to the IDF (NCEPIII) criteria among workers in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s were 4.8% (6.1%), 9.9% (12.2%), 18.4% (21.6%) and 25.8% (34.0%), respectively. A plot of the prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to the NCEPIII criteria versus age had a steep gradient and increased sharply for men in their 50s. In contrast, a plot of the prevalence of metabolic syndrome according to the IDF criteria versus age increased in a linear manner.Conclusion. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased among workers according to age, but the increasing trend and the absolute prevalence of metabolic syndrome differed according to the two sets of diagnostic criteria used in this study.",

The power struggle between the older and younger generations that pervaded many of the conflicts and social reform movements of this era was explored in the four most imaginative and acclaimed science fiction television series of the 1960s: The Twilight Zone (1959-1965), The Outer Limits (1963-1965), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Lost in Space (1965-1968). Each show presented the mature male as the bearer of culture, the holder of power and the keeper of the scientific mysteries, but instead of a standardized response to the problem of the 'generation gap' and the ever-increasing polarization of American society along generational lines, these dramas offered both pessimistic and optimistic views of the outcome of contemporary intergenerational social strife.",

    "abstract": "The importance of senile osteoporosis in men as a public health problem has long been underestimated. Elderly men are at substantial risk for fracture, and morbidity after osteoporotic fractures appears to be more serious and mortality more common in men than in women. Risk factors for osteoporotic fractures in men appear to be qualitatively similar to those in women, but there are quantitative differences. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is an important risk factor for fracture in men; however, further clarification of the relationship between BMD, bone geometry and fracture risk is needed before formulating definitive proposals on operational densitometric criteria for diagnosis of osteoporosis in men and the identification of men at high risk for fracture. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying senile bone loss and the pathogenesis of senile osteoporosis in men remains fragmentary with, in particular, the need for further clarification regarding the precise impact of hormonal status in elderly men on skeletal homeostasis. Recommendations on prevention and treatment of senile osteoporosis in men should focus on the minimization of known risk factors for bone loss and falls. Testosterone treatment may be useful in those men with initially low serum testosterone. As to other pharmacological treatment modalities, prospective trials specifically in elderly men, and preferably with fracture incidence as the primary clinical endpoint, are required.",

This retrospective study was to uncover the chronic secondary changes that affect the spinal cord following severe injuries and to evaluate the influence of residual spinal deformity in the development of posttraumatic spinal cord changes. Fifty-eight patients (39 male, 19 female) with complete traumatic SCI and recent Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up were reviewed retrospectively. A minimum of 2 years duration between trauma and MRI study was required (mean 2.9 years [2.1-4.7]). Two groups of patients were formed: with spinal deformity (and or spinal canal compromise) and without spinal deformity (and or spinal canal compromise). MRI of the injured spine demonstrated four major types of spinal cord changes; these are spinal cord atrophy, myelomalacia, syrinx, and focal cyst formation. The correlation of these changes to the presence of spinal deformity and or spinal canal compromise was also studied. Twenty-three patients (40%) of the studied population had more than 30° kyphosis and or 50% compromise of the spinal canal. Chronic spinal cord changes occurred in 25 patients (43%), 17 of these changes occurred in patients with spinal deformity and the remaining 8 occurred in patients without spinal deformity or canal compromise (p ≤ .05). The prevalence of spinal cord atrophy and focal cysts was significantly higher in patients with residual deformity and or spinal canal compromise (p ≤ .05). The authors recommend proper spinal cord decompression and fixation for patients with complete SCI to reduce the chance of secondary SCI.",

Articular cartilage was studied through morphometry and immunohistochemistry. Body mass was 12% less in the OCR group than in the OC group. The articular cartilage from OC rats show thinner medial condyles, fewer chondrocytes, smaller chondrocytes nuclear volume and, in both condyles, a predominance of collagen type II and less collagen density compared to both YC and OCR groups (p < .001). In contrast, OCR articular cartilage show thicker medial condyles, larger chondrocytes nuclear volume and increased collagen density compared to OC group (p < 0.001).

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated that alcohol consumption can decrease bone density and alter its structure. However, most of the studies did not investigate the effects of specific alcoholic beverages. This study determined the effects of chronic consumption of cachaça (a Brazilian beverage containing alcohol) on body weight (BW), tibia bone density and on the tibia collagen density in middle-aged Wistar rats. Rats with 9 months old were submitted for 100 days, to a liquid diet of cachaça diluted in water with a progressive and controlled concentration (10°GL, 15°GL, 20°GL, 25°GL, and 30°GL). Chronic cachaça intake produced a significant decrease in BW and altered bone remodeling, decreasing trabecular bone density. In chronic cachaça-treated group (CT), the production of collagen fibers in bone tissue has predominantly green birefringence. It appears that they are immature fibers that do not exist in the control group, in which there are standard predominantly yellowish mature fibers. In conclusion, chronic cachaça consumption affects the structure of the tibial bone of middle-aged rats by decreasing the bone density and reducing the density of mature collagen fibers.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTesticular aging affects simultaneously the individual and his lineage. In the individual, changes in the vascular and endocrine systems, in the blood-testis barrier and in Sertoli cells, because of increasing age, lead to a decrease in the number of spermatozoa and an alteration in their form and motility. Gamete quality is also low in very young men. These changes lead to a gradual decrease of fertility. In the progeny, paternal aging is responsible for new dominant autosomic mutations which themselves cause different malformations such as achondroplasia, Apert's or Recklinghausen disease, Marfan's syndrome, and, perhaps, certain chromosome X-linked recessive mutations such as Duchenne's myopathy or hemophilia A. Moreover, in mouse, rat and man, a very young age and paternal aging seem to be responsible for a gradual lowering in the level of cognitive functions in the progeny. Thus, the curve corresponding to this phenomenon presents an inverted U-shape, of which the top corresponds in man to about 30 years of paternal age. Maternal age does not appear to play a part in this event. These results pose the problem of the optimum age for fatherhood.Key Words: MALE AGESPERMGENETIC MATURATIONMUTATIONSPROGENYGENETIC SYNDROMESBEHAVIORAL TROUBLES",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction and stroke. It is known that a decrease in estradiol plasma concentration in postmenopausal women results in an increase in fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) concentrations, whereas estradiol replacement therapy decreases the plasma concentrations of these factors. In men, the risk of developing myocardial infarction is higher than in premenopausal women. However, the role of male sex hormones in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis, although the subject of many studies, has not yet been elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the plasma levels of and correlation between androgens, insulin, coagulation and fibrinolytic factors in men with coronary arteriosclerosis with and without a history of myocardial infarction. The study was carried out in a group of 109 non-obese men, aged 28-60 years, with coronary artery disease demonstrated by coronary angiography. In this group, 64 men had a history of one myocardial infarction and ten reported two or more such episodes. The control group consisted of 14 volunteers, who were healthy men aged 39-63 years with normal body weight. In men with coronary arteriosclerosis, the plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and testosterone were lower, whilst insulin, fibrinogen, PAI, PAI activity and lipoprotein(a) were higher in comparison with the group of healthy controls. We found that, in men with coronary arteriosclerosis, those with the highest incidence of infarction demonstrated the most advanced hyper-insulinism, had lower levels of DHEAS and testosterone, the highest fibrinogen plasma concentrations, as well as PAI-1, tPA and PAI activity. A positive correlation between insulin, PAI-1, tPA and fibrinogen has been shown. In conclusion, low androgen and high insulin concentrations, high PAI-1 and PAI activity, high tPA and fibrinogen concentration may be prognostic indicators of myocardial infarction in men with arteriosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHealth-related quality of life is a key element of successful aging. With life expectancy increasing, postmenopausal estrogen/gestagen replacement therapy has been under discussion for some time with the aim of achieving a higher quality of life in old age. For a long time, the relevance of hormonal aging was only discussed with reference to women; however, more recent work deals with concepts that affect both sexes. According to recent studies, numerous symptoms and complaints which may impair quality of life, can be attributed to hormonal changes in old age in both women and men. The majority of age-related complaints, such as a decline in physical performance, decreased sexual activity and a deterioration of general well-being, are strongly reminiscent of the symptoms of classical pituitary disorders in adulthood. Since the early 1990s, scientific studies have also been investigating the influence of hormone 'replacement' in elderly men, using, for example, growth hormones. However, until now there has been no suitable measure for assessing the quality of life specifically in elderly men. In a research project aimed at developing a questionnaire (the VITA™ questionnaire), roughly equal numbers of elderly men and women were asked about their subjective health and quality of life. It was found that men assessed their health-related quality of life very positively in a number of different dimensions of the questionnaire. In the present article the individual aspects of the quality of life of men are described and examples of gender-related differences are presented and discussed.KeywordsQUALITY OF LIFE IN OLD AGE MALE PERSPECTIVE QUESTIONNAIRE PILOT STUDY",

    "abstract": "This paper gives an overview of our own studies and the literature on the biosynthesis and metabolism of estrogens in elderly men, the estrogen action in the male, and the clinical usefulness of estrogen therapy, including the phytoestrogens. Finally, the paper includes a short review of our knowledge of xenoestrogens and men's sexual health. A strong estrogen-deficient status is seen in male patients with mutations of the estrogen receptors or in cases of deviations of the aromatase gene. On the other hand, there are no clear age-dependent changes in estrogen secretion. But, in men with disorders of glucose metabolism and also of increased body mass index, the serum estrogen concentrations are significantly elevated. There are also strong positive correlations between serum estrogen levels and bone density, including prevalence of fractures and mood in men. New fields of interest are natural fatty esters of endogenous estrogens, e.g. lipoprotein-associated estrogens, and the role and clinical significance of tissue-specific, local estrogen biosynthesis (e.g. different promoters of the aromatase gene). Exogenous estrogen treatment is focused today on patients with normal testosterone and low levels of circulating estrogens documented on several occasions and with clinical symptoms of hormone deficiency; male-to-female transsexuals; and selected patients with prostate cancer. Some clinical studies show the benefits of estrogen treatment on some cardiovascular parameters and for treating selected signs of mental stress. An indirect estrogen replacement can occur if dehydroepiandrosterone is given orally to men. The clinical usefulness of dissociated estrogens, including non-feminizing estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators, is still an open question. The beneficial action of phytoestrogens in lowering the clinical symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia is well documented. Finally, the question about the definitive influence of so-called endocrine disruptors (xenoestrogens) on sexual functions in men is also discussed.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) by using Spectrophotometer in CSF.Level of IMA was measured by spectrophotometer. CSF patients were chosen for the determination of IMA level. All obtained data were compared with control groups.Serum IMA levels increased in the CSF group. It was observed that there was a significant increase in IMA levels in patients with CSF when compared to controls (p < 0.05).IMA may play a role in the pathogenesis of CSF. IMA levels in the serum can be considered as a marker to predict coronary slow flow. IMA level can be used as a guide for coronary slow flow. Also, as increases number square frame, value IMA Increases similarly. It was found that the severity of impotence was correlated with CSF. Therefore, the IMA level may be predictive of the course of treatment. This study is the first one to show the relationships of IMA in CSF.

Indications for the procedure were for fertility only. Semen analysis variables were measured against European Association of Urologists (EAU) guidelines at six weeks. Patients were followed-up at clinic in three months. Data were collated using operation notes and cytology results, and analysed using descriptive statistics. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to compare years after vasectomy, and age to sperm count.The average sperm count in our group was 41.3 million per millilitre (median 29.95, range 2.7-107.8) at 6 weeks. Seventy-five per cent were found to have positive sperm motility, and all had acceptable sperm morphology at follow-up.

Berlin Sleep Questionnaire (BSQ) represents a validated screening tool for OSAS. Totally 450 patients admitted to the Sleep Center at Dicle University Medical Faculty were included prospectively. A risk analysis was performed for presence of OSAS using the BSQ. Arterial blood gas measurements were performed including bicarbonate (HCO3) level. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of BSQ for presence of OSAS and severe OSAS were determined. In patients with arterial HCO3 >24.94 mEq/L; sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, of the BSQ were 93.04, 57.1, 98.3, and 23.5%, respectively. The addition of arterial HCO3 value increased the sensitivity of the BSQ in detecting OSAS patients. Although the cost of sleep studies is high for false positives from the BSQ plus arterial HCO3 level, this cost should be compared with the loss of work efficiency and severe healthcare costs of undiagnosed cases in the future. Therefore, finding possible OSAS cases in primary care health centers is important and adding serum HCO3 value to BSQ questionnaire may contribute to this topic.",

Human brucellosis is quite uncommon in Elderly in Qatar.Case report This report describes a case of Brucellosis in acute geriatric unit under Rumailah Hospital in Qatar. The patient was an 81-year-old Qatari Gentle man, functionally able to walk with minimal assistance and had mild cognitive impairment who presented with high-grade fever with chills, anorexia, low back pain and arthralgia for 10 days. The above complaints occurred often for 1 month and had fever intermittently. Lab investigations revealed as high CRP 117 mg/l, low Hb 9.1 g/dl and mild elevation in ALP (151 µ/l) with normal leukocyte and platelet count. His blood culture positive for Brucella melitensis with high brucella Antibody titter 1:1280. The diagnosis made as Brucellosis.Discussion The clinical manifestations of Brucellosis are fever, night sweating, chills, arthralgia and loss of appetite. It seems pyrexia of unknown origin without other symptoms is most common presentation of Brucellosis in old age. The confirmation of Brucellosis made with serological tests, with significantly high titer, in the presence or absence of blood culture. Brucella antibody titers (≥1:160) are suggestive of active infection. Anemia and raised CRP and liver enzymes were the most prominent laboratory abnormalities in our patients. Previous study from Qatar reported that 41.7% had a history of raw milk consumption and 12.5% had a history of animal contact. The objectives of Brucellosis treatment include the prevention of complications and relapse.Conclusion Our case presented with classical symptoms and received appropriate treatment on time. However, atypical clinical presentation and lack of specific history taking can delay diagnosis and treatment; it leads to serious clinical disease progression with increased complications. From this case study, we would contribute to optimal assessment and to keep differential diagnosis for unknown cause of fever can be Brucellosis in geriatric population.",

Previous studies indicated that the relative length of the index and ring finger (2D:4D ratio) of AGA patients was lower than control. However, the correlation between 2D:4D ratio and disease severity is unclear. In this study, we sought to evaluate the relationship between digit ratio of the right hand and AGA severity in male patients.Materials and methods: The cross-sectional study was performed. Hamilton-Norwood scale was used to assess severity. The finger lengths of the right hand were measured using a digital caliper.Results: Our study found that the lower the right-handed 2D:4D ratio, the greater the risk of developing AGA and that the severity of AGA increases with age. Patients with moderate and severe AGA (grade 3 and above) had lower 2D:4D ratios and higher average age compared with patients with mild AGA (Norwood grade 2). Patients aged ≥37.5 with a 2D:4D ratio <0.947 were six times more likely to have moderate-to-severe androgenetic alopecia compared with the reference group (OR: 6.11; 95% CI: 1.96-19.04).Conclusions: Combining 2D:4D ratio and older age may help predict the severity risk of AGA, and offer a clinically accessible, non-invasive approach for patients to easily predict their future severity.",

The study was conducted in 1433 centres across 21 countries and comprised a baseline patient visit and up to four follow-up visits during an observational period of 1 year. Relationship quality, happiness, satisfaction with vardenafil treatment, and safety and tolerability were assessed by physician interviews and patient and partner questionnaires. Overall, 7496 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 7430 were included in the safety analyses and 6470 in the effectiveness analyses. Relationship quality, assessed by a relationship questionnaire (partnerschaftsfragebogen [PFB]), was improved at last observation carried forward, compared with baseline, in both patients and partners and satisfaction with the effectiveness of vardenafil treatment was high. Vardenafil was well tolerated and adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. These results confirm the well-established effectiveness and safety profiles of vardenafil. This study is the first to demonstrate improvements in relationship quality following vardenafil therapy, in both patients and partners, using the PFB questionnaire.",

The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is used to categorize the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and related symptoms in hypogonadal men. Testosterone therapy (TTh) has previously shown potential in improving total IPSS in men with hypogonadism. However, concerns regarding the effects of urinary function following TTh often prevent treatment in hypogonadal men. To explore this further, two population-based single-center, prospective, cumulative registry studies were combined to contribute to a total population of 1176 men with symptoms of hypogonadism. The total population was separated into a TTh group receiving testosterone undecanoate (TU) for up to 12 years and a control group that did not receive treatment. IPSS was recorded at both baseline and at final recorded visit for each patient. Long-term TTh with TU in hypogonadal men resulted in significant improvements in IPSS categories, even in patients with severe symptoms at baseline. In the control group, untreated hypogonadal men experienced a worsening of IPSS categories. These data indicate that TTh improves LUTS in men with hypogonadism and suggest that previous concerns regarding urinary function may have been overstated.",

Subjective health, which is the perception of one's health status, predicts both mortality and declining physical function in older adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors related to subjective health among centenarians and near-centenarians (ages ≥95) living in a rural area of South Korea.A total of 101 participants were enrolled from four different regions (Gurye, Gokseong, Sunchang, and Damyang), known as the Longevity Belt in Korea. Variables assessing physical and mental health, including the results of blood tests, were examined. Factors associated with good subjective health were identified with logistic regression analysis.Fifty-six participants (59.6%) were subjectively healthy among the centenarians and near-centenarians. Logistic regression analysis revealed that depressive mood was the only factor associated with subjective health and was negatively correlated. The regression model explained 39% of the variance in subjective health.These findings emphasize the importance of mental health at very advanced ages. Because depressive mood negatively correlates with subjective health, more attention is needed to prevent and manage mood symptoms of people of advanced ages, including centenarians.",

    "abstract": "It is now well documented that bioavailable androgen levels fall with aging. Results of the first studies investigating (Side-) effects of androgen administration to aging men are encouraging. The introduction of designer estrogens as a treatment modality in hormone replacement in women has invited consideration of the concept of compounds with selective androgenic effects for male hormone replacement therapy in general. The full spectrum of the actions of testosterone may not be necessary or even undesired for androgen treatment of the aging male. To define those indications for which certain androgenic properties are desired and undesired, more insight into basic androgen (patho)physiology is required. There is convincing evidence that aromatization of androgenic compounds to estrogens might be an advantage for maintenance of bone mass, and might also mitigate negative effects of androgens on biochemical parameters of cardiovascular risks.The psychotropic effects of androgens may also require aromatization. The potentially negative effects of estrogens on prostate pathology in aging men needs further elucidation. While the role of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in male sexual differentiation and in pubertal sexual maturation is evident, its role in mature and aging males seems less significant or may even be hannful. It is of note, however, that a negative effect of DHT on prostate pathophysiology is certainly not proven. For most of the androgenic actions, the critical levels of androgens are not well established. This is relevant, as the large amount of androgen molecules required for biological actions (compared to estrogens) is an impediment in androgen replacement modalities. There may be room for more biopotent androgens, as delivery of large amounts of androgen molecules to the circulation poses problems for treatment modalities.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMale osteoporosis has a prevalence of around 5% (vertebral fractures). Secondary causes such as gastrointestinal diseases with malabsorption, alcoholism and malignant diseases are common. Hypogonadism is often not diagnosed since clinical signs are subtle. Diagnosis of osteoporosis is made using clinical history (riskfactors), clinical examination (e.g. reduction of stature, backpain), X-ray, densitometry and laboratory work-up. Cut-off values for the WHO classification of male osteoporosis and all densitometry techniques, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT), need to be developed. QUS can be measured at the calcaneus and phalanges. Phalangeal ultrasound is especially useful because it is easily accessible, fast, radiation-free, portable and cheap. Preliminary results show that phalangeal ultrasound may detect structural deterioration, especially inpatients on glucocorticoid treatment, earlier than spinal DXA.The prevention of osteoporosis is based on the intake of calcium and vitamin D or its analogs. In hypogonadal men, or in men with osteoporosis with low-to-normal or decreased testosterone levels, the use of hormone replacement therapy with testosterone for at least 10 years, with yearly andrological examination and prostate ultrasonography, will lead to a significant increase of bone density. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and are the most effective treatment with regards to fracture reduction. Bone-forming drugs, such as fluoride or anabolic steroids, can activate osteoblasts; however, reduction in fracture incidence has not been shown. Parathyroid hormone, growth hormone and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are prospective treatments for the future.Key Words: MALE OSTEOPOROSISULTRASOUND DENSITOMETRYQUANTITATIVE ULTRASOUNDPHALANGESCALCANEUS",

    "abstract": "Age is a meaningful factor modulating the functioning of the human endocrine system. In our research, the factor stimulating the pituitary–gonadal axis was a 400 m race. In this type of effort, glycolytic and lactic acid transformations are dominant and a fundamental increase in lactic acid concentration is noted. The aim of the research was to compare the response of the pituitary–gonadal axis in physically active men of various ages after a 400 m race. Nine men aged 21.7 ± 0.7 years and nine men aged 60.0 ± 3.4 years took part in the study. Blood samples were taken from the elbow vein before the race at 08.00 and immediately after the effort. The levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone and free testosterone were determined in blood sera. The concentration of lactic acid was measured in full blood at 5 min after the race. Before the effort, statistically significant differences in the concentration of FSH and free testosterone between the two age groups were observed (higher FSH in older men but lower free testosterone). No differences in the level of LH, total testosterone and lactic acid were observed. Immediately after the effort, no changes in the level of FSH were found in both groups; a statistically significant decrease in LH concentration was noted only in the group of younger men. In both groups, statistically significant increases in total testosterone, free testosterone and lactic acid concentrations were observed after the race. In the group of younger men, compared to the older, larger increases in free testosterone and lactic acid concentrations, as well as shorter race time, were revealed after the effort test. Analysis of the two groups after the race showed statistically significant differences in FSH, free testosterone and lactic acid concentrations. A positive correlation (r = 0.57) was demonstrated between the after-effort increase in the concentration of free testosterone and lactic acid, and negative correlation (r = –0.66) between the after-effort increase in the concentration of free testosterone and the time of the 400 m race. In older men, the concentration of free testosterone may play an important function in lowering strength capacities. It must be stressed that the 400 m race was a more significant stimulus for changes in hormone concentrations of the pituitary–gonadal axis in younger men (greater changes in the level of the investigated parameters) than in the older. The results obtained allow us to conclude that, in older men, as compared to the younger ones, the response of the pituitary–gonadal axis to an effort stimulus is to some extent different.",

Evaluation included measurements of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin (PRL) concentrations and responses to a special questionnaire. Mean testosterone concentration in aging doctors (374 ± 86 ng/ml) was no different from that of hospital employees of the same age (361 ± 77). However, concentrations of LH, SHBG and PRL in the former group were significantly lower (p < 0.04, 0.01 and 0.004, respectively). Furthermore, the testosterone : LH ratio was higher in the aging doctors group (p < 0.001). Mean testosterone concentration in the combined groups of aging men was lower than that of the younger men (p < 0.00001). Andropenic manifestations related to sexual, physical and mental activity were markedly better in the group of aging doctors in comparison to aging hospital employees. By and large, it appeared that aging hospital doctors had a better physical and mental activity than aging employees and this may have been related to their better lifestyle conditions.",

Methods: In a cross-sectional survey 93 men, age 70 or greater, responded to a random mailing to a suburban community. Sixty-eight men were eligible and 47 participated in the study. Two health status questionnaires, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Short-form 36 (SF-36), were mailed to participants with instructions to complete the surveys on the same day and return them by mail. Blood samples were obtained for bioavailable and total testosterone measurements. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis was used to compare the responses to the SF-36 and SIP and testosterone levels. Results: Of the eligible volunteers 69% participated and were able to self-administer the SIP and the SF-36. Summation scores for the surveys were above those reported in similar age populations. Perfect scores were reported frequently in all subsets of the SIP; perfect scores were reported in 43-92% of men on various subscales. The responses to the SF-36 were also frequently perfect although perfect scores ranged from 2 to 82% on various subsets. There was moderate correlation between the results from the two surveys. There was no correlation between age, SIP or SF-36 and testosterone level. Conclusions: Healthy older men volunteering for clinical research were able to self-administer both the SIP and SF3-6. Responses to both surveys were skewed toward perfect scores; the SIP failed to reveal many men with functional deficits. Bioavailable testosterone levels did not predict perceived health in this group of men.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a complex process modulated by multiple interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Myotonic dystrophy (DM 1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by an unstable (CTG)n repeat expansion in the DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The affected male patients' life expectancy at birth (53.2 years) is more than two decades below that observed in most occidental populations. The DMPK gene expression is pleiotropic and includes the premature expression of several agerelated signs, symptoms and metabolic disturbances including hormonal dysfunctions, progressive decrease in muscular mass, presenile cataracts, alopecia, reduced alertness, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between aging covariates and the severity of DM1 expression in 136 DM1 male subjects. DM1 clinical expression was assessed on a validated neuromuscular disability rating scale and was correlated with plasma total testosterone (rs = -0.31, p < 0.001), luteinizing hormone (LH) (rs = 0.52, p < 0.001) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (rs = 0.54, p < 0.001) levels. Following LH releasing hormone stimulation, FSH and LH concentrations increased as a function of DM1 severity (p < 0.05). Muscular disability in DM1 was also positively associated with fasting plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations (p < 0.05). The association of plasma apolipoprotein B and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with DM1 was not linear across their distribution and tended to reflect cell membrane damage progression. These results suggest that DM1, a simple M endelian trait, can represent a valuable model to illustrate the complex relationships between variables associated with male aging.",

    "abstract": "Some population-based studies on male aging measure testosterone and cortisol in saliva instead of serum, but very few measure estradiol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), suggesting further testing is needed for reliability and comparative validity. In addition, the effects of interview stress and circadian hormone secretion need to be checked. In a pilot study on the overall sexual capacity of aging men, 48 randomly selected, healthy, heterosexual, cohabiting men aged 50–80 years, from Mannheim, Germany, and 50 from the State College, Pennsylvania, USA, were administered a standardized interview covering medical biography, present and previous life and work, marriage and emotional status. Two saliva samples were collected from each subject for measurement of testosterone, cortisol, estradiol and DHEA-S levels before and after the interview, and each subject completed a confidential self-administered questionnaire on intercourse, masturbation, orgasm, fantasies, libido and arousal. Questionnaires, hormone measurement techniques and the survey protocol had been extensively pretested. Prior to the pilot study, the kits for measuring testosterone and DHEA-S in saliva were checked for comparative validity against established measuring techniques in serum in 31 cases for testosterone and in 24 different cases for DHEA-S. These 55 cases underwent clinical diagnosis and were not otherwise involved in this study. The cases had been referred to the Andrology Unit of the University Hospital, Marburg, for reasons unrelated to this study. Given the biological differences for both steroids between their presence in blood and in saliva, a perfect correspondence between the two values was not expected and was not observed. The correlations obtained, however, support the assumption that all statistical relationships between testosterone and DHEA-S values in serum and clinical, as well as behavioral, variables reported to date may be replicated for testosterone and DHEA-S values in saliva.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of erectile dysfunction rises rapidly with age and is a frequent complaint presented in clinical practice. Although the etiology of erectile dysfunction is multifactorial, 10-20% of evaluations demonstrate testosterone deficiency. Testosterone deficiency due to secondary hypogonadism increases with age. Despite a higher prevalence of secondary hypogonadism in the elderly, there are no studies addressing hypothalamic-pituitary structural abnormalities in elderly impotent men with testosterone deficiency. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all elderly men who presented for general outpatient evaluation of erectile dysfunction from 1996 to 1999. To obtain a cohort control population, the records of 300 patients without erectile dysfunction were also reviewed. Amongst the erectile dysfunction patients, 225 were found to be testosterone deficient (testosterone < 300 ng/dl). Of these patients, 29 were additionally diagnosed with secondary hypogonadism based on a luteinizing hormone (LH) < 13 mIU/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) imaging was available and reviewed in all patients diagnosed with secondary hypogonadism. Ten per cent of these patients had hypothalamic-pituitary imaging abnormalities. The prevalence of pituitary tumors within our population was not significantly elevated compared to the previous general population studies. Small-vessel white matter disease, hyperlipidemia and history of compression fractures were significantly increased in both univariate and multivariate analysis in the erectile dysfunction group compared with the control cohort. This study does not suggest that the use of hypothalamic-pituitary imaging in the evaluation of impotence in elderly men, in the absence of clinical characteristics of other hormonal loss or sella compression symptoms, will increase diagnosis of structural hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities over that of the general population. However, the yield may increase with very low testosterone levels. These data suggest that there is an increase in ischemic white matter disease in elderly men with hypogonadism that may reflect microvascular injury to the hypothalamic-pituitary. Furthermore, these data confirm that low testosterone is associated with hyperlipidemia in the elderly. Future studies are required to assess the role of hypogonadism and hyperlipidemia, and to determine if treatment of the hormone deficiency improves the lipid profile.",

The sets of questions asked were graded from 1 to 5 and were related to present and past general mood, physical fitness, mental condition, sexual activity and presence of symptoms of andropenia.A marked reduction in the mean scores for general mood, concentration, physical fitness, sexual mood and ability to initiate or maintain an erection and an increase in the incidence of hot flushes were observed in the subjects studied when their present condition was self-compared to their condition during their early forties. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between the scores for each of these parameters and advancing age in this sample. Questions related to the cause of the problems described, awareness of their possible relationship to andropenia and its long-term consequences, interest in additional information, need for expert advice and to the men's attitudes towards replacement therapy revealed low public awareness, acceptance of the symptoms as an inevitable part of the aging process, an interest in impersonal channels of information and severe apprehension about replacement therapy because of fear of side-effects.These results provide a suitable platform to formulate appropriate communication strategies and to launch efforts to educate this age section of the population about their age-specific problems and the possible therapies for relief.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the frequency of low bone density in elderly males seen in an academic geriatric practice and to evaluate physician awareness of male osteoporosis among academic geriatricians. The participants were elderly community-dwelling ambulatory males aged 65 years and older (n = 35). The mean age was 80.7 +/- 8.2 years, with eight subjects in the 65-74 years range, 16 in the 75-84 years range and 11 over 85 years. Only 5/35 utilized an assistive device for ambulation. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using a heel ultrasound (QUS-2 calcaneal ultrasonometer). Clinical risk factors, gait and balance were evaluated (Tinetti scale). Results of BMD were communicated to the attending geriatrician. In all 7/35 participants had a calcaneal T-score of < or = -2.5 indicating osteoporosis, of these 50% were > 85 years; 7/35 had t score of -1 to -2.5 indicating osteopenia, of these 50% were 75-84 years; and 21/35 had a T-score > -1 indicating normal BMD). Overall, 14 of the 35 subjects studied had low bone density. Gait disorders were seen in 18/35 subjects (p < 0.05), more commonly in the oldest subjects. Risk factors for osteoporosis-related fractures included smoking (n = 22, 63%, p = 0.57), gait abnormalities (n = 18, 51%, p < 0.05) and alcohol use (n = 13, 37%, p = 0.39). Low bone mass (osteopenia or osteoporosis) was not addressed (by record notations, request for DEXA, laboratory testing or medical treatment) within 6 months by the majority of geriatricians (3/5). This pilot study shows a high frequency of low bone density in elderly males seen in an academic geriatric practice. This frail population presents with significant balance and gait disorders, and the coexistence of these two risk factors predisposes them to the development of hip fracture. This study also underscores the importance of increasing awareness of osteoporosis in males among geriatricians. Limitations to this study are that bone density was measured with the QUS-2 calcaneal ultrasonometer, and that female reference values were utilized. These limitations potentially under-estimate the prevalence of bone loss in males.",

Pre and postoperative demographic data, clinical and pathological findings and BCR conditions were recorded. The PSAD was calculated using information obtained through preoperative TRUS examinations, MRI, and collected pathological specimens after RP by dividing the maximum preoperative PSA value and PV/PW.In a mean follow-up duration of 20.2 ± 8.5 months, recurrence was observed in 52 patients (24.4%) and progression was observed in 8 (3.8%) patients. The TRUS-PSAD, MRI-PSAD, and PW-PSAD values were statistically significantly higher in BCR patients compared to non-BCR patients. The International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) grade 5 and pT3b as a pathological stage were detected as independent variables in the prediction of BCR formation. Actual PW had a high prediction value compared to other PSAD measurements at <40 g prostate weights, but it had a low prediction value in prostates with an actual PW >60 g.In this study, it was stated that PSAD acquired through different imaging methods does not affect the usability of PSAD in BCR prediction in clinical practice.

The median follow-up time from primary to the metachronous tumour was higher in group 1 than group 2. The rate of recurrence in PCa was higher in group 1 than group 2. No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of patients' age, smoking status, PSA levels at diagnosis of PCa and biochemical recurrence or metastasis between the two groups (p > 0.05).Primary PCa cases may progress more aggressively than metachronous PCa cases. Biochemical recurrence and metastasis may be less threatening in metachronous PCa cases than primary cases. Therefore, aggressive treatment can be avoided for metachronous PCa cases.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone is associated with sexual desire and performance in men, but little is known about cognitive mechanisms underlying this relationship. Even less is known about the influence of estradiol, despite its production from testosterone, and high receptor density in brain regions related to male sexual behavior. We used eye-tracking to compare men's visual attention to images of fully clothed (i.e. neutral) and minimally clothed (i.e. sexy) models in three groups: androgen-deprived (n = 6) and not androgen-deprived with prostate cancer (n = 11), and healthy controls (n = 7). We also assessed effects of serum testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels. We found no group effect for fixations to sexy compared to neutral images, and no influence of testosterone on either total fixations, or proportion of fixations to sexy images. In contrast, we found that sex hormone binding globulin positively predicted total fixations, and estradiol positively predicted proportion of total fixations on sexy images--regardless of androgen treatment status. Our results suggest that visual attention to sexual stimuli in men may be significantly affected by hormones. This has potential implications for clinical populations that experience sexual side effects, such as prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy.",

We evaluated the risk of bias in such studies using the ROBINS-I tool and analyzed deaths from cancer and deaths from all causes using HR.Results The meta-analysis included 11 studies. The pooled overall HRs for cancer-specific deaths between 5-ARI treatment versus non-exposed groups were 0.937 (95% CI: 0.730, 1.201). In the subgroup moderator analysis, the number of patients and additional medication variables were significantly associated with deaths from all causes (p = 0.022 and p = 0.005, respectively). For detecting the publication bias or small-study effect in the included studies, we performed Begg and Mazumdar’s correlation test (0.851 and 0.573) and Egger’s regression coefficient test (0.035 and 0.245) and ​suggested that there was no evidence of publication bias or small-study effect in this meta-analysis.Conclusions Our study indicated that exposure to 5-ARI had no close association between the overall death rate or cancer-specific deaths. To confirm these results, well-designed prospective studies with large samples are required.",

ED was assessed with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). Patients were divided into the mild/moderate (SHIM score ≥8) and severe ED groups (SHIM score ≤7). Correlations between variables were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of impaired grip strength and gait function on the severity of ED.The median age of the study participants was 62 years; all had ED, with 67% having severe ED. Spearman's rank correlation test demonstrated significant negative and positive correlations between gait function and SHIM score (ρ = -0.257, p = 0.042) and between grip strength and SHIM score (ρ = 0.305, p = 0.015), respectively. In the multivariable analyses, impaired grip strength was significantly associated with severe ED (odds ratio [OR]: 4.965, p = 0.017), whereas gait function was not (OR: 3.147, p = 0.064).Impaired muscle strength was significantly associated with severe ED, whereas impaired gait function had a marginal effect on this erectile condition.",

The power struggle between the older and younger generations that pervaded many of the conflicts and social reform movements of this era was explored in the four most imaginative and acclaimed science fiction television series of the 1960s: The Twilight Zone (1959-1965), The Outer Limits (1963-1965), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Lost in Space (1965-1968). Each show presented the mature male as the bearer of culture, the holder of power and the keeper of the scientific mysteries, but instead of a standardized response to the problem of the 'generation gap' and the ever-increasing polarization of American society along generational lines, these dramas offered both pessimistic and optimistic views of the outcome of contemporary intergenerational social strife.",

Five thousand and twenty-eight volunteer men aged 50–70 years attending a screening campaign for andropause, provided a fasting blood sample and completed the French ADAM test. Logistic regression analysis identified items that best predict andropause defined as serum free testosterone level below 70 ng/l. ROC curves assessed the diagnostic value of modified versions of the ADAM test, obtained by elimination of the less relevant predictors of andropause.Results. Only four items of the ADAM questionnaire may account for the diagnosis of andropause. These items concerned loss of height, decrease in libido and in enjoyment of life and deterioration in work performance. Item 9 was borderline significant. The area under the ROC curve for the short versions varied slightly from 0.555 to 0.560. As expected, model 6 has a greater specificity (56.02%) than the original tool while the efficiency increased slightly (54.85%).Conclusion. The modified versions of the ADAM test do not provide better diagnostic value than the original tool.",

    "abstract": "Partial androgen deficiency or the andropause in the aging male is a complex clinical and biochemical entity that needs to be analyzed at two levels of the constituent structure: the 'deep structure' should come to light with more intensive research, while the 'surface structure' holds the attention of investigators who focus on hormone measurements in the blood to help diagnose the andropause. In this study, it is recognized that bioavailable testosterone decreases progressively during the aging process. This physiological decline may be so important, or so close to castration levels, that aged men may experience numerous symptoms of hypogonadism. The assay for bioavailable testosterone was indirectly validated with a set of equations derived from our knowledge of the law of mass action at equilibrium, as proposed by Vermeulen and colleagues in 1999. With this mathematical model, we have shown that calculated free testosterone was highly correlated with bioavailable testosterone. It is therefore concluded that the evaluation of aged men's androgenicity should rely on at least one of these free testosterone assessments (bioavailable or calculated free testosterone) for the sake of reproducibility in the construction of the 'surface structure' of the andropause in the coming years.",

Despite a confusing clinical presentation with gout symptoms, including repeated episodes of knee arthritis, persistent hypercalcemia conducted further investigations. Biological tests excluded primary or hyperparathyroidism and malignancy-related hyperparathyroidism, confirming the diagnosis of FHH through the detection of an inhibitory mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene. This case suggests to clinicians the possibility of FHH in older patients with unexplained hypercalcemia. In geriatric patients, the diagnosis is complicated because of the poly-pathology: here hypercalcemia was associated with a confusing gout crisis, which was triggered by diuretic treatment for heart failure.",

We therefore set up a prospective study to analyze these associations. Methods In a prospective, cross-sectional study, men aged 45-85 years were recruited. All men completed a questionnaire containing 38 items covering a number of aspects of the aging male. Questionnaires were compiled by using items from previously published and validated questionnaires. Several socioeconomic parameters were also determined. In parallel, serum levels of testosterone, free testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), DHEA-S, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were quantified by commercially available immunoassays. Results A total of 375 men with a mean age of 59.9 ± 9.2 years (mean ± standard deviation) were analyzed. Average DHEA-S and estradiol levels of 135.8 ± 90.9 μg/dl and 29.7 ± 14.6 pg/ml, respectively, were recorded. DHEA-S serum levels were negatively correlated to patient age, sexual function score, total score and PSA. Estradiol serum levels were positively correlated to testosterone and free testosterone. None of the other scores or questions revealed a correlation with DHEA-S or estradiol serum levels. Conclusion This prospective study elucidates only small interactions between partial androgen deficiency of the aging male (PADAM)-related symptoms and serum levels of DHEA-S and estradiol. Nevertheless, the data suggest an impact of DHEA-S on sexual function.KeywordsAGING DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE SULFATE ESTRADIOL QUESTIONNAIRES",

The mechanisms by which the metabolic syndrome induces hypogonadism are increasingly being elucidated. It is now clear that insulin resistance decreases Leydig cell responsiveness to stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin. Androgen depletion in men with prostate cancer has demonstrated an impressive increase in insulin resistance and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Androgens have direct (membrane) effects on pancreatic β-cells thus stimulating insulin production. The relationship between circulating testosterone levels and the metabolic syndrome has been demonstrated in elderly men, but, paradoxically, there is a lack of effect of testosterone insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance in healthy young men...",

    "abstract": "Retroperitoneal sarcoma is relatively uncommon, constituting only 10–15 percent of all soft tissue sarcomas. The most common histologic types of RPS are liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. Retroperitoneal sarcoma is classified based on the amount of lipid inside the cells, the mucoid lipid and the degree of cell differentiation. It is classified into the well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic and dedifferentiated types and the commonest is the pleomorphic type. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas are defined by the presence of sharply demarcated regions of non-lipogenic sarcomatous tissue within a well-differentiated tumor. This type has a vague prognosis compared to other types of sarcoma and making the histological diagnosis can be difficult. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma commonly develops in the retroperitoneum, limbs, testis, and spermatic cord. Retro peritoneal sarcoma typically produces few symptoms until they are large enough to compress or invade surrounding structures. Most tumors are already large and locally advanced at the time they are first detected. Here, we reported a case that came to medical attention as an incidentally discovered large abdominal mass in an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, later the mass was successfully removed and free from symptoms.",

All patients underwent physical examinations, with measurement of body mass index, body fat ratio, and waist circumference. The erectile function was assessed using the sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) scoring system. Blood biochemical profiles such as free testosterone, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profile including adiponectin levels were measured. All patients were divided into two groups based on their SHIM score: normal to moderate ED (SHIM score ≥ 12) and severe ED (SHIM score < 12), and the factors associated with severe ED were determined. Patients with severe ED were divided into two groups based on adiponectin levels (cutoff value of 7.0 μg/mL), and their basic characteristics were compared between these two groups.Results: The severe ED group was older and had higher adiponectin levels. In patients with severe ED, various metabolic parameters were significantly worse in the low adiponectin groups than in the non-low adiponectin group.Conclusions: The risk of developing cardiovascular diseases is extremely high in hypogonadal men with severe ED who had lower serum adiponectin levels.",

A total of 1688 participants were included in this cross-sectional investigation. Spearman’s correlation analysis was used to assess the relationships between candidate indicators and PDM. The impact of indicators on PDM risk was determined by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of indicators. Our study indicated a positive correlation between WC, BMI, and 25-OH-D3 and PDM. WC (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04–1.06, p < 0.001), BMI (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.08–1.15, p < 0.001), and 25-OH-D3 (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00–1.02, p = 0.037) and an increased risk of PDM. Additionally, the ROC analysis demonstrated that WC (AUC = 0.651, Specificity = 55.00%, Sensitivity = 67.900%) had a higher diagnostic value for predicting PDM compared to the other variables (BMI, 25-OH-D3, TG, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and UA). A cut-off value of WC > 80.5 cm predicted PDM with both good sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, the cut-off value of waist circumference (WC) for men with prediabetes was 86.500, while for women with prediabetes, it was 76.500.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this study, we evaluated the levels of the main adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones, their precursors and metabolites in peripheral blood of 115 males aged 22–112 years.Prior to the study, all the men were divided into five age groups according to the classification of the Gerontological Association of the former USSR: young adult (n = 11, 22–35 years); middle age (n = 43, 36–60 years); young-old (n – 27, 61–14 years); middle-old (n = 12, 75–90 years); old-old (n = 22, 91–112 years). Plasma adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones, as well as a number of their precursors and metabolites, were assayed by radioimmunoassay, after extraction and purification by Celite chromatography.Results demonstrated no significant changes in the levels of Cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol with aging, while the level of the main adrenal androgen, dehydroepian-drosterone, and its precursors decreased progressively with age. The levels of plasma δ4 -androstenedione also decreased markedly with age; at 61–74 years of age, the level was reduced to only 50% of its original value and it remained stable thereafter. The level of 5α-dihydrotest-osteronefell to about 50% in men aged over 60 years. This cross-sectional study of males from a rural, long-living, ethnically homogeneous population from the highland Southwestern region of the Caucasian mountains demonstrated an age-associated decline in dehydro-epiandrosterone and Δ4 -androstenedione, similar to results reported from other studies, while plasma total testosterone levels did not decline with age in this population. These results suggest that the decline of testosterone with age in men, as has been widely reported for Caucasian men of Western European countries, may not be a universal phenomenon.Key Words: AGINGCORTISOL11-DEOXYCORTISOLDEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONETESTOSTERONE5α-DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE",

    "abstract": "As part of the routine assessment of 185 unselected men with undiagnosed impotence, testosterone was measured on a single serum sample to try to detect a subset of men with androgen deficiency who might benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Those with low levels of testosterone were investigated further with repeat measurements of testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH). In addition, prostatic specific antigen (PSA) was measured in all the men to exclude concomitant prostate cancer. Testosterone replacement therapy was offered to 20 men with consistently low levels of the hormone but few of the men continued with the therapy because of lack of benefit. It was concluded that either testosterone deficiency is rare in unselected men who actually seek help for impotence orebe our protocol of androgen assessment was not helpful for this group of men. There was correlation between PSA results and testosterone and this may have implications for the investigation of prostate cancer. The results presented here are an audit of a clinical practice and call into question the benefit of routine testosterone measurement in the investigation of all men complaining of impotence.",

Melatonin production decreases with advancing age and is impaired in several clinical syndromes and by certain drugs. Here we review the data on the link between melatonin deficiency and sleep, and the efficacy of melatonin replacement in age-related insomnia0Methods Studies and revietv articles that reported on the correlation of endogenous melatonin and sleep and effects of exogenous melatonin on sleep were selected from the Medline database and from major conferences on sleep and chronobiologyResults Low or distorted melatonin rhythms have repeatedly been reported in middle-aged and elderly insomniacs. In elderly insomniacs, melatonin replacement therapy was found to decrease significantly sleep latency and, in some studies, to increase sleep efficiency and decrease wake time after sleep onset. In addition, melatonin decreased sleep latency and increased sleep efficiency and mean total sleep time in chronic benzodiaz-epine-using elderly patients. In these studies, sleep was assessed objectively by means of wrist actigraphy or polysomnographyConclusion These data show an association between melatonin rhythm disturbances and psychophysiological insomnia. Melatonin replacement therapy may thus provide a rational approach to treat age-related insomnia in the elderly.",

This article reviews what is known about the role of testosterone on the mechanism of penile erection and describes the results of the experimental designs and animals models used in the study of erectile physiology. In animals, testosterone seems to have an action on some neurotransmitters of erectile mechanism, while in man, its role is mainly on the behavioral aspects.",

    "abstract": "The development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is undoubtedly related to male aging. However, data on the hormonal profile in aging men with prostate pathologies are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to compare the serum levels of selected hormones and the 24-h urine excretion of androgen steroids in 24 patients with BPH aged 62–86 (mean age 70.5 years) with those in 15 healthy men aged 38–70 (mean age 56.6 years). The quantities of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androsterone and etiocholanolone in 24-h urine samples were assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serum samples were assayed for estradiol, total and free testosterone levels (using radioimmunoassay), and for sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin levels (using immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)). Free androgen index (FAI), the serum testosterone/estradiol ratio and the urine androsterone/etiocholanolone ratio were calculated. The intergroup differences of hormonal variables were tested using the Mann–Whitney U test. There were no differences in the androgen and estrogen endogenous activities between men with BPH and healthy subjects. Patients with BPH had higher serum gonadotropin (LH, FSH) levels than healthy men. Moreover, patients with BPH had reduced 24-h urine excretion of testosterone, androsterone and DHEA (but not etiocholanolone) when compared to healthy subjects. This observation could reflect the more intense conversion of these steroids, e.g. to estrogens within the peripheral tissues (i.e. within the prostate), among men with BPH. Patients with BPH were also characterized by the reduced urine androsterone/etiocholanolone ratio, that could in turn reflect the diminished activity of the metabolic conversions involving 5α-reductase among these men. Even though no essential differences in the serum hormonal profile between patients with BPH and healthy men were found, it could be assumed that there were differences in metabolism of these steroids within peripheral tissues (e.g. within the prostate) between these two examined groups (this was shown indirectly by differences in urine hormonal profile).",

Population-based study in 48 men aged 70–90 years with objectively confirmed urinary leakage of ≥ 10 g per 48 h was undertaken. Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Nottingham Health Profile Questionnaire, Part I, in the group of incontinent men and in an age-matched control group of continent men (n = 239) from the same urban population. The Nottingham Health Profile, Part I, provides information on the degree of discomfort or distress in the dimensions of energy, pain, emotional reactions, sleep, social isolation and physical mobility. The higher the score in a dimension, the more severe the problems. There were no significant differences between incontinent men and men from the control group regarding other illnesses apart from urinary incontinence. Significant differences were, however, found for health-related quality of life in the dimensions of energy (p < 0.01) and emotional reactions (p < 0.05). Urinary incontinence had a negative influence on health-related quality of life in elderly men in dimensions important for well-being.",

Evaluation included measurements of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin (PRL) concentrations and responses to a special questionnaire. Mean testosterone concentration in aging doctors (374 ± 86 ng/ml) was no different from that of hospital employees of the same age (361 ± 77). However, concentrations of LH, SHBG and PRL in the former group were significantly lower (p < 0.04, 0.01 and 0.004, respectively). Furthermore, the testosterone : LH ratio was higher in the aging doctors group (p < 0.001). Mean testosterone concentration in the combined groups of aging men was lower than that of the younger men (p < 0.00001). Andropenic manifestations related to sexual, physical and mental activity were markedly better in the group of aging doctors in comparison to aging hospital employees. By and large, it appeared that aging hospital doctors had a better physical and mental activity than aging employees and this may have been related to their better lifestyle conditions.",

Thirty-one community-dwelling healthy, elderly men (mean age 73.4 ± 6.1 years) with a good nutritional status participated in the study. The Caltrac accelerometer was used to estimate energy expenditure related to physical activity. Subjects were divided into two groups according to the criteria proposed by Bauman: less active (< 1600 kcal/week) and more active (> 1600 kcal/week). In all the men, plasma total antioxidant status (TAS), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were determined. The reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in hemolyzed red blood cells were also measured. There were no significant differences in TAS, H2O2 concentrations and the activity of GPx between less and more active men. In the group of more active subjects, plasma levels of GSH were higher, while TBARS concentrations were lower compared with the group of less active men (p < 0.05). Negative correlation between GSH and TBARS levels was observed (r = -0.71; p < 0.01), and GSH concentrations positively correlated with level of physical activity (r = 0.63; p < 0.05). The results indicate that habitual physical activity can favorably affect antioxidant potential and prevent lipid peroxidation in healthy, elderly men.",

With the growing use of testosterone products, there is concern about the long-term risks of androgen supplementation therapy, particularly on the prostate. This article reviews what is known about the safety of testosterone replacement therapy in terms of the potential risks for development of symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and prostate cancer. Androgens are undoubtedly involved in the growth of benign prostatic nodules, as a permissive factor in the etiology of prostate carcinoma and in the enhancement of the growth of active prostate cancer. Their role in the initiation of either disease is less clear. Available data support the safety of such treatment in the short term. Caution is still advised in the interpretation of these findings, as the studies producing the data have involved relatively small numbers of participants. Until large, long-term, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted and analyzed, questions about the long-term safety of testosterone supplementation therapy in older men will remain.",

    "abstract": "Elderly subjects have a lower energy requirement compared to young adults as a result of lower physical activity and a lower basal metabolic rate. A lower energy intake in the elderly could lead to undesirable low intakes of essential nutrients. The reduction of the energy turnover is caused by, or a consequence of, a decrease in active cell mass. Thus, the effect of exercise training on habitual activity across age ranges, and age-related changes in body composition in relation to habitual activity level, are investigated here. The focus is on data on physical activity and body composition obtained with doubly labelled water. The results suggest that exercise training does not affect energy requirement in the elderly and the age-related decrease in fat-free mass is not delayed in subjects with a relatively high habitual activity level. Beneficial effects of exercise training in the elderly are endurance, flexibility, range of motion and balance control, all contributing to a delay in the age-induced impairment of personal mobility. Energy intake will inevitably go down as a result of a reduction of the energy requirement. Thus, the nutrition of elderly subjects needs more attention with regard to the essential nutrients than the nutrition of younger adults.",

Associations between AM and MetS definitions, including ATPIII, IDF and a new definition replacing WC by ICO in ATPIII MetS definition (ModATPIII), and PDDU were calculated.ICO was the measure of obesity more strongly correlated with diminished mean Peak Systolic Velocity (mPSV) (r = -0.189, p < 0.001). A positive association remained when replacing WC by ICO ≥ 0.60 (a nationally obtained ratio) in ATPIII MetS definition (ModATPIII). Patients with ModATPIII had lower mPSV when compared to non-MetS patients (30.8 versus 37.1, p < 0.001). Only the IDF definition had a significant association with AD (OR = 1853; 95%CI, 1.202-2.857).ICO revealed potential value to predict PDDU changes in a MetS context. However, IDF definition presented a stronger correlation with arteriogenic ED. Although longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis, our study highlights the importance of different MetS definitions for ED assessment.",

    "abstract": "On February 9, 2002, Serono Symposia sponsored a workshop at The 3rd World Congress on The Aging Male that was held in Berlin, Germany at the Hotel Inter-Continental. The title of the workshop 'Is aging a disease?', was intended to convey recent interest in the subject of aging as a clinically relevant entity and to discuss causes and approaches to its management. The Workshop was co-chaired by Drs Viktor Büber and Richard F. Walker. Speakers included Drs George R. Merriam, Heinrich M. Schulte, Felice Strollo and Richard F. Walker. Topics were arranged to proceed from a general overview of fundamental aspects of the aging process and their clinical consequences to specific aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of age-related disorders that could be associated with neuroendocrine dysfunction. F. Strollo initiated the series of lectures by reviewing some of the biological theories of aging and suggesting that maladaptive changes within the central nervous and endocrine systems play a major role in contributing to the cascade of events defined as senescence. R. Walker expanded upon this background by differentiating aging and disease. He suggested that while the process of aging is not a disease, it is directly responsible for the development of functional decrements causal of the intrinsic disease, frailty and general morbidity that occur in direct relation to advancing chronological age. From this generalized approach of linking age and disease, G. Merriam discussed a specific example in which age-related decrements in neuroendocrine dysfunction could contribute, at least in part, to senescent changes in body composition and physiological function. Specifically, he provided evidence that the gradual decline in growth hormone (GH) and testosterone secretion during aging is accompanied by anatomical and functional changes resembling pathogenic hormone deficiency. He went on to discuss possible interventions into this process, specifically showing data to support the view that a combination of GH secretagogues and sex hormones may be of value in sustaining health and vitality in the elderly. As an extension of this discussion, H. M. Schulte compared and contrasted age changes in sex hormone secretion between genders, and also stressed that the diagnosis and management of endocrine changes during life has become a serious challenge to those physicians intending to intervene in the aging process. Because the relationship of reduced hormone secretion to disease in the elderly is presently unclear, the Workshop concluded on a note of caution that guidelines for the replacement of endocrine substances as a prophylactic approach to aging have yet to be defined.",

    "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) exerts a crucial role in promoting somatic growth. In addition, GH constitutes a major regulator of body composition, bone and muscle metabolism, and cardiac function, and actually acts as a prime modulator of fuel metabolism. GH secretion is maximal during puberty. Thereafter, GH secretion falls in young adulthood to less than half the values achieved in mid- to late puberty. This decline is exponential, with a t1/12 of approximately 7 years, and is essentially complete by the beginning of the fifth decade. The origin of this decrease is likely to be multifactorial but the underlying mechanisms remain largely speculative. Since aging and ‘true’ GH deficiency due to pituitary disorders are associated with similar somatic features, it has been suggested that in older healthy subjects, these features result from relative GH-insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) deficit and represent a syndrome that has been named somatopause. So far, however, the causal link between these somatic features and decreased GH secretion has not been proven. Therefore, the question remains as to whether the aim of restoring GH levels to the normal young range is legitimate. If that was the case, experimental approaches which might mimic natural GH secretory patterns and improve sleep quality, such as GH secretagogues, would appear more promising than GH administration, and futher clinical trials should be peformed in men 40–60 years old.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the T, M category and the erector spinae muscle area (ESMa).Material and methods The initial first thorax and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of patients with lung cancer between 2015 and 2019 were retrospectively screened. After exclusion criterias remaining 226 male patients constituted the study group. ESMa was measured manually in the section taken from the T12 vertebra spinous process level as previously described in the literature and its relationship with the T and M stage were evaluated.Results The mean ages of patients were 70 ± 9.57 years. The T stage was T1 in 34 (15%) patients, T2 in 46 (20.4%), T3 in 59 (26.1%), and T4 in 87 (38.5%). Metastasis was detected in 83 (36.7%) patients. The mean ESMa of the patients was 34.15 ± 7.21 mm2 and did not differ according to the T stage (p = .39). ESMa was lower in the metastatic group (mean 30.42 ± 6.38 mm2) than the non-metastatic group (mean 36.32 ± 6.78 mm2) (p = .0001).Conclusions ESMa, one of the indicators of sarcopenia, is lower in patients with metastatic lung cancer than in nonmetastatic.",

This study intended to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FHL5 and LPA with DM risk in the Chinese population.This case-control study involved 1,420 Chinese individuals (710 DM patients and 710 controls). Four candidate loci (rs2252816/rs9373985 in FHL5 and rs3124784/rs7765781 in LPA) were successfully screened. The association of SNPs with DM risk was assessed by logistic regression analysis. Differences in clinical characteristics among subjects with different genotypes were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance.Overall analysis indicated that rs3124784 was associated with an increased risk of DM. Stratification analysis showed that rs3124784 significantly increased DM risk in different subgroups (male, non-smoking, non-drinking, and BMI > 24), while rs7765781 increased DM risk only in participants with BMI ≤ 24. Rs2252816 was associated with the course of DM. We also found that rs2252816 GG genotype and rs9373985 GG genotype were linked to the increased cystatin c in DM patients.The genetic polymorphisms of LPA may be associated with DM risk in the Chinese population, which will provide useful information for the prevention and diagnosis of DM.",

Specifically, combining the inverse variance-weighted (OR: 1.0009, 95% CI: 1.0001-1.0015, p = 0.02) and weighted median (OR: 1.0009, 95% CI: 1.0000-1.0017, p = 0.03). Sensitivity analysis showed that there was no heterogeneity (p = 0.448) and horizontal multiplicity (p = 0.770) among the instrumental variables.We found JAK2 was associated with the development of PCa and was a risk factor for PCa, which might be instructive for the use of JAK2 inhibitors in PCa patients.",

    "abstract": "It is known that even if spontaneous circulation returns after cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) in geriatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests(OHCA), the overall one-year survival rate of these patients is very low. In our study, we aimed to investigate the factors affecting survival in OHCA cases.OHCA patients over 18 years of age were examined in two different groups as 18-64 years old and over 65 years old. Demographic data, comorbidities, cardiac arrest rhythms and minutes, and the number of days they were hospitalized in the intensive care unit were recorded.The mean age was 65.9 ± 15.8 years and 39.9% (n = 110) of the patients were female. The number of intensive care unit stays was significantly higher in the over-65 age group (p = 0.011). The mortality rate and one-year survival rate were significantly lower in the over-65 age group (p < 0.001). Median CPR time was 21 min (IQR:14-32) in the entire patient population. The duration of CPR was 22 min (IQR:14-35) in patients with in-hospital mortality, and 15 min (IQR:13-25) in patients discharged from the hospital. In this comparison, the difference is statistically significant (p = 0.008).In our study, it was determined that especially over 65 years of age, coronary artery disease, and post-arrest CPR duration were determinant and predictive factors in in-hospital and long-term survival.",

The patient had been treating for obstructive voiding symptoms and septic condition for 5 months. Because of persistent symptoms, a drainage of the abscess was performed and the histopathological examination showed infiltrating moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of penis. He underwent a surgical Emasculation followed by the administration of a combination of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin). We highlight the importance of including penile cancer in the differential diagnosis of scrotal abscess and urethral stricture. A multimodal approach is an effective strategy to manage the disease.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the conditions affecting the mortality of patients diagnosed with OSAS at six year follow up.970 patients who admitted to Sleep laboratory between 2011-2013 were evaluated retrospectively. 74 patients whose mortality data could not be accessed through the system were excluded. The patients who died until April 2019 were compared with the surviving group in terms of demographic, clinical, comorbidities and polysomnographic findings.Total 47 patients who died were older, had higher BMI, AHI and ODI values, lower minimum oxygen saturations compared with the survival group (p < .001). In the Cox-hazard regression analysis, BMI (hazard ratio (HR), 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12), age (1.12, 1.08-1.15), accompanying COPD (2.19, 1.08-4.43), accompanying CAD (2.76, 1.34-5.67) and AHI of >50/h (2.19, 1.19-1.4.05) were reported.This study showed that OSAS increases the risk of death accompanied by CAD and COPD. It has also been shown that patients with higher AHI (AHI > 50/h) values die more. Therefore, it may be useful to classify the AHI> 50/h group as very severe OSAS instead of severe OSAS.",

    "abstract": "Vascular abnormalities are the most common factors in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). There are limited number of case series investigating the etiology of corporoveno-occlusive dysfunction (CVOD). In this study, we evaluated ED patients with vascular etiologies and their serum biomarkers from a large database.The current study retrospectively examined the association between serum testosterone levels and basic lab works with Penile Doppler Ultrasonography (PDU) results. We retrieved and reviewed the records of 500 ED patients who had PDU at our institution between January 2012 and November 2018. One-way analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to compare different parameters between groups (CVOD and penile arterial insufficiency) and between two quantitative variables, respectively.Sixty patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled and examined in this study. Patients' mean age was 52.9 ± 11.5 years, and mean serum testosterone level was 15.57 ± 6.49 nmol/L. Thirty-nine (65%) out of 60 patients had abnormal EDV values (>5cm/sec), while eleven (18.3%) had abnormal PSV values (<35cm/sec). Among the patients with abnormal EDV values, we demonstrated that there was a statistically significant negative correlation between testosterone and CVOD (Pearson's; r = -0.283; p = .028).Our findings supported that low serum testosterone level is a risk factor for CVOD and so for ED. Future studies would benefit from larger sample sizes in order to support or refute our findings.",

The active surveillance criteria were determined as Gleason score ≤6, when specified ≤2 positive cores with <50% cancer involvement in every positive core, a clinical T1c, a PSA <10ng/mL and a PSA density <0.15 ng/mL/cc. Patients who met all active surveillance criteria were included in Group 1, and other patients with prostate cancer were included in Group 2.The study included 336 patients with available data of age, total-free PSA levels, PV calculated by TRUS. Group 1 consisted of 82 patients and Group 2 consisted of 254 patients. PV and fPSA% were significantly higher and PSA was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2. On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors were determined to be PSA and PV while fPSA% was not.By using PSA and PV in predicting patients meeting all active surveillance criteria, unnecessary biopsies and ultimately overdiagnosis can be reduced.",

Positive clinical lymph nodes and positive pathological lymph nodeswere recorded. The largest positive clinical and pathological lymph nodeswere recorded. In terms of clinical lymph node involvement, compatibility between radiological findings and pathological results was evaluated.In the CT group, the sensitivity was 25.81%, specificity was 95.45%, positive predictive value (PPV) was 66.67%, negative predictive value (NPV) was 78.50%, and accuracy was 77.31%. In the MRI group, the sensitivity was 50.00%, specificity was 100%, PPV was 100%, NPV was 76.92%, and accuracy was 81.25%. For consistency between pathological lymph nodes and clinical lymph nodes according to the imaging type, there was no statistically significant difference in the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and accuracy rates between the imaging techniques (p > 0.05). However, the PPV was significantly higher in the MRI group than the CT group (100% vs.66.67%, respectively; p = 0.014).Positive lymph nodes play a critical role in the prognosis of patients with bladder cancer and the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT and MRI used routinely in clinical practice is low in lymph node detection. MRI seems more reliable than CT in lymph node detection.",

Near vision deterioration during aging results from a decrease in accommodation amplitude (AA). Cardiac aging is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We investigated the association between cardiac aging and AA.The subjects (500 mean 50-year-old subjects, with equal males and females) were divided into two groups according to AA measured with a Raf ruler. Biomicroscopy was used to capture images of the lens nucleus in the unaccommodated and accommodated state. The nucleus diameter change at 1 D accommodation was measured using ImageJ. Cardiac conduction system differences were evaluated using electrocardiography, and cardiac autonomic aging was assessed based on heart rate variability. Myocardial aging was assessed based on diastolic dysfunction.For near distance vision, compared to subjects who could see clearly from 24 to 28 cm, subjects who could see clearly from 29 to 33 cm had a 2.104-fold higher risk of a lateral e' velocity <10 cm/s [95%CI: 1.312-3.374], 2.603-fold higher risk of diastolic dysfunction [95%CI: 1.453-4.662], 1.54-fold higher risk of a low/high frequency ratio >3.1 [95%CI: 1.085-2.197].As a simple screening test, subjective AA measurement can predict important heart aging parameters, including diastolic dysfunction.NCT04362215.",

Histopathological results were grouped into low-risk disease (Grade Group 1), intermediate-risk disease (Grade Group 2 and 3), and high-risk disease (Grade Group 4 or 5). Clinically significant (CS) prostate cancer was defined as Grade Group ≥ 2.Five hundred and six men were included. Median age (IQR) and PSA (IQR) were 65.2 (60.3-70.2) years and 6.9 (5.2-9.7) ng/ml, respectively. There was no difference in overall cancer detection between FBx and SBx (53.6% vs 56.4% p = .1507). CS cancer detection was significantly higher with FBx (39.6% vs 35.3, p = .0275). FBx also outperformed SBx in diagnosing CS disease in patients with prior history of negative prostate biopsy (36.9% vs 27.9%, p < .001).FBx detects a higher proportion of clinically significant disease and a lower proportion of clinically insignificant disease compared to SBx, in line with outcomes demonstrated by centers of excellence.",

    "abstract": "Low baseline testosterone level has been associated with the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as insulin resistance and obesity. In addition to the absolute testosterone level, remarkable changes in testosterone level may have an acute effect on cardiovascular disease development and progression, which has been rarely investigated. In this study, we used a clinical dataset of 376 hypogonadal men whose testosterone levels were measured every six months for up to 11 years from a registry study in Germany, and conducted survival analyses to investigate the effect of testosterone changes since the last visit (time-varying) on the risk of cardiovascular events. Given the potential discrepancies in comorbidity conditions among patients with prior cardiovascular events and those without, all the analyses were stratified by patients’ prior cardiovascular event status. We found the effects were not different among patients with prior cardiovascular events and those without. Regardless of patients’ prior cardiovascular event status, patients with larger testosterone declines (≥3.12 nmol/L, 90th percentile) since the last visit were more likely to experience myocardial infarction. In conclusion, recent pronounced testosterone drop-offs may affect the risk of cardiovascular events among hypogonadal men. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our exploratory study findings.",

    "abstract": "Phytotherapy has won popular appreciation world-wide in the last few years with advocates proposing that herbs have the advantage of being reasonably effective, of producing fewer side-effects, and of being less costly compared with standard pharmaceutical therapies. PC-SPES is a combination of eight herbs effective for the treatment of prostate cancer patients, including androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cancers, with an overall improvement of morbidity and immune status, even in those in whom conventional therapy has failed. The preparation is estrogenic; however, its therapeutic activity is not only due to its estrogenicity, and the mechanism of action seems to be complicated. The constituent herbs of the preparation possess antitumor, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities, all of which may contribute to the therapeutic action of PC-SPES on prostate cancer. Further studies are needed to ascertain its long-term effect and safety, and to identify the active compounds and clarify their mechanisms of action. Saw palmetto may have a significant effect on urinary flow rates and symptom scores compared to placebo in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) mainly as a result of its 5-reductase inhibitory activity. Compared with finasteride, saw palmetto produces similar improvement in urinary tract symptoms and urinary flow and is associated with fewer adverse events. Hypoxis rooperi, Secale cereale and Pygeum africanum also appear to somewhat improve BPH symptoms, but the evidence seems less convincing for the use of Urtica dioica or Curcubita pepo alone in the treatment of BPH. The view, that the effects of all the plant products are no better than those of placebo, seems to be a little dogmatic. However, large-scale, placebo-controlled trials using standardized preparations with longer study durations are needed to determine their long-term effectiveness and safety.",

    "abstract": "Phytotherapy has won popular appreciation world-wide in the last few years with advocates proposing that herbs have the advantage of being reasonably effective, of producing fewer side-effects, and of being less costly compared with standard pharmaceutical therapies. PC-SPES is a combination of eight herbs effective for the treatment of prostate cancer patients, including androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cancers, with an overall improvement of morbidity and immune status, even in those in whom conventional therapy has failed. The preparation is estrogenic; however, its therapeutic activity is not only due to its estrogenicity, and the mechanism of action seems to be complicated. The constituent herbs of the preparation possess antitumor, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities, all of which may contribute to the therapeutic action of PC-SPES on prostate cancer. Further studies are needed to ascertain its long-term effect and safety, and to identify the active compounds and clarify their mechanisms of action. Saw palmetto may have a significant effect on urinary flow rates and symptom scores compared to placebo in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) mainly as a result of its 5-reductase inhibitory activity. Compared with finasteride, saw palmetto produces similar improvement in urinary tract symptoms and urinary flow and is associated with fewer adverse events. Hypoxis rooperi, Secale cereale and Pygeum africanum also appear to somewhat improve BPH symptoms, but the evidence seems less convincing for the use of Urtica dioica or Curcubita pepo alone in the treatment of BPH. The view, that the effects of all the plant products are no better than those of placebo, seems to be a little dogmatic. However, large-scale, placebo-controlled trials using standardized preparations with longer study durations are needed to determine their long-term effectiveness and safety.",

    "abstract": "The importance of senile osteoporosis in men as a public health problem has long been underestimated. Elderly men are at substantial risk for fracture, and morbidity after osteoporotic fractures appears to be more serious and mortality more common in men than in women. Risk factors for osteoporotic fractures in men appear to be qualitatively similar to those in women, but there are quantitative differences. Low bone mineral density (BMD) is an important risk factor for fracture in men; however, further clarification of the relationship between BMD, bone geometry and fracture risk is needed before formulating definitive proposals on operational densitometric criteria for diagnosis of osteoporosis in men and the identification of men at high risk for fracture. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying senile bone loss and the pathogenesis of senile osteoporosis in men remains fragmentary with, in particular, the need for further clarification regarding the precise impact of hormonal status in elderly men on skeletal homeostasis. Recommendations on prevention and treatment of senile osteoporosis in men should focus on the minimization of known risk factors for bone loss and falls. Testosterone treatment may be useful in those men with initially low serum testosterone. As to other pharmacological treatment modalities, prospective trials specifically in elderly men, and preferably with fracture incidence as the primary clinical endpoint, are required.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the frequency of low bone density in elderly males seen in an academic geriatric practice and to evaluate physician awareness of male osteoporosis among academic geriatricians. The participants were elderly communitydwelling ambulatory males aged 65 years and older (n = 35). The mean age was 80.7 ± 8.2 years, with eight subjects in the 65-74 years range, 16 in the 75-84 years range and 11 over 85 years. Only 5/35 utilized an assistive device for ambulation. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using a heel ultrasound (QUS-2 calcaneal ultrasonometer). Clinical risk factors, gait and balance were evaluated (Tinetti scale). Results of BMD were communicated to the attending geriatrician. In all 7/35 participants had a calcaneal T-score of ≤- 2.5 indicating osteoporosis, of these 50% were > 85 years; 7/35 had t score of -1 to -2.5 indicating osteopenia, of these 50% were 75-84 years; and 21/35 had a T-score > -1 indicating normal BMD). Overall, 14 of the 35 subjects studied had low bone density. Gait disorders were seen in 18/35 subjects (p < 0.05), more commonly in the oldest subjects. Risk factors for osteoporosis-related fractures included smoking (n = 22, 63%, p = 0.57), gait abnormalities (n = 18, 51%, p < 0.05) and alcohol use (n = 13, 37%, p = 0.39). Low bone mass (osteopenia or osteoporosis) was not addressed (by record notations, request for DEXA, laboratory testing or medical treatment) within 6 months by the majority of geriatricians (3/5). This pilot study shows a high frequency of low bone density in elderly males seen in an academic geriatric practice. This frail population presents with significant balance and gait disorders, and the coexistence of these two risk factors predisposes them to the development of hip fracture. This study also underscores the importance of increasing awareness of osteoporosis in males among geriatricians. Limitations to this study are that bone density was measured with the QUS-2 calcaneal ultrasonometer, and that female reference values were utilized. These limitations potentially underestimate the prevalence of bone loss in males.",

    "abstract": "The development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is undoubtedly related to male aging. However, data on the hormonal profile in aging men with prostate pathologies are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to compare the serum levels of selected hormones and the 24-h urine excretion of androgen steroids in 24 patients with BPH aged 62–86 (mean age 70.5 years) with those in 15 healthy men aged 38–70 (mean age 56.6 years). The quantities of testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androsterone and etiocholanolone in 24-h urine samples were assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serum samples were assayed for estradiol, total and free testosterone levels (using radioimmunoassay), and for sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin levels (using immunoradiometric assay (IRMA)). Free androgen index (FAI), the serum testosterone/estradiol ratio and the urine androsterone/etiocholanolone ratio were calculated. The intergroup differences of hormonal variables were tested using the Mann–Whitney U test. There were no differences in the androgen and estrogen endogenous activities between men with BPH and healthy subjects. Patients with BPH had higher serum gonadotropin (LH, FSH) levels than healthy men. Moreover, patients with BPH had reduced 24-h urine excretion of testosterone, androsterone and DHEA (but not etiocholanolone) when compared to healthy subjects. This observation could reflect the more intense conversion of these steroids, e.g. to estrogens within the peripheral tissues (i.e. within the prostate), among men with BPH. Patients with BPH were also characterized by the reduced urine androsterone/etiocholanolone ratio, that could in turn reflect the diminished activity of the metabolic conversions involving 5α-reductase among these men. Even though no essential differences in the serum hormonal profile between patients with BPH and healthy men were found, it could be assumed that there were differences in metabolism of these steroids within peripheral tissues (e.g. within the prostate) between these two examined groups (this was shown indirectly by differences in urine hormonal profile).",

Enrolment took place between January 2000 and December 2001 at Pundang CHA General Hospital in Korea. All men who came for male climacteric and geriatric health screening examinations were eligible. Of the 762 men recruited, 136 men had at least one present or previous medical illness and 626 men were healthy. Higher serum concentrations of total testosterone (5.31 ± 1.88 ng/ml vs. 4.96 ± 1.43 ng/ml; p < 0.05), free androgen index (16.60 ± 7.36 vs. 14.57 ± 5.55; p < 0.01) and calculated bioavailable testosterone (8.88 ± 3.52 nmol/l vs. 7.91 ± 2.52 nmol/l; p < 0.01) were demonstrated in the healthy compared with the disease group. Total testosterone declined at a rate of 0.2% per year, SHBG increased by 1.74% per year, calculated bioavailable testosterone declined by 0.8% per year, and free androgen index declined by 1.15% per year in healthy subjects aged between 40 and 70. The above results seem to be consistent with previous Western studies, showing higher concentrations of testosterone in healthy men, that decline with increasing age.KeywordsAGE TREND TESTOSTERONE CALCULATED BIOAVAILABLE TESTOSTERONE KOREAN MALE",

    "abstract": "The sex difference in cardiovascular morbidity is traditionally ascribed to the effects of testosterone on the lipid profile. Epidemiological studies show, however, that men with cardiovascular disease have low rather than high circulating testosterone. The factor responsible for both the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and the low testosterone might be visceral obesity. Men and women differ in their pattern of fat distribution. Women have predominantly gluteofemoral fat depots and men preferential abdominal/visceral depots. In puberty testosterone favors abdominal/visceral fat deposition. Visceral fat has a high metabolic turnover and the free fatty acids drain on the portal vein. With a large visceral fat depot the liver is flooded with free fatty acids inducing high levels of triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, impairment of insulin metabolism and reducing insulin sensitivity. These factors contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes type II. High insulin levels suppress sex hormone-binding globulin thus lowering circulating testosterone. The fat cell produces leptin signalling to the brain to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure. High leptin levels suppress testosterone. Some studies suggest that testosterone supplementation reduces visceral obesity and improves cardiovascular risks but more evidence is needed.",

    "abstract": "Androgen levels decline over a man's lifetime. In a proportion of men (increasing with age), levels fall below values that have been established by conventional laboratory criteria as indicative of hypogonadism. Testosterone has a wide range of non-reproductive actions: it preserves bone and muscle mass, it acts on non-sexual mental functioning and it stimulates red blood cell formation. Long-term androgen deficiency has a great impact on quality of life. The first intervention studies provide indications that androgen treatment of men with true androgen deficiency is helpful. Obviously, only men who are testosterone-deficient will benefit from androgen supplementation. The diag nosis of testosterone deficiency in old age is not unambiguous. Signs and symptoms of aging sometimes clinically overlap with those of testosterone deficiency. The groups that are at higher risk of testosterone deficiency are those men with disease (pulmonary disease, gastrointestinal disease, rheumatoid disease, etc.). Usually, sex hormone binding globulin levels increase with aging, leading to lower levels of free, biologically available testosterone. For the time being, arbitrary criteria for testosterone deficiency in aging men have to be adopted. The best practical approach is to calculate the free testosterone level. The calculation can be found at www.issam.ch under 'Tools'.",

Testosterone is responsible for the initiation, development and maintenance of primary and secondary sexual characteristics as well as having a role in male sexual behavior and potency. In adults, testosterone deficiency is associated with reduced libido and potency, infertility, lethargy and a number of behavioral modifications. This article reviews what is known about the role of testosterone on the mechanism of penile erection and describes the results of the experimental designs and animals models used in the study of erectile physiology. In animals, testosterone seems to have an action on some neurotransmitters of erectile mechanism, while in man, its role is mainly on the behavioral aspects.",

    "abstract": "There are many explanations for the sex-specific difference in life expectancy. An important reason for this difference can be found in the genome difference of one sex chromosome. It is obvious that testosterone, as an effective hormonal product of this genome difference, influences not only morphology, physiology and risk profiles of diseases but also social behavior and lifestyle. Statistical simulations are, for physicians, an unusual way to demonstrate differences in human mortality, but they may help to show other, and more abstract, aspects of nature. The Penna model of biological aging is a well-established model for simulating the influence of genetic factors on sex-specific mortality. In this study, the Penna model is explained and modified to take into account the potentially detrimental effects of testosterone on male mortality. This is achieved by a modification of the Verhulst factor, starting with male puberty. We demonstrated that about one-third of the sex-specific difference in life expectancy may be caused by the influence of testosterone in this mathematical aging model. These results do not show that male vices (smoking, drinking, risk-taking behavior, etc.) can be attributed only to testosterone even though it may appear so from the statistics. There are some correlations but not causal relations. It seems, even from the view of a mathematical–statistical simulation, that males are discriminated against regarding mortality and life expectancy. This underlines the need for sex-specific research, social policy and preventive programs (e.g. sports, nutrition) for minimizing the negative impact of male-specific genetic and hormonal factors.",

Population-based study in 48 men aged 70–90 years with objectively confirmed urinary leakage of ≥ 10 g per 48 h was undertaken. Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Nottingham Health Profile Questionnaire, Part I, in the group of incontinent men and in an age-matched control group of continent men (n = 239) from the same urban population. The Nottingham Health Profile, Part I, provides information on the degree of discomfort or distress in the dimensions of energy, pain, emotional reactions, sleep, social isolation and physical mobility. The higher the score in a dimension, the more severe the problems. There were no significant differences between incontinent men and men from the control group regarding other illnesses apart from urinary incontinence. Significant differences were, however, found for health-related quality of life in the dimensions of energy (p < 0.01) and emotional reactions (p < 0.05). Urinary incontinence had a negative influence on health-related quality of life in elderly men in dimensions important for well-being.",

    "abstract": "The male aging process brings about declines in hormonal function including a gradual decline in bioavailable testosterone levels. Animal studies suggest that testosterone modulates cognitive function through enhancing acetylcholine release and up-modulation of nicotinic receptors. Tau protein deposition is also affected by androgen supplementation in animals. We hypothesize that testosterone replacement in elderly hypogonadal males may improve cognition, in particular the visual-spatial domain. Thirty-six male patients with a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had their total and bioavailable testosterone levels measured. None of the patients had been on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Ten of the 36 patients (28%) were deemed biochemically hypogonadal (total testosterone < 240 ng/dl or 7 nmol/l). Five of the hypogonadal patients were randomized to testosterone and five to placebo. Initial Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAScog) and Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) ranged from 31 to 19 and from 17 to 22, respectively. The clock drawing test (CDT) and the pentagon-tracing portion of the MMSE were used as measures of visual-spatial abilities. Normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were essential before treatment with intramuscular testosterone, 200 mg every 2 weeks. Measurement of testosterone, complete blood count, lipids, PSA and neuropsychological cognitive tests were repeated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of treatment. In the testosterone-treated group, levels of total testosterone increased from a mean of 126.4 ng/dl to 341 ng/dl or 3.6 nmol/l to 9.7 nmol/l (p = 0.11). Bioavailable testosterone also increased from a mean of 48.7 ng/dl to 142 ng/dl or 1.39 nmol/l to 4.05 nmol/l (p = 0.10). PSA levels were also elevated from a mean of 0.98 to 1.37 ng/ml (p = 0.07). ADAScog improved from a mean of 25 to 16.3 (p = 0.02); MMSE improved from a mean of 19.4 to 23.2 (p = 0.02), CDT also improved from 2.2 to 3.2 (p = 0.07). One patient stopped treatment because of hypersexual behavior. The placebo-treated group deteriorated gradually. This small pilot study performed in aging male patients suggests that testosterone could indeed improve cognition, including visual-spatial skills in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",

Advances in impotence research and increased knowledge of the pathophysiology of erection have completely changed the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Before oral therapy, intracavernous injection was considered as the first-line therapy for impotent patients.

    "abstract": "Sebostasis in the aged male is a frequent and commonly accepted fact. In order to evaluate the sebostasis of the aged, several experimental parameters were developed to obtain valuable data with regard to the activity of sebaceous glands. The average areas of the lobes of the sebaceous glands and sebocytes, as well as those of the nuclei of sebocytes, were evaluated planimetrically. By means of chromatographic analysis, the skin surface lipids were determined. Using silicone stamping, the average extention of the pore openings was quantitatively measured. Although elderly men show significantly larger sebaceous glands than young people, the concentration of the skin surface lipid is clearly reduced. The transit time is diminished and the drastically reduced intrasebocytic sebum synthesis is of pathogenetic nature. Whereas, namely in young men, the volume of the differentiating sebocytes increases continuously, it remains small in elderly men. As a characteristic expression of this reduced differentiation, the sebocyte nucleus shrinks only very little while the cells migrate from the periphery to the center of the lobe. Consequently, the sebocytes set free only small amounts of sebum with considerable retardation. The qualitative composition of the skin surface lipids in the aged shows differences in respect to the cholesterol and squalene concentrations. The areas of pore openings on the skin surface shrink, probably as a consequence of a reduction of cutaneous elasticity.The present findings show clearly that sebostasis in the aged is caused by an altered differentiation of the sebocytes themselves. It is unknown whether or not normal influences undergo a decline or whether a deficiency of sebumrelated enzymes plays a role.",

    "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) secretagogues are synthetic peptidyl and non-peptidyl molecules which possess a strong, dose-dependent and reproducible GH-releasing effect after intravenous and even oral administration in humans. This effect is probably mediated via the activation of specific receptors, mainly present at the pituitary and hypothalamic level; a human pituitary GH secretogogue receptor has already been cloned, pointing to the existence of an endogenous GH secretagogue-like ligand. The GH-releasing effect of GH secretagogues is gender-independent but undergoes marked age-related variations. In fact, the effect is low at birth, increases markedly at puberty, persists at a similar level in adulthood and decreases thereafter, being already similar in middle age to that in elderly subjects. It is likely that the reduced activity of GH secretagogues in aging reflects the age-related changes in the neural control of somatotrope function. These could include the hypothetical impairment in the activity of the putative natural GH secretagogue-like ligand. Prolonged treatment with non-peptidyl GH secretagogues has been shown to restore spontaneous GH pulsatility and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels in aged humans as well as in animals. The possibility that chronic treatment with GH secretagogues in aging rejuvenates the activity of the GH/IGF-I axis and counteracts the age-related changes in body composition, structure functions and metabolism seems very attractive.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with decreased levels of growth hormone and both circulating and local levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). The decline in IGF-I has been postulated to be important in both physiological aging and pathological states that are seen with aging. In parallel, inappropriate apoptosis is thought to play a role in some of these same processes. In experimental models, IGF-I signalling through the IGF-I receptor confers a protective effect from apoptosis. This review summarizes the results of studies documenting the IGF-I anti-apoptotic effect in neuronal model systems. The known downstream signalling cascades that mediate this signal are beginning to be elucidated; these include MAP kinase and Akt. In addition, IGF-I prevents the reduction of anti-apoptotic proteins of the bcl-2 family induced by hyperosmotic conditions in cultured neuronal cells. IGF-I has been shown to positively impact on tau, the microtubule-associated protein, possibly preventing the degradation of proteins that are associated with the neurofibrils seen in Alzheimer's disease. All of the studies to date support the hypothesis that appropriately high levels of IGF-I signalling prevent some of the processes associated with aging.",

Adrenals from unstimulated rats were processed for light and electron microscopy and trunk blood was obtained for the assay of plasma renin activity and aldosterone. Similar assays were made in rats stimulated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 30 min before sacrifice. At light microscopy, no major structural changes were observed; the ultrastructure of most organelles was well preserved and the presence of lipofuscin granules in older animals was remarkable. Acid phosphatase activity was observed in lysosomes and some lipofuscin granules. The quantitative study showed an age-related decrease in cell and nuclear volume (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 respectively) and an increase in volume density of lipid droplets, lipofuscin granules (p < 0.001), lysosomes and Golgi complex; a decrease in volume density of mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (p = 0.052) was also observed. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone level were both reduced (p < 0.001). In stimulated animals, an enhanced aldosterone level was obtained which was higher at 12 months and decreased thereafter. These results show an age-related decrease of aldosterone secretion, consistent with structural and ultrastructural data and related to plasma renin decrement. They also show a decline in the response to aldosterone stimulation by ACTH, indicating a lesser functional ability of zona glomerulosa cells in old animals.",

Nearly all learned about the term ‘male menopause’ through newspapers. A very high proportion of the respondents expressed interest in acquiring more knowledge on the condition and its treatment, citing booklets and leaflets as the preferred mode of gaining this information. The majority found it necessary to seek medical advice for symptoms of male menopause. Most identified the general practitioner as the most appropriate medical personnel to consult. The majority welcomed active treatment to address male menopause indicating improvement of overall health as the main reason. Approximately one-fifth of the respondents were not keen on seeking treatment for male menopause for fear of side-effects.",

Although only a few are likely to be of specific interest, many papers will contain useful information. To help you keep up-to-date with the more important publications, each issue of The Aging Male will contain a selection of abstracts from recently published papers, which are judged by the Editor to be of the greatest general interest to those involved in this important area of research.",
