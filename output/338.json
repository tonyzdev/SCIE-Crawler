    "abstract": "AbstractBush encroachment has been recognised in southern Africa since the late nineteenth century. Our review of 23 studies showed that the rate of woody cover change has ranged from −0.131 to 1.275% y−1. Encroachment was most rapid on small protected areas, intermediate under commercial tenure, and slowest under communal tenure and large, natural environments with mega-herbivores present. Several drivers of bush encroachment, which interact and change over time, have been proposed. Fires, for example, were actively suppressed during the early twentieth century. However, rainfall interacts with fire and the rate of woody increase under fire exclusion is linearly related to mean annual rainfall. A reduction in browsing herbivores from the nineteenth century would have had a positive cumulative effect on woody cover whilst an increase in grazing herbivores would have reduced the competitive effect of grasses. Encroachment was most rapid during the high rainfall, mid-1970s, which followed the 1960s drought when cattle numbers were at their peak, and the grass layer was degraded. Increasing atmospheric [CO2] and climate change have emerged as important drivers in the recent literature. Bush encroachment depends on the interplay of history, environment, management and vegetation, recognition of which is essential for containing encroachment.Keywords: atmospheric CO2browsing pressuredemographic bottleneckfire suppressionlivestock trends",

    "abstract": "Bush encroachment affects the agricultural productivity and biodiversity of 10–20 million ha of South Africa. Many people believe that we understand the causes of bush encroachment. We do not. Many people believe that either fire or heavy grazing by domestic livestock is the sole cause of bush encroachment. This is wrong. Bush encroachment occurs in many arid regions where fuel loads are insufficient for fires to be an important causal factor. Belief in grazing as the sole cause of bush encroachment stems from Walter's two-layer model. This model states that grasses typically outcompete trees in open savannas by growing fast and intercepting moisture from the upper soil layers, thereby preventing trees from gaining access to precipitation in the lower soil layers where their roots are mostly found. When heavy grazing occurs, grasses are removed and soil moisture then becomes available to the trees, allowing them to recruit en masse. The fact that many bush-encroached areas are heavily grazed means neither that grazing causes encroachment nor that Walter's model is correct. Bush encroachment is widespread in areas where there is a single soil layer and where grazing is infrequent and light. We need to move away from observational studies and these single-factor explanations. If we are to understand the causes of bush encroachment, we need mechanistic models to guide us and multi-factorial experiments to tease out the interactions among causal factors. Current disturbance-based models have many of the right elements necessary to make mechanistic predictions but need to be appropriately parameterised. Some patch dynamic models also appear to hold great promise in this regard. Field experiments carried out to date show that support for factors conventionally claimed to cause bush encroachment is underwhelming, and that rainfall amount and frequency, coupled with specific soil nutrient levels, may drive this phenomenon.",

As the profitability of livestock production becomes more marginal and wildlife values increase, there is a need to understand the interactions between livestock and wild large mammalian herbivores (and other indigenous biodiversity). To address this, we have established a long‐term multi‐species herbivore exclusion experiment in the Laikipia ecosystem in Kenya. Using a series of semi‐permeable barriers, we are differentially excluding various combinations of cattle, large wild mammalian herbivores, and mega‐herbivores (giraffes and elephants) from a series of replicated four‐hectare plots. We are monitoring soil, plant, and animal responses to these treatment characteristics. This multi‐disciplinary project is one of the first to include controlled, replicated exclusion of combinations of multiple guilds of rangeland herbivores in the same place at the same time. We report here (1) the first quantitative vegetation analysis of this important grazing ecosystem; (2) details of the experimental design; (3) evidence of the effectiveness of the herbivore exclosures; and (4) a summary of some preliminary results.",

Adaptive multi-paddock grazing management is an example of an approach for grazinglands. Leading conservation farmers have achieved superior results in ecosystem improvement, productivity, soil carbon and fertility, water-holding capacity and profitability. Their method is to use multiple paddocks per herd with short grazing periods, long recovery periods, and adaptively changing recovery periods, residual biomass, animal numbers and other management elements as conditions change. In contrast, much research on grazing management has not followed adaptive research protocols to account for spatial effects, for sufficient time to produce resource improvement, sound animal production, and socio-economic goals under constantly varying conditions on rangelands. We briefly review what management has achieved best outcomes and show how previous reviews of grazing studies were limited in scope and applicability to larger, more complex landscapes. We argue that future research can provide better understanding of how multi-paddock grazing management can improve socio-ecological resilience in grazing ecosystems, while avoiding unintended consequences of possible management options, by involving realistic scale and context, partnering with innovative land managers on real operations, applying adaptive treatments, and combining field studies with modelling approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract People construct fences to delineate land ownership and to control access to land. Fences accomplish several purposes, notable among these are containing livestock or wildlife raised for profit or subsistence, excluding use of vegetation within areas to be conserved and reducing conflicts between wildlife and humans. In addition, fences may offer unanticipated benefits such as vegetation within hedgerow fences providing cover to wildlife, or grazing by confined herbivores promoting native flora. However, because fences limit mobility of large herbivores, fenced areas become fragments within the landscape. Fences may entangle or electrocute herbivores, truncate migratory routes, excise important resources needed by large herbivores and allow resident herbivore populations to become too high and damage vegetation. More subtly, fencing parcels may reduce the carrying capacity of a landscape irrespective of habitat loss by eliminating access to heterogeneous forage patches. Normalised difference vegetation indices, derived from satellite images and reflecting green vegetation biomass, are used to suggest effects of fencing upon stocking rates. Ecosystem modeling quantified the decrease in herbivore stocking rate as a 300km 2 parcel was fragmented. When the parcel was fenced as 10km 2 sub-parcels, 19% fewer cattle could be supported, compared to the parcel being unfenced. Keywords: ECOSYSTEM MODELINGFENCE DESIGNFRAGMENTATIONNDVIUNGULATES",

    "abstract": "Policy affecting the rangeland commons in South Africa has been based largely on management models developed for large-scale commercial farming. This paper examines the current policy situation and discusses some of the most pervasive ecological and economic assumptions that have influenced development in the rangeland commons: that increasing livestock sales and full-time commercial farming are the best way to improve productivity and resource management; that communal rangelands are invariably overstocked and degraded and that destocking, fencing and rotational grazing are required to address this; and that communal tenure per se is the root cause of degradation and privatisation is the answer. A wealth of research now shows that these assumptions, while they may be suited to commercial agriculture on large land holdings, are an inappropriate basis for policy on rangeland commons. Instead, policy should support multiple livelihoods to enhance resilience and reduce risk, support the aims and overcome the disadvantages of smallholder farmers, strengthen common property management and tenure security, and integrate livestock development with a broader development agenda. Rangeland commons differ in their ecological, social and economic characteristics. Policy thus needs to apply a variety of ecological and economic models appropriate to different contexts.",

The aim of this study was to determine the current and potential distribution of lantana in eastern Africa and its livelihood impacts in one region in Uganda. Data were collected by means of roadside surveys, and then compared with potential distributions based on ecoclimatic models. Household interviews were conducted to understand the impacts of lantana on local livelihoods. Lantana is currently widespread in eastern Africa, and has the potential to spread, especially in Tanzania. According to 40% of respondents, lantana reduced the amount of forage available to livestock by more than 50%, while one-third of those interviewed reported a 26–50% reduction in crop yields. Lantana invasions also cost individual households substantial amounts of money (US$400–500 per annum). Furthermore, lantana reduced the availability of natural resources, such as native medicinal plants, and hindered the movement of people and livestock. Based on the potential distribution of lantana, and its current impacts, we suggest that an integrated management strategy be developed and implemented, including the introduction of additional biological control agents to reduce the negative effects of lantana on local livelihoods.",

Grazing is often considered to be a major cause of encroachment in dry savannas because grasses are removed by livestock, leaving bare areas for trees to colonise in wetter years. Earlier experiments conducted in the Kimberley area of the Northern Cape showed that neither fire nor grazing was important for woody plant encroachment. We used aerial and fixed-point repeat ground photographs, including historical photographs taken at the time of the Second Anglo-Boer War of 1899–1902, to assess the scale and timing of woody plant encroachment in the dry savannas near Kimberley in South Africa (mean annual rainfall = 300–400 mm). There were large increases in woody plant encroachment in most areas. Even at the battlefield of Magersfontein, where grazing has been virtually absent since its protection in 1960, we found that encroachment by trees and shrubs has occurred. Using aerial photographs, we found that the rate of encroachment has increased substantially since 1993. However, repeated photographs at certain sites indicate that encroachment produced cohorts of trees. We show that global drivers are perhaps of greater importance than local drivers such as heavy grazing and absence of fire.",

Within these regions it is found across a broad range of climates, geological substrates and ecosystems. Because it is widespread across these areas it has great economic and ecological value, as it is a relatively palatable species across most of its range. It is of critical importance in supporting local populations of both native and introduced herbivores, and is thus central to wildlife and livestock production, and consequently rural livelihoods. It is an important climax or subclimax species that is well adapted to fire, a common element of many areas where it is found. Inappropriate grazing management, however, can result in a decline of Themeda, as it is not well adapted to an uninterrupted, selective grazing regime. A decline in abundance of Themeda in a grassland is usually coupled to a decline in grazing value, species richness, cover and ecosystem function. In spite of its significant ecological and economic importance, there has been no attempt to review and synthesise the considerable body of research undertaken on this grass. Our aim is to summarise and synthesis work previously undertaken and identify areas where further research is required.",

    "abstract": "It has been claimed that Holistic Planned Grazing™ (HPG), a type of rotational grazing, can increase productivity in rangelands and reverse climate change while doubling the stocking rate, mainly through the impact of densely bunched animals on primary production. Previous reviews have found similar or greater plant and animal production in continuous (season-long) compared with rotational grazing. Here season-long continuous grazing is compared with HPG alone to explore the evidence for animal impact. Three quantitative meta-analysis models were used to assess data sets from literature between 1972 and 2016. Weighted mean differences (effect sizes) between HPG and continuous grazing showed that there was no difference in plant basal cover, plant biomass and animal gain responses (p > 0.05). Thus, from the balance of studies, if animal impact is occurring during HPG, it has no effect on production. As interesting as the overall result is the significant between-study heterogeneity assessed using Cochran's Q (p = 0.007 to <0.0001). Studies with positive effect sizes tended to have higher precipitation (p < 0.05), suggesting that only some rangelands have the resources to support HPG. Furthermore, there is scope for investigating the impact of HPG on socio-ecological aspects of rangelands, such as management.",

South Africa experienced a major drought in 2015–2016. We analysed goat and cattle census data from the Msinga area in KwaZulu-Natal, which represent the livestock of some 3 000 households. Cattle farmers in the study area lost 43% of the herd, compared with 29% for goats, in 2015–2016. Three years after the drought, cattle numbers remained depressed, whereas goat numbers had recovered. Larger herds suffered lower mortality rates, suggesting that owners of larger herds had better means to support their herds. Support to reduce drought losses and aid recovery should take into consideration the different capabilities and requirements of small and large herd owners. Effects of high stocking rates and resource condition on mortality and herd growth were apparent during the drought year of 2016, but not the other years. Most die-offs appear to have been concentrated in a short period once forage and water resources became too scarce and far to reach. Recognising when this threshold is imminent would be useful for targeting strategic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) is a monitoring procedure that uses quickly determined field indicators to assess the functional status of rangelands. As such, it complements existing procedures that assess condition. It comprises three modules — a conceptual framework, a field methodology and an interpretational framework — and is intended to generate chronosequences of data. The conceptual framework is based on the economy of vital resources and focuses on the processes that regulate the spatial movement and use of water, topsoil and organic matter in the landscape. The field methodology uses simple, visual indicators closely related to a range of physical, chemical and biological processes, taking only a few seconds per indicator to assess in the field after training. Observations of system dynamics are made in two spatially nested scales ('hillslope' and 'patch'). A patch is an area on a hillslope where scarce, vital resources tend to be accumulated. A software template generates a series of tables containing data at both scales. The interpretational framework is based on a sigmoidal response surface linking the lowest and highest functional examples of a given landscape type across a stress/disturbance gradient. It facilitates the identification of target values for rehabilitation and the propinquity of monitored sites to a critical threshold distinguishing 'sustainable' from 'unsustainable' management/climate combinations. The procedure enables critically vulnerable processes to be identified, so that rehabilitation procedures can be appropriately designed. LFA has been developed, tested and implemented in a range of climate types (200mm to 4 000mm rainfall per year) and land-uses (pastoralism, mining, nature conservation).

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the fire regime over 41 years (1956 to 1996) in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, a mesic savanna area in South Africa. The study focuses at the landscape scale of tens of kilometres and at the medium term temporal scale of decades. Variation in fire regime was analysed in relation to variation in annual rainfall and the influence of management. The average annual area of the park that burnt was 26% and the average area of individual fires was 9.1 km2. Statistics relating to the percentage of area burnt annually, the average size of an individual burn, the mean and median fire return periods and the influence of management philosophy relative to the spatial and temporal variation in rainfall conditions are presented. Sources of ignition and implications for management are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Rangeland condition assessment was conducted in the Borana lowlands, southern Ethiopia to determine the current status and future trend of the grazing land with emphasis on comparing different functional land use units, called Kalo, Worra and Foora. An approach that integrated data from herbaceous and woody plants, soil and pastoralists' perceptions was followed. Density and canopy cover of woody plants were determined in 123 plots of 500m2. Scores of grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, number of grass seedlings, grass age distribution, soil erosion and compaction were recorded from 615 subplots of 0.25m2. Furthermore, relationships between rangeland condition score and herbaceous biomass production, percent bare soil, and density, frequency and percent cover of woody plants were determined by applying multivariate analyses. The overall rangeland condition appeared to be in a transitional state from good to poor with a downward trend. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Redundancy Analysis (RDA) illustrated that woody plants were negatively correlated with rangeland condition score, botanical composition and basal cover of grasses. The pastoralists perceived that woody plants encroachment, lack and/or shortage of rain, and ban of rangeland burning were among the major factors that caused rangeland deterioration. Therefore, rangeland rehabilitation, re-utilization of fire as a rangeland management tool, and selective clearing of woody plants are recommended as a result of this study.",

    "abstract": "The relative benefit of different grazing management practices for maintaining grassland biodiversity integrity was assessed. Practices considered were grazing system, stocking rate, animal type, grazing season, fire–grazing interaction, plus burning regime. Sparse empirical data indicated that stocking rate, cattle-to-sheep ratio, and increased fire intervals can affect plant diversity. Certain species behave as increaser or decreaser species in response to stocking rate or cattle-to-sheep ratio. Plant diversity appears robust in the face of variation in fire regime except for preclusion of fire. Multicriteria analysis was used to assess the relative impact of grazing systems (continuous, conventional, or high-intensity grazing by sheep, cattle, or sheep plus cattle) on grassland biodiversity integrity. Selected indicators covered landscape composition, structure and functioning. High-intensity systems and continuous sheep grazing have the most, and continuous grazing with beef the least, negative impact, depending on stocking rate. The relation between veld condition and plant diversity needs to be tested further before veld condition is used as a management tool for maintaining biodiversity. Proposed research priorities include inventory of management systems used, rapid expansion of the empirical data base, an improved understanding of patterns of plant diversity across the biome, and evaluation of the pyro–grazing diversity paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Forage legumes have the potential to contribute substantially to warm-season, subtropical and tropical pastures and rangelands. Compared to grasses, they have advantages in accessing subsoil nutrients and moisture; legumes typically concentrate protein in forage, even in infertile soils, and they can also provide ruminants with plant proteins and soluble carbohydrates that increase digestibility of grasses when consumed in legume–grass mixtures. Yet their inclusion in warm-season, subtropical or tropical pasture seed mixes or rangeland rehabilitation is minimal considering the percentage of grasslands coverage in these regions. Why have past diligent attempts failed to develop the germplasm, agronomic techniques, dissemination and ultimate widespread acceptance by land managers in regions where these legumes are widely adapted? Successful forage legume reports indicate that farmers’ participation in technology development, persistence with minimal management, adequate seed supply following release of new varieties, meeting recognised needs, delivery of clear benefits and profits, and communication among researchers, extension and stakeholders are crucial. Current and future research and development programs based on limited past successes and widespread failures should enhance successful commercial use of warm-season, subtropical and tropical forage legumes.",

This study assessed commercial livestock and game farmers' knowledge and perceptions of climate variability and change in the semiarid Great Fish River Valley, South Africa, and their coping responses to a severe regional drought in 2009/2010. Detailed questionnaires revealed that farmers' knowledge of global climate change was incomplete, suggesting that measures are needed to increase their understanding and awareness of likely impacts. Farmers were able to articulate a consistent story regarding how they believed local climate to have changed and most had implemented a variety of coping strategies in order to endure the drought. Some of these strategies were seen to have the potential to become longer-term adaptive practices. Farmers were, on the whole, open to considering new approaches and land uses such as carbon farming with Portulacaria afra (spekboom) to help them adapt to a more uncertain future.",

This study assessed how the management (herding and free-ranging) of different livestock herds affects their feeding ecology during the wet and dry seasons in a semi-arid shrubland. By using direct observations of livestock grazing in the field, we established their habitat preferences, diet selection and resources overlap. Results indicate that all free-ranging livestock can be considered grazers with cattle being selective. When sheep are herded, they tend to be more generalist feeders and herded goats are browsers. Livestock diet selection and forage preferences are largely linked to the habitats in which they graze and browse. Dietary overlap is highest between free-ranging livestock irrespective of season, whereas herded livestock are able to consume a food source with little potential competition from other livestock. Although the wet-season annual forage resources are able to sustain the livestock population in Leliefontein, this study concludes that the overdependence on annual vegetation would make livestock vulnerable during drought periods when forage production is low.",

More than 95% of the Karoo is comprised of land classified as Natural, which has been relatively stable since 1990. Over the last 100 years cultivation, as well as the number of domestic livestock, has declined significantly in both biomes. Protected areas have increased since 1980 to comprise nearly 8% of the Succulent Karoo biome, although they only cover 1.6% of the Nama-Karoo biome. There has been a significant recent increase in renewable energy installation applications, which cover 4% of the Karoo drylands. The trend in vegetation productivity (NDVI; 1982–2015) is unchanged over 90% of both biomes, while nearly 10% of the Karoo has shown a significant increase in NDVI trend. An analysis of repeat photographs shows that vegetation cover has either remained unchanged or has increased at most locations. Although the Karoo drylands appear less degraded than they were in the mid-twentieth century, on-going monitoring at different temporal and spatial scales is essential to evaluate the future impact of LULCC on these semi-arid environments.",

The influence of grazing on the forb composition, richness and diversity of two species-rich grasslands in the coastal hinterland and midlands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa was examined in plots subject to grazing intensities ranging from lightly grazed nature reserves through to heavily stocked communal areas and commercial ranches. Grazing altered forb species composition and considerably reduced forb richness and Shannon diversity in both grasslands. Mean forb richness declined by 64–84%, from 50–55 species per 100 m2 in lightly grazed areas to fewer than 10–20 species in the most heavily grazed plots. Many long-lived perennial indigenous forbs were extirpated or markedly reduced in abundance by overgrazing and replaced by a few, mostly exotic, hardy species, suggesting these grasslands did not evolve under heavy grazing. Indigenous forb richness was non-linearly related to, and thus not reliably predicted by, range condition score and the abundance of two dominant decreaser and increaser grasses, but the poorest grassland was the most depauperate and good condition grassland was invariably diverse. Judicious grazing management with light stocking is thus required to maintain the diversity of mesic grassland.",

Renewal of the herbaceous stratum is made possible by resprouting, mostly through a belowground bud bank. Evaluating the impacts of disturbances on the bud bank can assist in predicting post-disturbance responses and system resilience. In a semi-arid savanna, we aimed to verify whether lower fire frequency, fire and herbivory exclusion could affect belowground bud bank and organs diversity and consequently, the resprouting potential. Lower fire frequency or suppression and absence of herbivory were expected to reduce the bud bank density, which was confirmed by our results. If the fire is suppressed or fire frequency is reduced, the total, graminoid and the shrub bud bank decreased, whereas herbivory exclusion resulted in total and a forb bud bank of lower densities. Belowground buds were identified in non-woody and woody rhizomes, stolons, root crowns, and bulbs or corms. Despite having bud banks of lower density, disturbance exclusion promoted belowground biomass accumulation. Our results indicated the importance of maintaining the endogenous disturbances to the preservation of the belowground community and regeneration strategy, guaranteeing resilience in semi-arid savanna communities.",

    "abstract": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recognises transhumance pastoralism as a beneficial livestock production system that can contribute to food security together with economic and political stability. Thus, the subregional bloc put together the ECOWAS Protocol on Transhumance and supporting regulations to actualise these benefits. These policies seek to regulate transhumance pastoralism by ensuring that herd movements are along defined migratory corridors among member states. This review assesses the importance of transhumance pastoralism in West Africa, local and cross-border policies, and associated challenges, with emphasis on herder–farmer conflicts. It was realised that the movement of large numbers of livestock into rangelands (1) provides employment for many, and thus improves livelihoods; (2) improves productivity through high milk production and high fertility; (3) reduces moribund and combustible forage materials in the dry season; and (4) enhances seed dispersal, soil fertility and plant diversity on rangelands. This review shows that the ECOWAS cross-border transhumance protocols have led to infrastructural developments in some member states, but the partial enforcement of protocols has led to herder–farmer conflicts. We conclude that transhumance pastoralism and the regulatory policies have several benefits. However, to ensure policy compliance and avoid herder–farmer conflicts, the policies need to be reviewed and discernible gaps eliminated.",

Exclusion had no effect on the soil chemistry of the surface 15 cm of soil in Dohne and Piet Retief Sourveld. Exclusion promoted the ingress of woody elements, including heath-like species, but the extent of ingress was related to water availability (rainfall, aspect), proximity of propagules, duration of protection, and accidental fires. Alien invasive woody species, in particular Acacia mearnsii established at all sites. Woody species were mostly bird- or wind dispersed, some had no known nearby population, although some Acacia species were herbivore-dispersed. The wettest grassland, Piet Retief Sourveld on a southern aspect, was transformed to a shrubland matrix (mainly Helichrysum splendidum) with tree clumps of forest precursor species (Rhus dentata, Halleria lucida, Myrsine africana, Buddleja salviifolia, Leucosidea sericea) and A. mearnsii. A species-rich grassland on the northern aspect had become dominated by tall Hyparrhenia rufa, with scattered shrubs of L. sericea and Helichrysum rogulosum. The southern aspect exclosure in Döhne Sourveld had developed an A. mearnsii - B. salviifolia savanna, with Cymbopogon excavatus, Themeda triandra and Tristachya leucothrix as common grasses. The northern aspect exclosure on Döhne Sourveld maintained a grassland character, although heath-like elements (Stoebe vulgaris, Erica aspalanthifolia) established. Protection of the Southern Tall Grassveld promoted an open savanna of exotic and indigenous Acacia and broadleaf species, an increase in life forms including the succulent Aloe maculata, and the transformation of a T. triandra - T. leucothrix sward to an Aristida junciformis sward. Ferns benefitted from exclusion of fire and herbivory. Fire and herbivory rather than soil properties would seem the primary determinants of the structure of sour grasslands.",

    "abstract": "Little of the current focus on landscape fragmentation has focused on rangelands or pastoral lands. This paper investigates the existing evidence for causes and processes of fragmentation in pastoral lands and its effects of landscapes and peoples. More conceptual work is needed on the definition of loss and fragmentation, particularly efforts to clarify fragmentation from whose (or what's) perspective. Fragmentation and loss are caused by a suite of underlying demographic, economic, institutional, technological and policy, biological and climatic factors in east Africa, with property rights as a particularly important cause. These underlying causes often originate far from rangelands and drive more local causes like expansion of cropland and settlements and construction of fences and water points. Pastoral systems first fragment in wetter rangelands or in the key resource areas (wetlands, riverine areas) in drier rangelands. Ecological effects of fragmentation range widely across animal and plant populations, nutrient cycling and soils, with strong effects on animals with large body sizes. We have little understanding of the economic consequences of fragmentation and have a strong need to focus future research on valuing ecological services that affect human well-being, to gain a better picture of the complementarities and trade-offs land managers face during the process of fragmentation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The relative effects of drought and heavy grazing on the floristic composition, population size and structure, and basal cover of an African savanna grassland were differentiated by comparing changes over eight years, which included a severe drought year, across a gradient of grazing history. Drought had an overriding effect on community change, but grazing history had an additional effect. Severe drought in combination with a history of severe grazing transformed grassland of predominantly palatable, perennial grasses (Themeda triandra, Setaria incrassata, Heteropogon contortus) to grassland dominated by the unpalatable perennial Aristida bipartita, annual grasses and forbs. Palatable species were almost eliminated from the sward between tree canopies, but residual populations were protected beneath certain woody species. The most lightly grazed grassland maintained its character of palatable, perennial grass species but was changed considerably in the relative proportion of these species. After the drought, tuft size of palatable species was smaller than any previously recorded but recovered thereafter. A number of annual and perennial grass species were recorded for the first tune subsequent to the drought. Consideration of the life history attributes of species was useful for predicting species’ responses. Grazing management during drought episodes would seem critical for determining the direction of community change. The notion that savanna grasslands are insensitive to grazing because of their disequilibrium behaviour was rejected.",

    "abstract": "Dryland degradation (in other words, desertification) is defined for the purposes of this paper as a persistent decrease in the capacity of an arid or semiarid ecosystem to supply a range of services, including (but not restricted to) forage, fuel, timber, crops, fresh water, wild-harvested foods, biodiversity habitat and tourism opportunities. A conceptual model is proposed that allows syndromes to be evaluated. The hypothesis is that the majority of instances of desertification in southern Africa are due to one or more of a relatively small set of distinct biophysical mechanisms, interacting with a similarly small set of human system contexts. The paper describes 13 biophysical mechanisms, focusing on the system dynamics that lead to the loss of ecosystem services, and why the loss is persistent. It suggests the diagnostic symptoms and the conditions under which the syndrome occurs, and the remedial actions that can be taken. A preliminary attempt is made to estimate the aerial extent and severity of the various syndromes. It is suggested that application of these ideas will help to make the evaluation of dryland degradation more rigorous, and pave the way to better-prioritised and focused interventions.",

This article explores the 'youth in agriculture' problem from various angles. First, it surveys the various explanations prevalent in the policy community regarding the 'youth in agriculture' problem. Second, it gathers together the sparse research evidence regarding the participation/nonparticipation of the youth in agriculture. Third, it reflects on the intersection between the 'youth in agriculture' problem and the challenges of promoting livestock production in the communal rangelands of the former homelands/reserves. The article tentatively argues that there is a strong parallel between the 'youth in agriculture' problem and the question of commercialisation of livestock production, in the sense that the pursuit of the latter is likely to comprise at least a partial solution to the former. By the same token, the article argues that both face a common challenge, namely the high concentration of cattle and goat ownership in the former homelands/reserves.",

Five diets were formulated based on spineless cactus (Opuntia fícus-indica cv. 'Gigante') and buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris). The experimental design was completely randomised, with five treatments and three replicates in which the diets differed in the proportion of buffelgrass (0%, 15%, 25%, 30% and 35%, on a fresh matter basis). There was significant difference (p < 0.05) in the chemical composition of the diets, with all dry matter contents being within the ideal range. Ammonia-nitrogen content was not affected (p > 0.05). There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in dry matter recovery across diets, which ranged from 96.28% to 99.93%. The pH values decreased as the time of opening (days) was extended. Organic acid contents differed across all diets; however, overall, all diets showed satisfactory lactic acid contents. As the proportion of buffelgrass in the diets was increased, the degradability of dry matter decreased. Based on fermentation profile, losses and chemical composition the diet with higher proportion of spineless cactus can be recommended for silage production.",

    "abstract": "Droughts are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity for large parts of Africa. It is unclear how this may impact native grazers in protected areas, and how these outcomes may differ under contrasting management approaches. Reducing artificial water sources and increasing the size of protected areas have been proposed as management responses that could possibly increase system resilience and buffer herbivores against large-scale mortality during droughts. Long-term spatially explicit buffalo, elephant and hippo census data from the Kruger National Park and adjacent private protected areas during three droughts (1982/1983, 1991/1992 and 2015/2016) provided a unique opportunity to explore how a range of management actions influenced megaherbivore responses across six regions. Drought responses varied significantly at a regional scale for all three megaherbivores, supporting the notion that size, and the associated emergent property of spatio-temporal heterogeneity, provides a buffer during droughts. Furthermore, regional buffalo population declines (as a function of mortality, movement and birth rates) were highest in areas with high waterhole density and concomitant low levels of herbaceous biomass, compared with areas that experienced similar rainfall, but had lower waterhole density and higher herbaceous biomass. Elephant mortalities were negligible, but elephants displayed regional movement patterns, seemingly attracted to higher water provision densities during the drought. Our results highlight that drought interacts with spatio-temporal environmental gradients and management actions and illustrates how the Greater Kruger National Park is increasingly functioning as an integrated ecosystem for megaherbivores.",

    "abstract": "Drought is often discussed as a major perturbation in savanna ecosystems, associated with lasting shifts in savanna structure and functioning. However, historically, droughts have occurred frequently in southern African savannas, suggesting that plants might benefit from being resilient to drought. Here, we evaluate whether the 2014–2016 drought was an extreme event in terms of effects on the herbaceous vegetation and specifically on grasses. We monitored herbaceous responses, pre-, during and post-drought in the Kruger National Park and compared responses with a previous extreme drought (1991–1992). Grass biomass decreased during both droughts, but recovered quickly once rains returned, regardless of whether areas burned in the years preceding drought. However, species functional composition was slower to recover, with shifts in dominance that closely matched grass photosynthetic machinery. Species drought tolerances were best predicted by their bundle sheath morphology: species characterised by XyMS− bundle sheaths (often associated with NADP-ME photosythesis) declined in abundance consistently during drought, whereas those characterised by XyMS+ bundle sheaths (associated with PEP-ck and NAD-ME photosynthesis) either increased or were unaffected by drought. The response of grass to drought, at least in terms of productivity and functional composition, is relatively predictable.",

Rangeland in this arid region is species-rich and dominated by a mixture of long-lived succulent and non-succulent shrubs. Ranching has led to the domination of vegetation by less palatable species, and resting does little to restore diversity because most species are long-lived. Between 2015 and 2020, a combination of rising temperatures and low rainfall reduced vegetation cover and grazing potential throughout the Karoo. Mortality varied among species, habitat and with predrought rangeland condition, but appeared independent of size class. Growth form was not a good predictor of drought survival, although vegetation dominated by non-succulent shrub species before the drought was dominated by a succulent shrub species toward the end of the drought. Dieback was greater on deep soil than in drainage lines and on stony rises. Historically degraded landscapes lost relatively more vegetation cover and grazing capacity than areas protected from grazing. By reducing dominant, long-lived, non-forage shrub species, drought appears to be changing the composition of the vegetation to a state that may have higher grazing potential, particularly if livestock numbers are reduced and reseeding is carried out during the recovery period.",

Relationships between bush density and the density, species composition and phytomass production of the grass component were determined over a four-year period. Bush encroachment had an adverse influence on the density and production of the grass component, but not on the species composition. Fluctuations in seasonal rainfall appeared to be the most important factor governing changes in the species composition of the grass component. Bush enchroachment (2 500 tree equivalents ha−l) decreased the potential grazing capacity by as much as 331%, 149% and 58% in the Molopo Thornveld, the Mixed Vaalbos Thornveld and the Eastern Grass Bushveld, respectively, In comparison to sites with tree densities of less than 400 tree equivalents ha−1.

Sourveld occurs in areas with high water supply and where parent material gives rise to soils with a low base status. Sweetveld occurs in areas with low water supply and where parent material gives rise to soils with a high base status. The distribution of sweet‐ and sourveld does not seem to be determined by base status itself, but by the concentration of available phosphorus and the size of the readily mineralizable nitrogen pool in the soil. The difference between the temperatures in the growth (wet) and no‐growth (dry) seasons also appears important, but the relation is not clear. We propose that aspects of the environment which promote carbon assimilation (water supply and temperature) in relation to nutrient supply (soil fertility, water supply and temperature) determine the forage quality of grassland vegetation. Sourveld occurs where carbon assimilation is high relative to nutrient supply, and sweetveld where nutrient supply is high relative to carbon assimilation. Mixed veld is intermediate between these two.",

Faecal nitrogen concentrations of between 13 and 16 g kg−1 are above a threshold level that indicates a dietary deficiency which may precipitate nutritional stress in animals (such as happened during the 1991/1992 drought). Faecal phosphorous concentrations of between 1.9 and 2.0 g kg−1 over a long period of time would indicate a deficiency that may lead to low reproductive rates.

When all these multiple uses are accounted for, the cash and direct-use returns of livestock in communal areas can be comparable to commercial systems, although temporally and spatially variable. Yet previous work has generally excluded small stock from such analyses, as well as benefits and costs to non-owning households. This paper presents empirical results of a study in the Sand River catchment, assessing the benefits and costs accruing to owners and non-owners for both cattle and goats within a livelihoods analysis framework. Results indicate that cattle are used for a greater variety of goods and services than are goats. The savings value represented the most important function, followed by milk and then manure. Even if savings value was excluded, cattle ownership made a significant contribution to local livelihoods. Goats also provided a net positive benefit, represented largely by the savings value, followed by meat and cash sales. Non-owners also benefited through donations of manure, milk, draught and meat for free, or at a cheaper rate than alternatives. The majority of non-owners aspired to livestock ownership, although the risk of theft of animals was of growing concern. Averaged across the whole catchment, the net value of goods and services from livestock was just over R400 per hectare, with an annual return to capital of 36%. Cattle contributed the bulk of the value by virtue of their greater numbers and larger size, but on a per kilogramme basis goats provided higher value. Many of the goods and services obtained from livestock were not enumerated in regional or national economic statistics. Keywords: CATTLECOSTSGOATSGOODS AND SERVICESNON-OWNERS",

    "abstract": "Abstract During routine field application of the disc pasture meter (DPM) in the tall-grass rangeland of the Kruger National Park (KNP), it was noticed that the instrument frequently settles above the bulk of the grass leaf mass, leading to the suspicion that the settling height is inflated and non-representative. Taking into consideration the relatively heterogeneous nature of the herbaceous layer in terms of its floristic and structural diversity, as well as the increasing tendency to use the instrument for research purposes where a greater degree of precision is desirable, it was decided to re-evaluate the calibration of this instrument. Field sampling was undertaken, and by means of double normal distribution and 'broken stick' regression analyses, two populations were identified, both with a non-linear relation between compressed DPM height and above-ground standing crop. Beyond a DPM height of 26cm, the correlation is poor, apparently being strongly influenced by the structure of the grass plant; tall grasses or grasses with highly lignified culms lead to a weaker correlation. Two equations for DPM height groups (≤26cm and >26cm) were produced: kg ha−1 = [31.7176 (0.32181/x) x0.2834]2 (r = 0.979; r2 = 0.951; P < 0.0005) and kg ha−1 = [17.3543 (0.9893x) x0.5413]2 (r = 0.948; r2 = 0.882; P < 0.0005) where x is the mean DPM height in cm of a site.

This study compared the relative importance of land tenure, geology, slope angle and solar radiation index (calculated from aspect and slope angle) in influencing plant composition, basal cover, soil erosion and shrub encroachment in adjacent communal and commercial farming areas in two grassland types in South Africa. Sites under communal tenure had higher stocking rates and human population densities, different grass composition, lower basal cover, more bare ground, higher erosion scores and greater densities of unpalatable dwarf shrubs than commercial farms. Geology, slope angle and solar radiation had a secondary effect on some vegetation and soil variables, indicating the importance of controlling for these abiotic factors when comparing communal and commercial rangelands Keywords: BASAL COVERCOMMUNAL RANGELANDSDEGRADATIONEROSIONSHRUB ENCROACHMENT",

Most of the plants (55%) were found to be root suckers. There was no significant effect of disturbance type and frequency on 'seedling' establishment from seeds versus root suckers. Even when burnt annually, D. cinerea continued to form root suckers.

Invasion (c. 15% Prosopis canopy cover) reduced grazing capacity by 34%, whereas clearing improved it by 110% within six years. Much of the loss in grazing capacity during invasion was due to the displacement of the annual grass Aristida adscensionis that dominated herbaceous forage production at the study site. Improvement in rangeland grazing capacity after Prosopis clearing was due to increases in abundance of A. adscensionis, the perennial grass Cynodon dactylon and the establishment of the perennial grasses Eragrostis obtusa and Eragrostis lehmanniana. Grazing capacity in cleared rangeland was 39% higher than in uninvaded rangeland due to a higher abundance of the annual grasses A. adscensionis, Chloris virgata, Setaria verticillata and Tragus berteronianus and the perennial grasses E. obtusa, E. lehmanniana and C. dactylon. Our results indicate that Prosopis invasion (>13% mean canopy cover) can lower grazing capacity in Nama Karoo rangeland, whereas clearing Prosopis from such rangeland can, even under heavy grazing, substantially improve grazing capacity within 4–6 years.",

Thirty-eight vegetation types were identified using TWINSPAN, and a map of the types was created by supervised classification of a Landsat 7 ETM+ image (2000). A discriminant function analysis showed that the types were primarily separated along a soil textural gradient. A secondary gradient, associated with changes in soil depth, rockiness, slope and topographical position, was also important. Ordination indicated that several other independent environmental gradients appeared to be influencing the vegetation.

This study assessed the perceptions and understanding of climate change amongst livestock farmers in the semi-arid Eastern Cape Karoo and their responses to perceived changes and associated risks. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews revealed that, while commercial famers were well informed regarding global climate change, commonage farmers had little or no understanding of the phenomenon. Although changes in local climate parameters were identified by farmers, perceived changes were mostly ascribed to the expected climate variability of the region. It was found that commonage farmers are particularly vulnerable to future climate change, whereas commercial farmers, having experience in dealing with the already variable and marginal conditions of the region and facing fewer asset and informational constraints, possess a greater adaptive capacity to respond to projected changes. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that lack of funds, lack of government support and access to information on climate change and potential adaptation strategies are the main factors constraining farmers from adaptation.",

Although the condition of montane grasslands for provision of ecosystem services is maintained by regular annual or biennial burning, controversy exists over the impact of different frequencies and seasons of burning on grassland productivity. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term effects of different burning regimes on primary production and quality of the montane grasslands of the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg. There were no significant differences in the mean standing live mass between 30 years of annual winter and biennial spring burning. However, in unburnt areas productivity was 20% lower (118.2 g m−2) than in regularly burnt grassland (144.7–154.5 g m−2). Crude protein did not vary between the annual winter and biennial spring treatments (95–113 kg ha−1), but was significantly lower in unburned areas (45 kg ha−1). However, an infrequent fire in a protected area caused a temporary spike in crude protein (16%) compared with regular burning (5–10%), which can benefit wildlife. We conclude that montane grasslands can be burnt annually or biennially in the dormant season to promote long-term productivity.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of urea addition on fermentation characteristics, losses and chemical composition of silage of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) 'BRS Ponta Negra'. The sorghum plant was chopped and treated with different levels of urea (0.1756, 0.3512, 0.7024 and 1.4048 g per 10 kg fresh forage for the respective proportions of 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0% and 4.0% of forage (dry matter [DM] basis), and packed into quintuplicate experimen- tal silos to determine its effects on fermentation, losses and chemical composition of sorghum silages. Addition of urea increased lactic acid bacteria up to the level of 60 g kg−1 (DM basis). Compared with control silage, the addition of urea (p < 0.05) reduced DM losses. Urea-treated silages linearly increased (p < 0.05) the ammoniacal nitrogen and crude protein contents, and linearly reduced (p < 0.05) the ethanol content. The pH in urea-treated silages indicated better preservation of substrates obtained from fermentation. The intermediate level of 2.0% urea additive can be used to improve fermentation, reducing losses in sorghum silage without compromising lactic acid production. However, the addition of 0.5% and 1.0% urea to sorghum silage is sufficient to improve aerobic stability.",

Despite emerging literature on climate and tourism in southern Africa, the challenges to tourism in the region as a result of the drought remain under explored. This paper quantifies the extent of the reduction in precipitation during this period to determine its status as a meteorological drought through the calculation of the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The impacts of the dry period on nature tourism within the Sabi Sands Game Reserve are then explored by means of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. A composite timeline of the perceived severity of the dry period is produced. Key impacts and associated adaptation strategies are explored, along with the perceptions of stakeholders towards potential future drought events and climate change generally for nature tourism. Stakeholders are found to be highly knowledgeable regarding the climate of the region, as well as the nature and severity of the drought event. Although the overall impact on tourism is found to be lower than expected, this study concludes that droughts may pose a significant threat to the sector in the long term.",

The experimental design was completely randomised and consisted of a 4 × 5 factorial arrangement with four replicates. The treatments consisted of four forages, namely, Xaraes palisadegrass (Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xaraés), Congo grass (Brachiaria ruziziensis), Mombaça guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv. Mombaça), and Tamani guinea grass (Panicum maximum cv. BRS Tamani), intercropped with oversown soybean, and these treatments were evaluated over five grazing cycles. The results showed that Mombaça guinea grass and Xaraes palisadegrass were associated with higher forage production, but the highest forage quality was obtained with Tamani guinea grass. Mombaça guinea grass, Xaraes palisadegrass, and Tamani guinea grass resulted in the best pasture performance of animals under grazing in the off-season and thus generated more benefits in terms of the soybean yield. Congo grass was associated with reduced production, lower forage quality and decreased animal production during the grazing cycles. The pasture establishment through soybean over sowing proved to be an efficient technique that reduced the environmental impact of livestock, because of the greater use of soil nutrients and resulted in greater sustainability.",

The individual yields of fresh (270 t ha−1) and dry (23 t ha−1) matter in the cactus were not affected by the mulch or by intercropping.

The cactus-millet configuration, irrespective of the use of mulch, but irrigated in dry environments or during dry periods of the year, is more advantageous than the monocrops, because it promotes gains in production and food diversity for meeting the demand of the herd.",

Afromontane grasslands represent a large carbon reservoir, but it is uncertain how fire affects their long-term C storage. We investigated the effect of fire regime on soil organic C and N (SOC; SON) in a long-term (39-year) burning experiment in the Maloti-Drakensberg Park, South Africa. We compared SOC and SON sampled in 2004 and 2019 from six treatments differing in fire frequency (annual, biennial, five-year, infrequent) and season (spring, autumn). Average SOC increased significantly between 2004 and 2019. Average SON increased slightly, resulting in a significant increase in C:N ratio, indicating that soil organic matter is becoming less N-eutrophic. Importantly, burning annually in spring increased SOC and SON. This unexpected response is attributed to the aluandic (acidic, high organic matter) properties of Drakensberg soils. Burning in autumn did not increase SOC and SON. The lowest C stocks were observed in infrequently burnt plots. Average C sequestration across all fire treatments was 0.30 Mg ha−1 y−1. The observed increase in SOC under frequent fires is contrary to many findings from other studies in grassy ecosystems and notably driven by fire season.",

Decades of fire research in South Africa inspired a unique convergence of high-intensity fire experiments in the USA. In the Great Plains of North America, high-intensity fire trials were designed to remove traditional investigator constraints that minimised variability in fire intensity and to explore woody mortality thresholds across a broader suite of experimental conditions. At the same time, studies in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, similarly investigated high-intensity fires to examine previously unstudied relationships between high-intensity fires and woody encroachment. These scientific pursuits have contributed to theoretical advances in our understanding of fire-vegetation dynamics. In this paper, we synthesise these high-intensity fire experiments, the empirical evidence emerging from them and their importance for managing grassland and savanna ecosystems, and the lessons learned and challenges ahead to maintaining critical ranges of variation in fire regimes during the Anthropocene.",

The data showed that rainfall and E t have equivalent estimation value. The multiple curvilinear regression equation (r = 0.88) that was established, with seasonal rainfall and veld condition score as the independent variables, can be used with great success in this veld type to estimate seasonal production potential. In terms of the above‐ground phytomass production, it would appear that veld in good condition responds more efficiently to rainfall than veld in poor condition. Basal cover decreased linearly with a deterioration in veld condition.",

Soil seed bank sampling was carried out at three-monthly intervals from 0.25m2 blocks 50mm deep. Sampling was from rangeland artificially maintained in three different rangeland conditions viz. good, moderate and poor. The total seedling establishment in the field for every species was obtained at the end of the growing season. Soil temperatures at 100mm depth and soil-water content at 50mm depth intervals were recorded once a week. Due to the lower basal cover with rangeland degradation, soil temperatures increased significantly both daily and seasonally, while soil-water content also decreased. Rangeland in poor condition was characterised by a significantly higher seed density in the seed bank and more seedling establishment than grassland in good condition. No climax seedlings were present in rangeland in poor condition, while very few survived in rangeland in good condition at the end of the season. A mean seasonal seed bank density of rangeland in good, moderate and poor condition was respectively: 48, 74 and 98 seedlings m–2 for October; 28, 32 and 40 seedlings m–2 for January; and 58, 172 and 128 seedlings m–2 for April.

The degradation gradient was then used to quantify rangeland condition of areas ranging from poor (trampled areas close to watering points) to well-managed areas and areas that degraded as a result of selective grazing due to under-utilisation. Changes in the proportion of species composition over the degradation gradient were determined using a nearest plant point technique. Indicator species for the purpose of rangeland condition assessment were identified. Elionurus muticus was identified as a indicator species for rangeland that degraded as a result of selective grazing, while species such as Eragrostis chloromelas, Eragrostis plana and Cynodon hirsutus were indicators for rangeland that degraded due to long-term overgrazing. As computer equipment can limit the use of the degradation gradient, easier alternative methods were investigated, and the accuracy of these methods was tested against the degradation gradient. The advantage of this technique lies in its simplicity and ease of use. Another advantage is that only the most important indicator and the dominant species can be used to determine rangeland condition.",

Over the past century, mobile livestock husbandry has either been suppressed or collapsed and a fragmented pattern of rangeland use has ensued. Policy shifts underlying these processes in Kazakstan are traced. New patterns are evident whereby some flocks are again being moved by season to different pastures. In the market economy, individual families now decide on the costs and benefits of moving their animals. Results are reported from a multidisciplinary study of two rangeland areas in Kazakstan, including a survey of 46 households interviewed quarterly during 2001–2002 and community-level analyses of grazing patterns. Flock mobility is considered in terms of flock size and household assets of labour and capital. For most households in the study sites, movement is neither economically attractive nor absolutely necessary. Having enough resources is not a sufficient condition for moving. Other factors that bear upon the decision to move include the degree of grazing pressure around the shepherds' home base. In heavily stocked areas, even small-scale producers are finding ways of moving their animals. In isolated or abandoned areas where forage is plentiful, movement can be minimised even for large flocks. Keywords: HISTORYHOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICSPASTURE PRODUCTIVITYPOLICY",

    "abstract": "Abstract The importance of the human dimensions of vegetation change in rangelands is increasingly being acknowledged. However, surprisingly little research is directed at advancing our understanding of the relationships between socio-economic factors and state of the vegetation in these systems. There is therefore a significant gap in our understanding of the socio-economic drivers of change in rangeland vegetation. This paper uses the results of long-term research in the communal rangelands of the South African lowveld to demonstrate how socio-economic changes can influence resource use patterns, which in turn directly impact on the vegetation. Factors such as changes in institutional control, levels of unemployment and local perceptions of rights and responsibilities since democratic elections have resulted in a dramatic increase in harvesting of tree resources in these communal rangelands. Most noticeable has been the increased commercial harvesting of fuelwood. Increased harvesting has a significant impact on the vegetation, which in turn reduces local resource supply. This results in increasing reliance on resources purchased from commercial harvesters or on substitute resources. These changes in resource use patterns and the resultant impacts on the vegetation thus form a feedback loop between society and the natural environment. This paper emphasises the importance of understanding these relationships in order to adequately understand vegetation change in human-impacted rangeland systems. Research partnerships involving both the natural and social sciences will thus become increasingly important in rangeland ecology. Keywords: COMMON PROPERTYHUMAN DIMENSIONSRURAL SOCIETY",

Acacia mellifera never occurred on clay pans, and in low numbers only in other clay and sandy soils. This trend is ascribed to the soil texture, soil water regimes and/or heavy utilisation in these areas. Soil rockiness was important in determining the long-term presence and abundance of A. mellifera, perhaps due to better soil moisture conditions. Long-term increases in A. mellifera in non-rocky habitats were also found, although the causes of this remain unclear.

Vegetation was surveyed in 1952, 1973, 1986 and 2009. Woody colonisation into grasslands was the most noted change over time. The woody component was resurveyed in 2009 after the latest of 13 unintended fires had swept through CIX in 2007. This fire had an irregular burn pattern resulting in not all woody vegetation being burnt. The burn pattern was seen to be historically recurrent owing to the presence of distinct community assemblages with varying degrees of fire tolerance and metromorphic differences between prefire populations in burnt areas and those in fire-protected areas of the same species. Erica evansii and Leucosidea sericea, a reseeder and resprouter, respectively, were the two dominant species in CIX. These displayed expected responses to fire, resulting in dominance shifting from Erica evansii (92% mortality) to Leucosidea sericea (1.6% mortality). The decrease in E. evansii individuals resulted in a relative increase in community contribution of species not affected by fire. The postfire dominance of Leucosidea sericea in burnt plots was not apparent in fire-protected areas.",

In tropical montane grasslands, such changes are predicted to follow shifts in the percentage cover and abundance of species following the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways. Reliable methods of detecting impacts of such changes on biomass and forage nutrient quality will likely provide a synoptic scale link between carbon sequestration, nutrient cycles and environmental change. Remote sensing approaches provide efficient methods to assess changes in vegetation composition quickly and are efficient for assessing vegetation in large areas. Multitemporal data obtained using broadband multispectral instruments have been used inconsistently to discriminate C3 and C4 grasslands and to draw some inferences. Advancements in narrowband hyperspectral systems are expected to offer greater potential for accurate mapping of C3 and C4 composition in grasslands. This paper presents an overview of the uses of optical remote sensing for C3 and C4 discrimination, which is consistent with the PFT concept used in land-surface modeling schemes. This review describes the structural properties and biochemical characteristics that affect C3 and C4 grass reflectance. It highlights critical limitations and evaluates the potential of remote sensing approaches used for C3 and C4 studies. Keywords: grasslandnatural resource managementmontaneremote sensing",

Since management of abandoned croplands depends on a better understanding of their succession sequences, vegetation recovery on abandoned croplands in the Roggeveld was studied using species and life form diversity parameters. Abandoned croplands of different ages were compared with each other and to the natural vegetation. Therophytes and chamaephytes were the most abundant life forms. Chamaephytes made an overwhelming contribution to the relative cover. Species-area curves (exponential function) differed significantly between the abandoned croplands and natural vegetation. Species richness increased with time since abandonment but no similar increase in species evenness, Shannon or Simpson indices were found. A regression of species richness against age of abandoned cropland predicted that an abandoned cropland of approximately 33 years should be as species rich as the natural vegetation, but a principal cooordinate analysis of floristic data indicated that all the plots were floristically still extremely different from the natural vegetation. Across all nine survey plots only 15 species contributed to a high cover on the plots. Vegetation recovery on abandoned croplands in the Roggeveld occurs naturally, yet the rate of recovery varies among the life forms.",

The objective was to test the effects of information, negotiation, and monitoring costs on the decision to sell to private buyers, speculators or at auction. The theoretical predictions of transaction cost economics were tested based on primary data collected from 230 cattle farm households in 13 communities of the Okhahlamba Local Municipality. The results of a multinomial logit regression revealed some unique insights. They showed that the probability of selling at auction vs selling at the farm gate increased during the end-of-year festive season, indicating the scope of market uncertainty surrounding auctions. They also showed that the probability of selling at auction vs selling to speculators increased with proximity to the auction marketplace and decreased with knowledge of the buyer, suggesting higher opportunity costs of time and efforts associated with selling at auction, and considerable negotiation and monitoring costs incurred when selling to speculators. Other significant predictors of auction channel selection were volume supplied and farmer's age. This study concludes with some implications for the livestock marketing policy in South Africa.",

Aboveground biomass (AGB) of A. mearnsii was determined using a published allometric equation in invaded grasslands of the northern Eastern Cape, South Africa. The relationships among the A. mearnsii leaf area index (LAI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and AGB were investigated. The influence of A. mearnsii LAI and terrain slope on grass cover was also investigated. Strong linear relationships between NDVI, LAI and AGB were developed. Acacia mearnsii canopy adversely impacted grass production more than terrain slope (p < 0.05) and when LAI approached 2.1, grass cover dropped to below 10% in infested areas. Reducing A. mearnsii canopy could promote grass production while encouraging carbon sequestration. Given the high AGB and clearing costs, it may be prudent to adopt the 'novel ecosystems' approach in managing infested landscapes.",

A substantial loss of grassland cover (64.5%), moderate decline of cultivated land (24%) and a considerable increase in bush and shrub land cover (114.3%) occurred between 1985 and 2015. Consequently, pastoralist's access to rangeland resources and farmlands was highly restricted, thus putting the pastoral production system under increasing threat. A 13.3% decline of bare land was also observed during the same period. The results further indicated that policy, climate change, and variability, biotic factors including population growth, overgrazing, Prosopis juliflora seed dispersal via livestock's fecal droppings and seed germination potential of P. juliflora under moisture stress were the most important drivers of land-use and land-cover changes. Therefore, policy and strategies should be developed to control P. juliflora and give pastoralists full rights to their grazing land. Furthermore, there should be a strategy to strengthen the customary institution for effective management of rangeland resources.",

Severe grazing treatments (e.g. continuous or summer-only) increase abundance of grazing-tolerant dwarf shrubs and annual grasses, and decrease perennial grasses. Grootfontein, which is ecotonal between the Nama-Karoo and Grassland Biomes, houses long-term grazing trials. The area has experienced higher-than-average rainfall in recent decades. Plant basal cover data from the 1960s and 2010s allow several hypotheses to be addressed: (1) historical severe grazing (until 1985) will limit subsequent grassiness (grazing legacy effect); (2) severe grazing will preclude increases in grassiness, independent of rainfall (herbivore trap effect); and (3) historically leniently-grazed sites will transition to grassland with increased rainfall (biome shift effect). Rainfall was lower from 1957–1966 (350 mm) than from 2003–2012 (490 mm). The grazing legacy effect was supported based on the abundance of Aristida diffusa, despite all sites becoming much grassier. The herbivore trap effect was not supported. The biome shift effect was supported in that shifts to grassland sometimes occurred. Results suggest that increasing rainfall has prompted a shift to much increased grassiness and decreased abundance of dwarf shrubs, and that grazing had a smaller secondary effect.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFew assessments of the effects of fire and grazing on the herbaceous components of savannas have been reported for Africa. In the Kruger National Park, South Africa, range condition was monitored at three savanna sites spanning a rainfall gradient of 450 to 700 mm and subject to grazing by wildlife. The sites were burnt at 1-, 2- and 3-year intervals, in different seasons and included a control treatment excluding fire for >40 years. Initial surveys of the herbaceous vegetation were conducted between 1954 and 1957 and repeated between 1998 and 2001. Grass species were categorised as either decreaser or increaser species, which decline or increase with over- or under-utilisation, respectively, and their potential to provide forage and fuel for fires indicative of range condition were derived. Range condition improved with regular burning in the moist sites, but deteriorated in the arid sites over all seasons and frequencies of burning. It is concluded that the current homogenous approach to burning across the Park needs to be adapted by reducing the frequency of fires at more arid sites and can be achieved by burning according to the proportions of decreaser and increaser species reflecting the ecological status of the herbaceous vegetation.Keywords: firefrequencyseason",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to examine the factors influencing smallholder producers' potential to sell cattle and identify marketing opportunities for sustainable beef production in South Africa. A total of 95 structured questionnaires was administered to the Ncorha and Gxwalibomvu communities in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Average cattle herd size per household was higher (P < 0.05) in Ncorha (13.7 ± 1.9) than in Gxwalibomvu (11.3 ± 1.9). The logit model showed that households with few members, young farmers, Christians, large cattle herds, low income levels and access to extension services had high potential to sell cattle compared with other households (P < 0.05). Beef branding (∼40% of respondents from each community), feedlotting (∼30%), group marketing (∼25%) and forward contracting (>5%) were mentioned as potential strategies for improving commercial marketing of cattle in the studied areas. Most producers (70%) indicated their potential and willingness to participate in developing a natural pasture-fed beef brand. Overall, commercial marketing of beef cattle raised on communally owned natural pastures in the surveyed areas in South Africa was largely determined by farmer's demographic characteristics, cattle herd size and access to extension services with branding and feedlotting as the major opportunities for improving sales.",

Forb richness, diversity and biomass were equally low at both land-use types and increased significantly after the drought release, although the magnitude of response was much stronger in the protected area, whereas drought contributed to a directional change in the protected area with a complete post-drought turnover in both annual and perennial forb species, much less variability was observed in the communal rangeland, which may suggest long-term effects imposed by land-use history.",

Multivariate methods were used to examine the long-term (almost 40 years). compositional stability under different burning regimes. The species composition deviated steadily and markedly from the initial state (Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) by 43.4 ± 9.32% with quinquennial burning (alternating autumn/spring) and by 64.6 ± 2.24% with attempted fire exclusion (three unplanned burns). Composition was rapidly transformed (by 53.1 ± 4.6%) by biennial summer burning (discontinued in 1991). Dominance shifted from Themeda triandra to other grasses (Stiburus alopecuroides, Tristachya leucothrix, Harpochloa falx) with biennial summer and infrequent burning. In contrast, regular dormant season burning annually or biennially (in autumn, winter, or spring) maintained a stable grassland close to the original composition (mean deviation 23.08%). Burning homogenised the composition, overriding the initial extant small-scale spatial variation. Results support the current practice to burn biennially in the dormant season to maintain stable grassland in the Drakensberg catchments.",

Drought-driven tree mortality has been observed in some savannas, but little is known about how tolerant savanna trees are to drought, or what determines differences among species in drought vulnerability. Here, we examine which characteristics best distinguished tree species that were most negatively affected by a recent drought in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Woody-encroaching, root-suckering species, which tended to have relatively low investments in non-structural carbohydrates, had the highest mortality rates. Of particular interest was Dichrostachys cinerea, a notable contributor to widespread woody encroachment across southern African savannas, which suffered high drought mortality. Using rainfall maps and vegetation survey data, we show that D. cinerea distributions in Kruger National Park are limited to areas with higher mean annual rainfall and lower past drought frequency, and stem densities are lower where droughts have occurred more frequently, suggesting that past droughts have had lasting impacts on the distribution and abundance of this species. Woody encroachers, such as D. cinerea, may face a trade off between traits promoting proliferation vs. drought tolerance, and more frequent and severe droughts could increasingly limit their spread.",

This is particularly true in the woodland savannas of northern Botswana, where wildfires originate outside of management activities, and are left to burn uncontrolled, because of limited resources and remoteness. There is concern that severe annual wildfires are resulting in the ‘savannisation’ of large tracts of wooded land across forest reserves, protected areas and surrounding wilderness areas. Because the current fire regime is unknown, management interventions are hard to introduce. We examine the recent 20-year (2001–2020) fire history in northern Botswana using MODIS satellitederived fire products to reveal fire frequency and seasonality. Six wildfire hotspots are identified for exploration of fire frequency and possible origins. Annual fire frequencies are far higher than would be expected without anthropogenic ignition. Extensive areas in some hotspots are shown to have burned between 14 and 16 out of the 20-year period. Fires peak in September, several weeks before the onset of the rainy season and associated lightning strikes, and when the fuel load is at its maximum and conditions at their driest. Adaptive fire management practices, such as those being followed in neighbouring South Africa and elsewhere should inform Botswana’s fire management policies.",

    "abstract": "There is a general perception that ruminants produce large quantities of greenhouse gases (GHG) which contribute to global warming. Ruminant production is also known as the world's largest user of land, and southern Africa is no exception. Recent estimates indicate that livestock are responsible for approximately 4% of the world's GHG emissions through methane production, compared with an initial estimate of 18% by the FAO. Estimates indicate that the total GHG emissions directly related to livestock production in southern Africa did not increase over a period of 20 years, whereas the intensity of livestock–production-related GHG emissions (per kg animal product) was reduced by 40%. This may be the result of increased livestock productivity and breed selection. For instance, increases in the productivity of four indigenous beef cattle breeds decreased the calculated carbon footprint by 7–12%. Recent studies indicated that the methane intensity between beef breeds in South Africa can differ by 44%, and that crossbreeding can have small to moderate effects on the carbon footprint of weaner calf production. Interventions such as the use of indigenous and adapted genotypes, alternative breeding objectives, alternative production systems as well as sustainable management will be key to environmentally friendly livestock production.",

The probability of change of sites from one category of woody cover to another indicate the system is tending toward a severely encroached state.

    "abstract": "Abstract Grazing strategies found in communal areas are a result of interactions between social, ecological and institutional factors. To understand the processes in operation, and help in improving management, the perceptions of communal people on institutional structures, utilisation patterns and possible intervention for improving their grazing lands were studied. A more comprehensive understanding of communal rangeland grazing strategies is important as the mere transplanting of large-scale commercial farming management strategies would be met with viability and acceptability constraints. In addition to participatory rural appraisals, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted among a sample of 553 households in Amathole, Chris Hani and Ukhahlamba districts of the Eastern Cape province, South Africa. Although the need for fences and paddocks was highlighted as the best intervention to improve range management in communal areas, lack of strong local-level institutions, little or no knowledge of veld management, absence of rules and lack of seasonal restrictions on rangeland resource use are additional constraints that would minimise the impact of fencing. It is concluded that communal range management remains complex and there is a need to consider socioeconomic and ecological factors, as well as institutional factors, in any planned grazing management intervention. Strengthening of local-level institutions and helping in ways to effectively utilise stockposts and abandoned fields will improve the management of communal rangelands.

Peak growth rates occurred during spring for the Italian ryegrass–kikuyu, summer for the Westerwolds ryegrass–kikuyu, and late spring and early summer for perennial ryegrass–kikuyu pasture. All three pasture systems had similar total annual dry matter yields (kilograms dry matter [DM] per hectare) during year 1, but the perennial ryegrass–kikuyu pasture achieved a higher annual DM yield during year 2. As kikuyu density increased in kikuyu–ryegrass pastures from winter to summer, the DM and neutral detergent fibre content increased, whereas the metabolisable energy content decreased.

Recognising the scientific principles developed in this discipline the past 50 years and more in Southern Africa, customary to our diverse and unique environmental conditions will continue to guide and identify future research priorities. A journey from the past to the present can assist in avoiding reinvention and repetition of pasture research. This review highlights how research priorities have either remained the same over time or where research has received less or more priority. The review further illustrates that there has been more interest in species adaptation to drought, pasture and forage water relations, alternative pasture and forage species, and the combination of pasture species in the 21st century than in the 20th century. In conclusion, the soil–plant– livestock complex can serve as a conceptual basis for more effective research together with pasture breeding and nutrition. Finally, researching pasture and forage sciences in an inter- and multi-disciplinary manner clearly supports the principles of holism applied by General JC Smuts, one of the first pioneers of pasture and forage sciences.",

Despite the Karoo's specific environment and spatial importance nationally (covering some 30% of South Africa), no government structures address its needs holistically. Today it is a politically and economically marginalised region; perceptions of it as a desert easily morph into perceptions of it as deserted and ripe for exploitation for the benefit of external constituencies, whether in the name of astronomy, shale-gas and uranium mining or renewable energy. To manage the Karoo better for present and future generations, it is clearly desirable for social and natural scientists to work collaboratively, yet there is relatively little interdisciplinary work to date.

The growth response of two decreasers, three Increaser II grasses, and an Increaser III species to frequent, severe defoliation under three levels of competition from neighbours and two levels of soil nutrients was examined in a pot trial. The effects of competition and especially nutrients markedly modified the defoliation tolerance of different species, and grazing response groups varied in the manner in which their defoliation responses were mediated by these interactions. Contrary to expectation, defoliation constrained potential productivity most in nutrient-rich, competition-free environments, probably because it exacerbates a carbon limitation on growth. However, nutrient enrichment did enable Increaser II grasses, but not other species, to better tolerate intense defoliation, explaining why they can persist on intensively grazed fertile patches and in heavily stocked grassland, such as in communal areas, where nutrients are more available. It is concluded that grazing tolerance is not a fixed property of species or grazing response groups but depends on biotic and abiotic environmental factors.",

Forty pairs of permanently marked plots were surveyed in 1996, 2006 and 2016. The main objective was to investigate changes in the vegetation structure and species composition between the near-continuously grazed communal rangelands and the relatively lightly grazed commercial rangelands over the 20-year period. The results showed a decline in total vegetation cover in both commercial and communal rangelands in 2016 relative to the two earlier sampling periods. This can be attributed to the low rainfall in 2016 and was due largely to a reduction in annual plant cover, especially on the communal rangeland. Perennial shrub species provide a fodder bank that can be utilised by livestock in times of drought and can buffer short-term deficits in forage supply. However, the annuals that dominate the vegetation of the communal rangeland do not form such fodder banks and consequently do not have the same multi-year buffering capacity as perennial shrubs. This provides the mechanism whereby long-term continuous grazing decreases resilience to rainfall fluctuations and increases livestock variability, thereby promoting non-equilibrium-type dynamics in the system.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate morphophysiological indices, phenology and cutting time of forage cactus (Opuntia and Nopalea spp.) clones intercropped with sorghum cultivars (Sorghum bicolor). The experiment was carried out from 2017 to 2018, in two cropping systems (monocropping and intercropping), comprising 12 treatments, consisted of three cactus clones: 'IPA Sertânia'—IPA, 'Miúda'—Miu and 'Orelha de Elefante Mexicana'— OEM, in a monocropping system and nine combinations the cacti and sorghum (cultivars 467, SF11 and 2502) to comprise each of the intercropping systems. Cladodes morphophysiological indices were obtained: absolute growth rate, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate (NAR), specific cladode area rate (SCAR) and the cladode area index rate. OEM showed higher absolute growth rates at the beginning of the cycle, compared with IPA and Miu. NAR was higher in the monocropped OEM and in the OEM-2502 intercrop than under all the IPA and Miu systems (monocropping and intercropping), but the SCAR rate was higher for IPA (monocrop and intercropped). Miu showed a shorter duration of phenophase 2, but OEM had a higher rate of cladode emission during this phase. Cactus-sorghum intercropping systems cause a significant reduction in growth rates of the forage cactus. Intercropping has an earlier cutting time than the monocropping.",

    "abstract": "An improved understanding of how fire affects African mammals is important for the management of both fire regimes and mammal populations. The response of mammals (>5 kg) to fire was reviewed to identify habitat preferences, and to inform fire management. Sixty-four studies reported on 51 species at 34 locations. Body size was strongly correlated with fire response, with smaller grazing species more likely to respond positively to fire (i.e. to occupy recently-burnt areas) than larger browsing species. Frequently-studied species (≥4 studies) were classified as either ambivalent in their responses to fire (four large browsers) or as responding positively to fire (fourteen grazers). An additional 30 less frequently studied species (<4 studies), including carnivores, were preliminarily assigned to fire response categories. Almost all studies were conducted in savanna and grassland vegetation, with the fire-prone dystrophic miombo, and more arid sites under-represented. Much of the research was aimed at establishing the preferences of a rare or declining species of concern, and fire management recommendations often called for increasing fire frequency to benefit such species. However, it is clear that co-occurring species have different requirements. We conclude therefore that managers should aim to promote spatial heterogeneity through fire application.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vegetation change on different substrate types was measured over 15 years in semi‐arid Mopani Veld. Baseline data were collected in the terminal year (1982) of a decade of above‐average rainfall, whilst the period of monitoring was characterised by below‐average rainfall, with severe drought years occurring in 1988/1989 and 1991/1992. Grazing pressure was, on average, alleviated over the period of recording so that changes reflect primarily the effect of rainfall. Long‐lived perennial grasses had declined markedly, annual and micro‐perennial grasses had increased markedly, and the proportion of forbs had increased. Despite 7–17 years since the replacement of livestock grazing with wildlife at lower stocking rates, there was no evidence of an improvement in sward or soil condition, owing ostensibly to the effect of drought. The extent of change in botanical composition and in sward condition was influenced by substrate type. The rate of growth of the woody component had been slow: the average per annum increase in the radius of trees was 0.67 mm. For the dominant species, Colophospermum mopane, only individuals of less than 1 m in height consistently showed an increase in size. The basal area of dead standing trees had increased threefold. Complete mortality or substantial topkill of shrub species, in particular of Grewia spp., Ximenia americana, and Combretum apiculatum, and of adults of the latter, had occurred owing to drought. Shrub mortality was most pronounced on colluvial soils and sandveld. All species exhibited partial dieback of the crown. Overall, shrub recruitment has been limited except for that of H. mopane on colluvial soils but not on other substrate types, which is therefore likely to increase further its dominance on this substrate at the expense of species richness. Grazing pressure on desirable perennial grasses and browsing pressure on palatable woody plants has probably increased because of their decline, even if animal abundance has not increased, which will have a negative effect on their re‐establishment. Acting in opposition, dieback of trees and shrubs has probably created a window of opportunity for the recovery of perennial grasses, but it would likely require an extended run of above‐average years to reverse the changes in herbaceous vegetation, for which the availability of seed of perennial grasses is likely to be a major constraint.

Three subhabitats were distinguished, viz. under leguminous trees, under non‐leguminous trees, and between tree canopies. Soil under both leguminous and non‐leguminous trees was richer in nutrients (% total N, % organic C, Ca, K, Mg) than between tree canopies. Certain nutrients (K, Mg) also differed between the two canopied subhabitats. The leguminous tree subhabitat had a marginally higher grass biomass than the non‐leguminous tree and the uncanopied subhabitats at high tree densities. This increase was associated with the occurrence of Panicwn maximum. Digitaria eriantha showed no subhabitat preference, whilst Eragrostis lehmanniana and Schmidtia pappophoroides were mostly confined to the subhabitat between tree canopies. Increased tree competition negatively influenced the yield of grasses between tree canopies, but grass yields associated with the canopied subhabitats were only affected at the highest tree densities. Potential tree competitiveness was the most important determinant of grass yield. The importance of N as the main determinant of the Panicum‐tree association was not confirmed by this study.

    "abstract": "Abstract The short-term impact of fire burning with the wind (head fire) and against the wind (back fire) on soil characteristics (soil-water content, soil compaction, soil temperature, organic matter, pH, exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, Na and extractable P) were determined in a semi-arid grassland. This study was conducted over two growing seasons (2000/01 and 2001/02) after only one burning treatment in August 2000. The back fire moved approximately 7.5 times slower than the head fire, leading to the greatest change in hydrological characteristics. The decline in plant cover due to the fire resulted in a considerable increase in soil compaction, soil temperature and a decrease in organic material in turn leading to a lowered soil-water content. Much of the influence of these variables had not been completely reduced two growing seasons after the fire. Burning reduced the soil-water content (0mm to 300mm soil depth) after one month and one year by 13.4% and 31% respectively. Temporary wilting for all grass species occurred more rapidly with burning. During March of the first year, the greatest soil temperature difference (50mm depth) occurred between burnt and unburnt grassland, with the highest soil temperatures recorded in January. The highest temperature on the surface of the soil for each year after burning also occurred during January. Over the first growing season burning significantly reduced organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) content and extractable phosphate, but increased the pH and concentration of exchangeable Ca, Mg, Na and K in the soil, over the first 0–50mm layer. There were no differences in the soil properties of head and back fires, except for organic material that was further lowered by the back fire. With depth, organic matter and K decreased significantly and Ca increased between surface (0mm to 50mm) and lower (50mm to 100mm) layers due to burning. Thus, an unplanned event can increase the intensity and frequency of seasonal droughts in the ecologically sensitive semi-arid grassland areas leading to increase risk management in the short-term.

Goat browsing days were used as a measure of shrub productivity and cattle grazing days as a measure of the sward. Twigs on two shrub species were monitored to quantify utilization and recovery of the woody layer and a pasture disc meter was used to monitor grazing of the grass layer. Dense bushveld (high ecological status) had higher overall carrying capacity than open bushveld (low ecological status). Carrying capacity changed considerably depending on annual rainfall and this was complicated because the more degraded the veld the greater the variation. Maximum long‐term grass production occurred at intermediate tree densities. This was, however, extremely unreliable between years and a permanent grazer enterprise cannot be recommended. For total forage production and constant fodder supply, dense bushveld is optimum. Optimum, however, changes from season to season and with operator objectives. In wet seasons it will pay to have veld in the lower range of ecological status (i.e. open bushveld) whereas in other seasons veld with high ecological status (dense bushveld) will be more productive. Farmers with only cattle may aim to have veld in the mid‐range of ecological status but this conflicts with farmers who have browsers (e.g. goats and kudu) and with the conservation ideal, because bushveld, once thinned, does not regenerate, thereby limiting future management alternatives.",

These treatments were intended to simulate wood harvesting by local communities, pollarding by elephants, and browsing by herbivores, respectively. The foliar concentrations of total phenol, condensed tannin and protein-precipitating tannin were tracked for three consecutive years after treatments were effected. Coppicing, pollarding and pruning induced chemical defences in Mopane tree foliage. The order of magnitude of the response was positively related with impact severity: coppicing > pollarding > pruning > control. Differences between treatments remained the same for the duration of the study. The effects of canopy treatments on phenol and tannin concentrations were small compared to the seasonal and inter-seasonal fluctuations. The protein precipitation capacity of the secondary metabolites increased significantly with increasing impact. We concluded that secondary metabolite concentrations in Mopane foliage are dynamic and can be explained satisfactorily by season, year and treatment severity, with a high explanatory power (r2 = 0.94–0.98).

    "abstract": "Abstract The effects of burning on soil properties and landscape function were investigated in a long-term experiment comparing different burning strategies in a moist montane grassland. Total C, total N, total S, bulk density, plant-available nutrients, and soil acidity were determined in the top 200mm of soil, together with vegetation basal cover at the soil surface. The no-burn treatment had the lowest basal cover (14.8%). Basal cover for the burnt treatments ranged from 19.0% (five-year spring burn) to 25.4% (alternate autumn/spring, burnt every 18 months). The organic matter content of these soils was very high with total carbon ranging from 114g kg−1 in the 0–50mm layer to 77g kg−1 in the 150–200mm layer. Bulk density was very low, being 0.57g ml−1 in the 0–50mm layer. There were no significant effects of burning on the quantity of soil organic matter. The C:N ratio was significantly affected throughout the top 200mm by burning treatments; in the 0–50mm layer it ranged from 14.43 in the no-burn treatment to 16.14 in the treatment burnt every 18 months. Higher C:N ratios in frequently burnt treatments suggests that grassland productivity is N-limited in these treatments. In the top 50mm, soil pH is lower in treatments burnt infrequently (5 year and no burn) than in those burnt frequently, whereas concentrations of basic exchangeable cations (K, Ca and Mg) were lower in treatments burnt infrequently (five-year and no burn) than in those burnt frequently. The higher pH and concentrations of basic cations in frequently burnt treatments was probably due to greater cycling of nutrients to the soil surface as a result of higher productivity and deposition of nutrients in ash, together with reduced leaching of cations with nitrate. Landscape Function Analysis was used to measure the functioning of the landscape in terms of scarce resources and the processes that maintain these resources. All sites were highly functional, irrespective of the burning treatment applied. The infrequently burned sites had significantly higher nutrient cycling and infiltration indices than frequently burnt sites and these indices were correlated well with soil chemical properties (acidity, acid saturation, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, P and pH). No significant differences were found between treatments for the stability index. Keywords: BASAL COVERFIRELANDSCAPE FUNCTION ANALYSISSOILSMONTANE GRASSLANDS",

The aim of the study was to determine the dry matter yield, botanical composition and nutritional value of irrigated kikuyu over-sown with annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum var. westerwoldicum), white clover (Trifolium repens) and red clover (T. pratense) or a mixture of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) with white and red clovers under intensive grazing conditions with dairy cows. The incorporation of annual ryegrass, perennial clover or perennial ryegrass–clover into kikuyu pasture changed the seasonal fodder flow and increased the spring dry matter (DM) production. The over-sowing of kikuyu with annual ryegrass had no effect on the DM production of kikuyu during the summer and autumn. Kikuyu and kikuyu–ryegrass, fertilised with nitrogen fertiliser, had a higher DM production rate than kikuyu–clover pastures. Kikuyu–ryegrass pasture transformed from ryegrass-dominant in spring to kikuyu-dominant in summer and only kikuyu in autumn. This led to a decrease in metabolisable energy (ME) and increase in neutral detergent fibre (NDF) content of the pasture during spring, summer and autumn as kikuyu became more dominant. The clover content of kikuyu over-sown with clover decreased annually but was still higher than 30% at the end of two years after establishment. As the kikuyu content of the kikuyu–clover pastures increased, the seasonal growth rate changed from a low autumn growth (37.9 kg DM ha−1 d−1) in the first year to a higher autumn growth (48.5 kg DM ha−1 d−1) in the second year. The over-sowing of kikuyu with clover resulted in lower DM production and NDF values and higher crude protein (CP), ME and calcium (Ca) values. The lowest CP content in kikuyu–ryegrass pasture was during summer and autumn when kikuyu was dominant. The Ca content of the grass pastures (kikuyu and kikuyu–ryegrass) was low. The phosphorus (P) content of both the kikuyu–clover and grass pastures exceeded the requirement needed for dairy production (0.38%). The mean Ca:P ratio of the kikuyu–clover pasture meets the 1.6:1 ratio needed by dairy cows. The kikuyu and kikuyu–ryegrass pasture had a Ca:P ratio lower than 1:1 and Ca supplementation would be needed for dairy cows. The incorporation of annual ryegrass, perennial clover or perennial ryegrass–clover into kikuyu pasture improved the seasonal DM production and nutritional value of the pasture.

    "abstract": "Abstract The Bontebok National Park has long been faced with the dilemma of reconciling the need for short-interval fires, which promote grazing for bontebok, with that for longer-interval fires to maintain plant diversity. We explored habitat selection by various large herbivores in relation to veld age (time since fire), different management regimes, and vegetation type. Taller grass grazers (Cape mountain zebra and red hartebeest) were introduced in the 1980s to prolong the usefulness of older veld to bontebok through a grazing succession. We found that all herbivores favoured young veld and largely avoided veld >5 years old. Zebra and hartebeest competed with bontebok in utilising young veld rather than grazing facilitation occurring. In 2004, the fire rotation was prolonged to favour plant diversity, resulting in reduced availability of young veld. In compensation, the bontebok stocking rate was reduced. Bontebok densities subsequently declined proportionally across veld ages, thereby averting high animal densities on the smaller area of young veld. Fire significantly influenced bontebok habitat use equally during the old and new burning regimes. Herbivores did not distinguish between the two predominant vegetation types at Bontebok National Park. However, previously disturbed areas with Cynodon dactylon lawns were favoured by most herbivores despite not being burnt.

    "abstract": "The present study assessed the effects of deferred grazing management on rangeland condition using aboveground biomass, vegetation cover and species composition as indicators of range condition. The experiment was based on traditionally conserved exclosures (ngitili). Data were collected in Shinyanga rural and Meatu districts, Tanzania, from October to November 2011. Five grazing strategies were compared: old private ngitili, young private ngitili, old communal ngitili, young communal ngitili and continuously grazed land. Aboveground biomass was significantly higher in old private ngitili than continuously grazed land, but there was no significant difference in amount of biomass between communal ngitili and continuously grazed land. The mean percentage basal cover was significantly higher in ngitili than continuously grazed land. The duration of protection (old ngitili compared with young ngitili) was not found to have any significant influence on both aboveground herbaceous biomass production and basal cover. The Shannon–Wiener index and Simpson index of diversity revealed no significant differences in species diversity among the different strategies. Both the continuously grazed land and communal ngitili were generally in poor condition and a special rehabilitation programme for improvement of these fragile grazing lands should be investigated.",

We asked specifically whether the reassignment of the commonage for the use of historically disadvantaged town residents after 1994 has impacted negatively on the vegetation of the commonage. Analysis of land cover change using aerial photography time series revealed that the most significant human impacts on the Bathurst commonage occurred prior to 1942 due to heavy and uncontrolled communal land use. Vegetation change since then has been characterised by a recovery of thicket vegetation and an encroachment of woody species into grassland. Additional field sampling of the species composition and age class distributions of trees and shrubs in thicket and broken thicket vegetation showed these units to be of high veld condition status. Thornveld and old lands have both been encroached upon by woody species, particularly by Acacia karroo, and possessed the lowest veld condition scores. There is little evidence, however, that recent land-use activities have impacted negatively on commonage vegetation. We discuss these results in terms of the vegetation's potential to provide for the diverse needs of commonage users, and the implications for commonage management and policy.",

African floodplains in arid areas are critical wildlife habitats in addition to crop production and dry season livestock grazing. The study aimed to understand the patterns of spread of the invader Prosopis juliflora in a typical African floodplain characterised by both multiple dispersers and habitats. Data was collected on faecal seed density, establishment and vegetation composition, and subjected to non-parametric tests and regression analysis. The results showed that both livestock and wildlife species played a critical role in dispersal of Prosopis juliflora, especially yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus), bush pigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), donkeys and goats. Habitat preference of wildlife dispersers and livestock herding patterns influenced the spatial pattern of invader seed influx. Establishment of Prosopis juliflora was enhanced by ecological disturbance such as in rested crop fields and habitats outside conservation areas as compared to those inside. Establishment was also higher inside the floodplain than outside probably due to higher seasonal soil resources. Lastly, indigenous woody species diversity declined significantly as the density of Prosopis juliflora increased. We conclude that patterns of spread of Prosopis juliflora were related to ecological disturbances, type of disperser and flooplain effect. Keywords:: dispersershabitatshifting cultivationwildlife",

    "abstract": "Fire is rare in semi-arid eastern Karoo dwarf shrublands, South Africa, and responses to fire are largely unknown. Recent increased grassiness, and hence fuel loads, at Grootfontein in the Eastern Cape allowed an accidental fire (24.3 ha) to carry, and afforded the opportunity to examine compositional and structural effects of fire on a grassy dwarf shrubland. Sampling seven months after the fire, 108 species (102 perennial) were encountered, of which 74 were resprouters, six were fire sensitive (non-sprouters), and the remainder (rare, non-perennial or herbaceous) had an unknown response. The dominant pre-fire shrub, Eriocephalus ericoides, was extirpated by the fire, as was the unpalatable and sometimes invasive Ruschia intricata. All grass species resprouted, and grass became the dominant life-form after the fire, indicating a possible conferred competitive advantage. Resprouting shrubs grew to only a small fraction of their pre-burn size. The unpalatable, aromatic shrub Stachys rugosa was the dominant post-burn shrub. Extirpated species will need to regenerate from seeds, but no seedlings were found in the gaps where shrubs had stood. The widespread ability to resprout confers resilience on this vegetation, but fire does induce changes in structure, in the dominance of life forms, and it decreases canopy cover.",

The use of tebuthiuron on a farm in the Cymbopogon–Themeda veld type in the Zastron district of the Free State has led to the formation of bare patches in the grass layer. This study investigated patterns of emergence and survival of monocotyledonous oats (Avena sativa) and dicotyledonous cabbage (Brassica oleracea) in soils collected from bare patches resulting from the application of tebuthiuron between two and eight years earlier. Untreated soils provided a control. Both oats and cabbage emergence was high and not related to herbicide application. After about two weeks, plants growing in tebuthiuron-treated soil began to die, and after 60 d only four of the 299 emerged seedlings were alive, but showed signs of mortal phytotoxicity. Mortality in the control was low. It was concluded that tebuthiuron residues in the bare patches may preclude recolonisation by seed for at least eight years following application.

Using a fence-line contrast approach, this study compared the long-term effects of HDG with those of other rotational grazing systems at lower densities (LDG) on soil properties and vegetation composition at two sites. Soils at Kokstad and Cedarville were 31% and 19% more compacted under HDG than LDG, respectively, but did not differ in total nitrogen, total carbon, available phosphorus or pH. At Kokstad, HDG had promoted unpalatable grass species at the expense of palatable grass species. Forb species composition differed substantially between HDG and LDG, with HDG having 13 and LDG having 16 unique species. A radical prostrate forb growth habit was favoured over a cauline erect habit under HDG. At Cedarville, few grass or forb species showed differences between HDG and LDG, possibly because of an overriding influence of the absence of burning in both grazing systems. These results suggest that HDG potentially has negative impacts on soil health and vegetation composition of South African mesic grassland.",

The experimental design was a 3 × 3 Latin square replicated three times, with nine milking Holstein cows (mean live weight 496.2 ± 33.6 kg and daily milk yield 14.8 ± 2.8 kg cow−1) under on-farm participatory rural research.

Such conflict is pervasive in the Karoo region of South Africa but its contemporary history and various causes remain poorly understood. In this study, we interviewed 77 small-livestock farmers in the Central Karoo between July 2014 and March 2015 to (1) assess the spatio-temporal distribution and severity of the reported predation problems with the main regional predators of livestock (black-backed jackal, caracal and baboon) and (2) describe the perceived reasons for changes in predator numbers. Farmers reported that serious predation problems have increased since the 1990s for all three predators. Jackal predation appears to have re-emerged, particularly since the 2000s, while baboon predation seems to have escalated rapidly since 2014 for select farmers. Farms with more rugged terrain were more likely to experience serious problems with baboons and caracal but ruggedness did not predict the year of onset of problems. Farmers perceive predator numbers to be increasing and attribute this trend to declining government support for predator management, changes in farming practices and the associated increase in suitable predator habitat, from which they can recolonise commercial farms.",

Rangelands in the southern Cape region of South Africa have had a low animal production potential and were therefore improved through time as cultivated pastures. Initially, annual pastures were established by conventional tillage methods, but from the 1990s permanent pastures were established on a minimum-tillage regime. Lime and fertiliser guidelines, which were developed for annual pastures established by conventional tillage methods, were followed on minimumtillage systems, despite changes in the soil physical properties and stratification of biological parameters. The study aim was to survey the soil fertility of irrigated minimum-till kikuyu–ryegrass pastures in the southern Cape region. This study highlights changes in soil fertility and identified potential detrimental effects of elevated levels of extractable phosphorus and zinc, which were drastically increased in the topsoil layer. The necessity for remedial and preventative strategies to mitigate nutrient loading in cultivated pasture soil are stressed. Fertiliser guidelines should be applied strictly and should fit the farming system. In doing so, the dual goals of economic and ecological sustainability should be achieved.",

Fencing as a way of managing livestock began in the late 1800s, and by the early twentieth century was almost fully implemented throughout the Karoo sensu lato. The advent of these fences, and now in many instances, 'game proof' (∼2 m high) and electric fences have impacted native flora and fauna in various ways. Roads influence the quality and quantity of vegetation along corridors throughout the Karoo, with impacts on wildlife through increased mortality, but also provide foraging opportunities. Road-side structures, such as transmission poles, offer nest sites and perches in otherwise treeless landscapes, benefiting certain avifauna. Railway lines create similar corridors, carrying ungrazed vegetation along them. Their associated structures – culverts and (historically) steel frame bridges – provide nest sites for birds and some mammals. Transmission cables and pylons along power lines have mixed benefits to conservation, providing bird nest and perch sites, but can also cause bird mortalities. Unquestionably, these linear structures have had marked effects on the biota of the Karoo, through their effects on wildlife and livestock movement and mortality, plant demography and the spread of native and alien species.",

We examined the germination of seven dominant species from Central Zagros rangelands in the semi-arid region of Iran under various heat shock (60, 80 and 120 °C), aerosol smoke, ash and control treatments. Our findings showed that fire products could enhance, inhibit or not affect the seed germination of rangeland species in this area. The germination percentage of Astragalus adscendens increased following 60 °C heat treatment in comparison with the control. The germination of Astragalus verus, Bromus tectorum, B. tomentellus and Phlomis olivieri were increased significantly using smoke treatment (P<0.0001). The seed germination of B. tomentellus and B. tectorum was promoted by ash treatment, whereas the other species exhibited no response or were inhibited by fire products. In addition, smoke treatment shortened the overall germination time of B. tectorum. These findings suggest that fire products affect the germination of several species and can serve as potential tools for understanding the vegetation dynamics and restoration of disturbed semi-arid rangelands.",

The aim of this study was to quantify the morphogenetic and structural characteristics and forage production of brachiaria grass and forage peanut mixtures under four defoliation strategies. A two-year experiment was carried out in Brazil (Cwa climate), where the following treatments were studied: rest period interruption by cattle grazing when the canopy attained light interception (LI) of 90%, 95% and 100%, and grazing performed every 42 d. Morphogenetic and structural characteristics of both species were measured. The forage and leaf accumulation rates were also quantified. The design was randomised blocks, with three replications, and repeated measurements over time. The 100% LI had greater stem and stolon elongation rates and a lower leaf appearance rate in both species and fewer tillers or stolons when compared with the other strategies. Conversely, rest periods of 90–95% LI promoted an increase of about 30% on forage and leaf accumulation rates of both grass and legume. Therefore, to enhance productivity and stability when these species are associated we recommend defoliating at 90–95% LI, which represents a canopy height ranging from 26 to 32 cm.",

    "abstract": "The Succulent Karoo is characterised by a dense coverage of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) belonging to different types and successional stages. Whereas the Soebatsfontein region hosts cyanobacteria-dominated and minor amounts of lichen- and bryophyte-dominated biocrusts, the Knersvlakte comprises a rich cover of hypolithic crusts growing on the sides and undersides of quartz pebbles. Apart from dominating photosynthesizers used to classify biocrusts, each crust type hosts a rich and specific fungal and bacterial community and also diverse protists. In a remote-sensing mapping approach, soil-inhabiting biocrusts of the Soebatsfontein region covered ∼27% of the surface area, whereas in the Knersvlakte soil-inhabiting biocrusts covered ∼16% and hypolithic biocrusts ∼42% of the region. Combining these data with biomass contents, results suggested that the Knersvlakte, despite somewhat harsher environmental conditions, harboured about 65% more biocrust biomass per surface area. In physiological measurements we observed that biocrusts emit the reactive nitrogen compounds nitric oxide and nitrous acid, showing water pulse-dependent emission patterns. In addition, CO2 gas fixation showed characteristic type-specific patterns depending on climatic conditions. Long-term microclimate measurements along a gradient revealed that forecasted climate and land-use change may be detrimental for biocrusts with potentially adverse effects on soil stability and overall fertility of the Succulent Karoo.",

    "abstract": "Drought is thought to be a factor limiting the abundance of shrubs and trees in savannas, but this has rarely been tested empirically. The severe drought of 2014–2016 provided an opportunity to document the impact of drought on the mortality of woody plants in semi-arid savannas of South Africa. Annual data from long-term tree monitoring plots were combined with opportunistic sampling in areas of high mortality to determine the extent and severity of mortality across an area of approximately 10 000 km2. Although mortality was not extensive, certain landscapes suffered mortality similar to the highest values reported for semi-arid ecosystems. Rainfall deficit was identified as a key determinant of spatial variation in mortality at the regional scale, which varied from 3% to 49% over two years. Spatial variation at the landscape scale was also high, and affected primarily by species composition and height of the woody plants, with higher mortality for taller individuals. An effect of topographic position and unknown edaphic factors was also evident. Species that suffered high mortality included a common bush encroachment species, but also many non-encroachers. Additional study is needed to confirm that the observed mortality will cause a long-term reduction in woody plant density.",

We tested these assumptions at the farm, patch and plant scale using data from a grazing management trial in an Eastern Cape mesic grassland of South Africa along with field plot and glasshouse pot experiments. The grazing trial tested season-long grazing (SLG), four-camp grazing (FCG) and holistic planned grazing (HPG) at equivalent stocking rates over three years. We found that grass growth responses in both potted plants and field plots were reduced under more frequent and severe defoliation but that this was mitigated under elevated soil nutrients, in line with the Compensatory Continuum Hypothesis which predicts that compensatory growth will increase across an increasing fertility gradient. In the farm trial, SLG, which theoretically causes high frequency, low severity defoliation, reduced bare ground cover and increased vegetation greenness with increasing defoliation intensity on nutrient-rich soils. This effect was not present under FCG or HPG and disappeared under very high defoliation intensities and on relatively water- and nutrient-poor soils. Managers are advised to only increase grazing frequency on relatively high nutrient soils, while maximizing recovery on poorer nutrient soils.",

Accordingly, a grazing gradient extending outward from kraals, and fence-line contrasts between communal rangeland and protected areas (Golden Gate Highlands National Park and Royal Natal National Park), were studied in the QwaQwa region of South Africa. Presence of a grazing gradient was confirmed by a decrease in the amount of cattle dung with increasing distance from kraals that was independent of altitude, solar radiation, slope, or soil physico-chemical properties. Canonical correspondence analysis confirmed that grazing intensity had a significant influence on botanical composition although most compositional variation was unexplained. Higher grazing intensities tended to negatively affect plant species richness and diversity, and the cover of perennial graminoids, but benefitted the abundance of dwarf shrubs and alien invasive species. Similar effects were apparent across each of the fence line contrasts. Despite a long history of livestock grazing, communal rangeland supported >320 indigenous species, illustrating some contribution to biodiversity conservation, but being compromised near kraals. An improved approach for study of the impacts of livestock grazing on plant diversity is suggested that would overcome the difficulties of assessing rare and threatened species using a community approach.",

We investigated changes in land cover and condition from 1991 (before construction) to 2013, using Landsat imagery. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) decreased in the catchment areas, while increasing within two protected areas. NDVI decreases were greatest close to the dams and in the high altitude summer grazing areas. Land cover maps were generated for 1993, 2005 and 2013, using structural vegetation classes, as well as categories of grassland based on NDVI. High altitude areas were characterised by grasslands changing to lower NDVI categories, indicating overgrazing in climax sourveld grasslands. Mid-altitude areas were characterised by grasslands changing to higher NDVI categories and increases in woody vegetation, indicating overgrazing in Sweetveld. At lower altitudes, the increase in cultivated areas suggested disproportionately high population growth in the catchment areas. The results suggest that there has been widespread degradation that appears to be more as a result of overgrazing than climate change. The study demonstrates the importance of using a combination of land cover, NDVI and field data in assessing degradation. Natural capital accounting methods provide a useful framework for documenting, monitoring and understanding changes in ecosystem condition.",

Results showed that more entries, births and sales, but fewer deaths, were recorded in V. karroo encroached rangeland than open grassland for larger herds (p < 0.05). The GPP and GPE were higher in V. karroo encroached rangeland than open grassland for larger than smaller herds (p < 0.05). Goat population dynamics, BW for castrates, sales and GPE were significantly higher among seasons (p < 0.05). It was concluded that larger herds of goats browsing V. karroo performed better in comparison to those that grazed open grasslands, which demonstrates that bush encroachment can benefit goat farming.",

A suitable solution has not been found in land management policies because local people's contexts and their indigenous knowledge are ignored. Hence, this paper is aimed at (i) assessing the role indigenous knowledge can play in communal rangeland management, (ii) exploring working solutions to incorporate indigenous knowledge into effective communal rangeland management and land use policies, (iii) assessing mechanisms for generational transfer of indigenous knowledge. Findings from the Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) and Focus Group Discussion, conducted with Cata and Guquka villages in the Eastern Cape province were synthesised. This revealed that communal farmers have in-depth knowledge of their communal land, past and present rangeland management strategies and changes in rangeland condition. However, there is breakdown in the indigenous knowledge system whereby this knowledge is not being transferred and translated into good rangeland management practice, owing to the ageing population of communal farmers, limited youth involvement in livestock farming and limited access to extension services. This suggests a need for new policy approaches that would include participation of local people in policy planning and development.",

In South Africa, the calculation of ‘carrying capacity’ is based on conversion of animal species to metabolic mass equivalents. This assumes homogenous systems that tend to some point of equilibrium. It is applied widely in commercial livestock systems involving one or two species. Examination of a case study in the Lowveld of the Northern Province, South Africa, showed that the determination of ‘stocking rate’ in this multi‐herbivore and heterogenous system, overestimated the ‘carrying capacity’ of the reserve over 20 years. The actual animal numbers in the system dropped by approximately 4 000 kg km−2 after a drought in the early period of the study into the bounds as determined by a model incorporating rainfall and animal biomass. An approach to determine stocking density using animal type, biomass, rainfall and vegetation parameters is suggested. The development of this as a coarse‐scale (regional) and ranch‐specific model to cover a range of scales and heterogeneity in key resources is advocated.",

After casting the design and purpose of monitoring systems in theoretical terms, the authors draw on applications from southern Africa to confront these conceptual approaches with real world practice. Using two cases, one from a community based agro-pastoral system and the other from a conservation area, the authors examine how the theory and practice inform monitoring systems design. Does theory really guide us in developing useful monitoring systems when faced with the real world of complex trade-offs among different users, different ecosystem services and a hierarchy of different scales?

Deep percolation, beyond the root zone (i.e. more than 0.8 m), did not occur in any of the species nor in the veld treatment throughout the study. Chloris gayana produced more above‐ground phytomass (P≤0.01) than all the other species in both wet and drier conditions. The average WUE (7.2 kg dry matter (DM) ha‐1 mm‐1 and 0.39 kg crude protein (CP) ha‐1 mm‐1) of this species was the highest (P≤0.01) throughout the experimental period.

The exceptionally low (P≤0.01) crude protein content of natural grassland and Eragrostis during the second half of the season indicated that these are not well suited for use as foggage (grown out forage), while the high values for Anthephora and Digitaria suggests these to be suitable foggage species.",

The resultant browsing pressure has led to the evolution of both physical and chemical responses in Acacia trees. In an observational study, we investigated the physical and chemical defenses in Acacia sieberiana var. woodii in response to different intensities of giraffe herbivory. Trees with high browsing intensity had significantly longer spines, smaller leaves and higher total cyanide (prussic acid) concentrations than trees with low browsing intensity. No significant differences were present in the density of spines and leaves between high and low browsing intensity sites. Similarly, no significant differences were found in the concentrations of condensed tannins and total leaf nitrogen. However, comparisons with other Acacia species revealed that the sampled A. sieberiana trees had substantially higher condensed tannin concentrations than many other species. It therefore appears that condensed tannins may form a high constitutive, or fixed, defence in A. sieberiana in this population, while prussic acid and spine length (with a decrease in leaf size) form important inducible defences.

In such cases restoration interventions become necessary to assist with the re-establishment of vegetation. The efficacy of different techniques for the restoration of bare patches in the Nama-Karoo was investigated. Five different treatments, namely tilling, seeding and brush packing, and combinations thereof, were tested on the farm Hillmore in the Beaufort West district. Sown-in species established significantly better in the tilling+seeding+brush packing treatment (TSB), with Chaetobromus dregeanus and Atriplex semibaccata the most successful species. Important grazing species from the surrounding vegetation also established successfully in the different treatments. The tillage treatments were the most effective, especially the TSB treatment, which had significantly higher plant density and species richness than the other treatments. The results show that bare patches in the Nama-Karoo can be successfully revegetated with tillage treatments providing for rapid recolonisation of plants in the short term (over two years), and the tillage and seeding plus brush packing providing similar plant densities in the medium term (after five years). The tillage treatments resulted in higher plant density and species richness than the other treatments in the short term, a result that persisted with regard to species richness but not plant density in the medium term.",

However, the quality of kikuyu is generally low and consequently the milk production per cow is also low. The aim of the study was to determine the grazing capacity, milk production and milk composition from kikuyu, kikuyu over-sown with annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum var. westerwoldicum), kikuyu over-sown with a mixture of perennial ryegrass (L. perenne), white clover (Trifolium repens) and red clover (T. pratense), and kikuyu over-sown with a mixture of white and red clovers. Milk production per cow was highest on pasture with high clover content and the grazing capacity of pasture increased as the grass component increased. The milk produced from kikuyu during spring (15 kg cow−1 d−1) and summer (14.4 kg cow−1 d−1) was higher than during the autumn (12.1 kg cow−1 d−1). The total milk production from kikuyu during spring (3 876 kg milk ha−1) increased when kikuyu was over-sown with annual ryegrass (8 133 kg milk ha−1) or with clover (7 370 kg milk ha−1). The summer and autumn grazing capacity of kikuyu and kikuyu–annual ryegrass fertilised with nitrogen was higher than the kikuyu–clover pastures not receiving nitrogen. The clover content of the pastures did not affect the milk protein or butterfat content. The mean annual grazing capacity of kikuyu (6.7 cows ha−1) and kikuyu–annual ryegrass (8 cows ha−1) pasture was higher than the kikuyu–clover (5.3 cows ha−1) pasture. The grazing capacity and milk production per cow from kikuyu over-sown with ryegrass varied less than from kikuyu or kikuyu–clover pastures. This resulted in a similar or higher milk production per hectare from kikuyu–ryegrass compared to that of kikuyu or kikuyu–clover pastures.

    "abstract": "Abstract Land redistribution schemes (e.g. Settlement Land Acquisition Grant and Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development) initiated since the mid-1990s in Limpopo province under national land reform programs have sought to introduce a new generation of previously disadvantaged people to commercial livestock production. However, the beneficiaries of these redistribution schemes known as 'emerging farmers', many of whom generally possess limited technical and financial skills or knowledge of commercial farming practices, face serious challenges in their journey to commercial status. Problems facing the emerging farmers include lack of secure title to the land, lack of investment and working capital and limited access to credit, poor veld condition, highly variable climate, insufficient farm size, inadequate or damaged infrastructure, poor access to extension officers who, in turn, are often overcommitted and under-resourced, poor knowledge of pasture and animal management, and a highly competitive industry context. Many of these problems can be resolved only by government, but problems of pasture, animal, financial and property management can be addressed by training and support. This paper outlines the experiences to date of a project that is seeking to provide technical information and support to emerging livestock farmers in four communities in Limpopo province.

    "abstract": "Abstract We examined landscape and habitat (vegetation) scale foraging of cattle and sheep at two communal villages in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, to determine the key resources utilised during the dry season. At the landscape scale, cattle at both sites displayed overall preference for the arable lands at this time, although this diminished steadily as the dry season progressed. In contrast, sheep made considerably less use of these areas, showing only sporadic preference. At the vegetation scale, cattle demonstrated greatest preference for crop residues and uncultivated 'commonage' areas, although foraging in grassland increased considerably in the latter stages of the dry season. Sheep utilised a much smaller range of vegetation types, preferring crop residues and fields that had been recently fallow and avoiding all other vegetation categories. We suggest that given the spatial limitations in planned, communal villages, the arable lands function as key resource areas for livestock during the dry season. It is recommended that management of these areas emphasise greater integration of sheep and cattle grazing and focus on maintaining vegetation heterogeneity in order to facilitate opportunistic 'switching' in foraging patterns at different stages of the dry season.

The herbicides 2,4-D amine (480 g ai l−1), metsulfuron methyl (600 g kg−1) and picloram (240 g l−1) were tested at three levels each. Manual control comprised hoeing and pulling out parthenium plants by hand. Treatments were applied in mid-December 2006. Surveys were conducted prior to treatment and again in March 2007. The untreated control had a mean mortality of 16% at the end of the growing season, attributed to self thinning. Parthenium mortalities above 80% were achieved with metsulfuron methyl 18–75 g ai ha−1, picloram 270–360 g ai ha−1 and both manual control techniques. Broadleaf species, 10 out of 15 of which were alien, were severely affected by herbicides but alien forbs appeared to benefit by the selective removal of parthenium in the manual control treatments. Native grasses filled the space vacated by broadleaf species in the plots treated with herbicide. However, none of the treatments offered lasting control because parthenium regeneration density a year later was no different to densities at the start of the trial. Successful management of parthenium rests on a strong commitment to follow-up spraying until alternative vegetation has covered and stabilised areas under treatment.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the indirect influence of mammalian herbivores on invertebrates, by utilising long-term mammalian herbivore exclosures in Kruger National Park. The exclosures span three distinct habitat types (crest, footslope and riparian) on a catena. By performing invertebrate collections in the exclosures and in a control area we were able to assess the indirect effect of mammalian herbivory on the invertebrate community and if this influence varied across habitat types. Our results indicate that large mammalian herbivores (notably elephants) had significant negative effects on total invertebrate abundance, while medium-sized mammalian herbivores affected the abundance and richness of beetles and grasshoppers negatively. Habitat type affected the invertebrates; spider abundance and richness peaked on the footslope, while beetles were the most abundant and taxon-rich in the riparian zone. Hence, our results suggest that indirect effects of mammalian herbivores on the invertebrate community may be significant, and in most cases negative, but also that the effects of mammalian herbivores vary across invertebrate groups. Thus, to better understand the broad-scale implications of changed mammalian herbivore pressures for the functioning of savanna systems, it may be important to take effects on invertebrate communities into account.",

    "abstract": "The creation of local institutions with a mandate over land access and control is seen as a prerequisite for successful decentralisation of land tenure and effective local resource management in sub-Saharan Africa. However, with land tenure reform in South Africa currently at a state of legislative impasse, real uncertainty now exists over land rights and governance of rangeland in many communal areas. This paper draws on case study material from Eastern Cape province to illustrate how this ongoing uncertainty has resulted in the operation of a range of traditional authority and civil society institutions in different communal areas with varying degrees of legitimate authority over land administration and highly variable performance in managing rangeland resources. Collective management of rangeland resources seems most difficult in environments where land rights are contested because of the coexistence of traditional leaders and civil society institutions. On this basis an approach to tenure reform is advocated, which vests all powers over local land administration in democratically elected and accountable civil society institutions. Some successful examples of this already exist and might serve to guide policy formation, which must be flexible enough to accommodate collective management approaches that emphasise cooperation both within and between communities.",

Leaf carriage patterns of deciduous species were determined from September 2004 to August 2008. Similarities existed between Acacia karroo and Diospyros lycioides – mature leaves were present from October to April, with some dry leaves retained until June. Ziziphus mucronata had mature leaves from December to May with dry leaves retained until August. Mature leaves of Searsia pyroides were present from November to March and dry leaves until June. Though statistically non-significant, large A. karroo trees shed leaves faster than smaller trees. Differences were observed in phenology between years. Minimum temperature was strongly correlated with leaf phenology. Rainfall was weakly correlated with leaf phenology, though above-average rainfall resulted in increased growth of shoots and leaves. The few semi-deciduous shrubs retained mature leaves for longer periods, normally until September, and were extensively browsed. The winter-deciduous nature of woody species and absence of evergreen species have serious consequences for introduction of browsing game species on small fenced properties. The critical period, when browse was limited, is from July/August to mid-October; unless stocking rates are kept low this will necessitate the supply of feed.

The treatment was benchmarked against a relatively lightly stocked neighbouring farm. An assessment of termite richness across the contrasting land-use areas was also made. Significant differences were found mainly in plant structure, with reduced plant canopy cover and plant height on the communal land, thus transforming a woodland to a predominantly shrubland physiognomy. There was no significant effect of heavy utilisation on richness or diversity of plant or termite taxa. Species compositional shifts were reflected by significant species associations with either land-use type. Forb species formed an important component of the vegetation irrespective of grazing intensity. Cover of annual plants did not increase with heavy utilisation owing to the increase of ‘weedy’ annual species being counterbalanced by declining cover of palatable annual plants. Biological soil crusts were markedly less common on the communal land, which may result in an increased hydraulic conductivity of the soil. Other soil properties measured appeared to be insensitive to the intense level of land utilisation.",

Vegetation composition data collected in ca. 1990 in the eastern and western Maloti provide a baseline for assessing historical and future shifts in the abundance of functional groups such as C3 and C4 grasses and encroaching unpalatable dwarf Karroid shrubs. C3/C4 grasses had a skewed topographic distribution with the 50% floristic crossover from C4 to C3 grasses occurring approximately at 2 900 m above sea level (asl) on northerly slopes and 2 700 m asl and 2 400 m asl on south-facing slopes in the east and west, respectively. Shrubs were restricted to low, warm and dry slopes. C3/C4 grass patterns were most strongly correlated with modelled daily temperatures in early spring (October) and late summer (February), whereas winter temperatures and evaporation appeared important for shrubs. Warming would favour C4 grasses but eCO2 might benefit C3 grasses, whereas unpalatable C3 shrubs would be promoted by warming, eCO2 and grazing and should expand their distribution. Monitoring functional groups by remote sensing is recommended.",

Yield increased as a function of the amount of water and nitrogen fertiliser applied. The dry matter (DM) content, in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), crude protein (CP) and metabolisable energy (ME) were higher in the treatments being irrigated once every two weeks. These results conclude that higher irrigation coupled with high N application significantly improved the dry matter yield, while water stress, to some extent, did improve the quality of the pasture by increasing the DM content, IVOMD, CP and ME values.",

We also investigated the effect of catena, aspect, rockiness and land use on the bush encroachment. Rainfall and temperature data were also analysed. The observed large increases in woody cover cannot be explained by land use or by local climatic conditions only. The changes are also consistent with global climate change effects, most likely due to increasing atmospheric CO2.",

Thus, the aim of this paper was to examine concepts related to grazing and resting of grassland and associated effects on grassland productivity and energy flow to livestock. Our review and models demonstrate that grassland and livestock productivity is determined by lagged effects of the previous year's grazing and by grassland maturation, which influence grass growth rates, as well as forage quality. Livestock productivity is also influenced by the scale at which livestock are able to make foraging decisions in time and space, which is restricted by increasing intensity of management (increasing rotation and declining paddock size). Finally, overstocking will override key management initiatives, such as effective recovery periods, leading to rangeland degradation. Thus, in variable climates, stocking rate should be set conservatively to allow easier adaptation of animal numbers to rainfall variability from year to year. We suggest several key concepts that can be used to design and assess grazing management strategies and make suggestions on how to implement these concepts.",

    "abstract": "The management of rangelands over the past decade in Zimbabwe has been on the decline. This has resulted in degraded and depleted communal rangelands. A number of recommendations by various government departments, researchers and non-governmental organisations have been implemented. These focused on improving communal grazing areas throughout the country. Notable examples include the livestock destocking policy, introduction of grazing schemes, improved forage grasses, veld legume reinforcement and agro-forestry technology. However, success in improving communal grazing areas has been limited, with forage productivity in communal areas declining, soils still eroding, as well as loss of flora and fauna diversity. The objectives of this paper are to review factors limiting efforts to improve communal grazing areas, constraints to adoption of rangeland technologies necessary to achieve desired plant community for livestock production, and present recommendations to overcome the challenges. The review concludes that there has been limited farmer participation in efforts to improve communal grazing areas and livestock productivity, thus the low adoption of technologies to improve the grazing areas. It is therefore recommended to use participatory approach methodologies to assist communal livestock farmers to improve their grazing areas.",

The hypotheses tested were: (1) plant species and season affect diet selection, (2) physical traits such as leaf phenology, spinescence, shoot morphology and leaf size affect selection, and (3) selection is related to tannins, fibre and protein in ways that indicate nutrient maximisation. Six 2-year-old castrated indigenous goats weighing an average of 26 kg each were individually penned and maintained on a basal diet of pellets and grass hay. Six branches were offered simultaneously to individual goats and intake per branch recorded and used as an index for diet selection. Diet selection was significantly influenced by interactions between plant species and season. Scutia myrtina and Grewia occidentalis were consistently the most preferred species, whereas Gynmosporia maranguensis and Acacia nilotica were least preferred throughout the seasons. Goats preferred broad-leaf and long-shoot species over fine-leaf and short-shoot species across all seasons. These results suggest that short-term diet selection in subhumid areas is not as strongly influenced by leaf phenology and plant chemistry as in semi-arid savannas.",

This study aimed to analyse how herbaceous vegetation in the Kalahari savanna can recover from drought, and how this is affected by previously implemented bush control measures. We compared plant species composition and diversity of the herbaceous layer across a drought-release (2021) and post-drought (2022) year within two land use types (game and livestock) in bush-encroached and controlled areas, respectively. Diversity decreased significantly during the post-drought year. Annual species dominated in the drought-release year, which were replaced by perennial forbs and dwarf shrubs in the post-drought year. Selective bush control enhanced herbaceous species abundance and richness due to decreased competition. The species richness was higher in the game ranch compared to the cattle farm during the drought-release year. Herbaceous abundance, however, increased on the cattle farm. The management strategies, feeding behaviour and animal movement may have contributed to these differences in these two contrasting land use types. This study showed that herbaceous plant communities can recover rapidly after a drought period and in areas where bush control was applied.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this study was to assess the economic implications of shrub encroachment on pastoral rangeland productivity in Mbarara district, in south western Uganda. Sixty pastoral households were surveyed, thirty of which were grazing on cleared farms (with less than 25% of grazing covered by bush) and thirty were grazing on bushy farms (with more than 75% of grazing land covered by bush). The study was a survey and did not involve rigorous experimental work. Results indicated that cleared farms had higher herbage dry matter yield ranging from 1 850 kg ha−1 to 2 230 kg ha−1, compared to a range of 622 kg ha−1 to 1 190 kg ha−1 on bushy farms. Heifers on cleared farms reached puberty earlier and calved relatively earlier (12-30 months) as opposed to 24-36 months on bushy farms. The mean calving rate on cleared farms was higher (33.6%) than 22.6% on bushy farms. Mean milk yield on cleared farms was 3.8 L cow−1 d−1 compared to 2.4 L cow−1 d−1 on bushy farms. Results of body condition score indicated that cattle on cleared range had a higher mean score of 5.8 compared to 4.2 on bushy farms. Mean annual gross income was US$49.393 per cow per annum on cleared farms compared to US$23.351 on bushy farms. Financial efficiency measured by TR/TVC ratio was 1.2 on cleared farms compared to 1.1 on bushy farms. From the findings of the study, it was concluded that shrub encroachment led to reduced herbage DM yield and low levels of crude protein of the pasture, while clearing more than doubled herbage DM production. As a result, animal productivity in terms of milk yield, body condition and reproductive performance were also reduced. Cleared farms were more profitable than bushy ones in terms of gross margins due to higher animal performance and hence higher incomes. The financial efficiency of cleared farms was low due to high costs of shrub control. Shrub encroachment is a serious problem facing pastoral production in Mbarara district and requires adequate attention. Keywords: ANIMAL PRODUCTIONBUSH ENCROACHMENTGROSS MARGINSHERBAGE YIELD",

The aim was to identify possible relationships between long-term grazing pressure, and soil and vegetation properties. There are indications that continuous high-intensity defoliation of Succulent Karoo vegetation leads to a decline in species richness and perennial plant cover with a consequent loss of fertile topsoil. Over-grazed areas close to the watering point had shallow soils with a greater potential for crusting and therefore poorer water capacity. Mainly short-lived succulents (Mesembryanthemaceae) were recorded here, while under-utilised veld far from the watering point was identified by plant groupings dominated by Antimima hantamensis and Ruschia spinosa. Malephora crassa and Rhinephyllum macradenium are two key species which could be useful in veld condition assessment since they showed strong relationships with distance from the watering point. The results also have implications for restoration of degraded veld. Soils from degraded areas have been altered almost permanently and simply resting from livestock grazing may not achieve the desired vegetation recovery.",

This study investigated whether this severe defoliation regime has had an effect on surface soil properties, botanical composition, plant diversity, phytomass production, and the nutrient content of phytomass by comparing paired samples of grassland and immediately adjacent fire-breaks. Firebreaks differed quantitatively in composition from adjacent grassland although both were characterised as Themeda triandra–Tristachya leucothrix grassland. Only two grass species of lesser abundance, Brachiaria serrata and Eragrostis racemosa, were clearly more abundant on fire-breaks. Differences in plant diversity (species m–2, species 20m–2) were slight. Surface soil of fire-breaks compared with grasslands was slightly more acidic (0.2 units), lower in carbon (1% difference), and lower in total nitrogen (0.03% difference), suggesting deterioration of soil conditions on fire-breaks. Phytomass of fire-breaks and of grasslands burnt in early spring in the season sampled (biennial or greater burning frequency) were equivalent by February, indicating there has been no decline in productivity over time. Concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and copper in above-ground phytomass did not differ between fire-breaks and grasslands, although concentration of manganese tended to be greater in grassland. Expected seasonal trends, especially for nitrogen and phosphorus, were apparent. Fire-breaks therefore appear to be a sustainable management practice, in part because mid-winter burning allows sufficient recovery of canopy cover to mitigate against erosion by high intensity spring storms and the duration of grazing impact is alleviated by spring burning elsewhere. Grazing impact on fire-breaks may become more severe if grassland burning becomes more infrequent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Landscapes in northern Patagonia have undergone dramatic changes in fire regimes over the last century. Superimposed on this changing vegetation mosaic are impacts from introduced herbivores. In this paper we identify synergistic interactions developing into positive fire-herbivory feedbacks that maximise vegetation change. Analyses of vegetation changes over 30 years at low altitude (c. 800m) montane forest indicates that fire-fragmented forest has coalesced despite relatively heavy grazing pressure. During recent fire suppression, vegetation shifted in dominance from short-lived resprouting species (mostly shrubs) to obligate seed-dispersed trees, some of them requiring initial facilitation by shrubs. Transitions from shrubland and grassland to forest were restricted to c. 20–30m from the nearest forested patches. Beyond this distance, shrublands and grassland are stable in time. In contrast, post-fire responses of high altitude (>1 000m) subalpine forests show a much higher sensitivity to herbivory. Experimental evidence suggests strong fire severity × herbivory interactions affect tree seedling mortality. Severe fires and/or repeated fire create conditions where trees are unable to establish due to unfavorable microenvironments and because fire-opened forests are more heavily used by herbivores. These patterns are consistent with century-long trends of increase in montane forest at the expense of shrublands and increase in shrublands over former subalpine forests.

This study investigated use of tree and shrub resources by a local Maasai community, through discussions and a questionnaire. Twenty-four tree and shrub species were utilised for four main purposes: medicinal, fencing, firewood and shelter. These uses were mainly confined to four key species: Acacia mellifera, Acacia xanthophloea, Acacia tortilis and Balanites glabra. Ethno-medicine was the most common use and required smaller quantities of plant materials, followed by firewood and fencing. Construction of shelter was the least of the uses, requiring specific plant resources. The purposes of use, frequency of utilisation and quantities consumed were species-dependent. Though generally common and accessible, plant resource availability and proximity varied among species. The community felt there was a decline in tree and shrub cover due to charcoal burning, land use changes — particularly agricultural expansion — and fencing. Even though tree and plant resources were still available, it is important to monitor their use to avert potential overexploitation. Keywords: KUKU GROUP RANCHPLANT UTILISATION",

Range ecologists regard T. sericea as a major encroaching species and that such encroachment represents a cost to cattle production. In contrast, pastoralists regard this woody species as an important component of cattle diet, particularly during the hot-dry season or during drought. In this study, free-ranging cattle were observed during the peak of the pre-rain flushing period of deciduous plants during the hot-dry seasons of 2001 and 2002. Diet preference was evaluated by taking into account the proportion of diet consumed relative to its availability on the range. Diet preference was compared to diet quality. Cattle spent 71% of time feeding on browse during the hot-dry season. Terminalia sericea, Bauhinia petersiana and Philenoptera nelsii contributed 74.5% to browse consumption. Philenoptera nelsii was the most preferred browse. Generally, cattle preferred browse with high crude protein and phosphorus content but avoided browse with high fibre content. This study confirmed the long-term observations by local pastoralists that woody species contribute significantly to cattle diet during the hot-dry season in the northern Kalahari. We recommend that rehabilitation of encroached rangelands should take into account the role of browse in semi-arid environments.",

The study was conducted in a 3 × 4 factorial experiment arranged in a randomised complete block design with three replications.

Crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, cellulose, hemicellulose, phosphorus and IVDMD were significantly (P < 0.05) affected by the stage of harvesting. However, N fertiliser had no significant effect on chemical composition and IVDMD of the grassland. The results confirmed that the grassland can be categorised as medium- to high-quality herbage if harvested at 90 d after regrowth.

Ninety percent of forb species were damaged by HDG; type of damage varied widely from leaves and stems grazed to tearing and shredding by the hooves of cattle. Study of demography revealed that HDG threatened future populations of the grazing-sensitive species Afroaster hispida, Agathisanthemum chlorophyllum and Gerbera ambigua through increased mortality or reduction in the recruitment of large from small individuals.

We investigated the trampling effect of 1 600 sheep encamped at night in temporary enclosures (kraals, corrals or pens), which were relocated weekly. To examine trampling effects and regeneration rates of the various growth forms we compared vegeta- tion composition, canopy cover and foliar nitrogen inside and outside kraals, between one and 12 months after the trampling event. We predicted that inside kraals (1) succulent and non-succulent shrubs would be affected more severely than grasses, (2) perennial plant cover would decrease compared with annual plant cover, (3) foliar nitrogen concentrations would increase, and (4) vegetation recovery would be affected by time and rainfall since last use of the kraal. Grasses and shrubs (succulent and non-succulent) responded differently to kraaling. Density and diversity of succulent and non-succulent shrubs decreased, while annual and perennial grass cover inside and outside kraaling areas did not differ. Foliar nitrogen was greater inside kraals. Both succulent and non-succulent shrub cover increased over time after kraaling irrespective of the rainfall.

A number of irrigation scheduling techniques of varying levels of sophistication have been developed over the years to address limited irrigation water availability and maximise productivity. Despite this, the adoption of irrigation scheduling tools by farmers remains low. The objective of this study was to assess the use of simple irrigation scheduling calendars based on average weather data to improve irrigation management in ryegrass. The calibrated Soil Water Balance (SWB) model was used to generate simple irrigation calendars and assess effectiveness for different scenarios by mechanistically simulating water dynamics and pasture growth. Scheduling irrigation using the calendars gave similar irrigation applications, water losses and yields compared to a more scientific real-time scheduling (in response to soil water depletion by the crop). While site-specific irrigation scheduling calendars can easily be generated by consultants and irrigators, even simpler monthly estimates of average daily water use can also be useful. Application of calendars by farmers is encouraged to improve water and nutrient use efficiency of irrigated pastures, if real-time irrigation scheduling is not employed.Keywords: planted pasturessite-specific irrigation calendarsoil water balance modelwater requirement",

To develop best-estimation equations, the dendrometric parameters total height (H), crown height (CH), crown diameter (CD), diameter at stump height (DSH), diameter at breast height (DBH), crown depth (CDp), crown area (CA) and crown volume (CV) were measured from 12 sampled trees comprising three age ranges. Leaves and edible twigs of the sampled trees were clipped, oven dried, weighed and recorded as dry weight (DW). Regression analysis and a multicollinearity test were employed to remove non-significant predictors of DW. Results showed that only CV, CA, CD, CDp and DSH showed a strong correlation with DW. There was high collinearity between CD and CA, CD and CV, and CA and CV. However, CV and DSH had a higher correlation with DW than their counterparts, which suggested their use in the model. Therefore, the best allometric equation was: DW = 0.8470*CV - 0.2202*DSH - 1.5315 (R 2 = 0.99). This equation estimated that F. thonningii produces a very high amount of browsable biomass at all ages compared to common fodder species.

    "abstract": "In contrast to the exploration and use of southern African grass plant genetic resources over the past century, only a few indigenous legume species are currently used as forages, notwithstanding the vast untapped legume diversity available in southern Africa. The aim of this study was to assess legumes, indigenous to South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland and propose a list of species with pasture potential for further evaluation. Towards this end, legume species documented as being cultivated, grazed or browsed as well as plant collection data from the National Herbarium, South Africa, were used. The majority of cultivated, grazed or browsed species were recorded in the Central Bushveld, Lowveld and Mopane Bioregions, the Drakensberg Foothill and Coastal Region, Savanna Group and Northern Mistbelt leguminochoria and is largely enclosed by the Wolkberg Centre of Plant Endemism. The Phaseoleae tribe was found to contain the highest percentage of cultivated legume species. Legume species adapted to low soil phosphorus levels were identified, with 22 of these species previously noted for their pasture potential. It is suggested that the results of this study be used in the continued search for alternative indigenous legumes species for eventual integration into local and international pasture systems.",

    "abstract": "A quantitative description of woody plant communities that aimed at aiding studies on grass–tree competition interactions, bush encroachment and estimation of food to browser herbivore species, was proposed during 1989. It evolved as the BECVOL-model and differs from other methods by being able to provide estimates for both complete plants and plant portions. The previous model provides estimates of leaf volume and leaf dry mass only and this limitation regarding estimates of the browseable component of woody plants are addressed by including the edible shoots. The need for accurate estimations of the wood component is also addressed. Complete trees of a number of savanna tree species were harvested and separated into specific biomass fractions, dried and weighed: leaves, shoots and stems in three diameter classes (<0.5 cm, >0.5–20 cm and >20 cm). Regression analyses were applied with the plant dry mass fractions as dependent variables and spatial canopy volume as the independent variable. Highly significant regressions (P < 0.001) were achieved with the curvilinear regression models (exponential and multiplicative) that yielded the highest correlation coefficients. Once incorporated into the BECVOL 3-model, these regression equations will enable a complete quantification of the aboveground biomass of woody plants within specific height strata.",

The study was carried out on two farms that have followed crop/pasture rotation systems for the past 20 years. Two growing seasons (2015 and 2016) were evaluated on areas within fields that were identified to have poor, medium and high production potential. Soil samples were taken to evaluate soil quality and to determine the medic seed density in soil. Above-ground seed production and herbage production were monitored during the growing season. The low productivity soils had the lowest below-and above-ground seed density, medic seedlings establishment and medic herbage yield. Soil sodicity was one of the main factors decreasing pasture productivity. In a production system where medics need to regenerate effectively following good seed production, soil sodicity may be especially detrimental.",

The point intercept method was conducted annually over a period of more than 20 years at five transects in the plains habitat on the Goegap Nature Reserve in the Northern Cape, South Africa. Vegetation change was assessed in terms of vegetation cover, species composition, species abundance, growth form composition, range condition and plant diversity. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to illustrate the trajectories in floristic data and to determine the strength of the correlations with rainfall and grazing variables. The effects of the high grazing pressure on the plains were apparent in the overall decrease in total plant cover and reductions in the cover of grazing-sensitive species over the monitored period. Diversity parameters, of especially the annual component, were strongly related to rainfall. A directional change, which supports the equilibrium concept, was evident in changes in perennial species composition over time. The annual component, however, showed no directional change, but displayed eventdriven, non-equilibrium dynamics by fluctuating in reaction to the timing and quantity of rainfall.",

These studies often lack focus on formulating and studying 'drought specific' research questions. By learning from observations during droughts, research gaps can be identified and drought specific questions can be formulated to be tested during future droughts. Therefore, in order to get a more holistic view of the ecology of drought, and in order to assist in formulating drought-related questions and/or hypotheses and identifying research gaps, we collected and collated observations and reflections from >50 persons who have lived and/or worked extensively in the Kruger National Park (KNP) and surrounding areas during the 2015/2016 drought. Many ecological lessons, interesting ideas, valuable insights and truly remarkable natural history observations were harnessed from these observations. We summarise them here to help prepare scientists in framing ideas on the functioning and role of droughts, and in designing research in anticipation of future droughts. These observations are not only valuable for scientists, but also for management. We reflect on lessons learned from previous droughts that led to changed management approaches that made the system more resilient during the recent drought. Although studies that focus on specific aspects of droughts are critical to enhance our understanding of droughts, narrative papers like this that cover many scales, taxa and processes can contribute to a broader synthesis and integration.",

The use of drought resistant shade trees, water reservoirs and dams, and alternative ecosystem-based livelihoods were the majorly utilised EbAs.

The utilisation of drought resistant shade trees dominated the ecosystem services and adaptation benefits categories, whereas the use of water reservoirs and dams were the mostly used EbA for livelihood improvement. These EbAs should be incorporated in climate-change adaptation policies and initiatives, while considering their subsequent dominating categories to enhance farmers' resilience.",

The plant possesses some striking attributes, such as rapid growth rate, drought tolerance, adaptation to alkaline and acidic sterile soils, and resistance to a variety of edaphic and temperature changes. In past years V. karroo was recognised to be a major threat to rangeland productivity owing to its invasive nature. Research interest has shifted from its eradication as an unwanted plant to its utilisation as a feed resource for livestock. Extensive utilisation of V. karroo is mainly hindered by the presence of tannins and spines. Prospects to lessen the adverse effects of the anti-nutritional influences are now recognised. Vachellia karroo possesses desirable fatty acid profiles, and high protein and mineral contents that can improve animal performance. Presently, the use of V. karroo for goat production in communal areas is restricted owing to limited evidence for its nutritional value as animal feed. The present review, therefore, seeks to demonstrate the utility potential of V. karroo to improve growth performance, carcass characteristics, chevon quality, meat fatty acid profiles and as a natural anti-helminth for goats raised under an extensive system of production.",

Identification of indicator species for purposes of rangeland condition assessment was done by using the correlations between the relative composition and the rangeland condition value of a species. Index values and Gaussian distribution curves were used in calculations to determine rangeland condition. The accuracy of these methods was tested and the best results were obtained by using the species curves of Themeda triandra and other species which dominate at other positions along the gradient.

The dense plant cover of grassland in good condition provides a situation in which surface runoff and soil loss are lower (P<0.01) than that from grassland in poor condition. Direct evaporation from the bare uncultivated soil surface was on average 69% of the rainfall.

To determine the concentration of mineral elements in soil, native pasture and blood serum of Horro cattle (local zebu), samples were collected from four sites situated within a 30km radius of Bako Research Centre (BRC) at the end of the rainy season and during the following dry season. Mean mineral element concentrations in soil and native pasture in the bottomlands tended to exceed levels in the uplands for almost all investigated elements. Soil Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Mn and Cu concentrations were within the optimum range for active plant growth, but the levels of available Zn and P were below the critical limit. At the upland sites the effect of season on native pasture mineral element concentration was significant only for P (P<0.05) and K (P<0.01). Upland native pasture Zn concentrations in both wet and dry seasons and Cu and P in the dry season were below cattle requirements, but the remainding mineral elements were above or within the recommended range. Except for P, season affected serum mineral element concentrations significantly (P<0.01). There was no significant (P>0.05) difference between male and female cattle for any serum mineral measured. A season x gender interaction was significant (P<0.05) only for serum P. Dry season serum Zn and Mg concentrations in female cattle and dry season serum Cu concentration in both sexes fell below the critical value. The correlation coefficient between soil and native pasture was r = 0.81 for Ca (P<0.05) and r = 87 for Mg (P<0.05). A negative relationship was obtained between wet season soil Mg and serum Mg in male cattle (r = -0.96; P<0.05). A high negative correlation (r = -0.99; P<0.01) was also obtained between native pasture Mg and serum Mg from male cattle in the wet season. Based on the information obtained from soil, native pasture and serum assays, low levels of Zn, P, Cu and Mg in soil and native pasture could potentially limit livestock production in the study area.

It has been suggested that incorrect grazing management practices have resulted in a decrease in the production potential of rangelands. In order to explore the nature and extent of degradation at the landscape scale, we selected a study site where a range of land‐use and rangeland management practices could be studied in parallel. The mid‐Fish River valley consists of three markedly different units of land management, namely, commercial rangelands, communal rangelands and nature conservation areas. Using a direct gradient analysis approach, the vegetation of the study area was classified into homogenous units. A shift in the vegetation composition in response to different land‐use treatments was investigated. The results of the classification showed three major plant communities present in the study area, namely, Short Succulent Thicket, Medium Succulent Thicket and Mesic Bushclump Savanna. The results revealed a definite grazing gradient within the study area. It showed that an increase in grazing intensity resulted in a transformation from vegetation synonymous to a mesic environment towards that found in an arid environment. As grazing pressure increased there was a decrease in palatable grasses, succulents and herbaceous species and an increase in dwarf karroid shrubs.",

The behaviour of these fires was related to the response of the vegetation by monitoring the recovery and productivity of the grass sward after only one burn over a two year period (2000/01 to 2001/02 seasons). The results showed that head fires had significantly greater flame height and rate of spread than back fires. However, at ground level back fires were more intense and had a negative effect on recovery of the grasses, resulting in lower litter, yield and water-use efficiency (aboveground phytomass or crude protein produced per unit of evapotranspiration). Fire had a significant effect on plant density and cover, with basal cover 68% lower than that of unburnt grassland two months after the fire. Cymbopogon plurinodis with large tufts had the most die-back of all the species. With the exception of plant cover and density, which takes longer to recover, it takes approximately two complete growing seasons to recover from most of the detrimental effects of fire. The initial increased crude protein content of the plant material caused by fire did not off set the approximately 50% reduction in plant production the first growing season after the fire. Fire significantly decreased WUE (water-use efficiency), with an average over the two growing seasons of 3.06kg ha-1 mm-1 and 2.45kg ha-1 mm-1 for unburnt and burnt grassland respectively. In various semi-arid grassland areas, the use of fire as a management tool is questionable if there is no specific purpose for it.",

Of overwhelming concern is the difficulty of translating this information into a useful tool for making decisions about land management and intervention strategies. At one level, the land manager is always playing catch-up, as the technology for viewing and analysing imagery improves and out-strips his capacity. He is close to the land, making daily decisions about production and condition, but the images are snapshots taken two to three months earlier. To most land managers, remote sensing has remained illusive, seldom allowing the manager to use it to its full potential. In contrast, the policy maker, backed by GIS laboratories and remote sensing specialists, is confronted by plausible scenarios of degradation and transformation. After intervening, he is seldom active long enough to witness changes in the remotely derived land condition indices and fails to adapt decisions. Bridging this divide remains a challenge to the remote-sensing community and some possible mechanisms are suggested. The major limiting factor for the wider utilisation of satellite imagery in rangeland assessment remains the cost of the imagery. Unless first world data suppliers show their commitment to sustainable development in real terms, data costs will remain a limiting factor.",

Samson Ole Tuya, Member of Parliament, Narok South. Workshop — Defining the framework for management and conservation planning for the Maasai Mara ecosystem, November 1996 The Maasai Mara ecosystem has one of the richest assemblages of wildlife in the world and supports about 237 herbivores per km2, making it one of the most productive natural terrestrial ecosystems. It maintains the greatest and most spectacular large mammal migration on earth and is the most highly visited tourist area in the East African region. Tourism generates millions of dollars annually while livestock and agriculture contribute significantly to the local and national economy. This paper examines the enormous threats facing the ecosystem and the efforts being made to keep the ecosystem open in order to support a vibrant tourist trade and a healthy livestock economy. These aspects are currently threatened by a burgeoning human population, land subdivision, changing land tenure systems, crop farming, poaching, habitat fragmentation, blockage of wildlife migratory corridors, habitat destruction, sedentarisation, environmental degradation and poverty. Wildlife conservation is in conflict with agriculture, while tourism has taken away the best grazing areas for livestock. The paper also reviews the ecological and socio-economic problems associated with tourism, land use changes and break down of traditional governance structures and how they have weakened the capacity of Maasai Mara to sustain a viable wildlife populations.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge confronting managers of extensive grazing systems is uneven use of herbaceous forage plants by livestock. The concentration of grazing in preferred areas or around foci points (e.g. water points) eventually results in adverse impacts in soil nutrients, vegetation structure, production and composition. In Botswana's communal grazing systems, however, the severity or magnitude of this foregoing problem is little understood. This study therefore investigated herbaceous plant species patterns as a function of grazing pressure and soil nutrients in the sandveld and hardveld communal grazing areas of Botswana. Six boreholes (three in the hardveld and three in the sandveld), with sampling points at distances 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m and 3000m formed the investigation. At each sampling distance, two plots measuring 10m × 15m were designated, where soil and herbaceous plant samples were collected for further chemical analysis. Marked differences in soil nutrients, herbaceous plant nutrients, species composition and diversity were prominent between the two land zones. Soils from the hardveld boreholes recorded significantly higher concentration levels for both macro- and microelements relative to the sandveld. Insignificant negative correlations between soil and plant elements were established for the two ecological zones. Herbaceous plant species from the hardveld boreholes contained adequate macro- and microelements to meet dietary livestock requirements relative to the sandveld. The results are here discussed with the view of understanding their management implications for extensive grazing areas.",

    "abstract": "The tree:grass ratio of savannas is important, especially in the semi-arid savannas of South Africa. An increase in tree cover leads to reduced productivity and profitability of rangelands. We investigated the effects of soil type and grazing strategy on the presence and distribution of plant species in the Kimberley Triangle through vegetation classification. Heavy livestock grazing is generally believed to lead to increases in the tree:grass ratio, although we found that grazing strategy is not as important as soil type in determining species presence and distribution. We did, however, find that of the grazing strategies studied, communal grazing has the greatest potential to cause general vegetation degradation. Soil texture is a crucial determinant of the tree:grass ratio due to its effects on plant growth, soil moisture and nutrient presence and availability. These, in turn, alter the competitive relationships between N-fixing woody species and non-N-fixing grasses. We suggest that habitats with sandy soils and clay-pan habitats are resistant to bush encroachment by N-fixing species due to moisture deficiencies, soil texture and/or heavy utilisation. Heavy utilisation by game in rocky areas and in loam-sand-clay combination soils may remove the suppressive competitive effect of grasses on the woody vegetation and lead to bush encroachment. Hence these areas should be managed conservatively. Because of the importance of soil moisture in limiting woody plant germination and initial survival, we suggest that heavy grazing in above-average rainfall years should be limited in all habitats.",

We surveyed A. karroo demography and post-fire responses to determine what is facilitating this encroachment. We found no seedlings and few individuals with small lignotubers. This suggests that encroachment is due to release of already established individuals, rather than recent or continuous recruitment of new individuals. Post-fire height growth rates of basal resprouts is about 0.5 m y− 1, which is too slow for escape from damage by fire, given the present frequent fire regime. Analysis of post-fire responses suggests that individuals can resprout from the stem at relatively small sizes (1.2–2.2 m tall). We suggest that stems can incrementally grow beyond the zone of fire influence because post-fire resprouting does not only take place from the base, after individuals are above 1.2 m in height. Bush encroachment is suggested to be due to low fire intensity, which allows relatively small plants to resprout from the stem and thus incrementally grow in size until escape size.",

Adaptive phenotypic plasticity is more specific; it is the ability of a single genotype to produce an array of phenotypes depending on the environmental extent. We investigated differences in adaptive phenotypic plasticity as well as local adaptations measured by reaction norms of two extreme populations (Leeu Gamka, arid Karoo and Richards Bay, subtropical coastal forest) of the extremely phenotypically plastic tree species Acacia karroo in a common-garden experiment. In addition, we used allozymes to determine whether these populations were genetically differentiated. Seeds were grown at different levels of water availability with respect to their original environments and browsing by mammals was simulated in the greenhouse by clipping plants. We found that the populations are adaptively phenotypically plastic in response to these factors. The slow-growing population (Leeu Gamka) was phenotypically more plastic with regard to defence-related traits (spines, tannin) and the fast-growing population (Richards Bay) was phenotypically more plastic regarding growth-related traits (height, leaves). The interactions between populations and environments in some traits indicated genetic differentiation in plastic responses between populations and, consequently, that phenotypic plasticity is locally adaptive and not merely due to environmental differences. The two populations appear to have pure strategies; when environmental conditions were improved by addition of water, the forest population increased investment in growth but not defence, whereas the arid population increased defence production but not growth. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of allozymes revealed little genetic overlap among populations.

We measured vegetative traits for 18 bunch grass species local to Pietermaritzburg (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) and measured their competitive effect on a phytometer. Using 3 m × 3 m plots planted as monocultures 12 years earlier, we related principal components of these traits to how species had invaded other species' plots (invasiveness), and how their monocultures had been invaded (invasibility). Species with high total leaf mass, many tillers and low specific leaf area (SLA) were most invasive and most resistant to invasion by other grasses. Short, slow-growing grasses were most invasible by forbs. This was partly explained by linking traits to invasion through competitive effect: grasses with high total leaf mass, many tillers and low SLA showed the strongest competitive effect, which appears to be necessary but not sufficient for invasiveness. Thus, traits can predict species' ecological performance and provide insight into the processes structuring plant communities. Restoring grasses with short stature, slow growth, low leaf mass, few tillers, and high SLA may facilitate invasion by other native species, thereby increasing species richness.",

With increasing clump size, there was a corresponding increase in woody basal area, species richness and diversity, but not evenness. Correspondence analysis showed that the pattern of compositional variation was closely related to clump size; differences resulting from clump establishment disappeared as clumps developed. Population size structure of 20 (of 21) species was dominated by small individuals, indicating that regeneration has increased over time. Coddia rudis was prolific on a clump periphery; Scutia myrtina and A. karroo were dominant within clumps. Seven shrub and nine tree species were encountered more frequently within a clump than on its periphery. All species other than A. karroo had fruits suited to dispersal by birds or mammals. The overall pattern of bush clump succession shows close parallels with that initiated by invasion of Prosopis glandulosa into grassland in Texas, USA.",

A total of 57 herbaceous species (24 grasses and 33 non-grasses) and 39 woody species (12 trees and 27 shrubs) were identified. Of the 24 grass species identified, 16.7% were highly desirable, 62.5% desirable and 20.8% less desirable by grazers. Biomass of both trees and shrubs was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in grazing enclosures than in other treatments, whereas herbaceous vegetation biomass was higher, but not significantly, in prescribed fire managed rangeland units. Importantly, fire-managed areas also contained the highest densities of some of the most desirable grassland species, including Cenchrus ciliaris, Chrysopogon aucheri and Digitaria milanijiana. We conclude that in the absence of fire, the increasing prevalence of enclosures in Borana pastoralist systems may be encouraging the proliferation of woody shrubs and trees at the expense of more desirable pasture species.",

Finer-scale satellite collar data for ACHM yielded a calculated stocking rate of 0,55 LSU ha-1 y-1 or 24 590 kg km-2, which constitutes high-density grazing. An energy flow estimate shows that the grazing resource would, on average, not be limiting for livestock on ACHM but limiting on SCR. HPG may include an element where kraals are inserted into degraded rangelands for a short period. Overall, ACHM shows stable perennial composition with smaller tufts significantly closer together. A similar result was visible in SCR where maize yields were visibly higher on kraaled areas than on adjacent untreated fields. HPG yields positive long-term effects on ecosystem services (soils and vegetation) and points to the HPG approach enhancing the sustainability of livestock and wildlife in this environment.",

This study aimed to determine whether there are differences in the nutritional quality of diets selected by herded and free-ranging goat and sheep flocks utilising Namaqualand Granite Renosterveld vegetation during the wet and dry seasons. Plant samples collected along the grazing routes of livestock were dried and analysed for their fibre, condensed tannin, total phenolic and mineral nutrient contents. The study showed that a large variety of forages were on offer and livestock groups selected different diets of which some were different to the total diet on offer. In general, significant deficiencies in phosphate, protein and energy in the diets selected by herded and free-ranging goats and sheep were observed in both wet and dry season. The quality of the diets selected by herded and free-ranging livestock was also found to be different from each other, with herded livestock generally selecting more nutrient-dense diets. Herding, therefore, allows livestock to access better-quality forage in the Namaqualand Granite Renosterveld rangeland, where it is generally poor.",

However, increasing camp number and animal densities above four camps did not reduce (P > 0.05) parasite loads compared with HPG. Current results suggest that rotational grazing is a potential strategy to reduce livestock losses caused by high tick and worm loads in cattle, especially in the hot wet season.Keywords: animal health, cattle, faecal worm eggs, rotational grazing, tick count",

Assuming cultivated pasture area will decrease with land degradation, conversion to grain crops or urban expansion, the only alternative is to increase productivity per area. We suggest an underutilised solution: increase herbivore diversity on cultivated pastures. We review multiple herbivore species (MHS) ecology in natural ecosystems (rangeland and wildlife parks) for guidelines to implementing this approach in cultivated pasture. In rangeland or natural grassland systems, sequential or simultaneous introduction of MHS results in greater productivity, diversity and resilience of plant as well as animal populations. Replacing historical mono-ruminant systems with MHS or classes on cultivated pasture is currently beyond landowner experience and will stretch cultivated pasture science. This approach becomes more feasible, however, as cultivated pastures increase in plant biodiversity and canopy complexity. We enumerate research and demonstration topics that might promulgate MHS in cultivated pastures.",

Seasonal changes in browses affected diet selection. Selection of long shoot species, which were concomitantly broad-leafed, was higher than species with short shoots. Selection was higher for spineless than spinescent species. Diet selection correlated positively with increased leaf mass. In the rainy season, cellulose positively correlated with intake, number of bites and browsing time, whereas in the dry season, cellulose correlated with bite size. Diet selection tended to be driven more by shoot morphology and leaf mass than by either spinescence or plant chemistry.

Our results suggest that, below critical threshold cover levels, Prosopis trees do not affect indigenous vegetation and add to overall rangeland vegetation cover. However, once Prosopis cover exceeds critical thresholds, the trees begin to negatively impact on indigenous vegetation (especially grasses) and overall vegetation cover. In addition, our data suggest that vegetation cover recovers after Prosopis clearing, being temporarily higher than pre-invasion levels possibly as a result of enhanced post-invasion soil fertility. Lastly, our results suggest that Prosopis trees reduce rangeland erosion potential at low cover and increase it after they exceed critical threshold cover. Information about thresholds of Prosopis impact can be used to direct clearing efforts for maximum benefit when resources are limited.",

All meat traders had the potential but were not willing to support the development of a NPB brand citing smallholder farmers' limited ability to supply sufficient volumes of high-quality cattle. Consumers (81%) were prepared to purchase NPB upon availability on the market but were not willing (80%) to pay a brand premium. Logistic regression model results showed that consumers' willingness to buy NPB and pay a premium were influenced (P < 0.05) by gender, household size, income source, meat preference, meat consumption frequency, money spent on beef, frequency of beef purchases and consumption. Overall, beef traders and consumers held positive impressions regarding the development of a NPB brand by smallholder cattle producers but were not willing to support its development. Positive impressions held by value chain partners on the development of a NPB brand provide a basis for advancing development of a NPB brand. Initial efforts should enhance farmers' capacity to supply sufficient volumes of high-quality cattle.",

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of aspect on vegetation characteristics of two mountainous pastures (summer and winter) over two seasons (autumn and spring) in Tajikistan. A three-way ANOVA was conducted using GLM procedures to test the main effects and interactions of these factors on vegetation attributes. The biomass production (kg DM ha−1) was significantly greater on the north-facing aspects for both summer and winter pastures in spring (483.4, 326.1) and autumn (57.2, 143.9), compared with south-facing aspects (57.2, 143.9 in spring and 18.5, 48.2 in autumn, respectively). Plant cover and plant density were also greater on north than south-facing slopes for summer and winter pastures in spring and autumn. Aspect significantly affected species diversity, botanic composition, and plant life forms of both pastures mainly for grasses and geophytes. There were greater vegetation responses on north than south-facing slopes, implying that aspect is important when designing mountain rangeland restoration. Given this complexity, land managers should thoroughly assess the conditions of the target site before defining restoration objectives and interventions.",

Selective tree removal was applied to reduce woody density (4 065 ± 109 plants ha−1) of the control (0% WRI) to 10, 20, 50, 75 and 100% WRIs, with four replicates per WRI.

However, grass species diversity and evenness were similar across the treatments. In addition, herbaceous cover increased across the woody removal gradient, with the control plots recording the lowest cover. Overall, results showed that moderate removal of trees (i.e. 50%) in rangelands encroached by woody plants has the potential to maximise rangeland condition and can be used as a strategy for the restoration of herbaceous vegetation.Keywords: Marikana Thornveldrangeland conditionvegetation rehabilitationwoody-plant encroachmentwoody-plant removal",

An analysis of research published in the journals of the Grassland Society of Southern Africa from 1966 to 2023 revealed a widening focus on different consumptive and non-consumptive ES. While livestock remains the primary focus, there is a growing interest in other provisional, regulatory, supporting, and cultural ES and uses of rangeland. The term 'ecosystem services' started to appear in articles from the early 2000s, marking a shift towards a richer discourse on the multifarious resources and services rangelands can provide to diverse users. A transition from 'veld' to 'rangeland' terminology occurred at the onset of the 21st century, though 'veld' remains mentioned. Recognition of communal and pastoral users of rangelands has expanded since the mid-1980s, alongside more frequent studies on conservation of biodiversity and commercial game production. Research has increasingly focused on understanding ecological processes supporting rangeland productivity and the provision of other ES, including carbon sequestration for climate regulation. Cultural and recreational values of rangelands have received little research attention. Overall, the journals' corpus is evolving to reflect a broader perspective on valuing and managing multi-functional rangelands, which is in alignment with global research trends.Keywords: biodiversitycarbon sequestrationgrasslandmultifunctionalitypastoralismsavanna",

A study was conducted to determine the recovery of a rangeland grazed at different intensities and allowed a two‐year rest period. The following treatments were applied to 0.5 hectare plots: 0, 4, 8 and 16 heifers per hectare, hereafter referred to as CL, X, 2X and 4X respectively. At the end of the grazing period, the highest stocked treatments (2X and 4X) had lower herbage biomass, higher soil bulk density, lower soil moisture and lower herbaceous cover than the lower stocked treatments (CL and X). Drought in the rest period caused an increase in bulk density and decline in soil moisture in all the treatments. Even after the two‐year rest period, the more heavily grazed treatments had higher bulk density and lower soil moisture than the more lightly grazed treatments. Similarly, the herbaceous biomass in the 2X and 4X treatments did not recover after the two‐year rest period and was lower (P < 0.05) than the CL and X treatments. At the end of the recovery period a trend of declining herbaceous cover with stocking density was still evident. The relative cover of forbs in the 4X treatments increased more than in the other treatments, while the cover of perennial grasses did not recover in the 4X treatments after the rest period. Thus, stocking above 2X produced negative soil and vegetation responses which did not recover during the two‐year rest period. This study also indicated that drought can cause vegetation and soil responses similar to those of overgrazing.",

The total leaf DM in the different plant communities ranged between 1 224 kg ha−1 and 2 672 kg ha−1. The contribution of individual woody species to the total leaf DM ha−1 is presented for each plant community. Colophospermum mopane contributed substantially to the total leaf DM in all communities. Monthly assessments were made of the abundance of leaves in different phonological states for the most important woody species in each plant community. Differences in the leaf carriage patterns and phenological composition of leaves between different plant communities, as well as between the most important woody species, were established. The long leaf‐carriage period of C. mopane, relative to the other represented tree species, underlies its potential importance as a fodder resource in the study area.

Discriminant analysis indicated that these communities occupy particular topographic positions. The community‐environment relationships identified in this study were similar to those reported from other alpine areas of Lesotho. Grasslands at high altitudes are temperate in nature, with a high proportion of C3 grass species. Below 2 950 m on the warmer aspects and below 2 750 m on south‐facing slopes, subtropical grass species (C4) dominate the sward. Within the temperate and subtropical vegetation belts, slope orientation dictates the proportion of C3 species present in the sward. It is proposed that topography acts to modify the factors that directly influence plant growth by modifying solar radiation patterns.",

Commonly, each species is compared to the standard large stock unit (LSU) used in conventional agriculture. However, this approach does not allow for ecological separation, and thus overlooks the potential for using the specialised and complementary resource‐use habits of wild ungulates to maximise veld utilisation. The aim of this study was to quantify the overlap in ungulate resource‐use on a game ranch, and to demonstrate how these indices of overlap can be incorporated into substitution ratios for calculating stocking rates. Habitat utilisation patterns of Burchell's zebra (Equus burchelli,), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), eland (Taurotragus oryx), gemsbok (Oryx gazella), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), impala (Aepyceros melampus), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), and warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus), were studied on the Messina Experimental Farm. Indices of overlap were determined for spatial distribution, habitat selection, diet composition, and browsing height, and were calculated as the sum of the percentage points from each resource dimension that was common to both species. Grazer and browser animal unit substitution ratios are presented for each of the ungulates using the index of combined overlap, metabolic mass and a reference norm of a blue wildebeest (grazer) and a kudu (browser) respectively. It is proposed that these substitution ratios can be used to calculate stocking rates for game ranches in the Mopani Veld.",

The GIM may provide more acceptable range condition scores and more realistic estimates of the current grazing capacity. Using GIVs, arrived at by scoring the agronomic attributes of the plant species (productivity, forage value, perenniality), the estimated current grazing capacities are found to be closely similar to the grazing capacity norms established for the different agro‐ecological areas in the Karoo. The manner in which the range condition survey is conducted and the application of the grazing index method, ensures the computation of a figure representative of the agronomic potential of the area to support livestock. The cover figure and the range condition score determined for a sample site, can be employed in monitoring the trend in changes in the vegetation, brought about by climatic and biotic variables. Grazing capacity norms are closely related to median annual precipitation (r2 = 0.98). The GIM is more closely related to grazing capacities than the EIM (r2 = 0.96 and 0.68 respectively).",

Theis knowledge was used to hypothesize the possible effects of vegetation change on the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis). Acacia nilotica, Acacia karroo, and Dichrostachys cinerea contributed most to the diet, and Cassine transvaalensis, Rhus guenzii, and Acacia gerrardii were the most preferred species. Eighty‐six percent of the recorded browse was from plants <2.5 m, suggesting that a change from open woodland, with many trees, to a closed woodland, with a few small trees, would disadvantage black rhino. Plant communities ranged from highly utilized (bottomland scrub forest) to unutilized (Combretum apiculatum sparse woodland). The extremely patchy distribution of browse utilization within communities suggests that there are other important factors affecting browse utilization besides plant species composition. It appears that tall grass detracts from browse value, while factors that improve access, such as gentle slopes and paths, enhance habitat suitability. It is hypothesized that forest verges provide important black rhino feeding areas.",

Goats were predominantly browsers during winter, spending 73% of their time eating woody plant forage. Principal woody plant species in the diet included Rhus pentheri, Acacia nilotica, Acacia karroo, Euclea crispa and Ziziphus mucronata. Succulents (Aloe ferox and Aloe maculata) were also readily eaten. Highly preferred species were Capparis sepiaria, Phyllanthus verrucosus and Scolopia zeyheri, while Rhoicissus tridentata, Calpurnia aurea, Acacia ataxacantha, Euclea natalensis, Clerodendrum glabrum, Zanthoxylum capense and Hippobromus paucifolia were strongly avoided. Goats fed between ground level and 1m, with an average feeding height of 0.67m. The diet and feeding height of kudu and goats and of black rhinoceros and goats overlapped to a large extent suggesting that they are potential competitors for food resources. Similarly, overlap in diet between giraffe and goats was extensive, but overlap in feeding height was small. The potential for competition appeared to be the least between goats and eland because, despite feeding at similar heights, they generally consumed different species. A mixed farming system which includes goats, eland and giraffe is proposed as a useful management tool for using savanna vegetation more efficiently.

The aims of this study, conducted in a severely eroded district under communal tenure, were to establish (1) how the extent and severity of soil erosion have changed over time, (2) how soil erosion varies within the district and what variables correlate with high levels of soil erosion, and (3) how the perceptions of the local people reflect the realities of degradation. Analyses of aerial photographs showed that the extent and severity of erosion increased substantially since 1950, with the area affected by erosion doubling in some areas between 1950 and 1969. Soils derived from alluvium and sedimentary rocks were more eroded than soils derived from basalt and dolerite. Flat or gently sloping areas were most severely affected by erosion. The fact that most of these areas had been ploughed and since abandoned and used for grazing livestock supports people's perception that the abandonment of cultivated land was a major factor leading to increases in severe forms of soil erosion. This suggests that interventions to prevent severe forms of soil erosion should focus on preventing ploughing of marginal land and protecting abandoned lands from grazing.",

Interference between S. plumosum and four plant species (Eragrostis curvula, Festuca arundinacea, Solanum lycopersicum and Lactuca sativa), and between mature shrubs and seedlings of S. plumosum, was investigated in the field and greenhouse. The germination of all species was suppressed (P < 0.01) by both high-concentration and low-concentration S. plumosum extracts derived from air-dried or fresh material, with fresh material having a greater effect than air-dried material on the germination of dicot species. Seeds of the grass species were less sensitive to the extract than those of the dicot species. Seriphium plumosum seeds had a mean germination of only 68% after six weeks, a dormancy period of 12 months for optimal germination and 48% germination after three years. The allelopathic potential of S. plumosum was neutralised after 10 weeks when living shrubs were removed from the soil and >15 weeks when dead plant material remained on the soil. These findings indicate that S. plumosum can inhibit the recruitment of other plant species under natural conditions.",

This study aimed at quantifying the influence of rangeland degradation on grazing behaviour of the livestock breeds in the Shinile zone of the Somali region in eastern Ethiopia. Indigenous pastoral knowledge was also used in understanding and ranking the livestock preferences. Six each of male cattle, sheep, goats and camels, with average masses of 200, 35, 30 and 220 kg, respectively, were used and randomly assigned for unrestricted grazing. Species selectivity, grazing time, grazing intensity and number of bites were recorded. Forage mass intake per animal per day was estimated through a simulated feeding trial using Panicum coloratum hay. Number, type and abundance of preferred herbaceous species, as well as selectivity by livestock species, declined with rangeland degradation. Grazing time, intensity, number of bites, forage mass and dry matter intake increased with rangeland degradation. Rangeland condition is an important determinant of grazing behaviour of livestock species, an important tool for decision making in improving grazing and rangeland management systems under arid and semi-arid conditions.

Using seasonal biomass measurements recorded between March 2000 and March 2007, we developed a model for predicting the increment in annual biomass using a regression relationship between fPAR (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the vegetation canopy) and measured standing biomass. This regression model was used to estimate the growth rates from fPAR for the period 2001–2006. During the period 2004–2007, when complete meteorological records were available, we calculated reference or potential evapotranspiration (ET0) using the Penman-Monteith equation. To approximate actual evapotranspiration (ET), we used the MODIS leaf area index to approximate canopy conductance component (G) of the Penman-Monteith equation. Using the adjusted fPAR curves as a surrogate for plant growth, and ET, we calculated a water use efficiency value for these grasslands of 7.5 ± 0.48 kg DM mm−1 ha−1 y−1.

To investigate the effect of reseeding on secondary succession and botanical diversity, various reseeding treatments of cropland restoration were established on a recently abandoned cropland at Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve. Plots combining two seed mixtures, two seeding rates and two sowing methods were monitored and evaluated. The sowing method (plough vs rip-line) had the largest influence on the suppression of relic weeds as well as possible establishment of local non-sown species. The rip-line plots, where more resources were available due to spaces between the rip-lines, initially experienced higher densities of relic weeds followed by an increase in local non-sown species densities. Hyparrhenia hirta was one of the non-sown perennials increasing in the rip-line plots. The growth of H. hirta and relic weeds was, however, controlled in the plough plots, where species densities and phytomass production of perennial sown-in species were the highest.",

Vegetation structure, species richness, composition and diversity were compared between polluted and control sites. Concentrations of arsenic, chromium, copper, lead and zinc in soils were significantly higher closer to a 99-year-old mine dump than in a control site and exceeded internationally recommended guidelines by as high as 11 times. Mine dump pollution has significantly reduced woody plant densities, species richness and diversity in the affected area due to disappearance of pollution-sensitive species and preponderance of tolerant ones. Species composition and structure of vegetation close to the mine dump significantly changed, possibly due to negative impacts of heavy metals on recruitment as pollution-sensitive species died off, whereas tolerant species invaded the vacated ecological niches. Ordination analyses confirmed a strong pollution gradient, with measured heavy metals accounting for 57.3% of the observed variation in species data, suggesting that other factors are also important determinants in the area. It is recommended that the mine dump and its surrounds should be rehabilitated and regular monitoring should be carried out to remedy the situation and arrest further pollution of the surrounding environment.

Here we describe a method for estimating tree dimensions and calculating canopy volume using a measuring staff (for calibration), a digital camera and our VolCalc software. The method requires a photograph be taken of the measuring staff placed next to an object whose measurements are to be determined. The two objects must be adjacent to one another in the photograph. For rapid analysis, multiple photographs of different objects can be taken over a short period of time using the measuring staff. The method is not limited to plants and can be used to determine, for example, browser height, height at which browsers feed, and primate resource abundance. The method has been tested in the field and provides a fast and precise tree dimension parameter estimation option, where sampling time is of the essence. Test results compare well to alternative methods currently utilised, showing improved precision and faster field data collection times, which are important to researchers and ecologists.

In contrast to the 'fabric heavy' traces of the colonial period – farmsteads and SKA dishes – those reflecting earlier human inhabitation are generally 'fabric-light' and ephemeral, with the odds stacked against their survival in the archaeological record. The Karoo also has a relatively low level of archaeological survey coverage. Yet, where studies have been conducted, research testifies to a remarkable richness in archaeological and rock art heritage, a millennia-long record of non-farming stone-tool-using people. The nineteenth-century Bleek–Lloyd archive of |Xam folklore from the region contains insights into precolonial animist perspectives on living in these landscapes, perspectives which also challenge the distinction conventionally made between 'the social' and 'the ecological'.",

    "abstract": "Although wildlife production is widely considered beneficial for semi-arid environments, few studies have reported on the long-term environmental effects of converting from livestock production to game ranching. Asante Sana Game Reserve in South Africa was stocked with domestic livestock for centuries. However, after 1996 game ranching was adopted in the reserve. We investigated the long-term (1987–2017) spatial and temporal change in vegetation productivity and type on the reserve using Landsat multispectral data and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and explored the relationship between changes in vegetation productivity and the potential drivers. The results show that while Thicket has decreased overall, it has expanded into parts of Grassland and Shrubland, and Bare-ground has expanded into parts of Shrubland and Thicket. Overall vegetation productivity increased over time, with the greatest increases in Thicket and Grazing lawn and the lowest in Shrubland and Bare-ground. Changes in rainfall, fire and stocking rates were all significant predictors of the observed changes in vegetation productivity, but rainfall had the strongest effect. This research highlights some of the complex responses that arise in semi-arid vegetation when domestic livestock production is replaced by game ranching, and points towards key issues that can be addressed by management.",

Land-use impacts were examined by comparing plant species composition within three vegetation types between sites incorporated into commonage for different lengths of time and sites outside the commonage. Results showed that thicket cover increased by 87% between 1942 and 1985 but declined by 11% between 1985 and 2004. The increase in thicket cover was highest on land where goat browsing and wood harvesting was excluded. There was a decline in thicket cover when uncontrolled goat browsing and wood harvesting were introduced. An analysis of plant species composition suggests an increase in the impact of livestock in areas closest to the urban area and with time since inclusion into commonage. Such areas exhibited greater cover of Increaser II grasses and dwarf shrubs in the herbaceous layer and lower cover of succulents within subtropical thicket. We interpret the decline in thicket cover and shift to a less palatable and less productive vegetation as resulting from the open-access land use system that has prevailed on the commonage since 1994.",

In DPBS, phosphorus and potassium contents were highest (P  0.05) on approaching dip-tanks. In all soils, forb and perennial grass abundances showed significant differences but there were no significant trends with distance. These variables are not sufficiently sensitive to form gradients or the gradient is diminished with heavy grazing. In DPBS, the canonical correspondence analysis showed negative correlation of distance with bareness, the abundance of Aristida rhiniochloa and Cynodon dactylon, which may suggest these variables may respond to grazing gradients around dip-tanks, but this pattern was not established on the other soil types. Therefore, caution is required in drawing conclusions of the piosphere effect around focal points. The abundance of highly palatable species was low except for Panicum maximum in DPBS. It is concluded that vegetation and soil changes are driven by abiotic (site and soil) and biotic (livestock) factors that have different influences at different scales. Therefore, any rangeland utilisation and management program should consider these drivers.",

Rangeland condition was assessed in different vegetation units of the area and woody plant density was related to distance from urban settlement. Results showed that there has been an increase in woody plant cover in both commonage and commercial farming areas, particularly between 1949 and 1985. However, since 1985, increased rates of urbanisation have stabilised, and in some areas reduced, woody plant thickening, especially at locations closest to urban settlements. Bush encroachment is being controlled to some extent by fuelwood harvesting and goat browsing, resulting in a reduction in height of favoured woody species such as Acacia karroo (Vachellia karroo). There has been a shift to less palatable browse species on the commonage areas and the condition of the grass sward is poor. Change in woody plant cover is significantly influenced by changing patterns of land use and land tenure over time which, in turn, affect rangeland condition.",

To better understand the influence of this practice on the grass community, we determined grass species diversity, richness, biomass and quality (crude protein, fibre, rumen fermentation and metabolisable energy) from a chronosequence consisting of kraals abandoned 1, 2, 3 and 4 years prior to the study and compared them to the surrounding vegetation. Grass species diversity, richness, biomass and quality were higher in abandoned kraals than the surrounding vegetation. Grass biomass increased five-fold in the first year of kraal abandonment and thereafter declined three-fold after four years. Metabolisable energy, a measure of grass nutritive value, increased from 8.92 to 11.90 MJ kg−1 with kraaling. The number of grass species also increased with kraaling. Palatable grass species, such as Urochloa mosambicensis and Panicum maximum, were more abundant in abandoned kraal sites than the surrounding vegetation. We conclude that short-duration overnight cattle kraaling improves grass quality and biomass.",

For shrubs and intermediate growth forms (between shrubs and trees), mineral levels except potassium (K) and zinc (Zn) were influenced (p < 0.05) by height × species interactions. Most browse species had calcium (Ca) contents (8.5–50 g kg-1) above the required levels, with the majority of the species having Ca beyond the maximum tolerable limit. Most browse plants had sufficient K, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, iron and Zn concentrations to meet the requirements for ruminants. Copper was deficient in many browse leaves, thus supplementation should be considered in winter. We conclude that such knowledge is essential for sustainable use of browses as mineral supplements, especially during critical periods when climatic conditions limit the feed value of grasses.",

After 90 d of ensiling, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) became the dominant microorganisms in silages. The silage from soft dough sorghum exhibited the highest LAB counts, water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) and crude protein content. In addition, silage presented greater quality with higher (p < 0.05) lactic acid content and lower (p < 0.05) pH and ammonia nitrogen levels than those at hard dough stage and stover. The WSC and LAB were the important factors affecting silage fermentation and the addition of LAB and cellulase improved fermentation quality. The combined additives displayed a synergistic effect and when silage is prepared with sorghum at soft dough stage, it has best potential for controlling spoilage microorganisms and preserving the silage quality for animal feed.",

The soil characteristics such as soil carbon and clay content were strongly associated with variation in rainfall, and contributed to improved rangeland condition characterised by high herbaceous biomass and low bush encroachment. Livestock grazing management systems do not impact soil and vegetation properties differently as indicators of degradation are observed in both grazing systems.

Sodic patches of semi-arid savannas are considered ‘nutrient hotspots’ by producing high-quality forage. The impact of biomass reduction (due to overgrazing) and accumulation (in the absence of herbivores) on herbaceous species richness and diversity is still unknown for these hotspots. We tested the relationship between biomass and herbaceous species richness/diversity in savanna sodic sites across varying biomass levels obtained through different herbivore exclosures. LOWESS and quadratic regression analyses revealed a unimodal species richness/ diversity–biomass relationship for biomass <2 500 kg ha−1. Species richness and diversity in the sodic zone peaked at 1 300 kg ha−1, followed by a steady decline. At biomass levels exceeding 2 500 kg ha−1, i.e. where herbivores have been excluded for 10 years, the decline in species richness and diversity stabilised. Despite many debates surrounding unimodal relationships and the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, this study confirmed a peak in species richness and diversity at intermediate biomass levels in a herbivory-adapted ecosystem. Herbivores drive ecosystem heterogeneity and enhance herbaceous species richness and diversity by keeping biomass at intermediate levels (i.e. <2 500 kg ha−1 for this sodic site).Keywords: fireherbaceous vegetationherbivorysodic patchesunimodal",

Thinning was completed during 1989 and measurements done annually from 1990 to 1995 and again during 2008. Absolute tree densities (plants ha−1) increased in the low tree density plots, whereas in the high tree density plots the tree densities declined. Changes in leaf phytomass of the C. mopane trees were more pronounced than changes in absolute tree densities and growth of the remaining trees mainly occurred as increases in canopy diameter, rather than increases in tree height. Growth of established trees displayed an exponential increase in growth with declining tree density demonstrating the suppressive effect of inter-tree competition on the growth of individual trees. A trend towards an equilibrium appears to exist where some self thinning occurred in the dense plots, opposed to increases in the number and size of trees in the thinned plots.

Fire-breaks were changing the species composition, as three of the four communities illustrated a clear separation in species composition between fire-break and unburnt plots. There was not a strong association between specific species and the fire-break or unburnt plots, except for Themeda triandra and Tristachya leucothrix, known for their association with and without fire, respectively. The change in species composition was not negatively affecting range condition.

This study used the social-ecological systems framework to examine how pastoral mobility in the semi-arid, montane communal rangeland in South Africa adapted to the changing socio-political landscape. It analysed the impact of apartheid and democratic era legislation and policies over the past 70 years. Apartheid legislation promoted betterment planning and the privatisation of communal lands by awarding access to most of the grazing areas to a few wealthier pastoralists. This led to increased stocking densities and further restriction of herd mobility when the majority of herds were restricted to fewer grazing camps. Democratic era land reform policies continue to advocate for the modernisation and sedentarisation of pastoral practices. The persistence of mobility among livestock keepers despite discriminatory policy interventions suggests that this is a particularly resilient and necessary element of their practices. We argue that agricultural legislation and policies regarding livestock farming should promote landscape connectivity to allow mobile pastoralists to access variable resources. Connected landscapes should be viewed as alternative ways to modernising pastoralism and these should prevent elite capture when the land is subdivided.",

This study aimed to determine changes in the fire regimes of South Africa’s grassy biomes over the past century in response to widespread human-induced changes. Using spatially explicit data, we employed random forest models to examine the importance of climatic and human drivers on the extent, frequency and intensity of fire. We then modelled how fire regimes are likely to have changed over the past century using historical trends in key human drivers (population growth, livestock density, road density and land cover change) as inputs. Results showed that human drivers, particularly land transformation and human population density, were important determinants of fire regime. Random forest predictions showed a decline in burnt area (mean of 10.5% in 1910 to 5.1% in 2020), and a shift to fire regimes with smaller burnt areas, longer fire return intervals and lower intensity fires over the past century, particularly in the mesic east. These dynamics have important implications for our understanding of the widespread increases in woody cover observed in the region over this period.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the correlates of stocking rate in the Leliefontein communal reserve and attempt to provide a mechanistic explanation of the controlling factors. We further speculate on how high stocking rates are maintained in relation to the current state of the rangeland and grazing practices in the region. Stepwise regression revealed that over 80% of the variance in stocking rate could be explained by the mean maximum temperature during the hottest month, February. Deeper investigation revealed that the proximity of the West Coast played an important role in moderating temperature across the reserve. Areas further inland were not only hotter in summer, but were also colder in winter. We speculate that despite large differences in rainfall, the temperature gradient results in a shorter growing season and hence lower productivity of areas further inland. Mean annual rainfall was a very poor predictor of stocking rate and explained less than 5% of the variance in stocking rate across the reserve. Within a single village district, the stocking rate over time was, however, correlated with rainfall over the same period, indicating that stocking rates are determined by primary productivity and are at, or close to, the ecologioal carrying capacity. We further argue that continuous grazing of the lowlands during the growing season has resulted in the lowlands becoming dominated by annuals and unpalatable shrubs. Due to the shallow-rooted nature of annuals, the vegetation has become more sensitive to temperature effects. The reliability and seasonality of the rainfall in Namaqualand are seen as important factors contributing to the seasonal abundance of annuals and the viability of the current grazing system in the region.",

Tripteris sinuatum and Tetragoma froticosa were investigated on heavily grazed communal and lightly grazed commercial rangeland in the succulent karoo, Namaqualand. Seed production in both these species was substantially reduced on the communal rangeland relative to the commercial rangeland. Seed production in T. sinuatum was most severely affected, with seed production on the communal rangeland two orders of magnitude lower than on the commercial rangeland. The proportion of T. sinuatum and T. froticosa shrubs growing unassociated with other shrubs on the communal rangeland was reduced by approximately 50%. Lycium ferocissimum was most effective as a refuge plant for T. sinuatum in terms of the mean seed production per plant. Ruschia robusta was however most important in terms of the overall amount of seed produced by T. sinuatum and T. froticosa on the communal rangeland, due to the large number of times this association occurred. Refuge plants did not appear to be particularly important for T. froticosa in terms of seed production, but were important in terms of providing safe sites for recruitment. The results of this study suggest that unpalatable or thorny species such as L. ferocissimum play an important role in providing refuge sites for palatable species that might otherwise become entirely lost from overgrazed rangelands.",

We compared the influence of four drought response strategies on herd number, milk yield, cost and net present value for a communal cattle herd over the period 1983 to 2001 using a simulation modelling approach. The strategies were (1) no reaction to drought; (2) moving stock to areas not affected by drought; (3) purchasing replacement stock after the drought; and (4) supplementing stock during the drought with sugar‐cane residues. Moving, buying or feeding stock generated greater milk yields and net benefits relative to no drought response, but at considerably greater cost. Cost:benefit was greatest where a small proportion of female stock (10 percent) were moved. By doing nothing in the face of regional drought, communal graziers may be acting rationally, given the constraints under which they operate. The study reveals that simulation modelling may provide a useful basis from which to assess the outcome of various management strategies for communal graziers, and for integrating the disparate suite of influences which drive decision‐making on communal lands.

These recommendations are seldom adopted. Recent scientific evidence has facilitated the adoption of certain principles in new practical, economically viable recommendations aimed at maintaining or improving the resource while facilitating good animal performance. These are based on the principles that defoliation, particularly by sheep, is detrimental to the vigour of the preferred species and that extended rests are necessary as compensation. Recommendations are aimed at optimal utilisation of veld burnt in spring after a full growing season rest. This is followed by compensatory rests every alternate year with sheep alone or use by cattle for one or two years, depending on sheepxattle ratios, followed by a full season rest. Rested veld utilised during the dormant season is an important feed source. Additional keywords: Cattlegrazing systemsrange managementsheepsheepxattle ratios",

The vigour of veld grazed by sheep declined rapidly relative to veld grazed by cattle. The vigour of palatable species was severely impacted, vigour of intermediate species was variably impacted and vigour of unpalatable species increased dramatically on veld grazed by sheep. Similar trends occurred in veld grazed by cattle, but to a lesser degree. Resting was beneficial for vigour recovery in both sheep and cattle treatments but it seems that the grazing treatment between rests has an over-riding influence on veld vigour.

Organic matter content, pH, mineral nitrogen, total nitrogen, mineralisable nitrogen, resin extractable phosphorus, total phosphorus and mineralisable phosphorus were determined in soils from open and subcanopy positions and in soils from sites with increasing tree density. In bioassays Panicum maximum growth, phosphorus content, mycorrhizal infection levels and mycorrhizal dependence were studied. A positive influence of isolated trees, in this case Acacia sieberana, on soil fertility and mineralisation was found, causing increased plant growth independent of possible differences in microclimate between open and subcanopy positions. At higher tree densities, differences in soil nutrient levels were not related to position under tree canopies and levels of nutrients appear to increase. No influence of isolated trees on arbuscular mycorrhizal abundance was found. Mycorrhizas enhanced growth and phosphorus uptake of Panicum maximum.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the compositional stability of Highland Sourveld in response to fire and grazing by wildlife (Coleford Nature Reserve) and by cattle on three properties over 20-25 years. A limited amount of compositional change took place except on a property stocked 1.5 times as heavily as the others, but no species were lost. In general, Decreaser species decreased and Increaser 2 species increased, although individual species of a group did not show a consistent pattern of change in abundance. Consistent heavy grazing favoured mtshiki species (Sporobolus africanus, Eragrostis plana), stoloniferous species (Paspalum notatum) and Alloteropsis semialata. The extent of compositional change was least at an intermediate (0.4 versus 0.1-0.75AU ha-1) stocking density. Clovelly soils were prone to twice as much change as Hutton or Mispah soils. On lands abandoned for >50 years, the dominant E. curvula declined by two thirds and small amounts of characteristic Highland Sourveld species established. Infrequent burning (every six years) resulted in twice as much compositional change as annual burning. Ordination techniques revealed three main groups of species, in terms of their amount and direction of change, identifiable with the Increaser-Decreaser classification. Important contradictions were, however, evident, such as a similar response for the Decreaser Themeda triandra and the Increaser 2 Diheteropogon filifolius, indicating review of this classification is warranted for the Highland Sourveld. Changes in composition reflected changes in grass diversity (evenness, species richness, Shannon-Weaver diversity). Heavy grazing increased evenness, hence Shannon-Weaver diversity, through reducing the mono-dominance of T. triandra. Grazing-induced changes in grassland composition may therefore reflect the conservation status of grasslands.",

    "abstract": "A two-year study was conducted with an overall objective of characterising the structure and function of an arid rangeland in Kenya. A plot measuring 100 × 100m was used for this study. Data on rainfall and temperature were recorded at the plot site whereas data on evaporation rates and relative humidity were obtained from the meteorological office near the study site. Herbaceous aboveground material was sampled at monthly intervals using a rectangular 0.25m2 quadrat frame. Clipped material was separated by species and classified dead or live by physical examination. A 5cm diameter metal soil corer was used to sample belowground plant material, at monthly intervals. The sampled material was washed with running water over 2mm sieves and classified dead or live using the vital staining technique. All weights and calculations were based on organic weight. Total aboveground standing crop ranged from 84.6g m−2 to 295.4g m−2, with a mean of 162.3 ± 60.6g m−2. Mean monthly aboveground standing crop for 1992 and 1993 was 142.8 ± 53.8 and 178.5 ± 63.3g m−2 respectively. The two values were significantly different (p<0.10). Aboveground biomass yield ranged from 17.7g m−2 to 242.7g m−2, with a mean of 104.3 ± 58g m−2 and a coefficient of variation of 58%. Mean aboveground standing crop was 59 ± 24g m−2 Monthly values ranged from 28.8g m−2 to 120g m−2, with a 38% coefficient of variation. The range for total belowground standing crop was from 83.3g m−2 to 232.7g m−2, and a mean of 155.2 ± 46g m−2. The values had a coefficient of variation of 30%. Mean total monthly belowground plant material yield for 1992 and 1993 was 137.6 ± 41g m−2 and 169.9 ± 46g m−2 The coefficients of variation were 59% and 28% respectively. The mean monthly belowground biomass yield was 51.6 ± 33g m−2 with a coefficient of variation of 64%. Mean monthly yield for belowground dead material was 103.7 ± 32g m−2, with a coefficient of variation of 31%. There was no significant difference (p>0.01) in the mean belowground dead material yield between 1992 and 1993. In 1992, annual NPP was 439.2g m−2, giving a net primary productivity of 1.22g m−2day−l. Monthly NPP ranged from 17.2g m−2 to 90.1g m−2 In 1993, annual NPP was 944.5g m−2, equivalent to a net primary productivity of 2.62g m−2 day−1. Monthly NPP was between 27.4g m−2 and 548.6g m−2. Over the 1992–1993 period, NPP was 1 383.7g m−2, equivalent to a productivity of 1.92g m−2day−1. Trends in monthly NPP closely followed the trend in rainfall. On the whole, herbaceous vegetation production and productivity were episodic in nature and closely linked to rainfall.

    "abstract": "Tropical rangelands across the world are experiencing land use intensification pressures which are reducing the spatial scale of grazing management units. There are implications of a reduction in scale on environmental heterogeneity and its relationship with secondary production of large herbivores, and on the consequent risks of land degradation. Rangeland managers find it hard to conceptualise these implications and there has been little research to clarify them in the past. This paper will review our current understanding of scale-related effects on livestock production in tropical rangelands and herbivore-plant interactions at patch to landscape scales. We use published information and results from recent empirical studies in northern Australia and elsewhere to elucidate scale-related effects on secondary production. These results indicate that empirical approaches alone will not provide all the understanding necessary for better management of extensive grazing lands that are undergoing intensification and that modelling approaches are important in helping to understand underlying mechanisms driving observed changes. Such modelling approaches need to encompass rangeland systems as complex, adaptive systems where socio-economic factors are just as important as biophysical understanding. We use a conceptual J-curve model to help explain how fragmentation and intensification affects the socio-ecological dynamics of arid and semi-arid grazing lands.",

Ordination analyses showed that fenced plots did not develop a fundamentally different successional trajectory from open plots over time. There were also no significant differences in species richness, plant cover and grazing capacity between fenced and open plots in all vegetation types. This lack of indigenous herbivore impact is ascribed to the relatively low stocking rates that were maintained on SWR during most of the study period. Species richness, plant cover and grazing capacity also did not differ significantly between years in all vegetation types except for the highly disturbed Old Land sites. The existing monitoring programme provides a useful tool for assessing the impact of indigenous herbivores and should be supported at local and provincial levels.",

Patch-mosaic burning met with the expectation of creating a more heterogeneous fire regime as evidenced by a four-fold increase in average fire frequency, a greater area of reserve burnt per annum, an increase in the perimeter-to-area ratio of individual burns, and a greater proportion of fires occurring throughout the dry season as opposed to being concentrated toward the end of the dry season. In contradiction of expectation, size of individual burns did not differ between strategies, both periods were characterised by intense fires, and natural barriers to fire did not increase in importance under PMB. There was a reduced importance of arson fires and a markedly increased proportion of prescribed burns under PMB. Patch-mosaic burning has met in part its objective of creating a more heterogeneous fire regime.",

This study was conducted to investigate the nutritional characteristics of grasses collected from two grazing areas (Big Bend and Simunye), which differed mainly in soil types. Mature grass species were harvested and evaluated for chemical composition (organic matter, neutral detergent fibre [NDF], acid detergent fibre [ADF], crude protein [CP] and minerals) and in vitro ruminal fermentation (in vitro gas production, in vitro organic matter degradability and partitioning factors). The most common grass species in the Big Bend grazing area were Bothriochloa insculpta, Cenchrus ciliaris and Urochloa mosambicensis. In the Simunye grazing area the most common species were B. insculpta, U. mosambicensis, Heteropogon contortus, Panicum deustum and P. maximum. For grasses harvested from Simunye, the most (P < 0.05) degradable (532 mg g−1 dry matter) was B. insculpta, which also had the least fibre (597 g kg−1 NDF and 351 g kg−1 ADF) and the highest CP content (79.8 g kg−1). The most common grass species harvested from the Big Bend area did not differ (P > 0.05) in their Mg, P, Cu, Fe, Zn, CP and NDF content. However, U. mosambicensis had the highest (P < 0.05) ADF content. The least fermentation efficiency (partitioning factor = 2.2 mg degradable organic matter [DOM] ml−1 gas) was observed for U. mosambicensis as a result of low DOM coupled with high cumulative gas production. It was concluded that all the grasses investigated in this study show a deficit for Ca, P and protein. Therefore, supplementation is needed to ensure maximum forage utilisation and to satisfy nutrient requirements of ruminant livestock.

Both E. curvula and T. triandra increased linearly in biomass with increasing levels of the slow-release fertiliser, achieving similar maximum biomass (75 g vs 71 g, respectively) at the highest level of the slow-release fertiliser. However, only E. curvula peaked at the highest level of the rapid-release fertiliser, whereas T. triandra did not show any increase in biomass beyond 15 g m−2 of N supplied by the rapid-release fertiliser. This resulted in considerably less biomass achieved by T. triandra under the rapid- than slow-release fertilizer (29 g vs 71 g, respectively) and in comparison to the maximum biomass of E. curvula under the rapid-release fertiliser (29 g vs 87 g, respectively). Thus, T. triandra was intolerant of high concentrations of N. This has implications for choosing the correct type of fertiliser according to the objectives of an experiment and for understanding the response of these grasses to fire, mowing, grazing and fertilisation.

If the new land use is discontinued, many original species will not recolonise the area, necessitating their reintroduction for rehabilitation purposes. One method is to fragment local grass tufts into tillers and plant these into the degraded area. This project determined the survival and growth rates of various grass species planted into a recently cleared pine plantation near Nottingham Road, South Africa. Tufts of twelve grass species were collected locally, fragmented, kept on a mist bed for four weeks, and planted. Plants from all species were alive after nine months, although the average survival rate varied between species (from 92% for Eragrostis curvula to 39% for E. racemosa). Tuft area differed between species. The often-invasive species E. curvula had the highest average survival rate and the largest tuft area. The often-dominant, unpalatable Aristida junciformis demonstrated surprisingly low survival and growth rates. Themeda triandra and Tristachya leucothrix, species often dominating good-condition native grasslands, had average survival rates of 82% and 65%, respectively. This study indicates that tuft fragmentation and replanting is a useful way to re-establish locally extinct grass species into transformed habitats, but that success rates are species-specific.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of previous cultivation on regeneration potential under miombo woodlands in a resettlement area, a spatial product of Zimbabwe's land reforms. We predicted that cultivation would affect population structure, regeneration, recruitment and potential grazing capacity of rangelands. Plant attributes for Julbernadia globiflora and Brachystegia spiciformis were measured in previously cultivated and uncultivated sites making up rangelands of the scheme. Their population structure showed a high regeneration potential with different recruitment mechanisms, either coppicing or seedling emergence. Brachystegia spiciformis populations had more adult trees, and its saplings were more abundant in uncultivated sites while regeneration on cultivated sites was mainly from coppices. Julbernadia globiflora had fewer adult trees but high seedling and sapling densities, especially on cultivated sites, while coppicing was low and more common on uncultivated sites. This suggests that cultivation would favour vigorous recruitment of J. globiflora, while B. spiciformis would become more abundant in the absence of cultivation. This varying recruitment of the two woody species is likely to modify and influence state-and-transition dynamics in a miombo woodland, thus affecting the resultant tree population structure and grass biomass yield and quality.",

Most Rhizobium was detected between a SOC content of 2.03% to 3.80% in both inoculated and non-inoculated soils. Inoculation increased the number of rhizobia in soil. Most N was fixed in the soil with the lowest SOC content. Although the amount of N fixed increased as the level of SOC decreased, the efficiency of N fixation decreased proportionally to SOC. Subsequently, more N was rhizodeposited. It was concluded that symbiotic rhizobia introduced by the inoculant were more efficient than free-living rhizobia in soils with higher carbon content, which highlights the importance of inoculation in improving the sustainable production of T. repens pastures.",

Grazing by sheep may indirectly affect web spider populations by changing vegetation structures available for web construction, or directly by trampling the spiders or their webs. We tested these two potential impacts by surveying spiders along transects and found that web spider abundance was 52% lower in a sheep grazing area compared with inside the adjacent Tierberg-LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) sheep exclosure. This reduction in web-spider abundance could be due to the 10% lower shrub cover in the sheep pasture than in the exclosure. Further support for the hypothesis that web spider abundance is affected by shrub cover came from spider abundance being higher on densely vegetated mounds, termed heuweltjies, than in the surrounding shrub matrix in both the exclosure and the sheep pasture, with heuweltjies showing cross-fence differences, consistent with grazing impacts. In addition, there may be a direct effect of trampling, as suggested by experimental removal of webs. By depressing spider populations, sheep grazing may affect a number of ecological factors, such as trophic relationships or nutrient cycling.",

    "abstract": "Intensive rotational grazing systems (also called cell grazing, holistic grazing or time-controlled grazing) are often implemented to improve production and environmental outcomes. Over recent years there has been considerable interpretation and adaption of the holistic principles that guide the management of these systems. In southern Australia, this has led to an increasing use of longer rest periods for intensive rotational grazing. This experiment was established to compare three intensive rotational grazing strategies (fast rotation [FR], average 57-day rest; slow rotation [SR], average 114-day rest; and flexible grazing [FX], based on availability of green herbage mass) with continuous grazing (CG) to assess the impact these systems have on vegetation and diet quality. The grazing treatments were run across three production zones (PZs) in the landscape (low [LPZ], medium [MPZ] and high [HPZ]) to determine whether management by landscape interactions influenced vegetation. Pasture composition was mostly influenced by PZ in the landscape with Microlaena stipoides and Holcus lanatus more prevalent in the HPZ and Rytidosperma spp. more common in the LPZ. The intensive rotational grazing treatments all had greater herbage mass and ground cover than CG. Composition change often occurred in one PZ and not another (e.g. Hypochaeris radicata increased with SR in the LPZ), or there were contrasting effects in different parts of the landscape (e.g. M. stipoides increased with FR compared with CG in the HPZ but decreased in the LPZ). Diet quality was lower for the SR compared with the other grazing treatments. Maintaining a post-grazing benchmark of >0.5 t green DM ha−1 was associated with a higher diet quality. Based on this two-and-a-half-year study run during poor seasons, it can be concluded that intensive rotational grazing can be managed, with fast and flexible rotations, to achieve per head animal performance similar to CG, but with higher herbage mass, ground cover and a desirable pasture composition.",

Three groups were selected (large group, adult pair and solitary male). Resting, moving, grazing, vigilance and other behaviours were recorded during two seasons (dry and wet) and in the morning and the afternoon. In addition, faecal samples were collected. The results indicate that season and day period were the main factors affecting the activity budgets. The resting behaviour increased from the wet to the dry season, and from morning to afternoon. The grazing and moving behaviours increased during the wet season and decreased from morning to afternoon. Addax select a mixed diet composed of perennial and herbaceous plant species notably during the wet season. In addition, we observed that addax modify their behaviour according to the season and forage availability.

Its environment and people have experienced considerable changes, and now face new challenges as the Anthropocene unfolds. This Karoo Special Issue (KSI) brings together new information in 20 papers, a mixture of reviews, research articles and commentaries, significantly adding to previous syntheses of Karoo knowledge. The KSI comprises several sections focusing on different aspects of change, namely a lead article that provides an overview of social and environmental changes, followed by papers concerning changes over time from deep history to contemporary conditions (Xhaeruh to Karoo), insights from long-term studies at several sites across the area, different perspectives of ecosystem processes, and ending with a set of reflections and proposals for research priorities. We end this introduction by dedicating the KSI to two outstanding scholars of the Karoo: Dr Suzanne J Milton and Dr W Richard J Dean. These KSI papers, many of which were written by their colleagues, friends and former students, represents a Festschrift that celebrates and honours their research as well as the inspiration and leadership they gave to a generation of scientists.",

    "abstract": "The paper agrees with three fundamental points raised by Vetter (in this issue), whilst highlighting an emerging trend in wildlife land use, which should be considered in policy making. Firstly, the paper supports the argument that communal rangelands are important as objects of biodiversity conservation and, secondly, the argument that livestock production alone is not sufficient as a mechanism for alleviating poverty, but rather livelihoods diversification and multisectoral strategies are required for this purpose. Lastly, the paper supports the need for mechanisms to ensure tenure security for sustainable use of communal rangelands. I argue that the historical shift to wildlife land use previously observed on private farms in South Africa is now inevitable on communal rangelands and will require explicit consideration in the policy on communal rangelands. Although such development in the communal rangelands has potential to meet the important goals of livelihoods diversification as indicated by Vetter, it also has potential to threaten existing rural livelihoods. The paper suggests several issues to be considered as wildlife becomes part of the rural landscape in some areas, in addition to issues raised by Vetter relevant to policy making.",

    "abstract": "The ingression of woody plants into savannas, known as bush or shrub encroachment, has become a global concern. Fire has been acknowledged as a key factor in managing woody vegetation in savannas. This study assessed the role of fire in determining the total density, structure and composition of woody vegetation in Ithala Game Reserve, northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed woody vegetation in comparable areas with different fire frequencies. In Combretum-dominated woodlands, there was no significant effect of fire frequency on the total density of woody individuals. In old field grasslands, the density of woody plants was greater in areas burnt annually and in areas burnt once every 10 years, compared to areas burnt once every 2–4 years. In these grasslands, areas burnt annually were dominated by woody plants <2 m in height. Herbivore and fire interactions may explain these results. Multivariate analyses also indicated a significant effect of fire frequency on woody vegetation composition. To control dominant encroaching trees such as Dichrostachys cinerea and Acacia karroo (Vachellia karroo), and the development of macrophyllous thickets, an intermediate fire frequency is required (one burn every 2–4 years).",

    "abstract": "In the Nama-Karoo, South Africa, rainfall and grazing by livestock are two important drivers of botanical composition. Summer rains are advantageous particularly to the grass layer, whereas the characteristic dwarf shrubs survive better than grasses during drought, and benefit from rainfall during cool months. Heavy grazing by livestock during summer reduces the abundance of grasses, whereas winter grazing increases it. This study examined the influences of season of grazing (summer vs winter) and rainfall on botanical composition at two long-term grazing trials at Grootfontein in the eastern Karoo from 1949 to 1967. Severe summer grazing strongly reduced grass abundance and slightly increased the abundance of both palatable and unpalatable dwarf shrubs. High previous-season rainfall strongly promoted short-lived grasses. Dwarf shrubs and grasses declined in response to a decline in annual rainfall over the study period, except for the creeping grass Tragus koelerioides that increased in abundance, possibly in response to decreased competition and an increase in available gaps in the vegetation layer. Results indicate that grazing systems that exclude repeated summer-only grazing maintain ecological health, and that rainfall is the main driver of composition unless extreme grazing systems are employed.",

Despite growing interest in this arena, there are still surprisingly few studies that examine rural customary management of pastoral communities in East Africa. This is striking given that this region is an exemplary area for pastoralism and thus ideal for communal systems such as commons. Deficient studies and political support in this area could be linked to widespread prejudice of branding pastoralism as perilous to the environment. We set out to conduct a study to examine and test pastoralists’ customary norms that underpin environmental sustainability/unsustainabity of pastoral commons focusing on Mwanda-Marungu, in Taita hills, Kenya where the first author originates and brought up as a pastoralist up to the age of 24. Through ethnographic approaches and semi-open interviews to 193 respondents conducted in 2019–2021 during water and pasture stress during the dry months of July–October, we examined whether customary governance of Mwanda-Marungu would offer sustainable model that conforms to the IUCN’s Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs). Our study showed that pastoral communities in this area have been developing inventive measures for generations that improve good management and ecological protection. These may be tied to the principles of OECMs which contests the misconception about pastoralism.",

    "abstract": "AbstractKnowledge about how pastoralism and kraaling may contribute to desired global objectives, such as soil fertility, is in danger of being lost. We tested whether short duration kraaling increases soil fertility across various biomes and countries via a meta-analysis (random effects model, n = 12 studies). Kraaling approximately doubled soil concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and slightly increased pH compared to non-kraaled areas (p ≤ 0.0158, all meta-analyses). Results support the idea of persistent nutrient hotspots post kraal abandonment as a generalizable phenomenon. Anecdotes from a case study, the Herding 4 Health Model, supported findings. However, inconsistency scores (I2 ≥ 90%) indicated that while the average effect size was positive, in some cases the true outcome may in fact be negative. Kraal age did not predict soil fertility in our analysis, possibly due to coarse time intervals. Some studies nevertheless found kraal age to be important, with relatively immobile elements such as P persisting over time while N and K decreased. Using kraals to achieve 'desirable states' such as wildlife-livestock coexistence, land restoration, and crop fertilisation will require monitoring, and maintenance of fertility within ecological bounds, ideally with inputs from scientists and pastoralists alike as part of global partnerships.Keywords: herdingmeta-analysisnutrient hotspotspastoralismrangelands",

As a solution, drones have emerged as a promising tool capable of collecting low-altitude images over expansive areas with minimal effort and cost. Here, we explore the potential of low-cost drone images to estimate the rangeland biomass, and quality of the Sahelian rangeland ecosystem. Model calibration and validation were conducted using a random forest machine learning algorithm, where the response variables were field vegetation samples, and the explanatory variables were derived from drone image outputs. A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to explore the multivariate relationships between drone-derived vegetation indices and field-measured biomass and quality attributes. In the validation datasets, the random forest model exhibited relative root mean squared errors (RRMSE) of 31% for fresh mass and 37% for dry mass. The random forest model demonstrated a relatively high prediction accuracy, yielding RRMSE values of 32% for crude protein, 9% for neutral detergent fibre, 8% for acid detergent fibre, and 17% for organic matter digestibility contents. The PCA revealed that the first two components explained 53.3% of the total variance. Overall, these results showed that red, green and blue (RGB) images acquired from low-cost drones can be used to estimate rangeland biomass and quality.",

Emphasis is placed on how these may be influenced by tree clearing, either through exploitation or through deliberate actions aimed at reducing the suppressive effect of an increase in woody plant density on the production of the herbaceous layer. A diverse range of aspects, related to the dynamics of the woody component of savannas, had received attention in the literature. It has contributed to some understanding of the nature and dynamics of the vegetative growth, reproduction and browse production (including animal‐plant interactions) of woody plants in various savanna ecosystems. It has also demonstrated the complexity and heterogeneity of the different savanna ecosystems. Gaps in our knowledge, linked to specific options of land use, were identified. Within the context of the importance of woody plants, some recommendations on future research in savanna are made.",

However, the demarcation of the MRA may be inappropriate because it ignores recent changes in the transhumance system which threatens to cause greater degradation of the grasslands in the subalpine belt, particularly in the lower subalpine zone. In response to a variety of ecological and social factors, Basotho have modified the transhumance system by establishing winter grazing posts in this zone which lies between the summer grazing post areas in the subalpine zone and the alpine belt and the villages. The former areas are now used more intensively than the latter areas, thereby increasing the potential for greater degradation in the lower subalpine than in the upper subalpine zone and in the alpine belt. It is argued that the conservationist perspective, by which the MRA was demarcated needs to be broadened to include these lower valleys in view of these ecological dynamics.

These extensive, flat, infertile grasslands experience seasonal floods. Although summer droughts are usual, grasses maintain productivity during the entire year and produce almost 6 t ha‐1 a‐1. Continuous grazing has caused deterioration of these grasslands in terms of floristic composition and soil properties (salinisation). Stocking rate has been adversely affected. Controlled grazing systems have been applied with the objective of preventing deterioration. The main characteristics of this system are the concentration of animals in large herds, non‐selective grazing of dormant vegetation during autumn and winter, and selective grazing during spring and summer. Rotational grazing ensures adequate rest for grazed plants and promotes tillering and establishment of cool season grasses. A system of controlled grazing has shown an improvement in floristic composition and in animal production, despite no increase in primary production. This system should allow for a sustainable utilization of these grasslands.",

Preference utilisation ratio of species was estimated for each of cattle and sheep, from the proportion of each species found in the diet relative to the proportion of the species found in the forage on offer. A microhistological technique was applied to oesophageal fistula samples to determine the proportion of each species found in the diet. Grazing values and grazing index were determined from the production and preference utilisation ratio of species. Where grazing values of species were determined subjectively in the past, in this study species were objectively classified based on estimated grazing values. Meaningful relationships between rangeland condition and grazing capacity were determined, along a degradation gradient, with the long-term coefficient of forecasting more than 75%.

    "abstract": "Abstract A range inventory and condition study was conducted in three altitude zones: lowland (1500-1700m), medium altitude (1700-2000m), and highland (2000-2500m). Each altitude zone was stratified into four or five important grazing areas. One area represented lightly grazed government ranches or parks which were used as benchmarks, another area represented the seasonal grazing areas with an intermediate grazing pressure and the remaining were the heavily grazed roadsides, lakeshores and other communal grazing lands. The range condition assessment was based on the composition of the herbaceous layer, basal cover, litter cover, relative number of seedlings, age distribution of grasses, soil erosion and soil compaction. Dry matter was sampled in the mid-wet season to assess the relationship between available dry matter and range condition. A total of 36 grass species, 3 legume species, 2 sedge species, 15 other herbs and 31 species of trees were identified. The palatable Cenchrus ciliaris was dominant in the benchmarks and seasonally grazed areas of the lowland while Hyparrhenia spp. dominated in the same areas of the medium altitude. Cynodon dactylon, and the non-palatable Eleusine floccifolia and Pennisetum schimperi were dominant on heavily grazed areas of the lowland, medium altitude and highland, respectively. The total score for range condition of the benchmarks (34 out of 50 points), was significantly higher than that of the seasonally grazed areas (26), the heavily grazed communal grazing areas (19), roadsides (16) and lakeshores (17) (P<0.05). The highlands showed a higher score for benchmarks and seasonally grazed areas only. There was a significant linear relationship between available dry matter of grasses and range condition (excluding unpalatable pioneer grasses, r2 = 0.56, P<0.01). Seasonally grazed areas were identified as key sites for pasture improvement since these are privately owned and managed. Pasture improvement will reduce the grazing pressure on the heavily grazed roadsides, lakeshores and other communally grazed areas.

The conservation status of these food plants was also assessed. The diet of goats included a wide variety of plant species. A total of 87 species were recorded to be eaten by goats during winter within the National Park while 39 species were completely ignored. In this study, goats preferred herbaceous food plants. The foliage of woody browse and leaf-succulent plants became important in sites where forbs were limited. A total of 13 plant species in the diet of goats were considered to be principal food plants. Of the 32 species that were preferred, 19 species were intermediate whilst 13 species were highly preferred. The majority of plant species in the diet of goats are considered to be of low conservation priority.",

The LandCare Program of the National Department of Agriculture aimed to improve productivity at the same time as promoting sustainable land-use practices. However, agriculture officials have remained reluctant to tackle communal rangeland management. This paper examines the experiences of stakeholders who undertook communal rangeland management and rehabilitation on the Okhombe LandCare project in the northern Drakensberg. The paper explores how community facilitators can be trained and supported in their work. Facilitator training for communal rangeland management should include social skills, the social context of communal rangelands and novice facilitators should be supported by mentors. There is a need for greater financial support and law enforcement from the state in the area of communal grazing management.",

    "abstract": "We studied the seasonal and daily movement patterns of livestock (pastoralists) in the Richtersveld National Park to suggest management strategies that would support a balance between biodiversity conservation and livestock grazing. Livestock movement patterns indicated that forage is the motivation for winter movements and water is the motivation for summer. The movement followed a predictable direction from grazing areas in the wet season towards the Orange River riparian area with permanent water during periods of low rainfall. The latter can be considered as a 'key resource' area to sustain animal numbers through critical periods of low rainfall. Overall, seasonal movement patterns were in transect of approximately 10km in distance. However, these patterns varied amongst the pastoralists which suggest diverse approaches to tracking resources. On average, a pastoralist moved his animals six times a year between stock posts in a network of grazing routes. The grazing area around a stock post was 2.49km comprising an area of ca. 1 950ha. Herds walked much more quickly in the morning (1.25km hr−1) than in the afternoon (0.82km hr−1) and thus covered more grazing ground per unit time. On the basis of the grazing area and travelling rate (particularly in the morning), all the 36 identified conservation-worthy sites in the National Park were threatened by livestock grazing. Effective management strategies may possibly include zoning, closing some stock posts and careful consideration for opening new roads.",

We provide an overview of the spatial and temporal extent for agents of environmental change (land and disturbance transformations, biogeochemical modifications, biotic additions and losses) and highlight those that strongly influence rangeland ecosystems. Restoration may provide a mechanism for ameliorating the impacts of invasive species, but applications of restoration practices over large scales, e.g. ecoregions, will yield benefits earlier when the landscape is prioritised by criteria that identify locations where critical restoration species can grow and where success will be high. We used the Great Basin, USA as our region of interest where the invasive annual grass, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), dominates millions of hectares. A landscape-level restoration model for sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata and ssp. wyomingensis) was developed to meet the goal of establishing priority habitat for wildlife. This approach could be used in long-range planning of rangeland ecosystems where funds and labour for restoration projects may vary annually.",

Using livestock census data from 28 magisterial districts in the Transkei, we explored the trends in livestock biomass from 1923–1998. The area had been subjected to intensive herbivory by domestic livestock during that period, and the high livestock biomass had been blamed for the perceived degradation or 'overgrazing' of the region. Our assessment used the concept rain-use efficiency (RUE) (kg dry matter ha−1 mm−1) to determine whether there is evidence of change in the efficiency of the system to produce domestic livestock. We calculated RUE from annual livestock numbers and the mean annual rainfall for each district. We found no evidence of a decline in rain-use efficiency between the two assessment periods (1923–1944, 1945–1998). There was evidence of a shift in the ratio of sheep to goats between 1923 and 1998, with goat numbers increasing (greater than twofold) relative to sheep in eight districts. This trend may be associated with changes in the structure of vegetation. We conclude that this region is not showing evidence of system run down that affects domestic livestock production.",

A three-year study was implemented to determine the seasonal variation in herbaceous biomass and chemical composition of veld, animal weight, body condition and blood metabolites in a communal area where farmers wished to commercialise. The period of study was not characterised by unusual climatic conditions. Herbaceous biomass increased in wet months and decreased in dry months. Crude protein concentration was higher in wet seasons than dry seasons. Neutral detergent fibre was generally high. Calves gained 0.53–0.63 kg d−1 during the wet season and took 15 months to reach weaning weight. The mean weights and body condition scores of cows and bulls increased during wet seasons and decreased during dry seasons. Blood urea nitrogen was low in the dry season while creatinine concentrations increased in the dry season and dropped in the wet season. The results indicated that the quantity and quality of forage were insufficient for the development of commercial beef production. Further research is needed to develop and test strategies for improving the availability of nutrients in situations where communal farmers wish to develop livestock production.

Vegetation condition in contrasting land-use management systems is well documented in semiarid rangelands, but relatively little information is available on soil quality. This study explores soil quality indicators in contrasting land-use management systems (communal, commercial and game/conservation) to compare degradation status. Soil samples collected in all land-use management systems were analysed for chemical, biochemical and microbiological properties. Soils were acidic (pH = 6.33) and nutrients deficient (average organic C [Corg] 0.37%, available P 3.04 mg kg−1, cation exchange capacity [CEC] 2.99 cmol(+) kg−1). Significant differences (pH, p < 0.0001; Ca2+, p < 0.0001; Mg2+, p = 0.001; Na+, p = 0.014; CEC, p < 0.0001; Corg, p = 0.004; dehydrogenase, p = 0.003; acid phosphatase, p = 0.001; urease, p < 0.0001) were found between the conservation and both the communal and commercial land-use management. Only few indicators of soil quality showed significant differences between the commercial and communal management. No clear gradient of soil degradation could be detected. Results recommend caution when assessing degradation across contrasting land-use management systems, and within a specific management system. Further research across a wide range of sites within management and taking into consideration spatial soil and vegetation distribution is required to understand land-use management effects on rangeland condition.",

Although several on-station trials have been done in the subhumid region of Zimbabwe, there have been no studies assessing on-farm yields of the introduced fodder species. This study evaluated productivity in a communal area under varying soil (pH, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and management conditions (protection and tree density). Leaf productivity was high on farms with relatively higher soil P. Leaf yields ranged from 0.4–3.3 t DM ha−1 for A. angustissima, 0.8–5.6 t DM ha−1 for C. calothyrsus and 0.2-0.7 t DM ha−1 for L. leucocephala, with mean values of 2.2, 2.6 and 0.4 t DM ha−1, respectively. The low yields of L. leucocephala were associated with psyllid (Heteropsylla cubana) infestation. Decrease in tree density (low population) resulted in reduced yield. Poor performance was also attributed to uncontrolled browsing. Influence of soil characteristics could not be confirmed, but there were indications that low soil phosphorus may have adversely affected tree growth. The yields were generally lower than on-station, which implies that there is room for improving fodder tree yields in this subhumid region, through improving the availability of P, planting a high density of trees, and protecting them from uncontrolled browsing.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the effect of different management strategies on range condition is a challenge for farmers in highly variable environments. A model that explains how the relations between rainfall, livestock and vegetation composition vary over time and interact is needed. Rangeland ecosystems have a hierarchical structure that can be described in terms of vegetation composition, stocking rate and rainfall at the ecosystem level, and the performance of individual animals and plants at the lower level. In this paper, we present mathematical models that incorporate ideas from complex systems theory to integrate several strands of rangeland theory in a hierarchical framework. Compared with observed data from South Africa, the model successfully predicted the relationship between rainfall, vegetation composition and animal numbers over 30 years. Extending model runs over 100 years suggested that initial starting conditions can have a major effect on rangeland dynamics (divergence), and that hysteresis is more likely during a series of low rainfall years. Our model suggests that applying an upper threshold to animal numbers may help to conserve the biodiversity and resilience of grazing systems, whilst maintaining farmers' ability to respond to changing environmental conditions, a management option here termed controlled disequilibrium.",

A study spanning almost three years was conducted to determine the seasonal variation in herbaceous biomass, chemical composition of forage, sheep performance and blood metabolites in a communal area of KwaZulu-Natal. A study was also implemented to evaluate the feeding behaviour of sheep. The dry months had low biomass compared to the wet months. Higher values of crude protein were observed in the wet seasons compared to lower values in the dry seasons. Neutral detergent fibre was high in all the seasons. Overall forage quantity and quality were poor relative to commercial farming standards. There was no significant difference in sheep weights between seasons. Blood urea N concentration was lower in the dry season than the wet season and was below the normal range. Cholesterol concentration was higher in the wet season than the dry season and was generally high relative to the normal range. Seasonal differences in creatinine concentration were not observed, but it was generally within the normal range. Foraging time was higher during the late dry season than the early wet season and bite size was higher in the dry season. Simulated bites were found to have substantially higher crude protein and lower fibre concentrations than the average forage on offer. It was therefore postulated that although communal areas may provide generally poor forage, Nguni sheep are able to maintain their body weight through selective feeding.",

These variables were determined along a terrain morphological unit where S. plumosum density increased with altitude. On average 57% of S. plumosum seedlings were killed by fire, but fire had no significant (P > 0.05) influence on the mortality of mature shrubs. Fire significantly (P ≤ 0.01) stimulated seedling emergence of S. plumosum, to such an extent that an average of 510 seedlings ha−1 occurred on the foot slope, while only 9.14 seedlings ha−1 emerged in the unburnt treatment. Seedling emergence showed greater association with protection from direct sunlight and seedlings emerged not closer than 281 mm from the nearest leaves (canopy) of a mature S. plumosum shrub. The aboveground phytomass production of the unburnt grass sward was nearly double that of the burnt areas over the first season following the fire.

Digestibility declined somewhat from spring through to winter, but digestible crude protein content in the diet was unaffected by time of year.

In August 2011, such wildfires swept through the North West province of South Africa, destroying large areas of grazing and farm infrastructure. There is little information available on how the regional semi-arid rangelands respond to fire. In order to increase knowledge on short-term regeneration capacities of burned rangelands, the recovery of grass phytomass, composition and diversity as well as the frequency distribution of patch types (i.e. grass-, litter- and bare patches) were assessed in the growing season following the fire. Burned and unburned sites were compared in two regional grasslands and one savanna type receiving between 480 and 700 mm rainfall y−1. Fire significantly reduced phytomass production, and lowered the grazing capacity and potential grazing days across vegetation types. In general, grass diversity, composition and relative frequencies remained unaffected documenting an overall good regeneration potential of the grass sward. An increased proportion of bare patches and decrease of litter indicated that the post-fire environment lost functionality with respect to erosion control, nutrient cycling and water infiltration. Gained insights provide valuable baseline information for future impact assessments and research into the fire dynamics of investigated vegetation types.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess tiller population dynamics of aerial and basal tillers in eight cultivars of Pennisetum purpureum (Schumach.), syn. Cenchrus purpureus (Schumach.) Morrone, in a warm humid climate in Veracruz, Mexico. This is a pioneer study on tiller population dynamics in elephant grass under conditions of undisturbed growth. The tiller population assays included data from 14 days after cutting until 154 and 182 days after cutting for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. On each sampling date, a distinctive ring was placed on every new tiller, and rings were removed from dead tillers. Tiller density, mortality and appearance were determined. In wet seasons, copious tillering occurred on initial regrowth (by day 42, mostly aerial tillers, with a ratio of 2:1 to 4:1 for aerial to basal tiller appearance), and on day 98 (a higher proportion of basal tillers, with an aerial to basal tiller ratio of 1.5:1). Aerial tillers showed a higher overall mortality rate than basal tillers (29.0 vs 14.4). Younger basal tillers showed higher mortality than older tillers. Higher tiller density occurred during the dry season, where it increased gradually until day 70 and then declined. The cultivars ‘Cameroon‘, ‘CT115‘ and ‘OM22‘ showed remarkably high tillering ability. The findings indicate that harvesting a forage bank is possible from day 70 during a dry season.",

    "abstract": "Pentzia incana is one of the most important of all natural pasture plants in the dry interior (Karoo) region of South Africa. This highly aromatic shrub is thought to be responsible for the distinctive flavour of Karoo lamb (a registered geographical indication), yet the essential oil is here characterised for the first time. Leafy twigs are traditionally chewed for relief of stomach ache. Essential oil is associated with numerous small, multicellu- lar glands. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of 17 essential oil samples from five populations showed considerable variation in both yield (0.12% to 0.88% dry weight) and composition. Of interest was the presence of one major biosynthetic group comprising yomogi alcohol (to 38.9%), artemisia alcohol (to 26.1%), artemisia ketone (to 35.0%) and artemisyl acetate (to 9.4%). High levels of fragranol (26.9%) and fragranyl acetate (27.1%) were observed only in a single specimen. Other main compounds were 1,8-cineole (to 16.7%), santolina alcohol (to 11.3%), camphor (to 47.9%), linalyl acetate (to 17.4%) and bicyclogermacrene (to 11.8%). Six of the 10 major compounds were isolated and their identities confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance. The volatile compounds may possibly be linked to the medicinal use of P. incana, as well as the flavour profile of Karoo lamb.",

Treatments consisting of one or a combination of topsoil addition, plant translocation and seeding were applied to experimental rehabilitation sites in 2001, while the treatment of another site in 2008 combined all three techniques. Vegetation and species cover, species richness, diversity and evenness, and grazing capacity of rehabilitation sites were sampled during winter 2009 and summer 2010, and compared with a reference site. All rehabilitated sites achieved the objective to attain a minimum grazing capacity of 20 ha per small stock unit. Rehabilitation trials were successful in establishing a vegetation cover, but were unable to return species richness and diversity to reference levels and did not resemble the reference site in species composition. Common species in reference sites were absent or only occurred in low numbers. No treatment outperformed the others and further experimentation is needed to determine the most suitable combination. It is recommended that rehabilitation should be done in multiple stages in future to improve seedling survival and to return species that are unable to establish in the adverse conditions present at the onset of rehabilitation.",

The Karoo BioGaps Project aims to provide such data and to support the scientific assessment for shale gas development projects in the Karoo basin. In this paper we present the findings of the BioGaps mammal survey, which recorded medium and large mammals across twenty-five 1 km × 1 km sampling sites within the proposed fracking footprint using camera trapping techniques. We use sample rarefaction curves, non-parametric species richness estimators and non-metric multidimensional scaling plots to explore both species richness and community structure. We also used a generalised linear model to investigate how species diversity varies with both site-specific and landscape-level predictors. A total of 38 species were recorded at the majority of sites. Longitude (z = 4.018, p = 0.0005) emerged as the best predictor of species diversity across the study area, which we suggest is linked to the clear east–west aridity gradient. Together these results reveal the cosmopolitan distribution of the mammal taxa in the Karoo and could be used to inform decision-making linked to mining activities in the area.",

We were interested, firstly, in whether the vegetation showed any trends in response to the strong decrease in grazing pressure, which occurred at the beginning of the monitoring period, and secondly, in the effect of seasonal climate on the vegetation. We analysed the responses of species richness and cover in four life forms to seasonal rainfall and the standardised precipitation–evapotranspiration index (SPEI) using linear mixed-effect models. Time had a positive effect on richness of annual species and a negative effect on cover of shrubs and annuals, which increased in response to SPEI and less strongly to rainfall during autumn and winter. Habitat did not have any effect and geophytes and perennial herbs did not show any significant response. The importance of SPEI during autumn and winter is discussed in relation to potential germination cues and the projected decrease in rainfall and increase in temperature during these seasons.",

    "abstract": "Herbivores are an integral part of the African landscape and have evolved with the vegetation to create the savanna landscape. Managers of these landscapes can benefit from a better understanding of how indigenous herbivores use the landscape to which they are adapted. In this study we observed which patches were frequently utilised, by doing regular monthly road counts, grass height observations and dung counts on selected short grass patches in the Kruger National Park. Smaller-framed impala and blue wildebeest (meso-herbivores) were most regularly seen on these nutritious patches, while from dung deposits it was clear that the even larger-framed buffalo (mega-herbivores) spent time there. This preference can be explained by considering the nutritional needs and food intake of the herbivores. Smaller-framed herbivores seem to be able to satisfy their dietary requirements on the high-quality forage patches, while larger-framed herbivores seem to supplement the quality forage by also spending foraging time on areas of higher grass biomass. From this insight we propose that range management should take herbivore preferences into account and allow herbivores to select and concentrate their foraging on the most nutritious forage. This approach is likely to decrease inputs while allowing animals to maintain or increase production.",

Depending on the species composition, rangeland condition and local climate, available DPM calibrations may fail in providing precise measurements for a certain area. We calibrated a DPM for the arid dunefield savanna of the south-western Kalahari as found in the Northern Cape province of South Africa and bordering Namibia and Botswana. Assessments were done at 30 sites and restricted to inter-dune areas. The site selection accounted for different grazing conditions to ensure a better representation of the variability in ASB in the region. We determined grass species composition, basal cover and dry matter production in relation to height readings of the DPM. The grass sward was dominated by the species Stipagrostis ciliata, S. obtusa and Schmidtia kalahariensis, with a mean density of 25 cm point-to-tuft distances. Based on 90 paired observations of ASB and disc height (x; cm), the equation ӯ (kg ha−1) = 213.37(x) + 103.36 (r2 = 0.760) was established. In comparison to other models, the equation avoids an overestimation of ASB in this vegetation type, and thus leads to more accurate estimations.",

The grazing capacity of the kikuyu–ryegrass systems was lower during winter and autumn than during spring and summer, with the seasonal grazing capacity of the perennial ryegrass treatment more evenly distributed than that of the Italian and Westerwolds ryegrass treatments. The perennial ryegrass treatment had a lower butterfat and milk production per lactation than the Italian and Westerwolds ryegrass treatments, but had the highest milk solids and fat corrected milk production per hectare. The latter was a result of the higher annual grazing capacity achieved by the perennial ryegrass treatment. It was concluded that because kikuyu over-sown with perennial ryegrass supported a higher number of animals and had a more evenly distributed fodder-flow, it achieved higher animal production per hectare than kikuyu over-sown with annual ryegrass varieties.",

In line with the sentiments of Vetter, policies are understood to guide the allocation of resources. The important contribution that livestock make to rural livelihoods is well recognised and strengthening crop–livestock interactions is seen as an effective way of improving livestock productivity while generally being understood as an effective way to increase agricultural production so as to meet the growing needs of the global population. The use of crop residues by livestock is one specific linkage that offers opportunities, but this could be maximised by increasing the yield and quality of the residues. One key challenge to strengthening crop–livestock interactions is the extent to which arable lands are being abandoned. Efforts need to be made to reverse this situation, which requires a range of technical and social/institutional interventions. Although some policy documents refer to integrated systems and alternative cropping practices, there is limited evidence that this in fact is happening on the ground. Policy needs to support crop–livestock interactions more actively so that on-farm research with farmers, as is happening in Msinga, becomes more widespread.",

The aims were to explore the relationships between ecosystem components, and plan communal grazing and fodder flow for sustainable livestock production. In each area, grazing sites near, at intermediate distance from (middle) and far from homesteads were selected. In the valley land, site interacted with season to influence local variations (P<0.05) of soil calcium and microelements. In the plain lands, local variations occurred for soil phosphorus and magnesium. At the large scale, most macro-minerals showed differences between the valley and plain lands. In the valley areas, forage calcium differed (P<0.05) locally in the dry season, whereas in the plain areas, potassium and phosphorus showed local variations (P<0.05) in the wet season. Seasonal variations of most forage elements were significant within each local site of both study areas. All forages were deficient in phosphorus and copper. Cattle serum from the valley area had low iron concentrations. The study concluded that biotic and abiotic factors may influence the distribution of soil and forage elements, but their effects may vary between the two areas. Rangeland improvement and supplementation strategies are suggested to sustain animal production.Keywords: foragelivestockmacro-mineralsmicro-mineralsseasonserumtopography",

Brachiaria is well-known for high biomass production, animal nutrition, carbon sequestration, biological nitrification inhibition, soil conservation, and adaptation to drought and low fertility soils. However, the use of Brachiaria grass for fodder production in Africa has been little explored largely due to lack of cultivars suitable to different production environments. The exploration and use of natural diversity is fundamental for an efficient Brachiaria breeding program. We analysed genetic diversity and population structure of 112 Ethiopian Brachiaria brizantha accessions using 23 microsatellite markers. A total of 459 alleles were detected with an average polymorphic information content of 0.75 suggesting high discriminating ability of these markers. The molecular variance analysis showed a high contribution (86%) of within-cluster differences to the total variation. Three allelic pools revealed by STRUCTURE analysis in 112 accessions were in agreement with the clustering patterns seen in neighbor-joining tree and principal coordinates analyses. A core collection of 39 B. brizantha accessions was constituted. This study concludes a high genetic diversity of Ethiopian B. brizantha accessions and their importance in Brachiaria breeding programs.",

A poor ground cover, mainly characterized by bare ground and the dwarf grass Oropetium capensis, existed in the 50%, 75% and 100% plots. This state proved to be relatively independent of rainfall, typical of an induced or pseudo-drought condition. It can be concluded that the tree density of the 50% plot (mean: 3 620 ETTE ha−1, where 1 ETTE = mean leaf volume of a 1.5 m single-stemmed tree = 500 cm3 leaf volume) had already exceeded the critical point of detrimental grass-tree competition. Colonization of bare ground by herbaceous plants increased from increased levels of tree thinning. Annual grasses were the main colonizers of bare ground, while perennial grasses on(v constituted a small proportion of the grass species composition. The successional order of establishing grasses following thinning was Tragus berteronianus, Brachiaria deflexa and Aristida species, terminating in a state where Enneapogon cenchroides predominated.

The two species differed in their ability to tolerate defoliation under competition. Defoliation reduced the yield of A. junciformis, at all levels of competition, to a greater extent than T. triandra. Aristida junciformis was particularly sensitive to a combination of severe defoliation and full competition. It is suggested that manipulation of grazing patterns may shift the competitive balance between palatable (e.g. T. triandra) and unpalatable (e.g. A. junciformis) components of the sward.",

Research in wildlife, large herbivores, systems ecology and energy flows through grazing ecosystems formed the basis of his approach. A leader of the South Turkana Ecosystem Project (STEP), he showed the adaptive basis for opportunistic and spatially extensive resource use in temporally and spatially variable environments. After the STEP, he examined pastoral ecosystems in northern and central Asia and elsewhere in Africa. Spatial extensivity, or scale, emerged as being critically important to pastoral ecosystem function. Livestock development schemes based upon inappropriate ecological and economic assumptions are all too often ecologically and economically unsustainable. However, a new paradigm of pastoral ecology and development is emerging. The paradigm is derived from basic, but comprehensive, understanding of the ecologically adaptive features of pastoral resource utilisation strategies, and the ecological processes and constraints that determine energy flows from plants to livestock and humans in spatially and temporally variable environments. Jim Ellis contributed greatly to improved understanding of the importance of mobility and opportunism in these ecosystems. This understanding could benefit humans, ecosystems and wildlife over a vast portion of the earth's surface.",

For three years, phytomass of these accessions was cut and measured for three cutting periods characterised by different rainfall features. In 1998 the mean of the phytomass productivity was 199.1g DM (Dry Matter) plant–1. The productivity in 1999 was 81.0g DM plant–1, but in 2000 the productivity was only 21.6g DM plant–1. Positive correlations were found between dry matter and all morphological parameters, especially tuft diameter (r = 0.670) and tuft height (r = 0.637). Principal components analysis was carried out on all variables. For both dry matter and phenology, individuals differentiated strongly, but irrespective of their accession or eco-geographic origin.

Vetch (fresh cut) was sampled in September and vetch hay samples were taken in October both during the early dry period. Samples of the browse and grass species were taken once per month during the rainy (June-August) and early dry (September-November) seasons in each year of the study period. Big variation was observed in the chemical composition of the browse and grass species. The browse species had relatively higher crude protein (CP) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) contents and lower neutral detergent fibre (NDF) contents than the grass species during both seasons. The highest CP content was observed in Albizia amara (24.7%) in the rainy season and in the fresh cut vetch (24.3%) in the dry season. Among the grass species, Digitaria abyssinica and Panicum miliaceum had relatively high CP contents during both the rainy and early dry seasons. Panicum coloratum had the highest NDF content in both seasons. The potential gas production was the highest (71.5 ml/0.2 g DM) in fresh cut vetch and the lowest (12.5 ml/0.2 g DM) in Ximenia american. The rate of gas production was the highest (0.081 ml h-1) in Balanites aegyptica and the lowest (0.019 ml h –1) in Combretum molle. Gas production was higher in fresh cut vetch than in the vetch hay, while the rate of gas production was higher in the hay than in the fresh cut vetch. In general, most of the browse species considered in this study had comparable CP and NDF contents to vetch and could be used as dry season supplementation for goats and other ruminants. However, further study is needed to understand the underlying causes of low gas production in some of the browse species and to evaluate animal response to supplementation of the promising browse species.

The diet of the dorcas gazelle was significantly richer in crude protein than that of the wild ass. The level of crude protein in the faeces of dorcas gazelles was higher than that measured in the plant species, suggesting that diet selection by gazelles occurred at the level of plant parts, not species. Wild ass faecal energy was positively correlated with plant species richness and cover of forage species. Faecal digestibility (a measure of dietary fibre content) in both the wild ass and dorcas gazelle was negatively correlated with plant cover.

The levels of faecal crude protein (FCP) and faecal phosphorus (FP) of free-ranging springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) and blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) on a game ranch, goats and cattle grazing in a communally-managed area, as well as cattle grazing under commercial management were determined in the wet and dry seasons over a period of two years. Plant and soil analyses were also conducted. Goats had the highest FCP and FP of all species in all seasons during the study. It appeared that selective feeders (goats and springbok) and short-grass feeders (wildebeest) do not suffer from low forage quality because their FCP and FP levels were above critical values during all seasons. Contrastingly, cattle need nutrient supplementation because their FCP and FP were below critical nutritional values during the dry seasons. Plant and soil chemical characteristics, especially soil P, had an influence on faecal quality during the study. Clay pans provide an important habitat because of the high soil quality and, consequently, high diet quality. Our surprising finding that faecal CP levels were higher under communal management than under commercial management may be ascribed to higher nutrient deposition (due to higher stocking rates) and greater diet selectivity available to free-ranging animals under communal management. Higher faecal CP and P levels in game animals may also be ascribed to unrestricted movement and, consequently, greater access to palatable plants. The results of this study demonstrate the value of faecal profiling for management of semi-arid savanna livestock and game. Keywords: DIET QUALITYCRUDE PROTEINPHOSPHORUSFAECESMANAGEMENT TYPES",

All species produced the greatest biomass in high-nutrient high-water treatments. Short to medium-height grass species, such as Themeda triandra and Aristida junciformis, produced nearly double the biomass of taller species such as Hyparrhenia hirta and Eragrostis curvula in the low-nutrient treatments, with the reverse being true in the high-nutrient treatments. Themeda triandra and A. junciformis produced the greatest root biomass both in the low- and high-nutrient treatments. The shorter species produced relatively greater root than shoot mass, with the reverse being true of the taller species. Tall species did not produce relatively less, when cut, or relatively more, when shaded, than the shorter species. However, A. junciformis and E. curvula were more shade-tolerant than the other species, suggesting that their increase in abundance with infrequent fire is due to the shading by litter in unburnt grassland. The competitive hierarchy among species reversed between low- and high-nutrient treatments, with A. junciformis and H. hirta having the greatest competitive effect on T. triandra in low- and high-nutrient treatments, respectively. These results contribute to an understanding of species distributions on fertility and burning gradients.",

The soil salinity of the experimental site ranged from 4.8 to 28.6 dS m−1 and had pH values of 7.82 to 8.92 and residual sodium carbonate of 21.6. The plants were irrigated with underground brackish water with electrical conductivity (EC) of 4.78 dS m−1 and pH 8.2. The plants were raised from root stocks in selected plots and adjacent naturally growing plants of these species of the same age were selected for purposes of comparison in terms of growth and nutritional value. When the plants were at a stage when they could be used for forage, samples were collected and tested for biomass, protein, total carbohydrates, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, P and total nitrogen. The results indicated that A. lentiformis produced the highest biomass followed by K. indica, L. fusca, S. arabicus and S. fruticosa. Plant yields were significantly higher in the experimental plots than under natural environmental conditions. The chemical analysis for protein and carbohydrates indicated that S. fruticosa contained the highest protein followed by K. indica, A. lentiformis, S. arabicus and L. fusca.

Browse species had higher crude protein, phosphorus and calcium contents than the grass species, but the fluctuation range was similar to that of the grass species. In general, the crude protein content of the food plant species sampled in the present study was above the level required by African ungulates for maintenance. However, the diet of springbok in the south-western Kalahari appeared to be phosphorus deficient. Crude protein and phosphorus levels in plant food were especially low during the cold-dry season, when the crude protein content of the grass species was at or below that which is required by springbok for sustenance. The phosphorus content was below ruminant requirements in all plant species in all habitats during the cold-dry season. Faecal crude protein and phosphorus percentages higher than that of the selected plant species investigated imply that springbok have the ability to select the most nutrient-rich plant species and plant parts available. The Ca:P ratio of the plant species that were sampled in the present study fell outside the range that is considered to be healthy for ruminants in all instances, with calcium in excess.

It argues that environmental change cannot be understood without incorporating social, economic and political history. This is especially so in the case of the Karoo because the landscape and ecology was transformed by intensive commercial livestock production in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The scale and economic significance of sheep farming and wool production up to the 1960s is generally underestimated in histories of the Cape and South Africa. The article outlines the patterns of economic growth and also the technologies required, such as fencing and water provision. The environmental impact of intensive livestock farming was recognised from the late eighteenth century and new scientific approaches helped to define understandings of environmental change. Environmental degradation was at its height in the first half of the twentieth century; simultaneously, conservationist ideas were developed and gradually implemented. In the second half of the twentieth century, these approaches, together with socio-economic factors that led to lower levels of stocking, resulted in a stabilisation and even some environmental recovery.",

Few studies, however, have quantified the impact of grazing on the composition and structure of the mountain grasslands. Gradients of grazing and trampling intensity related to distance from 23 cattleposts in the subalpine and alpine belts (2 650–3 175 m above sea level) were examined to describe the long-term effects of livestock on unpalatable dwarf shrubs, bare area and plant species composition. The potential for shrub invasion and bare areas (low herbaceous cover) to develop was highest near cattleposts. Species composition also changed significantly along the grazing gradient, accompanied by a shift in dominants from grazing-sensitive to grazing-resistant grasses and shrubs. Species either decreased or increased monotonically along the grazing gradient or had an intermediate, unimodal response. The relative positions of species' centroids along the grazing gradient were used to quantify their grazing sensitivity on a scale from 10 (most sensitive) to 0 (most resistant), which confirmed and contradicted previous classifications of their grazing responses.

This study modelled the distribution of five C3 grass species, namely Tenaxia stricta, Tenaxia disticha, Festuca costata, Merxmuellera drakensbergensis and Merxmuellera stereophylla, to temperature-related surrogate variables using presence–absence data collected across the environmental heterogeneity of the mountain range. Distributions of each species, and of all species combined, were modelled using generalised additive models. These temperature-related variables accounted for the distribution of all five species, least so for F. costata. Four species could therefore contract in range in response to climate change, whereas F. costata is least likely to have a range contraction directly related to a warming climate and could experience a range expansion owing to the fertilising effect of increased [CO2].",

    "abstract": "Savannas are notable for the varied patterns of leaf display in the tree layer. Characterising this variation, and assessing the range of phenological strategies apparent in savanna ecosystems will be helpful for understanding savanna tree life-histories and their response to global change. We recorded leaf phenological metrics on a monthly basis for 28 woody species for one year in a semi-arid savanna at Nylsvley Nature Reserve, South Africa. Using these metrics four plant functional types were described: (1) evergreen species, which retained full canopy throughout the year; (2) semi-evergreen species, which lost a significant amount of canopy during the dry season, but not less than 60%; (3) obligate deciduous species in which the canopy was leafless for about 3 months during the dry season; and (4) rain-stimulated species, in which canopy flushing was driven by rainfall patterns. Of the 28 species, 18% were evergreen, 18% obligate deciduous, 32% semi-evergreen and 32% were rain-stimulated species. These results confirm that phenological strategies are variable in savannas, and highlight that there are numerous cues controlling the timing of leaf out and leaf drop. By defining distinct phenological strategies we can predict which plant functional types will have phenological cues that will be vulnerable to shifting climates.",

These have been caused by a range of considerations related to advances in farming technology and changing labour needs, transport improvements, environmental considerations and contextual economic variables. This paper pays attention to how, in the twentieth century, these factors catalysed net population loss in the Karoo's rural areas but population gain in all categories of urban settlement, particularly the larger centres. An exception to this was the phenomenon of 'shrinking towns', which became discernible in the late twentieth century. In the twenty-first century the process has become more complex, as small towns' decline has now been reversed and all towns are now attracting rural and inter-regional migrants in the post-apartheid years. We comment on the potential causes, nature and effects of these variations in the Karoo, and discuss the key role of these towns as they reflect the dynamic socio-economic and environmental shifts witnessed in the region.Keywords: Karoopopulationurban",

This paper analyses information from two case studies – the Karoo towns of Carnarvon and Williston in the Northern Cape. By comparing data between 2009 and 2018, we show that a significant number of these commonage farmers have increased their livestock holdings. In addition, several have moved their livestock onto 'new' commonage farms, purchased by Government, or on land leased from white commercial farmers. We argue that the concept of 'economic class' needs to be reintroduced to South African development analysis. The paper compares these proto-commercial farmers with the 'kulak' farmers of Russia in the early twentieth century (before the Soviet regime) and the early twenty-first century (after the collapse of communism). We concur with Russian authors that the emergence of new commercial farmers may constitute a new economic class. In South Africa, the situation is of course divergent, given that a strong class of commercial farmers exists. We suggest that the commonage farming phenomenon can make a contribution to current South African land debates.",

In South Africa, Vachellia sieberiana is encroaching into the savannas and high-altitude grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal. We investigated the role of fire, frost and simulated grazing (mowing of the grass sward) on the establishment of transplanted V. sieberiana saplings (as change in stem diameter) along an altitudinal gradient in north-western KwaZulu-Natal using analysis of variance. Altitude had a significant effect on sapling size. There was no response to treatments at the high-altitude site. At the mid-altitude site, sapling stem diameter decreased in response to fire treatment and increased in response to mowing. At the low-altitude site, there was a negative response to frost and a positive response to fire and to mowing. At both the mid- and low-altitude sites there was a positive response when fire and mowing were combined. None of the treatments were able to prevent the establishment of V. sieberiana. Rangeland managers need to maintain a tree:grass ratio that provides the best production of forage. Fire is frequently used to control bush encroachment, but, with V. sieberiana being well adapted to survive fire, managers will need to devise other methods to conserve important grassy biomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Glyceria maxima (Poaceae) is regarded as one of the most invasive grasses worldwide, but has only recently become naturalised in South Africa after its intentional introduction as a fodder crop in the 1940s. It invades seasonally inundated habitats. The primary reproduction mode of G. maxima within established infestations was studied at two sites in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Glyceria maxima seeds were also collected from three sites (in KwaZulu-Natal) to understand their dormancy and determine viability. No seedlings were found within established G. maxima infestations. Cold stratification (4 °C) and dry storage of seeds at ambient room temperature for eight weeks did not enhance G. maxima seed germination (means: 0.5% and 2.5%, respectively). However, tetrazolium tests revealed that a high proportion of seeds that did not germinate were still viable. After-ripening of seeds for 19 months resulted in very high germination (mean: 92% across the three sites). A combination of high seed viability, physiological dormancy, high germination following after-ripening and substantial vegetative reproduction is likely to contribute to the invasion success of G. maxima in the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, chemical control should be investigated as a matter of priority as no control recommendations for this species exist in South Africa.Keywords: after-ripeninggrassinvasive weedpropaguleswetland",

    "abstract": "Condensed tannins are ecologically important compounds in plants for several reasons, e.g. as herbivore deterrents or protecting photosynthetic tissues against ultraviolet radiation. The hand-held Dualex Series 4 instrument was originally developed for indirect determination of flavonol concentrations in crops. Flavonols are low-molecular-weight phenolics from which condensed tannins are synthesised. Therefore, it was expected that the Dualex's ‘flavonol index’ (range 0.00–3.00) could be used to predict condensed tannin concentrations, providing a rapid, cost-effective, non-destructive method to sample more species and more plants per treatment than destructive methods used for wet-chemistry tannin assays. Thirteen broad-leaved woody species were sampled at the Nkuhlu and Letaba exclosures in Kruger National Park during December 2011. Four plants were sampled per species by collecting 100 leaves per plant, measuring the flavonol index of each leaf and pooling them in classes of 0.10 flavonol units. Condensed tannin concentrations were determined according to the acid-butanol assay with Sorghum tannin as standard. Regression models (condensed tannin = a*flavonol index – b) were significant for only four species: Acacia nigrescens (Senegalia nigrescens), Euclea divinorum, Spirostachys africana and Combretum zeyheri. Other than high variation in chemistry among plants, poor calibration results were likely caused by high chemical variation within leaves.",

The model predicts the annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) from regression equations of canopy cover by annual production fraction for plant functional classes. We tested the output of the model against another fully independent net primary production (NPP) model, namely the MODIS NPP product. The mean MODIS NPP for the 29 sites was 343 ± 22 kg dry matter (DM) ha−1 y−1 as opposed to 285 ± 142 kg DM ha−1 y−1 for the fAP model that used the regression method (p < 0.01). As a proof of concept, these landscape-scale ANPP values are used to calculate a recommended livestock carrying capacity for the Ehirovipuka Communal Conservancy, a 1 980 km2 communal area with both wildlife and livestock populations. In addition, we also provide details of a field method for predicting landscape-scale LAI from line transect data. This approach can be used to ground reference the LAI values generated from the MODIS LAI product.",

    "abstract": "An online decision support system derived from research and expert knowledge was developed for arid rangeland management in central Namibia. The expert system emphasises the control of bush thickening and is divided into three forms of decisions: adaptive, reactive and ongoing good management. Adaptive decisions are mostly related to periods of protracted high rainfall, as this is a critical window both in terms of a hazard (transition to bushy thickened state if no fire is applied) and opportunity (transition back to an open savanna if fire is applied). Currently, the expert system uses wiki technology, as this allows a high level of interaction between user and administrator. The expert system includes embedded links to photographs and additional information. It allows easy updating of the knowledge base. An additional booklet was also developed, since access to computers and the internet is still limited. Although the evaluation of the expert system will be determined partly by its acceptance by rangeland managers, we adhered to many of the critical success factors relating to decision support systems in its development. The paper discusses some key strategies for the success of this and similar decision support systems for improved rangeland management in the future.",

We evaluated the impact of Prosopis invasion and clearing on vegetation species composition and diversity (alien and indigenous species richness and cover) in Nama-Karoo rangeland on two sheep farms in the Beaufort West district of the Western Cape province of South Africa. Our results suggest that Prosopis invasion and clearing can significantly change Nama-Karoo rangeland species composition. Invasion and clearing appear to have no effect on alien species richness. Invasion, however, increases alien species cover, while clearing restores it to pre-invasion levels. In contrast, invasion reduces indigenous species richness while clearing restores it to pre-invasion levels. Invasion appears to have no effect on indigenous species cover. This lack of effect appears to be the serendipitous result of a site-specific trade-off between a decline in cover of grasses that are negatively affected by Prosopis invasion and a concomitant increase in the cover of positively affected grasses. Clearing increases indigenous species cover to above pre-invasion levels. The higher than usual indigenous species cover after clearing could be a transient legacy of Prosopis soil nutrient enrichment.",

However, detailed studies comparing the response of plant functional groups to fire seasonality, and thus phenological timing, are scarce from humid Afrotropical grasslands. Such information, however, is crucial for understanding what keeps the grasslands open and for enabling evidence-based management, and conservation. We initiated an experiment in frost- and fire-prone Angolan geoxyle grasslands in 2017, investigating the effect of different timing of fires on cover and diversity of trees, grasses, geoxyles and herbs. We installed permanent, randomised plots with fire exclusion, annual early and late dry-season burning, representing the local burning practices. Functional plant groups reacted differently to the treatments, becoming apparent at species level and their performance metrics. After three years, grass species benefitted from late and no burning, and herbs from late burning, whereas geoxyles thrived under early burning. Tree growth was suppressed under late burning, and did not increase with fire exclusion. Species richness and diversity was higher in burnt than in unburnt plots. Seasonal timing of fire tips the scales between geoxyles and grasses. The extraordinary plant diversity of Angolan geoxyle grasslands is a result of pyrodiversity and frost, keeping the grasslands open even in absence of fire.",

(Asteraceae), previously known as Stoebe plumosa, has resulted in a reduction in productivity, causing large socio-economic challenges, such as loss of productive land. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of four herbicides in combination with mechanical removal of S. plumosum. We measured shrub mortality, regrowth and examined the grass species richness and cover after the execution of the control methods. Furthermore, we compared the productivity of the paddock where S. plumosum had been controlled with a neighbouring unencroached paddock. Five months after herbicide application, the total mortality of all shrubs was recorded. Grass species richness and cover were higher when shrubs had been mechanically removed before herbicide application. Additionally, the use of the non-species- specific herbicide (tebuthiuron) resulted in lower species richness and cover, compared to application of a species- specific herbicide (metsulfuron-methyl). The productivity of the treated area increased in the year after application. Our results show that when controlling S. plumosum the manual removal of shrubs before applying herbicides can improve the regeneration of the grass layer. This combination of mechanical and chemical control is effective in combating S. plumosum encroachment and increases forage yields in semi-arid rangelands.",

    "abstract": "Feed scarcity is a major challenge facing free-range beef farming in semi-arid areas. Specifically, low quality and quantity of forage in rangelands and higher feeding costs are the main constraints limiting smallholder free-range beef farmers' participation in mainstream beef markets. Using farmers' participatory approaches, this study identified major locally available forage resources (LAFRs) and evaluated their nutritional value. A total of 40 free-ranging commercially orientated smallholder beef farmers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires and tasked to identify LAFRs in the Cradock and Middelburg areas of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Chemical analysis was conducted for the most cited forages such as African sheepbush (Pentzia incana), sweet thorn (Vachellia karroo) leaves and pods, reed (Phragmites australis), lucerne (Medicago sativa) hay, natural pasture grasses (NPGs) and barbary fig, or prickly pear cactus, (Opuntia ficus-indica) cladodes collected from twelve participants' farms. Feed shortage was ranked by more than 53% respondents as the main constraint to smallholder beef production. Regardless of the farming area, crude protein content of V. karroo leaves and pods averaging 18.8 and 19.5%, respectively, was higher than other LAFRs. However, V. karoo pods had relatively low ash content than other forages in both farming areas. Opuntia ficus-indica attained high in vitro neutral detergent fibre digestibility at 12, 24 and 48 hr incubation periods, due to low neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and acid detergent lignin. Integration of participatory inventory and chemical analysis proved to be reliable in identifying LAFRs, with V. karroo leaves and O. ficus-indica cladodes being the main potential forage resources for inclusion in beef cattle diets. Further research is recommended to substantiate their supplementary nutritive value and level of inclusion in beef cattle finishing diets.",

The past fire regimes (2001–2021) of the two parks were investigated with use of the MODIS and VIIRS remote-sensing instrument. Extremely short fire return intervals dominated the landscape, with almost half (47.8%) of the area experiencing a subsequent fire within a year of the previous fire, and an additional 30% of the area burning within two years after a preceding fire. Only 2.4% of the landscape was shown to remain fire-free for a period of ten years or more. Overall, the fire intensities were highest from August to October, with the largest areas burnt between August and September. Fire frequency, seasonality and intensity were influenced by the land-cover type, and a comparison of the different satellite products was made. This information is the first of its kind for the region and is intended to provide a basis from which fire management activities can be coordinated.",

    "abstract": "In the semi-arid areas of Africa many pastorallsts move their livestock to find better grazing when forage is scarce during the dry season. However, the practice of forage cultivation can sustain fodder supply for effective livestock feeding during these times. This study was undertaken to (1) assess grazing land management, and perception among Maasai pastoralists, and 2) evaluate Cenchrus ciliaris L. (Buffel grass) establishment and biomass yield under four levels of fertilisation and three seedbeds in a semi-arid area of eastern Tanzania. The seedbeds were not tilled (NT), tilled flat (TF) and tilled sunken (SN) with manure applied at rates of 0, 5, 10 and 15 t ha–1. The 2m × 3m subplots were replicated three times per seedbed-manure treatment. Communal grazing land was perceived to be in poor condition by pastoralists due to the long time spent by their livestock in search of forage. Private forage reserves for dry-season feeding were present and could be used for forage cultivation. The TF, manure at 10 and 15 t ha–1 treatments had significantly higher (p < 0.001) C. ciliaris establishment rates (97%) and biomass than other treatments. The TF10 and TF15 t ha–1 treatments had biomass values of 9.8 and 10.1t OM ha–1, respectively, by Week 10. Pastoralists preferred the TF method because of its high forage yield and low cost. Cultivation of C. ciliaris is important for livestock production and it can be established on privately owned forage reserves.",

Utter sampling was carried out at monthly intervals using a rectangular 0.25m−2 quadrat frame. Utter within the quadrats was handpicked and washed with running water to get rid of soli particles, dried, and weighed. Weights were expressed on organic matter basis. Monthly litter production ranged from 31.4g m−2 to 130.0g m−2. Mean monthly yield was 92.5 ± 26g m−2, with a 28% coefficient of variation. There was no significant difference (p>0.01) in litter yield between 1992 and 1993. Rate of decomposition for aboveground material ranged from 0.005g g−1 day−1 to 0.084g g−1 day−1. The mean annual rate of decomposition was 0.026g g−1 day−1. Belowground plant material rates of decomposition spread from 0.009g g−1 day−1 to 0.062g g−1 day−1. with a mean annual rate of 0.041g g−1 day&minus1. Belowground material consistently decomposed faster than aboveground material. Peaks in both aboveground and belowground material decomposition rates coincided with rainfall peaks. Overall, in this arid environment, litter production and decomposition is pursed in nature, and trends are closely related to rainfall occurrence. Moisture is thus a limiting factor both to the production and decomposition of litter. Belowground litter plays a significant role in nutrient cycling.

Livestock were not the only source of income for pastoral households. Livestock farming was a post-retirement activity and a way of supplementing pension grants, suggesting that pastoralism could be a dying tradition. Pastoralists concentrated on keeping as many animals as possible (by selling and slaughtering animals only when it was necessary to buy food and supply household meat) to reduce the risk of destitution. Goats and sheep were not kept for sacrificial purposes. Besides making their individual choices, pastoralists employed a range of risk-mitigating farming strategies (manipulating herd composition, spatial distribution and timing of grazing) to maximise the efficient harvesting of available forage and water resources. This emphasised the variable nature of the motives underlying herd management practices. Alliances among pastoralists were mainly a matter of mutual convenience and maintaining social ties with kin or friends from another herd.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The impact of defoliation on the productivity and soil temperature of burnt grassland (head and back fires) was investigated over the short term (one and two growing seasons after burning). Head fires had greater flame height and rate of spread than back fires. However, back fires were more intense and exceeded 100°C at ground level. Botanical composition was little influenced by both head and back fires, though fire had a drastic impact on the basal cover and tuft die-back. Basal cover was still 28% and 11% respectively lower than that of unburnt grassland, one and two growing seasons after burning. Those grass species normally forming large tufts, such as Cymbopogon plurinodis and Themeda triandra, had the greatest percentage die-back per tuft. Defoliation up to and during October, after the grassland had rested for a full growing season after burning, still significantly (P ≤ 0.01) lowered production for the subsequent full growing seasons. For sustainable production in this semi-arid area, it seems grassland should not be defoliated before December of the second growing season following fire. When defoliation took place later in the same season following burning, it had a smaller negative impact on the water-use efficiency. Defoliation significantly (P ≤ 0.01) increased the soil temperature up to a depth of 50mm over the first half of the growing season right after the fire. The importance of the correct time of utilisation of burnt semi-arid grassland, with respect to sustained high production, has been emphasised.

We focussed on variation in plant biomass, phosphorus (P), crude protein (CP) concentrations and dry matter digestibility as parameters most likely to affect sustainable stocking rates. Habitat type had greater effects on plant quality, plant biomass and species composition than management type. The commercially-managed area had the highest tree density in the rocky habitat and lower plant quality than other management types. All of these features indicate that land degradation is occurring on commercial ranches in spite of rotational grazing and lower stocking density than on communal ranches. We recommend that commercial ranchers should introduce a greater variety of stock and/or game to reduce selective grazing of certain plant species. Quality measures (CP and P) gave more conservative predictions of stocking density than biomass. In this region of the Northern Cape, seasonally-inundated pan habitats are particularly valuable in spite of low-standing crop because they have the highest year-round quality. Contrastingly, ranchers should only lightly stock open savanna habitats, in spite of high standing biomass, because they have low vegetation quality and may be particularly susceptible to degradation and invasion by poisonous and unpalatable plants.

Pitfall traps targeting epigaeic invertebrates were set for one week, and soil cores were collected for extraction of hypogaeic invertebrates in 21 plots. A total of 2585 individual specimens from 219 morphospecies were identified. Mean morphospecies richness was consistently highest in blocks burnt in autumn, and higher for biennial burns or two years since last burn for epigaeic, winged and wingless invertebrates, but this was not the case for soil invertebrates which showed little real response to fire. Fire season and frequency significantly influenced epigaeic and winged invertebrate species richness and abundance, with autumn burning and a fire return period of two years favouring richness and abundance. However, the small size of the plots and their proximity and a runaway fire in 2000 could have influenced results and could also result in relatively homogenous communities.

The Eastern Cape Communal Arable Lands Research Project was framed within this policy discourse with the aim of introducing legume-based pasture into 'abandoned arable lands'. Initial results from community workshops show that the institutional arrangements for these arable lands vary widely and, with them, the capacity to utilise any new technology that may have application to them. Rather than simply draw on social capital, if a participatory research approach is to enhance the agency of the participating communities, it may need to contribute to social capital building and especially to create a dialogical space in which the matters being researched can be discussed meaningfully.

    "abstract": "Abstract Transformation of indigenous vegetation for production purposes impacts negatively on biodiversity but does this necessarily equate with a decrease in phytomass accumulation, which may influence carbon sequestration? Phytomass accumulation was studied for common land covers of beef ranching or dairy farming under private tenure, plantation forestry, crops and rangelands of communal areas, and conservation areas in the southern Drakensberg. Annual turnover in above-ground phytomass (AGP) was estimated by harvesting at seasonal extremes, or at bimonthly intervals for grasslands and pastures. Peak root biomass was estimated by coring. Tree biomass (44792 g m−2) of pine plantations unsurprisingly dwarfed total AGP (litter plus standing) of all other cover types, but total AGP of plantations even excluding trees was highest because of litter accumulation. Total AGP ranged from 82–1423 g m−2 in mid-summer and 215–1008 g m−2 in mid-winter. Total AGP was otherwise highest for commercial maize, followed by kikuyu pasture, conservation grassland, Eragrostis pasture, commercial rangeland, rangeland and maize under communal tenure, and least for annual ryegrass pasture. Intensively used pastures were therefore superior, equivalent, or inferior to indigenous grasslands in terms of phytomass accumulation, depending on the pasture and grassland compared. Excluding plantations, total AGP consisted mainly of standing AGP. Graminoids contributed >83% of standing AGP for all cover types except communal maize (54%); necromass contributed 33–47% for grasslands or pastures in mid-summer, and 86–93% for all in midwinter except ryegrass pasture (49%). Root biomass varied sixfold among cover types (648–4128 g m−2) and contributed greater than 75% to total phytomass (root, litter, standing AGP) for all cover types except maize (46%). Although soil stocks of carbon are usually far greater than vegetation stocks in grassland, significant increases in vegetation stocks can be achieved through choice of land use and management.

The data was subjected to one-way and multivariate analyses of variance. Highly preferred plants had a higher concentration of CP, phosphorous (P) and magnesium (Mg) in their edible forage compared to the medium or least preferred plants. Individual preferences of sheep were not, however, associated with the rumen degradability parameters. Principal component analysis revealed that highly preferred plants had lower NDF, manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn), and higher CP, calcium, P, Mg and potassium values compared to the least preferred plants. In contrast, medium preferred plants exhibited inconsistent patterns, with a tendency to have higher sodium chloride and sodium, and lower Mn, Zn and copper, concentrations in the forage.

Frameworks and monitoring systems developed with their associated indicators are often complex and inaccessible to land users who lack the advanced equipment to implement them, and the relevant training to analyse and interpret monitoring results. After reviewing the challenges and opportunities in rangeland monitoring, this paper describes the local-level monitoring (LLM) conceptual tool, which is flexible, adaptive and easy to use by local land users for monitoring and documenting changes in natural resources and livestock conditions in order to guide and support management responses accordingly. As a concept, the LLM approach is currently being tested and implemented by agricultural extension services in the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District municipality (North West province, South Africa). At this stage, the LLM concept should be seen as a continuous and evolving learning process that will be updated over the long term through decision support to include several other components essential to implement effective and sustainable rangeland management practices by local land users.

In this paper, I propose that communal rangelands in South Africa be recognised as complex social–ecological systems and that one of the reasons that development initiatives have had little impact on improving livelihoods and rangeland condition is that interventions have been based on reductionist thinking that has failed to recognise non-linearities and uncertainties in the system. This complexity resides in ecological, social and economic components of the system, and is characterised by dynamics operating at different scales within and beyond the boundaries of the rangelands. People and the environment are vulnerable to change in these systems from factors such as changing climate, economics, governance arrangements, as well as disasters. Policy that promotes adaptability and resilience, and is itself responsive to changing dynamics, should be sought. Complex systems modelling with an inclusive group of stakeholders holds potential for realising such policy.",

The position of those who favour privatisation has been strengthened by the belief that the only environmentally sound way to manage the range is to subdivide it into private ranches because traditional open-range pastoralism is environmentally destructive. This point of view is at variance with an ever-increasing body of research. Insufficient attention has been given to the sustainable nature of communal rangeland in savanna areas and to the needs of the poor who depend upon them.

Pechuel-Loeschea leubnitziae (wild sage) is a multistemmed, aromatic shrub, occurring in Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and the northern regions of South Africa, that colonises disturbed regions on sandy, alkaline soils. The influence of differing levels of P. leubnitziae cover on soil seed-bank characteristics and aboveground herbaceous species composition was determined by examining aboveground species composition, recorded in the field, and soil seed-bank species composition, determined by recording germinations from topsoil samples collected at each of 104 sites in the southern Okavango Delta. No correlation was observed between aboveground and soil seed-bank composition (p = 0.209). Cover of P. leubnitziae did not affect soil seed-bank species composition (p = 0.31) or the grass:non-grass ratio within the seed bank (p = 0.308). It did, however, affect aboveground grass composition (p = 0.018), with increasing P. leubnitziae cover associated with increasing abundance of poor-quality, shade-tolerant grass species. This confirms the observations that encroachment of P. leubnitziae may be associated with a decrease in veld quality and carrying capacity, and highlights the necessity for further study to facilitate a better understanding of the species for management purposes.",

In the semi-arid savannas of Africa, alien shrub invasion often occurs simultaneously with native shrub encroachment but climate-dependent differences in encroachments of native and alien shrubs have never been properly quantified. A combination of historical aerial photographs and field measurements was used to compare the spread of the invasive shrub Lantana camara L. with that of native encroaching shrubs over a 31-year period in a protected semi-arid savanna in Zimbabwe, southern Africa. We tested whether the response of this invasive alien shrub to rainfall differs from that of native shrub encroachers. Both the invasive shrub L. camara and native encroaching shrubs spread significantly faster during high rainfall years than in dry years. However, the response of L. camara to annual rainfall was stronger than the response of native encroaching shrubs. During years of above-average rainfall, the mean annual rate of spread of L. camara was at least twice that of native shrub encroachers, whereas in other years natives spread at the same rate as the alien shrub. This is a novel finding suggesting that in water-limited savannas, pulses in rainfall may accelerate the spread of some invasive alien species.",

However, the sustainability of this practice has been questioned for many years. This led to the establishment of a long-term stocking-density trial in 1988 at the Carnarvon Research Station. The trial was designed on a three-camp rotational grazing system under four stocking densities (8, 7, 5.5 and 4 ha SSU–1). Following continuous treatment over 28 years, the results from a once-off assessment in February 2016 portrayed no significant differences between treatments with regard to plant height, cover, species diversity, ecological and grazing index scores. Animal production varied among treatments where the mean production per hectare was found to be the highest under the high stocking-density treatment. Due to the absence of historical data, the results from this study are not conclusive with regards to changes in the vegetation dynamics over time and therefore does not lend itself to making conclusions concerning stocking densities. It can, however, be concluded that the vegetation of the Western Upper Karoo is remarkably resilient to the perceived higher stocking densities set at the time, on condition that an appropriate grazing management strategy is applied.",

The present study examined the effect of different plant-community rehabilitation treatments on arthropods after strip mining in the arid Namaqualand region of South Africa. Vegetation cover and plant species richness were significantly lower at all rehabilitated sites compared with those at a reference site. Arthropod species richness did not differ amongst the different treatments and the reference site. Except for the most recently rehabilitated site, arthropod abundance in all guilds was higher at all treatments compared with that of the reference site. Overall arthropod abundance was positively correlated to plant cover and negatively correlated to plant species richness, but these vegetation characteristics had no effect on arthropod species richness. This may be explained by a high cover of pioneer plants at the rehabilitated sites, which offer ample food for generalist arthropod taxa. Arthropod community composition differed significantly between treatments. We demonstrate that rehabilitation of ecosystem function after mining in arid systems is a lengthy process, even after implementation of intensive rehabilitation protocols. We also show that arthropod communities provide additional insights into the level of ecosystem recovery otherwise obscured when only considering plant community data.",

Forbs contribute more to species richness than grasses in South African grasslands. However, little is known about the impact of grazing and grass competition on the population dynamics of forbs. The aim of this study was to determine the response of three mesic grassland perennial forb species to simulated intensive defoliation and interspecific competition from a neighbouring dominant grass, Themeda triandra, in a field experiment. Two of the selected forb species are sensitive to defoliation (Afroaster hispida and Gerbera ambigua) and one is potentially resistant to defoliation (Hypoxis hemerocallidea). Defoliation resulted in smaller plants of all three species following regrowth. Only A. hispida showed an interaction response to defoliation and competition. Thus, a competitive release was observed for A. hispida in that the height of defoliated plants was reduced by 45% compared with undefoliated plants under full competition, but there was no difference under partial or no competition. Gerbera ambigua was unaffected by competition. Hypoxis hemerocallidea was sensitive to competition irrespective of being defoliated or undefoliated. Findings of this study highlighted an individual response such that a general response cannot be predicted.",

Digestibility increased with nitrogen content and both of these variables are decreasing when the dry matter and fibre contents increased. Four groups of species were obtained, based on digestibility and nitrogen and lignin contents. A. halimus and L. creticus harvested in the winter of 2015 have superior forage quality. A. mollis was better able to regenerate after winter harvest. Forage quality of C. ciliaris and L. creticus decreased with seasonal variation.

    "abstract": "Documented increases in woody plant abundance worldwide can reduce land value and grazing capacity. Throughout many grasslands and savannas in South Africa, Seriphium plumosum, an encroaching woody plant, has been rapidly displacing desirable native species. Cost-effective management techniques are required, in order to prevent encroachment. However, the effects of fire and grazing on S. plumosum are not well understood. We established a full factorial, completely randomised experiment to evaluate interactive effects of fire and livestock grazing on woody plant density and native plant diversity. Sixteen 100 m2 plots were aggregated within an area of rangeland and randomly assigned four treatments, including: i) ungrazed, not burned: ii) ungrazed, burned, iii) grazed, not burned, and iv) grazed, burned. Results indicate fire can reduce S. plumosum height (p < 0.01) and canopy cover (p < 0.01), while simultaneously maintaining the herbaceous community composition (p = 0.33). However, this treatment effect was not significant 24 months after a single treatment. This suggests that although fire holds promise for S. plumosum management, follow-up treatments are necessary to control the shrub. Additional research into the effects of altering components of the fire regime in combination with grazing could provide insight into more effective management.",

Parameters recorded were height of shoot apex, tiller mass, number of new lateral tillers and time of flowering. Monitoring of marked tillers before and after each burn enabled the life history of populations of tillers to be followed. In all species investigated, flowering was found to be of minimal importance with most tillers remaining vegetative until death. Shoot apices remained close to the soil surface (<20 mm) enabling them to survive frequent burns. All species exhibited smooth survivorship curves, suggesting that dramatic fluctuations in climate and severe defoliation, as by fire, had little impact on mortality. The differential response of the four grass species was explained by their different reproductive capacities and reproductive rates. The predicted responses to fire regime were verified by changes that took place at the study area from 1981 to 2019, showing the importance of applying appropriate burning regimes to maintain the bud bank. A biennial spring burn was best for maintaining these important grass species at current levels of abundance in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is one of the main challenges facing humanity in the coming century. To understand the impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, we urgently require a better understanding of plant responses to climate change. To address this knowledge gap we established a full-factorial warming experiment using open-top chambers (OTCs) inside a long-term fire-manipulation experiment in Afromontane fire-climax grasslands. Fire is an essential ecosystem driver in these grasslands, but has rarely been included in experimental climate change research. To assess growth responses to elevated temperatures and fire frequency, we measured four functional traits: vegetative height, leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Grasses responded to fire exclusion with increased height, and lower LA, SLA, and LDMC. Grasses responded to warming with lower height and LA, and higher LDMC, suggesting that plant growth was negatively affected by warming. This response was mostly attributed to intra-specific trait variability, highlighting an important role for trait plasticity in community-level processes to mediate the response of montane grassland communities to elevated temperatures and associated drought effects. These results are a first step towards establishing a more mechanistic basis for understanding future climatic changes in Afromontane grasslands.",

Regarding forage provision, we found effects of management for the savanna, where, irrespective of rainfall, rotational grazing management resulted in higher phytomass and phytomass–cover ratios than management with continuous grazing. In the grassland, however, this difference was only discernible for phytomass–cover ratio in two years with above-average antecedent rainfall. This suggests that management effects are biome-dependent and that modulating effects of annual rainfall are stronger in the grassland. In either biome, management effects on the dominance of increaser and decreaser species were negligible, i.e. rangeland condition did not differ across management types in either biome. We conclude that investigations on management effects should account for interactions with biome and rainfall.",

However, the response of different plant functional types and communities to such intense livestock impact may vary depending on local context. We thus examined the effects of short-duration overnight kraaling on soil and vegetation characteristics in a mesic montane grassland in South Africa using paired kraal and control sites, as part of a low intensity grazing approach. Kraaling increased soil P and S, as well as soil organic matter (except when initial values were over 12%). The effect of kraaling on vegetation was strongly dependent on initial condition. Basal cover of grasses and forbs increased by approximately 50 and 15%, respectively, if sites had very low initial basal cover, but decreased by up to 15% if initial values were over 50% and 10%, respectively. Kraaling always decreased herbaceous biomass, but especially when initial values were over 2 000 kg ha−1. In mesic grasslands, short-duration overnight kraaling is promising as a tool for rehabilitating degraded sites or fertilizing abandoned cropland, but should be avoided where the grass sward is intact. We recommend that the suitability of kraaling be evaluated per vegetation type and local context.",

Cover estimates for each vegetation type were obtained using object-based classification techniques and a non-parametric random forest classifier algorithm in eCognition Trimble software. Results show that over the two decades under investigation (1996–2019), trees declined (−10.6%), and the shrub-grass mosaic vegetation type increased (8.1%) across the park. The largest decline in trees occurred in the western land use areas (−36%), which also experienced the greatest increase in the shrub-grass mosaic (17%), when compared with areas in the east (11%). Variation of woody cover estimates is attributed to different seasonal fire management practices in the east versus the west of the park. The fire history (2000–2018) revealed that late dry season fires were frequent in the west, whereas in the east, early dry season fires were frequent. The stages of encroachment recorded in this study have consequences for biodiversity, people’s livelihoods, and tourism.",

Quantifying the long-term impacts of nutrient enrichment on grasslands contributes to understanding eutrophication effects on grassland, particularly for grasslands adapted to low soil nutrient status. Overextended time periods, nutrient enrichment may modify soil fertility. The Ukulinga Grassland Nutrient Experiment situated on a natural C4 grassland was set up in 1951 on the Ukulinga research farm, South Africa. Continuously applied treatments on plots measuring 2.7 × 9 m include combinations of nitrogen at 0, 7, 14 and 21 g m−2 per annum, phosphorus at 0 and 2.8 g m−2 per annum and lime at 0 and 225 g m−2 applied every five years. Nitrogen sources included ammonium sulphate (acidifying) and limestone ammonium nitrate (less acidifying). Grass species composition was influenced by both nitrogen forms. In contrast, forb species composition was more sensitive to LAN. We found evidence of nitrogen limitation on aboveground net-primary production. However, species richness (for grass and forbs) declined with increasing ammonium sulphate levels, owing to increased soil acidity and high aluminium concentrations. Aluminium toxicity can affect overall species composition by replacing Al-sensitive species with Al-tolerant species on site.",

Moreover, human activities can also drive changes in these components and their interactions. There are few long-term datasets available to monitor these changes over ecologically relevant time-scales. Here the combined analysis of a rainfall proxy, developed from a baobab tree core (Adansonia digitata) and fire proxy, from a sediment core, in the savanna-woodland transition zone in South Central Africa elucidates the history of two major drivers of savanna structure for the past 600 years. They show a system that oscillates between wooded and grassy vegetation states over time, as well as a change in the spatial scale of fires, which could be linked to human activities and recent fire management legislation.",

Eight grass species in the Highland Sourveld of Natal showed clear responses along a gradient of grazing intensity, and were abundant over at least a portion of this gradient.

All camps were rested every fourth year during which recovery growth yields were measured. Differences in floristic composition between camps at the end of the trial were small and were associated with spatial variations in composition on the experimental site rather than with the applied grazing treatments. Although palatable grasses, such as Themeda triandra and Tristachya leucothrix, were still dominant in 1991, the unpalatable grass Aristida junciformis increased in abundance in all treatments during the last seventeen years of the trial. The extent of this increase did not, however, vary (P≥0.05) between treatments. The mean recovery yield over all rest years did not differ (P≥0.05) between treatments because of inconsistencies in treatment effects between years, particularly during the last three grazing cycles (1977–1988). It is concluded that multicamp systems employing short periods of occupation and long rests between grazings, cannot be justified in terms of their purported ability to improve plant productivity and veld condition. However, a limited degree of camping may facilitate management of temporal and spatial variations in vegetation composition and productivity.",

This study was initiated to determine the effects of patch grazing on (1) the vigour of a single grass species, Themeda triandra, and of the sward, and (2) sward species composition. The generally held idea that a full season's rest followed by an early spring burn would prevent preferential grazing of patch grazed areas which had developed in the seasons before the rest was also tested. The vigour of 71 triandra was estimated from etiolated growth of marked tufts while sward vigour was indexed by above‐ground herbage production (AGHP). Etiolated growth of T. triandra and AGHP of the sward within patches were negatively affected by three seasons of grazing, but a full season's rest appeared sufficient to restore both the etiolated growth of T. triandra and the AGHP of the sward to a level similar to that in the non‐patches. A full season's rest followed by spring burning did not, however, prevent preferential grazing of grazed patches which had developed in the seasons prior to the rest. Species composition within patches (characterised by Increaser II species) differed significantly from the species composition of non‐patches (characterised by Increaser I species). Patch grazing may therefore initiate the rangeland degradation process in Highland Sourveld and patch grazing may be the focus from which rangeland degradation proceeds.",

The merits of this grazing system, where relatively large numbers of livestock are herded into numerous small paddocks for short timespans with long rests between grazings, have not been formally evaluated in a long-term monitoring experiment in the Karoo. In this study we used exclosures (controls) on a 7 000 ha farm in the Central Lower Karoo, camped into approximately 50-ha paddocks, to evaluate the impact of this grazing system on certain vegetation parameters. We report on the first four years of monitoring, after each of four replicate paddocks had received four treatments (one treatment = 40 - 60 Large Stock Unit grazing days per hectare over a period of 2 - 16 days). Concentrated defoliation with concomitant trampling, dunging, and urinating did not influence the perennial species composition, and cover of this grassy, semi-arid shrubland. Changes over time in plant composition, and cover are explained by annual, and short-term (e.g. quarterly) rainfall rather than by grazing impacts. Ephemerals were not favoured by this grazing system, but litter was more abundant in the treatment than the control areas. The dominant grass, Eragrostis lebmanniana, and shrub, Pentzia incana, are resilient to this defoliation regime, and show signs of compensatory growth. As yet there is no evidence that non-selective grazing increases diversity, but the severe defoliation and trampling may enhance the biomass turnover rate, resulting in more vigorous, and productive plants in the grazed areas. Diversity is unlkely to change rapidly in response to grazing, largely because of the persistence of grazing-tolerant perennials. Concentrating mixed herds of livestock onto small areas with lengthy rests can be a useful tool for 'kick-starting' moribund karoo veld into greater productivity. Several of the impacts hold potential for restoring the rangeland quality of degraded areas, but this needs to be tested.",

Based on vegetation surveys conducted at three enclosed sites at the Messina Experimental Farm during the period 1964 to 2001, no clear fixed grass species establishment sequence was observed. The classic plant succession model of the grass component, as usually found in other veld types, is absent in Mopani veld of the Limpopo Valley. Shallow, nutrient poor, gravelly, severely eroded soils with low moisture retention and a high runoff rate are mainly colonised by annual grasses and forbs. Perennial grasses take long to establish. This results in an unstable herbaceous component that is vulnerable to changes, which in turn depends on the erratic availability of soil moisture. Where the woody component is concerned, eight tree species appeared to be early colonisers, five intermediate colonisers and seven late colonisers. Tree numbers increased at sites with deeper soils, indicating that bush encroachment is a general, natural process that occurs irrespective of rest treatments applied to the herbaceous component. At a site with an extremely shallow soil, bush density decreased, suggesting that the bush encroachment process in the Limpopo Valley is much more affected by soil and climate than in other veld types and climatic zones of the Limpopo Province.",

The study was conducted on seven rehabilitated discard dumps situated on the Mpumalanga Highveld, South Africa. Vegetation was assessed according to its composition, basal, crown and ground cover.

Results showed that MY was significantly correlated (P = 0.05) with BCS and NDFh, but not with RF and CPh. The correlation with Tm, HY and HG were not significant. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that milk yield increased with body condition and declined with herbage yield according to the model: MY = 3.70∗BCS–3.90∗HY–6.67. This implied that throughout most of the year, cows depended on mobilisation of body reserves built in the wet season to meet the requirements for milk production. As herbage matured, milk yield declined because cows could not maintain the dietary quality needed for optimal digestion and feed intake. Cows fed to maintain good body condition yielded more milk. Therefore, to minimise maturity, appropriate stocking rates should be applied to maintain young herbage and sustain milk yield.",

    "abstract": "The effect of four levels of water availability on the yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of five subtropical perennial grasses was evaluated in a small plot trial under a rain shelter. The soil profiles were brought to 100% (W4 = the control), 75% (W3), 50% (W2) and 25% (W1) of field capacity on a weekly basis. Under W4 (control) and W3 conditions, yields did not differ significantly from each other. Where water became less available (W2 and W1), yields were significantly reduced, in comparison with the control (W4). Buffel grass, a drought-tolerant species, produced yields (11.7–20.0t ha−1) under moderate to severe water restriction (W1, W2 and W3), which were comparable with yields obtained with adequate water (W4) for traditionally-irrigated grasses such as couch grass (12.0–15.8t ha−1) and kikuyu (5.6–11.8t ha−1). All five grass species tended to use water more efficiently under moderate to severe water-limiting conditions (W1 and W2) than under control conditions (W4). These results also indicate that traditionally drought-tolerant grass species should not be overlooked when identifying species for use under irrigation.",

To test its impact on grass biomass, nitrogen (N) mineralisation and seedling establishment, grazing and coloniser density were controlled using experimental exclosures and weeding treatments separately in a factorial design. Grass biomass increased 47% in weeding treatments and 117% with protection from grazing. Ipomoea hildebrandtii removal also led to decline in soil moisture at at a depth of 5 cm and an increase at 30 cm, and lower soil compaction. Grazing lowered soil moisture and increased soil compaction. Mineralisation of N was highest under the dominant grass Chloris roxburghiana followed by I. hildebrandtii and bare ground. Weeding increased N mineralisation whereas grazing lowered it. Multiple regression showed that I. hildebrandtii seedling establishment was significantly higher with low grass biomass, high soil moisture at a depth of 30 cm and higher soil N nitrification. Thus weeding, which caused an increase in the latter two factors, led to increased seedling establishment. Grazing, which lowered soil moisture and mineralisation, led to lower seedling establishment despite reduced competition from lowered grass biomass. This shows invasibility by I. hildebrandtii in rangelands increases when lowered competition is accompanied by an increase in soil resources such as moisture and nitrogen, thus supporting the resource fluctuation theory.",

A survey of livestock owners and an experimental study of impacts of cattle on restoration processes were conducted to develop better knowledge of the perceptions of livestock owners neighbouring the mine, and the impacts of their cattle on rehabilitating coastal dune forest. Shortages of grazing and livestock diseases were perceived to be the major constraints on livestock operations. Mitigation included grazing cattle in the rehabilitating forest and treating livestock diseases with available medicinal plant species. An exclosure experiment in one of the older stands undergoing restoration showed that cattle grazing reduced grass biomass and Acacia kosiensis seedling recruitment. A study of seeds collected from cattle dung showed that Psidium guajava, an important invasive alien woody species, was dispersed by cattle into the rehabilitating forest, but passage through cattle did not enhance germination of the invasive species. The study concluded that: (1) the proximity of livestock owners to large-scale commercial land uses influenced their perceptions and their resources, and (2) grazing and trampling by cattle in the rehabilitating dune forest may hinder the ecological restoration process.",

Accordingly, fecundity, predation, mortality by fire, dispersal by livestock, and seed longevity were studied. Seed production per tree (P of pod production, pods per tree) was positively related to tree height, negatively related to tree density, and was greater for sites receiving run-on. Predispersal predation by bruchids, cerambycids, and wasps depleted seed production by 18%. The ant Messor capensis effectively eliminated surface seed except during the early dry season following seed shed. Rodent predation of seed was minimal. Fires >100 °C killed most exposed seed but a thin layer of soil increased survival and maintained germinability. A greater proportion of ingested seeds passed through cattle (57%) and sheep (50%) than through goats (15%). 50% of seeds were recovered within 48 h. During passage, soft seeds were digested, some hard seeds were softened, but most were egested as hard seeds; germinability was not increased. Cattle were confirmed as dispersal agents. Using experimental seed banks, it was shown that buried or surface-exposed seeds did not persist for longer than a year, but 24% of surface-shaded seeds persisted for two years. Most seeds germinated but most buried seeds died before emergence. Seed persistence in deep shade should facilitate invasion into grassland. Seed banks of. A. karroo did not exceed 18 seeds m−2 because of the above-described effects. Seed availability (fecundity, dispersal by cattle, seed longevity) is concluded to contribute to the invasiveness of A. karroo, but use of fire may offer partial control of seed availability.

A total of 786 farmers (268 from coastal lowlands, 171 from eastern midlands, 132 from central highlands and 215 from north-western highlands) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire between September 2013 and March 2014. The data analysis was carried out using logistic regression models to evaluate the determinants of adoption of forages and production niches. Land tenure, access to formal education and experience in livestock farming positively and significantly (p < 0.1) influenced the adoption of forages. In contrast, distance to market, farm and household size negatively influenced the adoption of forages. Gender, age, off/non-farm income and number of livestock did not influence adoption of forages. Farm size, agro-ecological zone and type of livestock management system influenced the choice of niches for forage production significantly (p < 0.001). Land tenure did not influence the choice of forage production niche. Improving access to education and secure land tenure can enhance the adoption of forages. Research should focus on developing a decision support tool for assisting farmers to select suitable niches for integrating forages in the farming system.Keywords: agro-ecological zones, chi-square, crop–livestock farming system, cultivated forages, logistic regression model",

Selection by ruminants was associated with grass greenness and grass height, <10 cm for black and blue wildebeest, and >11 cm for red hartebeest. The non-ruminant zebra were more generalist, but selected for wetlands in all seasons, as did red hartebeest and blue wildebeest. Each species modified its behaviour during the late dry season by searching more for biomass or accepting grass that was less green or longer. The presence of burnt patches did not affect patch selection by any study species. Accordingly, large herbivore resource use showed strong seasonal adaptations, wetlands were important for sustaining sympatric species in the study area, and none of the species used the exact same combination of resources.",

Therefore this study assessed grass above ground biomass (AGB) at various levels of wattle invasion In assessing the impacts of wattle invasion on grass AGB the study found that, wattle invasion significantly reduces grass AGB when, compared with uninvaded and cleared plots. Mean grass AGB was 89.64 g m−2, 43.87 g m−2 and 83.36 g m−2 for the cleared, moderately invaded and uninvaded, respectively. The study further found no significant differences between cleared and uninvaded plots (p = 0.826). However, moderately invaded plots were significantly lower than the cleared (p < 0.0001) and uninvaded plots (p = 0.001). In assessing the applicability of remotely sensed data, the findings of this study showed that the most influential variables in estimating biomass were red-edge-based VIs. Specifically, the simple ratio VI (band5/band2) was the most optimal variable for predicting grass AGB across various levels of wattle invasion yielding high accuracies (root mean square error of prediction [RMSEP] = 19.11 g m−2 and R2 = 0.83). Additionally, PLSR results showed that the moderately invaded treatment was most optimally predicted with RMSEP of 13.06 g m−2.

A seasonal pattern was observed with the lowest Nf concentrations recorded during late winter, which correlated with the seasonal phenology pattern (leaf carriage) of the winter-deciduous tree species. The Nf concentrations (g N kg−1 dung DM) of giraffe ranged from 18.3 (late winter) to 36.7 (summer) and that of kudu from 13.6 to 33.2. Likewise, the Nf of impala ranged from 16.9 to 28.0 and that of eland from 16.3 to 34.9. Access to evergreen woody species during the late-winter period proved to be essential in avoiding condition loss that corresponds with Nf levels below published critical levels (<16). In the absence of evergreen species, supplementary feeding is essential. Faecal nitrogen proved to be a useful indicator of seasonal trends in the nutritional status of browsing game species.",

Although all three species produce white thorns, the pseudo-galls of V. gerrardii and V. drepanolobium are dark coloured. In contrast, pseudo-galls of V. seyal var. fistula are white. Associated with this, they are thin-walled and poorly used by aggressive mutualistic ants. We suggest that this weak functionality is compensated for by the highly visible white colour. This aposematism may also involve mimicry as only the fistula variety of V. seyal has galls and only this variety co-occurs with other Vachellia species that have functional galls. Vachellia seyal seyal does not have pseudo-galls and this variety does not occur with other Vachellia species that have pseudo-galls.",

Understanding how livestock diet and season affects the decomposition dynamics is critical to nutrient cycling models. We hypothesised that livestock diet and season of the year affect dung decomposition. This study evaluated the decomposition and release of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na from faeces of cattle collected in dry and wet seasons. Treatments were signalgrass (Brachiaria decumbens Stapf) in monoculture or mixed with sabiá (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth.) or gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp.). Excreta samples were incubated in nylon bags for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 d. The single negative exponential mathematical model was adequate (P < 0.0001) to explain the decomposition. The relative rate of dung decomposition (k) was greater for samples that originated from cattle grazed on signalgrass (k = 0.00284 g g−1 d−1), followed by sabiá (k = 0.00233 g g−1 d−1), and gliricidia (k = 0.00200 g g−1 d−1) pastures. The rate of nutrient release showed a time effect for all variables and interaction between time and season for Ca (P = 0.0042) and Mg (P = 0.0013). Faeces collected from cattle grazing/browsing intercropped pastures tended to have lower decomposition rates.",

In the greenhouse, seedlings growing with heavily clipped grasses had higher biomass production than those competing with moderately clipped grasses. Root/shoot ratios were higher in treatments with undipped grasses. There was a negative relationship between grass root production and A. karroo biomass production. The field experiment was carried out in two paddocks, one previously heavily‐grazed and the other lightly‐grazed. Grazing in both paddocks was simulated by artificial defoliation. Generally more A. karroo seedlings emerged under lightly defoliated treatments. Clipping frequency had a strong effect (P=0.066) on the survival of emerged seedlings during the wet season. There were no differences in survival rate at the end of the dry season. Though grass defoliation was shown to enhance seedling growth under controlled conditions, no evidence was found to suggest that seedling establishment during the first year is influenced by the intensity of grass defoliation.",

The approach was to compute six dissimilarity indices for data on vegetation cover and composition from paired, site‐specific surveys across farm boundaries. Fence‐lines were buffered using the ARC/INFO GIS, and a soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was computed from Landsat Thematic Mapper data of the area. Two dissimilarity indices were computed for paired pixel sets of SAVI values and statistically analysed for differences between their means. These satellite‐derived dissimilarity values were correlated with the indices from the rangeland survey data to test whether the satellite measures could be used to identify and quantify artificial boundary events. The results indicate that it is feasible to detect and quantify fence‐line differences in range condition with the use of satellite imagery that is registered to other relevant geographical data.",

Changes in grass species composition and soil nutrient status were measured The study site, situated on the Athi-Kapiti plains of central Kenya, comprised of an ungulate exclusion camp, subjected to an annual mow, and an adjacent control plot, exposed to herbivory from cattle and game. Significant changes were noted in four of the seventeen grass species. Relative percentages of Pennisetum mezianum and P. stramineum increased significantly within the mowed/exclusion plot, while those of Microchloa kunthii and Sporobolus iocladus showed a significant drop. No significant differences were noted in relative frequency of grass species designated as 'decreasers', or in basal cover index. Analysis of soils inside the mowed/exclusion plot showed significantly higher soil pH, and soil Ca levels, but significantly lower plant available soil P and inorganic N, when compared to the control plot. The long-term treatment of mowing/herbivore exclusion, has resulted in severe depletion of plant available soil P and inorganic soil N. Results suggest that differences in species composition can be primarily attributed to the lower defoliation levels, and shading effects inside the exclusion plot, while differences in soil nutrient status can be attributed primarily to the export of nutrients with bailed hay, and to the absence of the stimulating effect that large herbivores have on nutrient recycling. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that herbivory plays an important role in maintaining P recycling in plant available forms, particularly for soils where P may be limiting.",

It was considered desirable that soil surface condition should also be described to provide an index of landscape function and a threshold of critical resource control. Tongway and Hindley's (1995) soil surface condition assessment technique, termed Landscape Function Analysis (LFA), was applied to rangelands in the Peddie District, Eastern Cape Province. Samples were collected across a fenceline between commercial and communal rangeland management systems. At each sample site, the LFA technique was applied, and soil samples were collected to determine major nutrient content. At the landscape organisation level, the technique yielded conclusive differences between the contrasting rangelands. The commercial site contained grass swards which would be able to control water and nutrient flow across the landscape. In the communal rangeland, vegetation cover was lower and presented weaker barriers to water and nutrient movement across the landscape. The soil surface condition index did not provide clear differences between the two sites. LFA indices provided indirect measures of these differences in landscape function. Surface soil conditions on the communal rangeland had higher organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content. Following the analysis of satellite-derived vegetation indices, the commercial site had higher active green biomass (higher NDVI) and lower spatial diversity of near-infra red band (lower MSDI) than the communal site.

An experimental rehabilitation study of degraded succulent thicket was initiated to determine whether increasing the patchiness on the landscape would result in an increase in soil resources. Five types of treatments were used for the rehabilitation trials, namely: piles of black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) dung placed so as to mimic rhino latrines; Portulacaria afra brushpiles; brushpiles of woody Thicket species; brushpiles of woody Thicket species over-sown with seed; and the control (area left unchanged). Measurement occurred before and three years after treatment and change was related to an untransformed reference site. All of the treatments did increase the litter in the patches, which resulted in an increase in soil organic content especially in the top 3cm of soil. All of the rehabilitation patches were successful in accumulating basic elements (pH and electrical conductivity results) as well as available phosphorus. The dung treatment had the greatest effect on the soil resources underneath and surrounding the patches. The dung treatment significantly increased the electrical conductivity as well as the available phosphorus and available organic nitrogen. The rehabilitation trial has shown that by increasing the patchiness of degraded areas in succulent thicket it is possible to initiate \"islands of fertility\".",

The aim was to examine the influence of moisture-deficit stress on physiological attributes and performance of the four Indigofera species. Based on plant available water (PAW) levels, three moisture levels were applied (no stress or 70–100% PAW, 40–70% PAW and 10–40% PAW) as experimental treatments and imposed on each species in a randomised complete block design with four replications. Moisture stress significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the total leaf area of I. amorphoides at moderate levels and that of I. vicioides at the most severe moisture stress level. The relative growth rate was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in I. amorphoides but not in I. arrecta, I. coerulea or I. vicioides plants subjected to moisturedeficit stress. The reduction in total dry matter yield was due to the effect of moisture stress in reducing both leaf area and leaf area ratio. Drought stress-tolerance indices were not different (p > 0.05) for I. arrecta or I. coerulea grown under no stress and moisture-deficit stress conditions. The root mass fractions of I. amorphoides and I. arrecta were substantially increased (p < 0.05) due to moisture stress. Water-use efficiency was low in I. amorphoides under water deficit conditions, while that of I. vicioides was higher under severe stress conditions compared to non-stress conditions. Transpiration efficiency was, however, higher at moderate moisture-deficit stress levels than under non-stressed or severely stressed plants. Generally, the species investigated exhibited significant variation in terms of physiological attributes and performance response to moisture-deficit stress. Indigofera amorphoides was relatively sensitive while I. vicioides was able to maintain unabated growth under water stress conditions. This is highly relevant to programmes aimed at identifying suitable species as a source of fodder for livestock exposed to long dry seasons and frequent drought phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The Namibian rangelands consist of a mixture of herbaceous and woody components. The main source of income is from farming systems with grass production the predominant source of forage. For rangeland managers to utilise this source sustainably, the accurate determination of grazing capacity is vital since it allows for adapting the animal load, and therefore the grazing pressure, to the actual capacity of the land. Various practical approaches and methodologies were investigated to update the existing Namibian grazing capacity map that was compiled more than three decades ago from the expert, but nonetheless subjective, opinion of farmers, extension officers and pasture scientists. The methodologies studied in this paper include the estimation of seasonal herbaceous biomass production using satellite imagery, land cover mapping and the quantitative yield method of determining available forage. It is expected that combining all these methods (information from remote sensing, adjusted with scientifically established coefficients for woody cover, accessibility and palatability and the incorporation of the clipping technique [quantitative yield method] as a ground truthing mechanism) will provide a tool to objectively establish rangeland productivity and thus grazing capacity in Namibia.",

The findings suggest that the diversity of plant communities and traits of S. tenacissima are strongly affected by the management regime. Diversity is higher under seasonal grazing. Traits, such as leaf water content, specific leaf area and bio-volume are higher under seasonal grazing, compared with continuous grazing and/or sites fenced off to prevent grazing.

Although the Nama Karoo is generally resilient to grazing and most responsive to variable rainfall, chronic overstocking, particularly in the driest regions and around water points, could degrade vegetation and soils. The interactive effects of rainfall (MAP) and grazing (stocking rate, percentage overstocking, resting system) on plant species composition and soil chemical characteristics were examined on 36 farms across a regional rainfall gradient (120–300 mm y−1) and around water points (n = 3) on farms. Multivariate direct gradient analyses revealed regional species compositional differences were related most strongly to MAP (r = 0.736), but not to grazing, with no MAP × grazing interaction. On a smaller scale, grazing intensity (1/distance from water point) had a weak negative impact on the vegetation (r = 0.36) and soil chemistry (r = 0.49) with nutrient enrichment around water points in paddocks. Our findings suggest that the Karoo is responsive to rainfall, but loosely coupled to grazing.

An ecological rangeland assessment was combined with participatory research methods to determine the diversity of feed resources in two wards of the Beitbridge District, namely Chamunangana and Joko. One hundred and twenty households were surveyed. All farmers depended on rangeland as the main feed resource. Some 87% of the respondents indicated that rangeland was not adequate, yet only 54% practiced supplementation. Participants predominantly used crop residues (40%), browse tree foliage (28%) and commercial feeds (22%) as supplements. Of the 46% who did not apply supplements, 53% attributed this to unavailability of feeding material and 29% were not aware of the importance, whereas the rest thought it unnecessary. Farmers in Chamunangana and those who milked their goats were more likely to supplement feed (p < 0.05). Respondents who supplemented had received training in goat husbandry (p < 0.05). The Shannon–Wiener diversity index (H′) was higher in Chamunangana (1.29), compared with Joko (1.19). There was no difference in biomass production between the study sites (p > 0.05). Improved goat nutrition could be achieved through farmer trainings in goat husbandry and incorporating available feeds into balanced rations.",

However, fire behaviour may change under increasing CO2 concentrations, due to altered flammability of the grassy layer. Here, we determined the effect of predicted future CO2 concentrations, and how it interacts with water-availability, on grass flammability and traits influential to flammability, and uncovered the physiological mechanisms underpinning these responses. Using the widespread C4 savanna grass, Themeda triandra, as a model, we found that improved water-use efficiency under elevated CO2 (800 ppm) resulted in a larger (greater aboveground biomass), but wetter (higher moisture content) grass fuel load, that cured at a slower rate under drought conditions. These changes were associated with increased time to ignition, reduced flaming times and reduced predicted rate of spread. We modelled the effect of altered grass flammability on fire behaviour at a national level (South Africa), finding large-scale reductions in fire spread under elevated CO2, mitigating the converse effects of predicted increases in aridity, and marginal increases in fireline intensity. CO2-induced reductions in fire frequency, spread or intensity could have serious implications for savanna vegetation dynamics, possibly exacerbating the woody encroachment already seen in these ecosystems across the world.",

Vegetation surveys were conducted at a protected site at the Towoomba Agricultural Development Centre during 1977 and 2000. Over the 23-year period, bush density at the site increased by 33%. Changes in the woody component indicated a shift from an acacia-dominated site to one dominated by broadleaved tree species. Early colonisers included mostly Acacia species (A. karroo, A. robusta, A. nilotica, A. gerrardii, A. tortilis, A. caffra, A. habeclada and A. mellifera), Dichrostachys cinerea and a few broadleaved species (Ximenia caffra, Dombeya rotundifolia and Searsia spp.). Intermediate colonisers included various shrubs (Diospyros lycioides, the Maytenus/Gymnosporia species group, Euclea species, Carissa bispinosa and Grewia spp.), a limited number of tree species (Pappea capensis, Boscia albitrunca and Ziziphus mucronata) and only two legumes (A. robusta and Peltophorum africanum). Late colonisers included only broadleaved shrubs and Waterberg Mountain Sourveld tree species (Grewia flavescens, Tarchonanthus camphoratus, Berchemia zeyerii, Cassine transvaalensis, Schotia brachypetala, Ximenia caffra, Heteropyxis natalensis, Terminalia sericea, Vangueria infausta and Searsia lancea). The leguminous and broadleaved components appeared to have distinct establishment sequences. Acacia spp. appeared to facilitate the early invasion of broadleaved woody species.",

Yet, the effects of fire on savanna ecosystems and especially on plant species is very much dependent on the nature of the fire regime. We assessed the effects of season of burning on herbaceous species dynamics and phytomass for four years (2006–2009). Neither fire season nor the interaction between year and fire season affected species richness, diversity, phytomass and dominant species (Andropogon chinensis (Nees) Merr.) abundance. There was, however, an interannual variation (p < 0.05) on all herbaceous species attributes except abundance of A. chinensis. This could be related to interannual variation in amount and frequency of rainfall. We also examined the whole species community using canonical correspondence analysis on the species data matrix and the fire treatment data matrix. There was no clear indication of some species showing affinity to a particular season of burning, although certain tendencies were observed. Overall, in the short-term (four years), there is no evidence of burning season affecting herbaceous species community in this ecosystem.",

Three aboveground treatments (full light competition, no light competition and clipping to simulate grazing), and two belowground treatments (full belowground competition and belowground competition excluded by a root tube), were used. On all soil depths the three grass species differed in mean mass, with E. racemosa having the least mass and T. triandra having the greatest mass. Simulated grazing by clipping the surrounding sward created niches for seedling establishment.

The actual gender relations within rural communities and the emergence of strategies that are being pursued in communal land processes are obscured and often ignored in policies about communal rangelands, which overemphasise ‘the ecological and economic impact’ and the balancing of these dimensions. As active, primary users, women play a central role in livelihoods supported by communal rangelands yet their access to land is mediated through their relationships with men, effectively circumventing women's land autonomy. A wider debate is necessary to advance the largely superficial policy considerations of women's position in relation to communal rangelands land and their social exclusion on the basis of traditional control of land, forms of access and claiming of use rights. The paper discusses the complexity of land rights under communal land tenure and argues that, despite traditional and policy barriers, women in traditional systems of male-dominated land rights have had some success in accessing communal rangelands. Greater policy impetus is necessary to leverage equitable and independent land access for women amidst debates about management of communal rangelands.",

Whilst much is known about the factors influencing mound density in natural settings, how termites respond to livestock grazing has been overlooked. We compared the characteristics and density of Trinervitermes trinervoides (Isoptera: Termitidae) mounds in the Karoo (South Africa) within an exclosure and continuously-grazed plot from a >75-year grazing experiment. Specifically, we asked whether long-term livestock grazing impacted (1) termite mound density, volume, basal area and size, (2) mound occupancy and age, (3) vegetation characteristics and (4) soil properties. Long-term grazing increased mound density two-fold. This was coupled with a decrease in mean mound size, an increase in the size of the largest mounds and range of mound sizes, and an increase in the proportion and numbers of young, active mounds. However, these changes did not alter landscape-scale mound basal area or volume. Vegetation was unaffected by long-term grazing but it did cause soil phosphorus, magnesium and calcium depletion. We suggest that livestock grazing provides additional forage resources for termites through litter breakup and dung production, leading to greater mound recruitment and thus densities, whilst allowing mounds to achieve greater maximum size.",

Our goal was to determine if visual obstruction could be used as a correlate to aboveground grass biomass in grassland systems in Namibia. We gathered clipping and visual obstruction samples at three study sites in Highland Savanna and Woodland Savanna in northern Namibia. Dry biomass of grass was correlated with visual obstruction readings when samples from all study sites were pooled (r 2 ≤0.64, P<0.0001), but the strength of the relationship varied among the three study sites. We also evaluated the number of samples needed to characterise biomass at a study site. Variation in the cumulative mean was very low at sample sizes of 15–20 samples.

The National Department of Agriculture has set a general stocking rate of 60 ha LSU−1 as a guideline for livestock on natural veld in the Little Karoo, which equates to 22.8 ha ostrich−1. The aim of this review is to examine the scientific principles, data and assumptions the current recommended stocking rate for breeding ostriches on natural veld in the Little Karoo is based on and to investigate if there is a stocking rate (or range of stocking rates) that has been demonstrated to be ecologically and/or economically sustainable. We found no evidence that the recommended stocking rate of 22.8 ha ostrich−1 is economically or ecologically sustainable in the Little Karoo. Most studies only addressed a single dimension of sustainability, and stocking rates deemed to be economically sustainable were several times higher than ecologically based recommendations. Given that economic and ecological objectives appear irreconcilable on open veld, an industry switch from extensive to intensive breeding practices may be a solution. Further research is required that integrates the socio-economic and ecological aspects of ostrich farming in the Little Karoo.",

These criteria were used to evaluate a widely used grassland sampling technique in South Africa – the nearest-plant (with 200 points) method (NP) – against common alternatives, namely NP excluding forbs (NP-nf), the plant number scale (PNS; a cover-abundance method) and quadrat frequency (QF), using multivariate ordination and permutation tests. Four trained teams surveyed four grasslands using each method. PNS took more than twice as long as the other techniques, which were similarly rapid. Estimates of composition using NP methods were the most precise and PNS was least repeatable, with QF intermediate. Compositional differences between sites were most finely distinguished using NP-nf, followed by NP and QF. PNS was able to detect only marked differences and had the greatest potential for surveyor bias. The NP method, with or without including forbs, is therefore recommended for monitoring the species composition of mesic, dense grassland. Some suggestions for monitoring agencies on how best to use multivariate methods are presented.",

Since 2012, the Zimbabwe Crop Livestock Integration for Improved Food Security (ZimCLIFS) project set out to address such challenges through research-for-development initiatives. The main objective was to demonstrate the potential viability of a pasture seed business using a lead farmer approach, farmer-to-farmer technology dissemination, innovation platforms and field demonstrations. Snapshot surveys were used to map forage seed distribution pathways within and outside project areas. Total land area planted to forages from the 2012/13 to 2014/15 seasons increased by 147% from 14.6 ha. In 2013, Mucuna pruriens (mucuna), Lablab purpureus (lablab) and Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) seed produced was 2 250 kg, 120 kg and 4 450 kg, respectively, and by the third season, total yield increased by 163%. Seed diffusion was within and beyond project boundaries, with mucuna (67%) and lablab (43%) seed produced in the 2013/14 season being distributed outside the project area. Highest amounts received by some farmers were US$800 and US$750 for lablab and mucuna, respectively. It was concluded that there is scope to develop formal pasture seed businesses to increase rural industrialisation and provide a pathway out of poverty in the smallholder sector.",

The conditioning treatments were subjected to three natural aeration methods, viz. Aframe, raised platform, and dry ground. Replicated four times, conditioned forage was cured at a swath density of 25 kg m−2 to cover 3 m2 per treatment over 28 d. Conditioning of forage had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on drying rate. However, conditioning did not have a significant (p > 0.05) effect on crude protein content. Aeration treatments did not have a significant effect (p > 0.05) on drying rate or crude protein content. Moisture loss rate was higher for forage conditioned with a wired drum and machete. Conditioning with a machete was most labour intensive compared with drum conditioning treatments.

Yet, most fire research in these ecosystems focuses on the fire ecology of protected areas. Research exploring fire regimes in inhabited landscapes remains limited, undermining opportunities for culturally and environmentally sustainable fire management. To address this gap, we used interviews in Tanzanian farming communities and remote sensing to identify intentions behind fire use and the perceived relative frequency and riskiness of fires set for different purposes. We found that the most common ignitions were intentional and important to livelihoods. Burning was adaptive, responsive to environmental conditions, and optimised for the intended outcome with the perceived riskiest fires intentionally spreading uncontrolled. Remote sensing showed that most of the total burned area was accounted for by fires during the late dry season when people burned for activities, such as field preparation, and when environmental conditions encouraged fire spread. Our findings offer an insight into fire regimes in inhabited landscapes, by exploring how intentions shape the fire regime at the landscape scale. We discuss how understanding these intentions and local priorities, including adaptive uses of fire, is key to sustainable fire management outside protected areas.",

Such evidence is essential to inform rangeland policies and interventions. In each rangeland, three villages were identified, and sites near, at intermediate and far distance from homesteads were selected. Soil from LSD had generally greater macro and microelement levels than soil from SD rangelands. Soil elements (i.e. N, P, Mg and Cu) displayed variations at local scale (between villages or distance points from homestead) depending on degradation condition. Degradation level significantly influenced the local distribution of grasses between the distance points from the homestead (Themeda triandra Forssk., Aristida congesta Roem. & Schult.) and between villages [Digitaria eriantha Steud., Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees, T. triandra]. Forage biomass was low (range: 45–223 kg ha−1) in both degraded conditions. During the dry periods, cattle grazing SD rangelands had most serum minerals below a critical level, but pastures showed Cu and N deficiencies only. We conclude that the low forage yield may limit animal mineral intake. On the other hand, the great abundance of grasses with high forage values (60–76%) indicates that degraded areas may be regenerated. In SD rangelands, complete mineral supplementation is recommended during the dry period.",

Observations in South Africa, however, have detected a contrasting trend of increasing grass cover across the transition between the Nama-Karoo and Grassland Biomes over the last few decades. A west-to-east gradient of increasing mean annual rainfall, and underlying geology, controls the natural transition of Karoo dwarf shrublands to semiarid grasslands. The availability of historical vegetation surveys and landscape photographs, weather, and livestock census records, made it possible to assess the nature, extent, and drivers of vegetation change across this biome transition. Rainfall has been generally higher over the last four decades compared to the years prior to the original surveys. This, together with a reduction in livestock numbers, is the main driver of the westward expansion by ∼100 km of perennial grasses, and a general increase in dwarf shrub and total vegetation cover. Rangeland condition, as indexed by estimates of grazing capacity, has improved significantly. Despite a structural shift towards grassland-dominance, the original species complement has persisted. The rainfall-driven increase in grass fuel loads in the region, however, places these rangelands at risk of becoming altered by increasing fire frequency.",

A possible means to reduce fertiliser reliance is the use of biostimulants. Biostimulants such as fulvic acid and bioflavonoids help to increase N uptake efficiency, thereby increasing herbage quantity and quality. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a soil application of a carbohydrate-derived fulvic acid and bioflavonoid biostimulant on herbage yield and nutritive composition of a mixed perennial ryegrass–clover pasture. Biostimulant treatment resulted in a lower ryegrass component of the mixed sward, in both winter and summer grazing cycles. However, the nutritive composition and total herbage yield of the pasture were not significantly affected by biostimulant treatment. The treatment did show a tendency to affect total herbage yield within a season. This suggests that total herbage yield could be increased if additional N fertiliser is applied together with a biostimulant soil treatment, although further investigation is needed to confirm this postulation. Biostimulant treatments have the potential to lead to reduced fertiliser inputs on perennial ryegrass–clover pastures as they may increase nutrient uptake efficiency.",

A potential solution is adopting a nurse crop during the first year in the same field. This study aimed to assess the impact of wheat as a nurse crop and crop residue on lucerne establishment in South Africa's Mediterranean climate region. The experiment employed a split-plot design with two treatment factors across six blocks. Half of the area received wheat straw, while the rest had low residue content with almost bare soil. The nurse crop combinations included wheat alone, lucerne alone, and a wheat-lucerne mixture. Results revealed competition between wheat and lucerne when planted together. When plant populations, total biomass, wheat grain yield and grain quality were considered, wheat performed better in pure stands, as did lucerne when grown without wheat. Germination of lucerne was significantly impacted by high crop residue levels. Wheat achieved superior grain yield without crop residue, despite producing less biomass. Results indicated that it is advisable to avoid using a nurse cropping system for lucerne in this Mediterranean climate region.Keywords: companion cropconservation agricultureintercroppingsoil covermixed farming systems",

The study trees were Terminalia sericea and Acacia karroo. Ordination techniques using grass density and biomass as indices separated quadrats according to soil type but not grass species according to understorey or open areas or according to tree species. Grass yield under tree crowns was similar to open areas, in contrast with most reports where understorey areas had higher yields. The high understorey grass quality that has been reported from savanna areas exhibiting grass composition differences was not expressed. Selective grazing of palatable perennial grasses growing in association with tree crowns and their eventual replacement by low‐yielding and less‐palatable grasses that normally grow in open areas is proposed as an explanation of the unique tree‐grass interaction scenario of this study. In areas where this replacement has occurred, recovery may require management interventions.",

It was suggested that the difference in the MSDI reflected differences in rangeland condition. To assess whether or not any differences could be detected in the field, vegetation parameters were recorded (cover, species composition) along ten, paired 20-m transects. Based on species forage factors for commercial live-stock production, the commercial grassland was in a significantly better condition than the communal land. The commercial farmland had a higher occurrence of palatable species while the communal land was richer in non-palatable species. A TWINSPAN classification and the NDVI and MSDI values confirmed the marked difference between the communal and the commercial land. Both the vegetative field survey data and the satellite imagery showed that the communal land was transformed in comparison to the commercial land, and this difference can be attributed to differences in land-use.

At the milk stage the FS had a dry matter (DM) content of 338 g kg−1 and water‐soluble carbohydrates (WSC) content of 120 g kg−1, as compared with 389 g kg−1 and 63 g kg−1, respectively for the GS. At the dough stage, these contents were 374 g kg−1 and 123 g kg−1 for the FS, and 520 g kg−1 and 29 g kg−1 for the GS, respectively. At the dough stage the GS had higher neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) contents than FS (592 g kg−1 and 379 g kg−1 vs. 533 g kg−1 and 339 g kg−1 DM, respectively). In the silage harvested at milk stage, the pH of FS alone decreased most slowly, whereas at the dough stage the pH of the GS remained highest. In mixtures the pH decline accelerated with an increasing proportion of FS. Following harvest at the milk stage the 3:1 (FS:GS) had the best ensiling characteristics, whereas following at the dough stage the 1:1 mixture provided the most stable silage. Rumen degradability of the silage of GS was higher than that of the FS silage, especially for material harvested at dough stage of maturity (59.2 g kg−1 vs. 50.9 g kg−1). Mixing FS with GS at the ensiling increased the digestibility of the resulting silage as compared with FS alone.",

A sequential harvesting technique was applied and regrowth was expressed in terms of above‐ground herbage‐mass accumulation and etiolated growth. Patterns of regrowth were similar for both species. Severe grazing during the previous two years significantly reduced topgrowth yields during the first 27 to 31 weeks of rest compared to tufts which had previously been leniently or not grazed. Etiolated growth was greater on leniently and ungrazed tufts than on severely grazed tufts for 13 to 15 weeks after the commencement of spring growth, whereafter there were no significant differences. The regrowth patterns of tufts for all intensities of defoliation suggests that the vigour of severely grazed tufts of both species had been restored by the end of a full growing season's rest. However, a need for further studies into the efficacy of a growing season's rest is indicated.",

The method is based on canopy‐spread‐cover strikes, and these strikes are assumed to represent mass as well as number of the species. Through the application of the individually estimated grazing‐index values of the different species, the index of veld condition is computed from either line‐point or clipped‐quadrat data. With appropriate data management, both the line‐point and the clipped‐quadrat data yield acceptable indices of veld condition, from which values, current grazing capacities, can be estimated for assessed sites.",

    "abstract": "The soil types and woody vegetation of Weenen Nature Reserve (WNR), KwaZulu-Natal, were described. Mispah, overlying shale, and Shortlands, overlying dolerite were the most common of 18 the soil forms encountered. Six vegetation types were identified by TWINS PAN which differed in slope, aspect, land-use history, species richness and tree density. Vegetation types ranged from species-rich, dense 'Coddia rudis-Dombeya cymosa Closed Woodland' overlying dolerite and occurring on steep north-east facing slopes that had never been cultivated, to previously cultivated, species-poor 'Acacia sieberiana Open Woodland' on flat topography, overlying shale. Ordination analyses further described the main associated floristic-environmental gradient from steep slopes supporting a high diversity of broad leaved species through to species-poor, flatter areas with an abundance of microphyllous plants. A second main gradient described was from uncultivated sites on steep slopes of usually dolerite-derived soils through to flat, previously cultivated land on shallow soils overlying shale. Topo-edaphic variables and previous cultivation, which were confounded, were therefore the main determinants of floristic variation in WNR, whereas fire had no influence. Half of the dominant woody species exhibited a reverse-J size structure, indicating relatively constant population change. A number of species had a preponderance of individuals in the smallest (0.5–1.5m height) size class, owing possibly to recruitment during the exceptional wet season of 1995/6, and/or the inability of individuals to escape the 'fire-trap'. Several, mostly Acacia, species appear to have recruited intermittently. The vegetation changes of this system will have an affect on browse availability. The woody vegetation of WNR appears to be changing in response to successional processes and management influences.",

Efforts to re-introduce the grass through re-seeding using seeds from research stations have had little success. One possible reason for low establishment is attributed to transplanting spatially separated populations that may represent genetically distinct ecotypes. To test this hypothesis, germplasm diversity within and among four populations of C. roxburghiana from four ecologically distinct sites was analysed using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. A total of 131 polymorphic markers were identified using nine RAPD primers. There was significant variation among populations, with genetic diversity (H) ranging from 0.134 to 0.206. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed most variance within populations (76%). However, the variation among populations was also significant (24%). The UPGMA of the population frequency indicated that the four populations of C. roxburghiana were genetically distinct, probably as a result of variation in soil fertility, geographical isolation and socio-ecological history of the study sites. Although there are differences for neutral genetic markers between the populations, it is difficult to relate this directly to ecotype since correlation does not imply causality. The implication for optimising future seed collection is discussed and potential areas for further studies identified.",

Drivers may be classed as physical, social and economic/policy, referring to their origin and mode of action. Physical drivers include environmental (weather, climate) and management (livestock grazing, prescribed burning) factors. Social drivers include attitudes and values of land mangers and the public. Economic/policy drivers refer to factors such as tax laws and environmental policies (including penalties and incentives). These drivers seldom operate independently, at similar scales, or in isolation from other drivers, and subtle interactions may confound both interpretation and response. While it is difficult to identify the impact of a specific driver on a specific biological property at a specific time, it is important to monitor changes in drivers to both predict likely impacts on ecological systems and design effective response tactics and strategies. Risk assessments, adaptive management analyses, or management by hypothesis require understanding linkages between environmental drivers and various management options on ecological properties of managed systems. Though our abilities to generate accurate predictions are currently limited, conceptual models of system response to drivers are improving. Continued incorporation and refinement of understanding and monitoring effects and interactions of different drivers will contribute to improvements in these predictive capacities.

Government land management agencies have often been keen contributors to the process because they are custodians of publicly owned land and need to represent the interests of their constituents in the entire community, not just in rangelands. The approaches which have been developed may tacitly be assumed to be useful to local land users, because they cater for the public interest at scales from local to national, but we are not convinced that they are always as useful as is supposed. We discuss our monitoring experiences on freehold land, protected areas and in communal rangelands in southern Africa, with particular reference to South Africa, Botswana and Namibia, as well as on commercial pastoral enterprises in Australia. From these, we consider who the monitoring is for, how land managers and scientists can work together to devise systems which managers will use, what needs to be monitored as a consequence and what the scale should be. We think that characteristics that define a system useful to land users include less rigour in methods than scientists usually require, greater breadth of information, better feedback on that information and more support to encourage continuing use and integration into decision-making. We argue that the monitoring process is as important as the data that are generated.",

Seeds with and without their bracts (fruits) were subjected to physical (scarification, water soaking, gamma radiation) and chemical (potassium nitrate, sulfuric acid and gibberellic acid) treatments. For each treatment, sets of 100 seeds with and without bracts were selected randomly, divided into four equal groups, and incubated in a germinator at 20 ± 1°C. The treatments had a highly significant (P < 0.0001) effect on seed germination. The scarification, potassium nitrate (0.2% concentration), gibberellic acid (100 and 150ppm) and sulfuric acid (25% for 10min, 50% for 10 and 20min) treatments improved seed germination significantly compared to control treatment (4.0%). The different doses of gamma radiation and high concentrations of sulfuric acid (75%) reduced seed germination significantly (P < 0.001). The removal of bracts surrounding the seeds had a highly significant (P < 0.0001) effect on seed germination and averaged 73.5% for washing, 78.0% for scarification, 80.9% and 88.0% for potassium nitrate of 2% and 4% concentration, 88.1% for gibberellic acid of 150ppm, and 70.4% for sulfuric acid of 25% concentration.

    "abstract": "Abstract Foliage of Ziziphus mucronata (buffalo thorn) was collected during the spring, summer and autumn. The chemical composition and in vitro digestibility of organic matter (IVDOM) of these samples were determined. Crude protein concentration ranged between 123–262 g kg DM−1, and tended to be higher in spring than in the other seasons. The acid detergent fibre ranged between 175–312 g kg DM−1 and also tended to be higher in autumn than in either spring or summer. The IVDOM values in this study were high (>700 g kg DM−1) compared to values reported in literature for the same species and other browse species such as Cassia sturtii, Tripteris sinuatum and Sutherlandia microphylla. The concentrations of calcium (Ca), sodium, zinc and manganese (Mn) appear to be higher in autumn while the concentrations of phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), potassium and copper (Cu) tended to be lower at this time compared to other seasons. In spring, the concentrations of Ca and Mn appear to be low while those of P, Mg and Cu are relatively high compared to the other seasons. However, the P content of Z. mucronata foliage was deficient in summer and autumn, while Cu was deficient in all seasons. Keywords: chemical composition in vitro digestibilitymineral composition",

Locally collected seeds of three grass species (Enteropogon rupestris, Ischaemum afrum and Tragus berteronianus) and imported seeds of three additional species (Cenchrus ciliaris, Chloris gayana and Panicum coloratum) were oversown in a severely degraded area of the rangeland to improve cover and grazing capacity of the rangeland. The effect of combinations of inorganic fertiliser, manure and grass mulch on the dry matter production of the grass species sown at 4 kg ha−1 in strips in a 10 m × 10 m plot was determined. The experiment was a randomised complete block design with eight factorially combined treatment combinations randomly applied and replicated three times. All the sown species showed significant positive responses to the mulch treatment, but not to the other treatments or treatment combinations. Ischaemum afrum and T. berteronianus produced significantly more dry matter (900 kg ha−1 and 800 kg ha−1, respectively) than the other species. The results emphasised the importance of mulching to restore degraded patches in arid and semi-arid environmental conditions.",

The growth and habitat requirements of A. karoo have not previously been studied in detail. This paper refers to an autecological study of the A. karoo seedling. Growth analyses indicate that the seedling is characterized by a low growth rate, that it is very sensitive to temperature changes and that light intensity is a less important ecological factor. The seedling is very sensitive to desiccation and it is suggested that under field conditions, favourable moisture conditions extending over a lengthy period together with high temperatures are the most important requirements for establishment. The possibility of a temperature boundary limiting the establishment of A. karoo is discussed and it is demonstrated that the average temperature climate of areas subject to A. karoo encroachment is very close to such a boundary. A. karoo encroachment can possibly be due to a temperature shift or to reduced grass competition.

This article presents a comparative characterisation of the morphology, chemical composition and in vitro ruminal fermentation of Urochloa mosambicensis, Cymbopogon pospischilii, Eragrostis superba, Fingerhuthia africana and Eragrostis bicolor when grown under controlled conditions. Species were analysed for height, number of leaves, number of tillers, stem diameter and leaf width at different growth stages, whereas chemical composition and in vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (DMD) were assessed at maturity stage. Grass species and growth stages significantly influenced morphological characteristics. Eragrostis superba and U. mosambicensis had the highest number of leaves at the reproductive stage. Urochloa mosambicensis ranked highest in terms of rangeland restoration potential when all morphological parameters were considered, followed by E. superba and C. pospischilii. With the highest crude protein, low acid-detergent lignin and higher DMD at 48 h, F. africana and C. pospischilii have the highest potential feed value. Across the three most suitable native grass species, U. mosambicensis, E. superba and C. pospischilii, there is sufficient genetic diversity that suggests that these plants may play different and complementary ecological roles in the communal rangeland ecosystem.",

Our aim was to study the depth of water uptake by trees in grassland and its controlling factors. We studied water uptake in Vachellia sieberiana trees (hereafter called 'acacias') in a humid grassland of South Africa. We especially studied the effect of size classes of acacias and their position in the catena on water potential (ψ) of acacia leaves and water uptake depth of acacias across seasons, as inferred from isotope δ18O values of soil and stem water samples. Acacias were more water stressed in February (wet season) with the most negative water potentials. Taller acacias (>3 m height) were more water-stressed (ψ ± SD = −1.62 ± 0.81 MPA) than smaller acacias (<1 m height) (ψ ± SD = −1.32 ± 0.80 MPA). In September (end of dry season), all tree size classes uptake water equally in A and B soil horizons. In February (middle of the wet season), tall, medium and even small trees favoured the B horizon. Small trees had similar plasticity in water uptake to taller trees and could modify depth of water uptake between seasons. This process could increase their probability of becoming adults, and may favour tree encroachment in grasslands.",

This study assessed the functionality of Letšeng-la-Letsie wetland in Lesotho, using the Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) technique and soil quality indicators. LFA threshold values for stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling were found to be >50%, >30% and >20%, respectively, whereas the mean surface stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling were 55.4 ± 1.9%, 28 ± 1.9%, and 15.5 ± 2% respectively. Although soil cover was high, the soil was unstable with low litter and low cryptogam cover. These rendered the soil less fertile, resulting in lower primary plant productivity and nutrient cycling potential. The three LFA indices were correlated with soil quality indicators, including pH, carbon, nitrogen, soil texture, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, cation exchange capacity and phosphorus. Clay content and CEC had a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation with the LFA indices and soil organic carbon. Redundancy analysis showed that stability was positively correlated to soil carbon and potassium. Monitoring of this wetland ecosystem is deemed necessary for the early warning of possible landscape degradation, as a result of induced pressures on the ecosystem.",

The frequency and standing crop (biomass) of species and functional groups were sampled in the spring of 1979 and 2016. Mean annual temperature increased, whereas changes in frequency varied between species and functional groups. Species that decreased included perennial plants, whereas species that increased were comprised mostly of annuals and unpalatable herbaceous plants. An NMDS ordination showed significant differences in species composition between 1979 and 2016. Total biomass, as well as the biomass of annual and perennial grasses and forbs did not differ between 1979 and 2016. Shrub biomass, however, decreased by 60% between years. Biomass of the 'graminoids' (e.g. Carex divisa), on the other hand, increased fourfold between 1979 and 2016. Species richness and the Shannon–Weaver diversity index H′ declined in 2016. This, together with a decline in the frequency of palatable species and a shift in species composition, could signal a decline in resilience over the long term. Changes in vegetation were most likely driven by a combination of higher temperatures and increased grazing pressure.",

Soil degradation can be monitored using an soil quality index (SQI). The SQI can assess both environmental aspects and indices related to pasture productivity within specific environments. A framework to evaluate and map a soil quality index for Ferralsols was developed in this study, emphasising pasture quality and seasonal variations, as well as geologic–geomorphological influences. Ground cover was determined in pasture areas with different levels of degradation. A minimum data set associated with pasture quality and productivity was selected by partial least squares regression to generate the SQI. The SQI is controlled by geomorphology and geology. In highlands, Ferralsols that develop in the oldest surfaces show strong leaching of basic cations and have higher acidity and, although components of organic matter increase, they are less important to pasture quality. In lowlands, landscape dissection exposes less weathered saprolite, forming Ferralsols with good chemical properties. This favours sustainability in pasture systems and reduces soil degradation in vulnerable environments. Soil quality indices were able to better evaluate pasture quality when established in summer.",

The model simulated a growth pattern typical for grasses native to local rangelands. The SGS model represented measured grass biomass moderately well (R2 = 0.57) at reasonable average error (RMSE, 820 kg DM ha−1), despite huge discrepancy in measured (mean = 3 877 kg DM ha−1) and simulated (mean = 3 071 kg DM ha−1) biomass.

The results from the fibre analyses were used to determine the digestibility and energy content of fodders. Preliminary results indicate that C. sericea fodders are of better nutritional quality in the wet season and that protein content, digestibility and energy content is sufficient for maintenance of lambs and dry ewes. The energy content, however, was not sufficient for maintenance of pregnant and lactating ewes. Furthermore, certain mineral nutrients (Na, P and K) were not found in sufficient concentrations in this species, and it was thus suggested that further investigation is needed into whether fertilisation could potentially improve the protein, digestibility and mineral nutrient content of C. sericea fodders.",

Planned fires also serve human needs. Critical media content analysis of 390 media reports (print, online and broadcast) on fires in South African National Parks over a three-year period were used to investigate the portrayal of fire by the mass media. We found a strong emphasis on reactive fire suppression along with a predominantly negative sentiment towards fire (93.9% of total media reach) focussing primarily on losses, destruction and the threat of fires to infrastructure, human health or lives and vegetation. In the few cases where scientists were involved (2.3% of total reach), the narrative, sentiment and images provided a more nuanced perspective of fire as having both detrimental and beneficial consequences (63.6%), imparting key fire ecology concepts to understand fire behaviour better and highlighting the importance of proactive fire-risk reduction measures. Given the influence of the mass media on the views and opinions of the public and policymakers, and its socio-political and management consequences, we conclude that scientists and journalists should do more to engage with one another. We provide pathways and tips to scientists on how to increase their media footprint to promote a more balanced media portrayal of fire.",

    "abstract": "Botanical and chemical compositions of Boer goat diets, determined with repeated collection of forage samples taken from the goat's mouth, were studied in a gypsophilous grassland during four seasons of the year. Ten pluriparous goats were used to collect selected forage species. Shrubs were a minor dietary component throughout the year (<7.5%). Goats selected more (p < 0.01) grass during autumn and winter (34.2–37.8%) than during spring (21.2%) and summer (29.0%). During all seasons goat diets were dominated by forbs (>59%). Diets were lowest (p < 0.05) in percentage of crude protein during spring, summer and autumn (13.2 ± 3.5, 13.2 ± 2.4 and 14.2 ± 3.9, respectively) than winter (17.5 ± 2.9) with levels above the recommended quantities for goats throughout the year. In vitro dry matter digestibility of forages selected by goats did not differ between seasons (range 47.4–53.3%). It was concluded that in this particular ecosystem goats preferred forb species over grasses across all seasons. In addition, goats maintained relatively stable diet quality by forage-class mixing of diets.",

    "abstract": "Important drivers of woody cover in African savannas are rainfall, soil and nutrients, and disturbance factors, such as fire and herbivory. However, very little is known about how these drivers influence woody cover at specific height classes. The main aim of this study was to identify which of these drivers are the best predictors of woody cover at three height classes: shrub (0.75–2.5 m), brush (2.5–5.5 m) and tree (>5.5 m). Percent woody cover estimates were collected using a rapid monitoring technique over 1 700 sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Geology (basalt and granite), mean annual rainfall, fire frequency and elephant density were analysed as potential drivers of woody cover. Results indicate that mean annual rainfall was negatively associated with shrub cover, fire frequency was negatively associated with brush cover, and elephant density was negatively associated with tree cover. Patterns of woody cover show that while geology influences the spatial distribution of horizontal woody cover, variation in vertical vegetation structure is created and maintained by top-down disturbance. This provides the first documentation of drivers associated with structurally differentiated woody cover at regional scales. Future studies on woody cover in disturbance-driven environments should not ignore vegetation structure.",

Our primary objective was to determine the effect of three grazing intensities within an intensive, short‐duration grazing system on selected soil physical properties. Maximum compaction occurred in the A2/AB horizons, which has significantly higher (P<0.05) penetrometer readings than the overlying A I/A horizons under all grazing intensities. Heavily grazed areas also have significantly higher (P<0.05) penetrometer reading than the other two areas in both horizons. Heavily grazed areas also have significantly lower (P<0.05) infiltration rates, saturated hydraulic conductivities, and water‐stable aggregates than soils grazed at the other two levels. Aggregates in the A2/AB horizon were more stable than aggregates in the Al and Bw horizons in every pedon under all grazing intensities. When the effect of grazing intensity was analysed for each horizon separately, the lightly grazed areas had significantly lower (P<0.05) bulk density and higher total porosity in the A2/AB horizons than comparable horizons from the other two sites. However, when all horizons were analysed together, no significant differences in bulk density were found among treatments and horizons. No significant differences were observed in percentage organic carbon among treatments.",

Three unreplicated camps were stocked early (29 days), at the recommended '10-15cm' sward height (44 days), and late (80 days) after a spring burn. Temporal change in the spatial distribution of herbage in each treatment was described by intensive measurement of compressed sward height (CSH) with a disc pasture meter and analysed with parametric and spatial statistics. Grazing pressure at the start of the grazing was highest in the early graze, intermediate at the recommended, and least in the late graze treatment because of variation in initial herbage mass related to period of deferment after the burn. The early graze paddock was most spatially uniform and the late graze paddock the most uneven and patchy before grazing. Such initial conditions significantly affected subsequent herbage removal patterns: the greater the amount and spatial variability of herbage accumulated before grazing, the greater the chance for patches to develop through area-selective grazing. The early graze paddock was utilised non-selectively during the first two grazing periods but similar to other treatments, became patchier with time. Spatial pattern, a mosaic of short, intermediate and tall patches, peaked in late summer and was most pronounced in the late graze treatment. Intensive, early stocking after a burn is recommended for minimising intraseasonal development of patches and efficient use of high-quality forage available after a burn.",

Four water stress treatments (T1 = 0-25%, T2 = 25-50%, T3 = 50-75% and T4 = 75-100% depletion of plant available water) were applied to the plants in pots in a glasshouse.

The WSPC in the leaves increased from after defoliation, up to day 6 over all the water treatments (P < 0.05) and for all the growth stages (P < 0.05). Non-structural carbohydrates serve as the most important growth reserve and are utilised for re-growth after severe defoliation. Water-soluble protein can also be utilised as growth reserve, but only as an emergency measure for up to two days after defoliation.

On average, the cattle spent nine hours and 29 minutes (SD = 27 minutes) outside the kraal, with a range from about 8 hours in the dry season to almost 11 hours in the wet season, depending on the morning temperature and milking time. A significant (P<0.001) linear relationship between the time spent outside the kraal and time spent grazing was found. The Echinochloa spp.-Vossia cuspidata grass association was intensively grazed for the largest part of the year (44% of the total grazing time). During the flood season cattle grazed largely along the floodplain edge instead of the adjacent woodlands, which resulted in a negligible intake of browse. Body condition of all categories of cattle was significantly lower during the flood season. It was concluded that during this season cattle should graze more hours daily than they presently do, to minimise the drop in body condition as much as possible, and to make more intense use of the forage resource of the woodland.

Twenty single stemmed trees of both Acacia erubescens and Combretum apiculatum subsp. apiculatum were randomly selected and five trees of each species were cut at heights of 5cm, 15cm, 30cm and 45cm above ground level. At the end of the following five growing seasons leaf dry mass estimates were calculated using the BECVOL-model. Both species coppiced vigorously, but C. apiculatum achieved a higher leaf dry mass production (mean of 875g tree-1) in comparison to A. erubescens (mean of 608g tree-1). In the case of A. erubescens the leaf dry mass production at the end of the 5-year trial period varied from a minimum of 460g tree-1 at a cutting height of 5cm to a maximum of 768g tree-1 at a cutting height of 15cm. In the case of C. apiculatum it varied from a minimum of 668g tree-1 at a cutting height of 15cm to a maximum of 1 074g tree-1 at a cutting height of 30cm. The effect of the cutting height on the subsequent height of the coppice growth differed between the two species. In the case of A. erubescens the total height of the coppice growth differed significantly between plants that were cut at different heights, but not in the case of C. apiculatum. The cutting height had no significant effect on the leaf dry mass production of both species. Despite the lack of statistically significant differences, the leaf dry mass production tended to be higher with an increase in cutting height. Depending on the cutting height, the A. erubescens trees will regrow to their original leaf biomass (average of 1 429.7g tree-1) within 5.9 to 9.4 years (seasons) and the C. apiculatum trees (average of 1 748.9g tree-1) within 7.1 to 15.8 years (seasons).

    "abstract": "The need to balance biodiversity conservation with sustainable development, though widely agreed upon, is elusive in practice. Human societies are increasingly disconnected from the ecosystems which support them. The loosening connection and growing scientific acceptance that ecosystems are complex, dynamic, non-linear systems pose new challenges for rangeland monitoring. Consequently, although conventional monitoring has contributed to better range practices, a far more integrated and multi-scale approach is required as human activity becomes more pervasive and dominant locally and globally. Integrated monitoring must track social and economic variables no less than ecosystem services in a reliable and affordable way. In addition, analysis and feedback involving the data collectors and land users should become an integral part of adaptive rangeland management more akin to business approaches than conventional science. As demanding as such an integrated approach may seem, much of the socioeconomic data already exists and physical and biological data can increasingly be collected and collated by new imaging technologies. For monitoring to be locally and globally useful, it must provide information to local users in a timely and usable form and simultaneously provide data on which deleterious environmental impact can be assessed independently of the users. A set of guiding principles for setting up such programmes is discussed. The utility of monitoring and its guiding principles will only work effectively where good environmental governance is practiced by users and producers affecting rangeland ecosystems.",

Four sheep were randomly allocated to the four dietary treatments of either veld hay alone or veld hay supplemented with either cowpea, fine-stem stylo or silverleaf desmodium. Total dry matter intake was highest with cowpea (P < 0.05), and the lowest increment (P < 0.01) was with silverleaf desmodium. The pH of the rumen fluid was lower (P < 0.01) in sheep given the supplemented diets than the veld hay alone.

The silverleaf desmodium diet produced the highest level of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) (P < 0.05). Supplementation with the legumes improved the nitrogen retention, although animals on all treatments were in negative nitrogen balance. Legume supplementation to the veld hay also enhanced rumen fermentation, as reflected by an increase in ruminal ammonia N and VFA concentrations. These results suggest that although the legume hay increased dry matter and nitrogen utilisation, the negative nitrogen retentions might indicate the inadequacy of the specific legume hays used as nitrogen supplementary feeds to sheep fed a basal diet of veld hay.",

    "abstract": "Compositional shifts of bunchgrass species in the Southern Tall Grassveld in response to different combinations of non-selective mowing and burning appear to reflect differences in growth strategy among species, but there are few studies of South African grasses designed to test this. A descriptive study was undertaken both to observe how different species allocated resources in response to different defoliation treatments imposed at the start of spring, as it was thought that these responses might be critical for an understanding of tiller dynamics and compositional change in bunch grasslands. The study recorded the reproductive growth response of two spring-flowering species, Themeda triandra and Eragrostis curvula, subjected to three defoliation treatments: no defoliation (No Mow), defoliation during the previous summer (Summer Mow), and defoliation in early spring (Early Spring Mow). Plant growth response was separated into primary growth, measured as individual organ extension on individual phytomers, and secondary growth, measured as the number of secondary tillers recruited per live primary tiller. Phytomer growth depended on treatment and species. For either species, organ extension was greater for the No Mow treatment than for either of the two defoliated treatments. Tillers of E. curvula were substantially larger and grew faster than T. triandra tillers. In addition, apical meristems of E. curvula remained close to the ground until flowering. These combined differences are consistent with E. curvula being able to outcompete T. triandra in less-frequently defoliated swards. Secondary tiller recruitment was significantly related to defoliation treatment and species. Tiller recruitment was substantially lower on the No Mow treatment than for the two defoliation treatments, and tiller recruitment was greater for T. triandra plants than for E. curvula plants. Accumulated blade length was negatively related to tiller recruitment. Results suggest that tiller recruitment was limited by nutrient demand of primary structures, a consequence of which is that T. triandra will recruit more tillers than E. curvula when defoliation opens up space, accounting for T. triandra's dominance on more regularly-defoliated treatments.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of varying levels of Leucaena supplement on the intake, flow and digestibility of nutrients of two low-quality forages. Partial digestion methods were used. The overall results showed that the supplementation of veld grass with Leucaena hay improved the performance of veld grass more significantly (P < 0.05) than the supplementation of Eragrostis grass with Leucaena hay. The crude protein of Diets 2–4, which contained veld grass, increased by 67.1%, 95.3% and 130.6%, compared with the control diet, while the in vitro organic matter digestibility increased by 15.5%, 25.7% and 15.24%, respectively. Similarly, neutral detergent fibre content decreased by 6.5%, 14.7% and 23.3%, respectively. Feed intake increased by 22.7%, 14.9% and 11.3%, and crude protein intake increased by 2.13, 2.25 and 2.57 times, respectively. The production of ammonia nitrogen increased by 17%, 38.4% and 44.3%, and volatile fatty acids increased by 31.3%, 28% and 26%, respectively. The flow of non-ammonia nitrogen through the abomasum increased by 3.28, 3.9 and 4.76 times, respectively. The disappearance of organic matter from the rumen increased by 29.3%, 36.2% and 24.7% and in the small intestine increased by 1.8, 2.3 and 2.2 times, respectively. The overall digestibility of organic matter in the whole digestive tract was increased by 9.9%, 16.3% and 9.7%, respectively. In comparison, the crude protein of Diets 6–8, which contained Eragrostis grass, increased by 37.5%, 80% and 103.3%, compared with the control, while the neutral detergent fibre content decreased by 4.8%, 14.8% and 21.6%, respectively. Feed intake increased by 41.3%, 36% and 28.4%, and crude protein intake by 1.93, 2.43 and 2.52 times, respectively. The production of ammonia nitrogen increased by 13.8%, 25% and 21.7%, and volatile fatty acids increased by 18.8%, 17.4% and 14.7%, respectively. The flow of non-ammonia nitrogen through the abomasum increased by 1.27, 166 and 1.50 times, respectively. However, there was no significant effect on the flow of the other nutrients. However, the overall digestibility of organic matter was not significantly different from that of the control diet. The conclusion was that the supplementation of the poorer forage with Leucaena was more beneficial and more cost-effective than the supplementation of the better-quality forage with Leucaena.",

The grass was harvested at the boot stage of growth and the material of each treatment was ensiled in separate 1kg mini-silos. Compared to day 0 (control), silage pH dropped significantly at day 7 for molasses-treated silage regardless of initial moisture level. In the untreated silage a slightly lower pH was recorded for the unwilted silage. Molasses treatment resulted in a lower silage pH, higher lactic acid and lower acetic acid concentrations starting from day 7 throughout the fermentation period. Compared to prior wilted silages, lower (p < 0.05) pH, higher lactic acid and lower acetic acid concentrations were recorded for directly cut silages throughout the fermentation period. Molasses had no influence on the nitrogen (N) content of silage, but wilting resulted in a higher N content compared to unwilted silage in presence of molasses. Neither the influence of molasses nor the initial moisture level had a significant effect on ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration on day 7, but an interaction between molasses addition and moisture level was evident on day 21 and 120. The level of ammonia nitrogen increased with fermentation time. The addition of molasses seemed to be beneficial to the fermentation process and resulted in well preserved silage, whereas the effect of initial moisture condition seems to have little significance.",

We conducted a series of trials in the Succulent Karoo Randteveld near Barrydale to determine if the uniform defoliation of P. paniculata dominated vegetation at two heights (0.05 m and 0.20 m above ground level) using a brush-cutter and, in one trial, application of a second cut will improve the plant species composition, productivity and grazing capacity of the veld. Brush-cutting treatments and the uncut control all resulted in a change in species composition towards greater species diversity and more palatable species and an average increase of 540 kg ha−1 (28%) in above-ground biomass over four years. It appears that there was a pervasive improvement in species composition associated with a general decline in the cover and abundance of P. paniculata over the time-scale of the present study that was not influenced by the defoliation treatments, except for the 1996-cut treatment where the cover of P. paniculata increased. The absence of propagules of palatable species in the soil seed bank and competition from P. paniculata (a long-lived, perennial shrub) are assumed to be among the main reasons for the lack of response of the vegetation community to the defoliation treatments. Brush-cutting (in the absence of reseeding), aimed at reducing the dominance of unpalatable karoo shrubs, was more costly but not significantly better than long-term resting in improving veld composition or forage production.

    "abstract": "By its nature, combating desertification is a complex, multidisciplinary activity that requires coordinated responses at a multitude of levels spanning both scientific disciplines and government departments. In the final analysis, it is at the level of the land user where the bulk of activities take place, and where the greatest impact is to be gained. Providing access to knowledge, a supportive environment and, in some instances, financial assistance that allows the land user to counter desertification is important. However, the nature of desertification processes is such that, in many instances, they extend beyond the domain of control of a single land user and require a coordinated response from multiple land users. This is especially true of situations where resources are used and managed communally as is the case in much of southern Africa. Though global and national institutional structures may facilitate implementation, it is proposed that sound local-level institutions are one of the most important components for successful sustainable land management interventions. The need to differentiate between private and communal land in terms of the nature of structures and forms of incentives to promote the combating of desertification is highlighted.",

This is in response to scarcity of feed, particularly in the dry season, associated with seasonal variations, land degradation and the need to meet increases in demand for livestock products. The study investigated forage seed production, marketing, challenges faced and opportunities along the value chain in Zimbabwe. Data were collected from 414 smallholder farmer households through a survey, four focus group discussions and 12 key informants. Results show that forage seed is mainly sourced from development organisations. Actors include farmer producers, seed companies, research and extension institutions, and NGOs. Seed is disseminated through sales to other farmers and organisations, sharing, seed exchanges and payment for services. Challenges include unavailability of seed, under-developed markets, weak or non-existent linkages between seed suppliers and farmers, limited knowledge on seed production and marketing, and low market prices. Forage seed have comparatively higher gross margins (US$611.61 for mucuna and US$644.14 for cowpea) compared with conventional seed such as maize (−US$382.70). Opportunities arise from the growing demand for animal products, which is associated with expanding populations and the need for improved nutrition.",

Given the magnitude of degradation and the benefits of landscape-scale restoration, a unified approach among stakeholders is required to upscale restoration efforts. Seeking such an approach, we compare the efficiencies of two restoration and land use models for the period 2014–2016. Model A is characterised by both mechanical and bioturbation as methods to control the IAPs combined with short duration, high-density rotational grazing. Model B uses mechanical and chemical methods to control IAPs, as well as a mixed rotational rest grazing system. We found that Model B's unit cost was 47% higher than that of Model A (R13 747, compared with R9 327 ha−1). Model B is also less efficient with respect to the use of time and labour required to clear a hectare. We also note that seeking to simultaneously achieve dual objectives (e.g. ecological and social) using a single instrument, such as clearing IAPs, violates Tinbergen's Golden Rule in Public Finance. By seeking efficiency on a single objective, e.g. with respect to ecological indicators, restoration will yield more benefits and impact more people for longer.Keywords: environmental managementnatural resourcesresource pooling",

However, the scarcity of pastures during the dry season may result in changing grazing behaviour by cattle. Therefore, we studied the management practices of transhumant herders on communal rangelands through monitoring of cattle herds' behaviour in southern Benin. We expected changes in grazing behaviours of cattle and shifts in diet composition and diet overlaps between herds. Therefore, feeding and spatial behaviours of cattle were studied on six transhumant herds monitored daily, each during three consecutive days on communal rangelands of Djidja. In each herd, three adult cows of four to five years old were equipped with two GPS data loggers (GT-730FL-S) to monitor animals' movements. The data loggers were set to record the positions of the animals every 10 s and direct observations of the animal activities were made. The results indicated that the activities of cattle varied greatly according to site (p < 0.05). Moreover, feed ingested varied with site. The ration was dominated by woody species with 70% Fabaceae, whereas shrubs and grasses were less represented, indicating a shift in diet. This analysis is required for better monitoring of grazing cattle.",

The bare area in the biennial summer burn increased by 5.6%, remained the same in the annual winter, and decreased in the biennial spring (6.1%) and five-year (7.8%) burns. The disappearance of Stiburus alopecuroides from the summer burn and increase in basal cover of Tristachya leucothrix indicates a directional change in composition that is likely to be irreversible. The biennial spring burn, where the three dominant species were in a state of equilibrium, is recommended for stability.",

This study examines the provision of grassland forage and non-forage resources across five grassland types in relation to environmental determinants of site topography, soil conditions, and plantation-forestry disturbance. Grasslands characteristic of low-lying and fertile landscape positions were dominated by nutritious lawn grasses and therefore tended to complement rangeland practices, whereas grasslands associated with elevated areas or infertile conditions were diverse in species composition and consequently provided the majority of plant medicines, spiritual resources, fruit-beverage resources, oils, and craft materials. Secondary grassland, resulting from forestry plantation abandonment, had moderate forage potential and limited non-forage resources. Our results provide a simple framework for approaching grassland resource classification, grassland conservation and land use management on the Maputaland coastal plain.",

The threat of soil erosion in a high rainfall regime can be countered with rapid establishment of a sod-forming grass, such as Cynodon dactylon, that covers and binds the soil. An experiment was initiated in early 2013 to investigate whether planting vegetative material (plugs) was more effective than sowing of seed, and whether soil amelioration (fertilisation) was necessary on a substrate-specific basis. The experiment was assessed at the end of May 2013. Aerial vegetative cover was correlated with above-ground dry mass. Planting of plugs in combination with fertilisation was overall the most effective. On tailings, seed without fertilisation was a complete failure and fertilisation was essential for growth of plugs. Fertilised plugs resulted in a high density of stolons but fertilised seeds did not, although the response was delayed on tailings. Once phyto-stabilisation has been achieved, C. dactylon might serve as a nursery bed for establishing locally adapted cuprophytes of conservation significance.",

For this purpose, we developed power-law volume-biomass functions based on nonlinear regressions for each of these species, under both browsed and unbrowsed conditions. These functions were then applied to individual-based annual monitoring data from inside and outside a browsing exclosure to calculate standing biomass for each of the years from 2004 to 2009. The biomass of the three species was well predicted by the allometric functions, and different functions for the browsed and unbrowsed conditions reflected changes in plant architecture. Browsing had a significant negative impact on biomass for A. herba-alba but not for A. mesatlantica, whereas its effects on T. mideltense were inconsistent between years. The fact that the latter two species hardly benefited from browsing exclusion might be because of increased competition from the more dominant A. herba-alba. During the study period, the standing biomass increased whether or not there was browsing, which might be because of the recovery of the shrubs after a preceding severe drought. Further studies are needed in order to investigate the generality of the findings. Keywords: allometric functionAtlas Mountainsnonlinear regressionpermanent plotplant architecturestanding biomass",

A total of 78 plant species and 108 arthropod families were sampled monthly from the endangered Bloemfontein Dry Grassland at the Free State National Botanical Gardens between April 2009 and March 2010. Interaction strengths between plants and arthropods varied within a calendar year; being strongest in winter months (July and August), initiation of the growth season (November) and peak growth season (February and March). It was hypothesised that variation was caused by changing primary productivity. The trophic composition of the arthropod community supported this hypothesis as the ratio between primary consumers (herbivores) and secondary consumers (predators and parasitoids) showed patterns that coincided with periods of strong arthropod-plant interactions. Patterns were explained by multiple theories linking plant and arthropod diversity. It was concluded that arthropod assemblages are closely linked to primary producers, the abiotic environment and top-down trophic forces at different times of the year. Future arthropod-based studies should be performed with clear objectives and seasonal benchmark conditions to overcome these variations.",

The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional quality of C. sericea forage harvested at five phenological stages. Results from the study show that crude protein, fibre, energy and digestibility of the forage decreased with plant maturity, but not all mineral nutrients showed the same trend. In general, C. sericea forage harvested at non-reproductive, early flower bud and full flower stages could provide sufficient energy and protein to maintain livestock condition. At these stages, the neutral detergent fibre and digestibility of the harvested materials are also good, indicating that intake and processing of these forage would not be a problem for the livestock. At these phenological stages most of the mineral nutrients were also sufficiently high to meet the minimum requirements of small stock. Thus, C. sericea forage harvested at the appropriate phenological stages could provide a useful source of forage for resource poor farmers.",

Vetiver grass (from India) is often used during rehabilitation efforts to restore soil function without a thorough understanding of the potential negative ecological impacts. Hence, a study was initiated to investigate vetiver's ecological impacts during grassland rehabilitation. Firstly, a field survey was conducted using a contiguous quadrat method to evaluate the extent of grass secondary succession in these rehabilitated sites. Secondly, the effect of vetiver competition and seed sowing method on the recruitment of two native grasses (Eragrostis curvula and Megathyrsus maximus) was examined using pot trials. The field survey results showed no evidence of grass secondary succession, but rather the abundance of bare ground around vetiver, and a marked increase in grass species richness with increasing distance from planted vetiver. Subsequently, in the pot trial, vetiver facilitated emergence in both native grasses, and soil surface sowing of indigenous grass seeds showed greater emergence than other sowing methods. However, vetiver inhibited native grass seedling establishment, even when root competition was excluded. This study suggests that areas rehabilitated using vetiver are unlikely to become productive grasslands with good grazing, because vetiver inhibits colonisation by native grasses.",

Sole and intercrops forage materials were harvested 80 days after planting and ensiled in small-scale silos, that is: plastic bags, plastic drums, and small pits, for 60 days. After ensiling, samples were collected to examine the chemical composition, microbial community and fermentation quality. Mixed silages stored in the drum silos had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher DM content (35.69%) than that from pit and bag silos. The drum silos had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher crude protein concentration (20.57% DM) in sole legume silages than other silo types. Neutral detergent fibre concentration (39.76% DM) of sole forage silages was greatest in bag silos than in other silos. High in vitro dry matter digestibility and water-soluble carbohydrate values (58.15 and 12.19% DM respectively) for mixed silages were recorded in drum silos. Bag silos showed lower numbers of lactic acid bacteria and higher populations of enterobacteria (4.86 and 4.26 log10 CFU g−1 respectively) in sole forage silages than other silos. Mixed silages ensiled in drum silos produced significantly lower (p ≤ 0.05) pH (3.03) and ammonia nitrogen content (3.73% TN) compared to pit and bag silos. The study concluded that ensiling maize–forage legume mixtures in drum silos can have a positive effect on the nutritive value of ruminants' feeds. Therefore, the recommended forage type for ensiling is mixed silages.",

Alfalfa and Atriplex were added to cactus silage to improve nutrient quality. Three mixtures were prepared: M1 based on cactus, M2 based on cactus and alfalfa, and M3 based on cactus and Atriplex. Bran and wheat straw were added to the mixtures to improve the moisture content. After adding alfalfa and Atriplex, the protein content of the pre-ensiling material increased (p < 0.05), reaching 10.63% DM for M1, 16.35% DM for M2, and 17.22% DM for M3. During ensilage, a significant amount of sugar and protein was degraded. All silage treatments achieved stable pH values (M1: 4.35, M2: 4.55, and M3: 4.54). The M2 and M3 treatments had the highest amount of protein. After drying, the protein content of the dried treatments was higher than that of the ensiled treatments (8.05% DM for M1, 14.96% DM for M2, and 15.36% DM for M3). In both storage methods, the microbial population declined. However, silage reduces coliforms, yeasts and moulds more efficiently than solar drying. The drying operation preserves remarkedly the nutritional quality of the mixtures while ensiling reduces the number of undesirable microorganisms.Keywords: biochemical propertiesfermentationmicrobial floranutrient qualityshrubby orache",

Recent research indicates that carbon produced during pyrogenic events in fire-dependent ecosystems may occur in more recalcitrant forms within deeper soil horizons. Notably, refractory organic carbon (ROC) and black carbon (BC) fractions are globally recognised as highly stable components of soil carbon. Here, we examined the impact of prescribed fires on the accumulation of ROC and BC fractions within South African mesic grassland soils. Our findings revealed that while BC remains stable in the soil, exhibiting consistent levels across soil horizons, increased fire frequency led to breakdown of BC in the soil. Greater BC quantities were observed in burn exclusion and prescribed burns with a greater burn interval, suggested as primarily driven by a decline in soil pH. There were no significant differences in ROC within the burn treatments, but there was a notable decrease in ROC with increasing depth increments below 5 cm.

Many different breeds of livestock are farmed in the Nama-Karoo, and the stocking rate varies greatly over the region. In this study we examine how grazing by dorper and merino sheep applied at three stocking rates affected two Karoo shrublands on a long-term grazing trial at Grootfontein in the eastern Karoo. The effects of grazing treatment on shrub communities at two sites of the Afrikaner-Hereford grazing trial differed greatly and were measurable after ten years of rest. At the sandier, grassier Afrikaner site, heavy grazing by dorper sheep had a significant effect on shrub composition, density and cover, whereas the effect of grazing treatment was less pronounced at the Hereford site. Lenient grazing by merino sheep resulted in a vastly different community compared to all other grazing treatments. Individual Karoo shrub species responded differently to grazing treatment. Overall shrub recruitment has faltered for all but three species, and populations were dominated by intermediate-sized and large individuals. Results indicate that grazing management, animal type and stocking rate are important determinants of Nama-Karoo rangeland composition and structure with evidence of a legacy effect longer than ten years.Keywords: animal typegrazing legacyKaroo shrubsNama-Karoostocking rate",

However, the quality and quantity of forages can be poor, especially during the dry season. The objective of this study was to assess the nutritional composition of naturally available forages across smallholder livestock systems in Malawi, with particular focus on seasonal differences in quality and quantity. Samples of herbaceous forages and browse were collected over 17 months, across four sites (30 farms/smallholders) in central Malawi. Forages underwent nutritional analysis for crude protein, fibre and ash/organic matter. NDVI obtained from satellite imagery was used as a proxy for forage availability. Forage nutrition and availability were most adequate in the wet season, with higher concentrations of crude protein and a greater availability of herbaceous plants. There were significant differences in low-digestibility fibre fractions between locations, likely due to local factors such as soil and hydrology. The fall in crude protein concentrations from the wet season to the dry season along with a reduction in forage biomass represents a seasonal nutritional feed gap that may impact productivity within livestock systems.Keywords: browsegoatsruminantslivestockfood security",

Edible plant material of V. nilotica were harvested, chopped and ensiled in 1.5 L anaerobic glass jars under laboratory conditions with four treatment applications: control, shoots + seedpods, shoots + molasses, and shoots + molasses + seedpods. Three jars per treatment were opened at Days 3, 7, 21 and 60 to determine fermentation characteristics, and subjected to a five-day aerobic stability test at Day 60. Thereafter samples were analysed for chemical composition, mineral nutrients, fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability. Dry matter content of V. nilotica differed (p < 0.05) at ensiling with an average of 433 g kg−1 DM, CP (70–81 g kg−1 DM), ADF (360–426 g kg−1 DM), aNDF (468–524 g kg−1 DM) and pH (4.3–5.0) at Day 60. Butyric acid was < 0.1 g kg−1 DM, acetic acid (4–6 g kg−1 DM) and propionic acid was not detected. These findings demonstrated that V. nilotica edible parts can be effectively preserved as legume silage to bridge the dry season gap.Key words: aerobic stabilityfermentationmolassesnutritive valuesilage",

The study trees were Terminalia sericea and Acacia karroo. There were consistent patterns in soil nutrient status between understorey and open areas, although these patterns were largely not significant. There was also a consistent pattern in soil volumetric water content of open areas > T. sericea > A. karroo understorey areas.

Group A of the rainfall, with a sequence of wet and dry cycles, was reflected in the botanical composition of the duneveld. Group A species (highly desirable decreaser species) form the dominant component (up to 90%) during dry cycles because of their drought tolerance. During wet cycles the group B, C and D species (less useful to poor increaser species) increase more rapidly than do the decreaser species and may comprise as much as 50% of the botanical composition. Because of this cyclical pattern in botanical composition (or relative cover), absolute cover provides a more reliable index of relative veld condition than botanical composition.

The implications of this are: i) the relation between fire frequency and intensity may not be a negative one, and ii) burning trials with a fixed fire frequency will not easily be able to discern frequency and intensity effects. We predict decreasing woody plant density with increasing fire frequency.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Individual forage species were appraised in varying distances along transects radiating from the water points of the ranch and traditional cattle post management systems. Measurements of plant height were used to assess the degree of forage species utilisation by livestock around water points. Livestock use forage plants more heavily near water points and the degree of use is more pronounced in the traditional cattle post areas, compared to ranch grazing. Utilisation of annual plants occurring at the 0m zone from water was greater than that of the same plant species growing at further distances. Periodic closure of water points aimed at reducing grazing pressure has been indicated as a method to promote production of forage around water points. With the exception of Panicum maximum, the abundance of which was low or non-existent in both management systems, Digitaria eriantha was the most utilised grass by livestock, followed by Schmidtia pappophoroides and Eragrostis lehmanniana. Stipagrostis uniplumis, one of the dominant grasses in the Kalahari Sandveld, exhibited a weak tendency to decline as distance from water increased. It was observed that high forage utilisation rates coincide with drought periods, implying that correct stocking rate adjustments should always match the available forage. Forage utilisation from water points in the traditional cattle post areas extended beyond 4 000m, especially during the dry periods. Keywords: GRAZING PRESSURELIVESTOCK GRAZINGRANGELANDSANDVELD",

    "abstract": "The main radiation of large mammalian herbivores in Africa took place in the Pliocene–Pleistocene, when a long-term trend towards aridification promoted grasslands and the diversification of ruminant grazers. Traditional models of this evolution identify habitat fragmentation in response to climate change as the primary cause of speciation and diversification. However, with their adaptation to poorer and drier diets, these animals incurred a cost: an increase in water requirements to aid digestion and to thermoregulate their larger body size. Water requirements are included in the current model, relating this foremost physiological need to an environmental resource: habitat fragments would have contained sources of drinking water for the persistence of water-dependent species. However, the location of drinking water and its influences are subsumed within the extent of those fragments; their roles in habitat fragmentation and the subsequent evolutionary processes are less clear. The current model neglects to consider the interaction of water dependency with the location of drinking water; increased aridification would not only have involved shifts in the spatial distribution and species composition of forage resources, but it would also have increased the patchiness of surface water distributions. Animal foraging distributions would have been constrained within species-specific distances of their drinking water over an evolutionary timescale, distances that were not necessarily in accord with the extent of their potential habitat as solely defined by forage distributions, particularly as animals became more dependent on water with the increase in grazing and its associated traits. Drinking-water location exerts a dominant influence on animal survival and reproduction, suggesting that these roles of drinking-water location need to be incorporated into existing models of large mammalian herbivore evolution in Africa.",

The study sought to determine the effects of Acacia mearnsii clearing on soil physico-chemical properties and grass production. Soil samples were collected from three A. mearnsii invasion statuses and analysed for representative physico-chemical variables. Using line transects and a disc pasture meter (DPM) approaches, equations were developed to predict annual grass dry matter production in areas cleared of A. mearnsii. A. mearnsii significantly (p < 0.05) altered most of the physico-chemical soil characteristics that affected grass production. Predicted grass dry matter production from sites cleared of A. mearnsii ranged from 284 to 362 g m−2 y−1. These production rates were similar to those from uninvaded landscapes, suggesting that background grass production can still be attained even if there is no active soil management. Autogenic recovery thresholds have not been surpassed despite a long history of landscape invasion in the area. Management of invaded grasslands should be informed by an appreciation of local soil background characteristics. The equations developed for grass dry matter prediction may enable farmers to non-destructively estimate forage availability and fuel loads.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of different plant species communities on soil health, as quantified by soil physical (water infiltration), chemical (soil organic matter) and biological (Collembola community data) indicators. Data was collected from an existing long-term field trial in the UK, planted to either forb-dominated composition, grass species dominated composition or a multipurpose mixture of forb and grass species. Results showed that plant community can determine soil water infiltration rates, particularly with observed increased soil organic matter (SOM) and epigeic Collembola abundances. The results presented here add evidence that plant communities planted as vegetative buffer strips can be specifically tailored to support soil health development and maintenance.",

This study aimed to examine the effects of livestock grazing pressure on vegetation structure and diversity with distance from herder shelters. Six shelters were sampled. From each herder shelter, a grazing gradient was set aligned to the contour lines. Along each grazing gradient, we surveyed seven 100-m transects between 10 and 800 m from the herder shelter. The standing crop biomass (dry matter = DM) along the gradient from the shelters, bare soil, cover of vegetation functional groups and plant species diversity were determined using the point intercept method along each transect. Bare soil cover increased as we approached herder shelter. The total standing crop biomass (DM) (in g DM m−2) increased with the distance from the shelter. Shrub biomass decreased when approaching shelters, as so did the percentage of shrub cover. Cover of perennial forbs and grass also increased with distance from shelter, whereas annual cover increased as we approached the shelter. Species richness and diversity increased when moving away from the shelter. Changes in vegetation structure were not linear. Strong changes were detectable within the first 200 m, whereas little responses were found behind this threshold. The 200 m threshold should be used to monitor the main keystone species that preserved these rangelands.",

There was an association between sites selected in winter and soil organic carbon, and these sites were dominated by Cynodon dactylon and Pennisetum clandestinum. The floristic patterns observed in Magwiji were associated with soil organic carbon content. Low-lying swampy patches had high soil pH in Cala, while mountain top soils in Magwiji had low electrical conductivity and these areas selected in winter were associated with grass species such as Eragrostis superba and Heteropogon contortus.",

Within each catchment, a relatively homogenous 1 km2 pixel of grassland was selected for intensive study. Mean annual ETMODIS results from 2009 to 2011 showed that P10A (light) was higher by 14 mm than Q91C (heavy). No significant difference was observed between hourly ETMODIS and hourly ETOTC. A good relationship was observed between daily ETMODIS and ETOTC (r2 = 0.7065, p value < 0.01, df = 8) for each 1 km2 pixel during the 2010/11 growing season. This confirmed that the OTC is a useful instrument to determine actual ET over grassland and short shrubland, and may be used in model validation.",

Available canopy volume, mean maximum daily temperature and tree species were the most significant determinants of browse production. Available canopy volume proved to be the most reliable predictor of browse production per species and per tree, with quarterly browse production being greater on trees with larger available canopy volumes (up to a threshold). Browse production differed significantly between quarters. Growing season onset occurred during the sampling period prior to the rainy season when mean maximum daily temperatures peaked. Quarterly browse production was greatest in evergreen E. divinorum, followed by the semi-deciduous species, S. africana and Z. mucronata.",

An imbalance in the ratio of grasses to bushes is a consequence of bush encroachment due to competition for moisture, nutrients and sunlight. This imbalance results in a decrease in grass cover, plant biodiversity and grazing capacity, leading to severe economic losses. Several methods exist to reduce high woody plant densities, including mechanical, manual, biological or chemical control. In this study, we assessed the structural and compositional attributes of the grass layer and compared these to the woody vegetation structure for herbicide-controlled rangelands and the no chemical control. The main objective was to evaluate the potential of chemical control to restore an open savanna system dominated by perennial grasses. Woody-dominated vegetation resulting from long-term overgrazing was assessed and compared to chemically controlled sites. Results revealed that chemical control treatment increased forage production and maintained woody-patch conservation. After the treatment, the sites were characterised by more productive and desirable woody species. The re-encroachment of woody species at all bush-controlled sites is possible. A follow-up control programme to manage and mitigate encroachment needs to be implemented when mitigating bush encroachment.",

Two tall (Elephant B and IRI-381) and two dwarf elephant grass genotypes (Mott and Taiwan A-146 2.37) were the grass components of intercrops in a two-year trial. Higher acid detergent fibre (ADF) and lignin contents were found in tall than dwarf elephant grass genotypes (p < 0.0001), while lower coefficients of in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM) were recorded in tall than dwarf elephant grass genotypes (p < 0.0001). There was no intercrop effect on the herbage accumulation (p = 0.1278), dry matter (DM) contents (p = 0.2338), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) (p = 0.2022), lignin (p = 0.7179) and condensed tannins (p = 0.1699) of the butterfly pea. The butterfly pea grown with tall genotypes had higher crude protein (CP) concentrations (p = 0.0001) and coefficients of IVDDM (p = 0.0086) than when intercropped with dwarf genotypes. The study showed that tall elephant grass genotypes improved the butterfly pea's nutritional value in grass–legume intercrops through increases in leaf/pod ratio. Intercropping with butterfly pea may compensate for the lower nutritive fodder value of tall elephant grasses compared to dwarf genotypes.",

This study was undertaken in Samburu county in Kenya, an area characterised by varying climatic conditions, land uses and agro-ecological zones, to determine the interrelationship between rainfall and temperature variability and the mobility of herds. To achieve the research objectives, 20 years of data for temperature, rainfall, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and georeferenced data (GIS) together with field data obtained through household interviews and community participatory mapping were utilised. Only Samburu Central is endowed with good rainfall and the pastoralists graze their animals around their homes all year round. Rarely does livestock in Samburu East graze around homesteads due to low rainfall and degraded pastures. The spatial distribution patterns of the herds followed pasture availability as shown by vegetation NDVI patterns. Areas with higher NDVI of over 0.3 attracted herd concentration but with high in situ mobility to maximise on grazing of the most nutritious pastures. This study proposes grazing management embedded in observed herd mobility and grazing resource use patterns as a strategy towards adapting the pastoral communities to the changing climate.",

Cattle rejected herbage from both cattle and sheep dung patches for six months after deposition. Sheep initially rejected the herbage from cattle dung patches, but their grazing patterns were no longer affected at six months after deposition. Sheep grazing tended not to be influenced by sheep dung. Urine deposition may consequently be an important factor in patch initiation and patch development.",

A field test of the three techniques in succulent karoo, showed that the discriminating power per metre of ellipse‐intercept survey (for all three abundance measures) is the same as that of each metre of line‐intercept survey or each four points of point‐intercept survey. The additional ellipse‐intercept information of plant densities and size distributions is shown to be useful for interpreting vegetation differences and for revealing differences (e.g. in vegetation dynamics) not detectable by measures of species covers alone.",

Thorn length and density was greatest for branches within easiest reach of goats. However, there was no increase in thorn length or density on the latest year's growth of branches of A. karroo individuals protected from browsing. Thorns on distal ends of branches are relatively small and sparse and this is partly due to differences in internode length. Herbivores limit the extent of annual growth and this prevents development of small thorns characteristic of late season growth. Thus, browsed individuals which lack late season growth may have greater spinescence.

Low frequency, low intensity grazing produced lower CDMD and herbage N levels than higher grazing frequencies and intensities. These differences were, however, generally small. Overall, levels of herbage digestibility (estimated by CDMD) and N fell within similar ranges to those observed for perennial ryegrass in temperate environments. Seasonal trends in quality were characterized by high levels during late autumn to early summer (May to October) and low levels during mid‐summer to early autumn (January to April). These data would tend to support high frequency grazing as part of the management programme for perennial ryegrass.

Enteropogon macrostachyus, Cenchrus ciliaris and Chloris roxburghiana were the most abundant grass species, while Brepharis integriifolia, Commelina benghalensis and Macrotylomma axillare were the most dominant forb species. Grasses increased towards the end of the wet season and the beginning of the dry season, while the forbs decreased. Eragrostis caespitosa, Cenchrus ciliaris, Eragrostis superba, Enteropogon macrostachyus and Themeda triandra were the most dominant grass species in sheep diets during both seasons, accounting for over 82% of the diet. Acalypha fruticosa, Grewia similis and G. bicolor were the most important browse species in goat diets in both seasons, while Eragrostis caespitosa and E. superba were the most common grass species during both seasons. Overall, goat diets comprised 81% browse, 17% grass and 2% forbs during the wet season; and 82% browse, 15% grass and 3% forbs during the dry season. Whilst the goat diets had higher (P < 0.05) Crude Protein (CP) content than sheep diets during both seasons, the sheep diets were lower in lignin content than goat diets during the wet season.

This research aims to gain better insight into the potential distribution of this plant and to determine some of the main environmental conditions that promote its thickening. Using the Maxent programme to determine the potential distribution, a map was developed to illustrate the possible extent of V. nilotica within KwaZulu-Natal. It is estimated that a possible 800 968 ha (8.5%) of the province has a greater than 50% distribution probability, whereas in 26.9% of the province there is 25%–50% probability of V. nilotica inhabiting these areas. Using Maxent, it was determined that geology and altitude were key determinants for V. nilotica habitat selection. This model-based map will be particularly useful for conservation and rangeland planning for future management and control of the plant through being able to predict which areas of the province are more likely to be high potential regions for the thickening of V. nilotica.",

    "abstract": "In a context of water scarcity, efforts to increase landscape production should focus on improving water productivity. This requires an appreciation of the various components of evapotranspiration (ET), including soil evaporation (Es) because the latter reflects 'unproductive' water loss. Both complex and simple algorithms have been developed to determine ET. In data scarce areas, developing and testing parsimonious algorithms is useful. This study sought to improve a simple single layer ET model by incorporating an Es component. Empirical methods were also explored to predict ET from vegetation indices (VIs), leaf area index (LAI) and reference evapotranspiration (ET0). A large aperture scintillometer and an eddy covariance (EC) system were used to validate the proposed algorithm at three sites over Grasslands and Albany Thicket biomes in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. There was good agreement between the observed and predicted ET with RMSE of 0.30–0.58 mm d−1 when average daily observed ET was 0.43–3.24 mm. The VIs had moderate correlations with the observed data due to the significant role played by Es (65%–84%) across the sites and stomatal conductance at the Albany Thicket site. The simple algorithms developed would make determining ET easier in data scarce regions.",

These include concerns over land-use change, long-term monitoring, climate change, governance and the need for more interdisciplinary research. We also identify some of the novel contributions of the KSI around these themes and highlight research issues that require further attention. These include greater focus on the social-ecological impact of large-scale infrastructural developments and wildlife ranching, as well as the need for more longitudinal studies related to contemporary social issues. We conclude by outlining a simple framework for thinking about interdisciplinarity in future research efforts in the Karoo. The first axis relates to the natural science/social science continuum, while the second is concerned with the continuum between basic and applied science. Greater awareness of these two dimensions could not only encourage researchers to reflect more carefully on where their research fits in relation to the broader research needs of this region but could also promote interdisciplinarity within the research community. It could also bring researchers closer to the realities and needs of the people who live in and derive their livelihoods from Karoo environments.",

Of the total of 21 grasses identified in the field survey, communal farmers had vernacular names only for 11 species. Respondents rated Digitaria eriantha and Pennisetum clandestinum to have the highest (p < 0.05) grazing value. Respondents' ratings of Eragrostis obtusa and Sporobolus africanus as having similar (moderate) grazing values to Themeda triandra is against the established knowledge. Respondents' ratings of T. triandra and S. africanus as having higher (p = 0.01) ecological value than the other grasses concur with the scientific knowledge, whereas their nomination of E. obtusa and D. eriantha as providing less ecological benefits than Aristida conjesta disagrees with some ecologists. The study hinted at the complementarity and discrepancies between LEK and scientific knowledge that need ratification. The respondents' lack of detailed knowledge is suggestive of a gradual eroding of LEK among the local communities that will adversely impact the local people's ability to implement sustainable rangeland utilisation practice. The current study also recognised farmers' familiarity as well as training needs that would expound their knowledge and management of grasses.",

Grassland species composition corresponded with landscape position and soil organic carbon. Grasslands occurring in infertile, elevated landscape positions were the most diverse having a greater richness of tufted graminoids, herbaceous forbs and geoxylic suffrutices than grassland occurring in low-lying dystrophic sites, which were dominated by rhizomatous and stoloniferous graminoids. Previously afforested grasslands (i.e. secondary grassland) were species poor, lacked keystone grasses, such as Themeda triandra, were dominated by a few species of rhizomatous or stoloniferous grasses and had been colonised by pioneer or ruderal forbs. Grassland species composition affects the provision of ecosystem services so to maintain a full complement of these attributes, grassland landscapes in Maputaland should comprise intact grasslands that cover both elevated and low-lying topographic positions.",

Diet of the rumen liquor donor may change this if it contains CT. Leaves from 11 browse species were evaluated for their IVOMD of nitrogen, fibre fractions and CT concentrations. Crude protein (CP) ranged from 14% to 25%, whereas neutral detergent fibre (NDF) varied from 20% to 40%. The CT fractions differed (P ≤ 0.05) among the browse species with most CT either soluble or bound to protein. Acacia brevispica and Berchemia discolor had the greatest concentrations of total CT, whereas Balanites aegyptiaca and Prosopis juliflora had the least. Rumen liquid from goats on grass diet (no CT) or browsing species with CT resulted in differences in IVOMD of NDF (P ≤ 0.05); 37% less (P = 0.11) fibre-bound CT IVOMD resulted when rumen liquid donors consumed browse containing CT. This indicates that (1) during IVOMD assays, rumen fluid donor diets should reflect, as closely as possible, those of the target animals and their diets, and (2) rumen liquid donor diet composition, especially forage CT concentrations, should be documented when evaluating results of IVOMD trials that use rumen liquor donors consuming CT.",

The response of important species to grazing in each range type was determined using detrended correspondence analysis. With few exceptions, the response of species was consistent across all range types and in most cases supports previous definitions of decreaser and increaser groups. Within range types, the influence of environment on species distribution in ordination space was identified using Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Significant correlations existed between ordination axes and soil characteristics such as soil depth, clay content and surface stone. In most cases grazing induced patterns of degradation in ordination space were predominantly influenced by soil depth. Understanding the influence of environmental characteristics on grazing patterns can assist in predicting species composition within range types.",

R&T found that Lantana was more common in the communal area than in the conserved area. Glyphosate herbicide was sprayed to suppress Lantana from 2016 to 2019 in the conserved area only. We re-examined the bird-dispersal hypothesis by surveying subcanopy and intercanopy environments. We found more Lantana in the subcanopy than in the intercanopy. There were more Lantana plants in the conserved area, but there were virtually none in the communal area. Most concerning was the apparent resprouting of Lantana despite herbicide application. We used sequential aerial photographs and found that there has been an increase in woody cover in the conservation area since 2013, which may exacerbate the problem with this invasive plant. We conclude that it is not communal grazing per se that causes the encroachment of Lantana, and that it has more do with the woody cover of native plants, as concluded by R&T.",

The quantification of aboveground biomass and carbon content are among the principal indicators to evaluate these changes. Most methods used to quantify these parameters are costly, time consuming and destructive. In this paper, two non-destructive methods were compared: digital image processing and biometric measurements. Aboveground biomass and carbon content of five perennial shrubs were studied inside and outside Sidi Toui National Park, southern Tunisia. The effect of long-term protection on aboveground biomass and carbon content was assessed. The main results indicated that both methods provided similar aboveground biomass and carbon values. Aboveground biomass and carbon content were strongly correlated with canopy cover and biovolume (R2 ˃ 0.7). Positive linear relationships were found for all the studied species. Apart from the large canopy cover of Haloxylon schmittianum and Haloxylon scoparium, the obtained results showed that long-term protection had no significant effect on aboveground biomass and carbon content for the other species. These results suggest that digital charting technique is an accurate method for assessing rangeland productivity in a timely and cost-efficient manner and that long-term protection is not always suitable for enhancing carbon content and therefore ecosystem resilience under climate change conditions.",

Old lands are dominated by the unpalatable and poisonous, pioneer perennial Galenia africana. A complete randomised block design was followed with eight treatments and four replicates. All treatments, excluding the control, included re-seeding with five palatable species from the region. Soil disturbance was important with best results after three years in the ploughing-and-seeding and rolling-and-seeding treatments, which were also the most cost-effective treatments. Rainfall played a major role, with good germination in year one, but after a dry summer most of the new seedlings died. After three years the grasses Chaetobromus involucratus subsp. dregeanus and Ehrharta calycina, followed by the dwarf shrub Tripteris sinuata, established the best, but less than 1% of the seed sown established. The near-absence of perennial species in the soil seedbank and above ground necessitate the addition of seed. In conjunction with this, applying mechanical soil disturbance using an environmentally-friendly method, such as a knife roller, is advised to rehabilitate old croplands to a more productive state for herbivores.Keywords: indigenous perennial species, improved forage, re-seeding, soil disturbance, species diversity",

This shift in vegetation structure can affect many factors, including insect fauna. Epigeal arthropods occupy smaller habitat patches and therefore respond to the effects of bush encroachment at finer scales. Different restoration efforts to combat bush encroachment have been implemented. A low-intensity management method is brush packing, which involves the use of removed woody branches to cover the soil surface. This study investigates whether the application of brush packing is effective in the restoration of insect communities. Total insect richness and the tendency towards diversity were higher on bush-controlled plots, irrespective of brush packing. This trend was found for all tested insect orders, except for Hymenoptera. However, non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination clustered distinctive insect communities in areas where brush packing was applied. The results indicate that the application of brush packing results in higher habitat heterogeneity and, consequently, more diversified insect communities on a small scale. We argue that brush packing application does not only benefit vegetation structure, but can also improve insect community composition, thereby increasing overall ecosystem health and stability, making this restoration method suitable for highly degraded areas.",

Regression analyses of count data showed that metsulfuron-methyl at 45 g ha−1 (USD 20.05 ha−1), picloram at 252 g ha−1 (USD 25.47 ha−1) and 2,4-D/dicamba/MCPA at 540/360/474 g ha−1 (USD 45.41 ha−1) required five annual treatments in summer to eradicate C. macrocephalum, whereas 2,4-D amine at 1 440 g ha−1 (USD 13.65 ha−1) and MCPA at 1 200 g ha−1 (USD 14.46 ha−1) required six treatments. Hence, there is a trade-off between the use of slightly more effective herbicides against the lower costs of other selective herbicides.",

Maximum TNC values in the plants were reached after 12h00. The TNC content was positively correlated with the DM content of the plant, but this was probably environmentally induced. The negative relation between TNC and N content appeared to be genetically controlled. Diploid Italian types had the highest mean seasonal DM content. Cultivars with the highest mean DM yield over the growing season rated poorly in terms of TNC content. However, the coefficients of variation for the seasonal DM yield and TNC content were high. Coefficients of variation for mean DM content over the growing season were much lower than for TNC content and DM yield. It was concluded that the variation within and between cultivars was sufficiently large for successful manipulation in a breeding programme. The cultivars Exalta, Exalta × Lemtal, Moritz and ex Matador ranked high in both TNC yield and DM content.",

The relation between the relative density of resources and herbivore density is illustrated by regressions of the ecological density of kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) on the relative density of habitat patches within landscapes for a semi‐arid savanna. Habitat suitability models were used to isolate patches of suitable kudu habitat for each landscape. The habitat suitability models were used to classify a proportion of randomly located circular plots as kudu habitat. The relative density of habitat patches within the respective landscapes was thus determined. The relation between kudu density and the relative density of habitat patches in each landscape was significant, with exponential models producing more significant statistics than linear models. Regressions of resource density against animal density are useful to understand ‘carrying capacity’ for wild herbivores, and additionally provide insights into temporal fluctuations in animal numbers. The usefulness of the approach depends on correctly defining the size of a habitat patch and selecting an appropriate scale of study.",

Results showed that clipping height had less of an effect on shoot weight and tiller number than time of clipping. Clipping at the tillering stage produced 8.1 to 9.4 g per plant dry matter and 9.3 to 11.2 tillers per plant, compared to 7.7 and 8.1 g per plant and 7.1 and 8.5 tillers per plant for the undipped control. Clipping at the jointing and booting stages reduced shoot mass and tiller number. Defoliation during tillering stage did not have an impact on plant shoot mass or tiller number. It is therefore recommended that wall barley plants are defoliated early at the tillering stage before the plant reaches the jointing or reproductive stages, or after the plants reach physiological maturity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In South Africa there is widespread reliance on kikuyu grass as a source of summer forage for intensive dairy, beef and sheep enterprises. There is, however, a dearth of reliable information on the fertility requirements of kikuyu pastures. Responses of previously productive and unproductive kikuyu pastures in the Mistbelt and Highland Sourveld of KwaZulu‐Natal to top‐dressed nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers were studied infield cutting trials conducted during two consecutive seasons. Significant dry matter (DM) yield responses accompanied incremental N applications of up to 500 kg ha−1. First‐season DM yields of previously productive pastures at zero applied N were in the range 6 to 9 t ha−1, while yields of previously unproductive pastures at zero N were 0 to 2 t ha−1. By the second season, yields at zero N were uniformly low on the various pastures, reflecting the limited extent of plant‐available N reserves in soils under productive kikuyu. In both the Mistbelt and Highland Sourveld, efficiency of response to applied N in seasons when rainfall was similar to the long‐term mean was approximately 30 kg DM per kg N over the N application range of 0 to 250 kg N ha−1. When rainfall was substantially below average, N efficiencies decreased markedly. Application of N in six rather than three dressings during the growing season resulted in the N efficiency increasing by 3.5 kg DM per kg N. In contrast to the enormous responses to N, there was little or no response to P in the various trials. An optimum P test (NH4 HCO3 / NH4F / EDTA) for high clay content (>50% clay) Mistbelt soils of approximately 10 mg L−1 is suggested from yield‐soil test calibrations. Data highlighting the impact of soil sampling depth on P test values are presented, and this information serves to underline the importance of standardizing sampling procedures in the soil testing of pastures for fertility purposes.",

The models used diet quality and intake data collected from sites of different sward structures and species compositions on this veld type. In model 1, predicted ADG was highest at an optimum sward height (Hopt) of 60‐ 80 mm for sheep and approximately 120 mm for cattle but Hopt is likely to decrease as forage quality declines through the season. Species composition appeared to be the major determinant of ADG above Hopt while sward height appeared to be more important below Hopt. Potential rates of DM intake generally far exceeded predicted voluntary intake, suggesting that on sourveld, intake is seldom likely to be restricted by the effects of sward height on intake rate per se. In model 2, species composition had a major effect on animal production with sites showing large differences in predicted LWG. Significantly, site rankings in terms of predicted LWG were different between cattle and sheep and showed only limited agreement with veld condition score. In both models, small, apparently insignificant, differences in dietary quality translated into major differences in predicted ADG and LWG. Through their effects on diet quality, species composition and sward structure thus both appear to be important determinants of animal production on Döhne Sourveld. However, an optimum species composition and sward structure cannot be specified as these variables are conditional upon each other as well as the season and the animal species involved.

Lantana was significantly more prevalent on communal lands than in the conservation area, and in sub-canopy micro-sites than inter-canopy micro-sites. The communal lands had significantly lower herbaceous biomass than the conservation area, and Lantana prevalence was inversely related to herbaceous biomass. Higher prevalence of Lantana in communal areas was probably due to more intense disturbance of the herbaceous layer in this land-use type, although this was not conclusively demonstrated. The difference in the prevalence of Lantana between sub-canopy and inter-canopy micro-sites is most likely explained by either seed dispersal patterns imposed by avian dispersal agents and/or micro-site variation. An assessment of population size class structure of Lantana in the communal lands suggested that the population is stable and rapidly recruiting.",

Fifteen male Barka goats, approximately one year old and 10-15kg body weight, were randomly assigned to the five rations and fed in individual pens. Chemical composition, dry matter intake (DMI), in vitro dry and organic matter digestibility and body weight changes of the animals were evaluated. The average crude protein content of the pods was about 47% higher than the 7% minimum required for normal rumen function, while that of the hay was about 13% below. Percent ash, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), hemi-cellulose (HC), cellulose (CL) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) contents were higher in the hay than in the pods.

    "abstract": "Abstract An experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of stage of growth at harvest on fermentative characteristics of Digitaria eriantha subsp. eriantha silage. The treatment included three different growth stages (early vegetative, boot stage and full-bloom stage). The materials were ensiled either directly (unwilted) or after wilting for a period of 5–6 h prior to the ensiling. Samples of silage were taken from three bottles at 0, 7, 21 and 120 d for analysis of fermentative characteristics. Within the directly cut silage, stage of harvesting had no effect on pH on day 7, but on days 21 and 120 there were differences. Lower pH was recorded consistently for the boot stage silage. Within the prior-wilted groups, lower pH was recorded on day 7 for the boot growth stage while the difference between the growth stages in terms of pH was not significant on day 21. Within the directly cut silage, lactic acid concentration was consistently higher for the boot stage as compared to the early or full-bloom stage. Similarly, within the prior-wilted group, silages harvested at the boot growth stage resulted in higher lactic acid concentration on days 7 and 21, but on day 120 lactic acid concentration was higher for the early vegetative stage. In directly cut silages, harvesting at the boot growth stage resulted in a higher acetic acid concentration than that of the early vegetative growth stage or the full-bloom growth stage. For wilted silage, however, lower acetic acid concentration was recorded for the boot stage silage. In directly cut silage, the total nitrogen (N) concentration of boot-stage silage on day 120 was higher compared to the rest, but within the wilted silage the N value for boot-stage silage was not significantly different compared to the early vegetative stage. At day 120 the ammonianitrogen concentration increased for the early vegetative growth stage and full-bloom growth stage, while it was either reduced or remained similar for the boot-stage harvest when compared to the control. Under the current set of experiments, harvesting at the boot growth stage seems beneficial as the silage is lower in pH, higher in lactic acid concentration and able to retain most of the nitrogen in the silage for later use by the target animal.

Harvested seed must be cleaned of chaff to allow mechanical planting, which can exclude small seeds. We propose that fluid seed drilling techniques (suspending uncleaned harvested seed in a cellulose-based gel matrix, which may then be injected into the soil with a mechanical planter) may overcome these challenges. As a preliminary investigation of the proposed method we designed a greenhouse pot trial experiment aimed at quantifying restoration success through the measurement of seedling recruitment, biomass production and composition responses of commercial and harvested seed mixes under simulated fluid seed drilling and smoke water priming (collectively termed application method). These data were analysed using generalised linear modelling and multivariate analyses. Commercial mixed seed resulted in greater recruitment, whereas harvested seed produced the greatest biomass production. There was large multivariate separation between seed types and seed type × application method centroids for recruitment responses and only seed type for biomass responses. Application method had minimal effects on restoration measurements whilst seed type greatly affected these measurements. Careful selection of the restoration seed mix is advised.",

They also act as natural sources of fodder for livestock and thus risk becoming homogenised in a heavily grazed rangeland. The aim of this study was to compare plant diversity on inselbergs and matrices in heavily grazed sections of three arid biomes of South Africa's west. The inselbergs are scattered in a matrix of rangeland vegetation in the Desert, Nama-Karoo and Succulent Karoo biomes where pastoral herding is the main land use. Plant composition, cover and growth forms were quantified in plots and along transects in 21 inselberg and matrix sites. Inselbergs had more diverse plant and growth forms and greater cover than adjacent matrices. Defoliated plants on inselbergs are able to recover due to more mesic conditions and because inselbergs are largely grazed during drier periods, species are able to flower and set seed during winter. Inselbergs are also less accessible to livestock due to their unique geomorphology. Therefore, inselbergs are able to persist as islands of diversity and warrant inclusion into conservation and rangeland farming management plans since climate change will result in biome boundary shifts.",

In cut-and-carry silvopastoral systems, woody trees are often severely pruned for harvesting nitrogen (N)-rich fodder. However, very few studies have assessed the influence of this management practice on symbiotic N2 fixation. The study was conducted at Fountainhill Estate, Wartburg, South Africa, to assess the influence of pruning height on N2 fixation of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) using the 15N natural abundance method. Pigeon pea was grown in association with Panicum maximum. The treatments were unpruned, and pruning at 60 or 90 cm height. Results showed that pruning at 60 cm height significantly decreased total N (P ≤ 0.05), percentage of N derived from atmospheric N2 (P ≤ 0.05) and amount of N2 fixed (P ≤ 0.05) compared with unpruned plants and those pruned at 90 cm height. It was concluded that harvesting fodder at 90 cm height should be practised for pigeon pea to optimise symbiotic N2 fixation.",

In a continuously-grazed commonage at Ntshiqo in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, we measured seasonal patterns of biomass accumulation and forage quality under a short season rest (October–January), a full summer rest (October–June), and an extended year rest (June 2014–October 2015). Forage quality was expected to decline with increasing biomass accumulation. The full season rest produced twice as much (almost 1 ton ha−1) biomass than the short season rest. Up to 1.5 tons ha−1 more forage accumulated in the exclosures in the extended year rest, compared with the surrounding grazed grassland, but about 15% of the standing dry matter was lost through frost and senescence from the rested areas during winter. Forage quality (crude protein, phosphorus) declined from summer to winter and was similar in all rested and grazed areas, except for 4% higher acid detergent fibre (ADF) for the full- versus the short-summer rest. For commonage in sourveld, periodic full season rests (spring to autumn), followed by winter grazing with a protein lick and a spring burn, are recommended.",

    "abstract": "In livestock-based livelihoods of the developing world, determination of the nutritive value of browse species is mainly associated with farmer perceptions. Additionally, little is known on seasonal variation in nutritive value of these species in some areas. Therefore, chemical analysis is necessary to validate farmer nutritive value ranking, because this has implications on rangeland management. We compared farmer perceptions with chemically quantified crude protein, dry matter, acid detergent fibre (ADF), and dry organic matter digestibility (DOMD) of seven browse species. Crude protein and DOMD were higher in the wet season compared to the dry season. However, ADF was higher in the dry season. There was a strong negative correlation between acid detergent fibre and DOMD during the wet season (r = −0.631, p < 0.05). Positive, though non-significant correlations were observed between farmer perceptions of 'most nutritious according to herder' and CP (r = 0.29, p = 0.54), farmer perception of 'most abundant species' and DM (r = 0.13, p = 0.78), and between farmer perception of 'highly preferred species by livestock' and DOMD (r = 0.32, p = 0.48). Therefore, although farmer perceptions of nutritive value of browse species are important in strategic utilisation of rangelands, they should not replace chemical analysis, but should complement each other.",

Awns (n = 100) were collected from 16 sites across a mean annual precipitation gradient (575–1 223 mm), ranging from 271−1 097 m asl.

Aboveground biomass yield for the grass species was 17.6 and 31.2% higher, respectively, for the highland and mid-highland agro-ecologies for enclosed areas, compared with open-access grazing. Andropogon amethystinus (Important value index (IVI) = 86.9) and Pennisetum thunbergii (IVI = 79.2), the most dominant and highest density, found in the enclosed areas decreased from open access grazing land and replaced by more resistant to continuous heavy grazing, like Eleusine floccifolia (IVI = 125.7) in the mid-highland area. Herbaceous species richness was better in open access grazing land than the enclosed areas. Soil quality parameters, such as total nitrogen, available phosphorous, calcium, sodium and cation exchange capacity, were significantly higher for enclosed areas than open access practice. In conclusion, enclosed areas performed greater in most of the parameters considered than open access grazing land management practices at both agro-ecologies.",

Soil respiration, however, varies considerably in space and time owing to the influence of factors such as soil nutrient content, temperature and water content. Comparing soil respiration across a fence-line separating rangelands in contrasting condition can potentially isolate effects of rangeland management from other abiotic variables. To explore this idea, soil respiration was measured from 260 different collars across a fence-line contrast in the Nama Karoo, near Beaufort West, over a period of four days in May 2005. Differences in soil respiration across the fence-line were only evident when the data were analysed in relation to soil temperature. The large data set enabled delineation of boundary lines relating soil respiration to temperature on the two farms. The boundary line analysis showed that constraint on soil respiration was between 0.2 and 0.4 umol CO2 m−2 s−1 greater under high compared to moderate stocking density. It was concluded that measurement of soil respiration is likely to be useful for detecting changes in ecosystem function as a result of over-utilisation of Karoo rangeland.

Given that thicket vegetation is prevalent in Eastern Cape, South Africa, we monitored soil CO2 effluxes from an intact thicket, degraded thicket (DT) and grassland (G) over 10 months, as affected by temperature, moisture and penetration resistance (PR). High soil moisture (16%) reduced PR (4 kg cm−2), which raised winter effluxes (1.2 µmol m−2 s−1), while low moisture (2%) resulted in hard dry soil (14 kg cm−2) that suppressed spring effluxes (0.2 µmol m−2 s−1). There was good interaction between PR and moisture (r = −0.53), with seasonal effluxes increasing with increasing moisture (r = 0.9, p = 0.0001) and decreasing PR (r = −0.66, p = 0.02). Temperature effects were significant under unlimited moisture supply. Thus high summer temperature (40 °C) gave lower effluxes in DT and G (<1 µmol m−2 s−1) due to limited moisture (<10%), whereas high autumn temperature (48 °C) and good moisture (16%) accelerated CO2 emissions (averaging 2 µmol m−2 s−1) from all covers. Although semi-arid ecosystems are limited by low moisture and sandy soils, they contribute to CO2 emissions under high moisture and increasing temperature.

Rainfall for the first three grazing seasons was similar to the long‐term mean of 790 mm whilst 1992/1993 was a relatively low rainfall season (554 mm). Five cattle‐to‐sheep ratio treatments were applied, each within a four‐paddock rotational grazing system. Sheep performance improved as the proportion of cattle in the species mix increased, whereas cattle performance was affected by the stocking rate of cattle rather than by the presence of sheep. Sheep performance declined in each ratio treatment from the first to the third season. Sheep performed best during the low rainfall season. Animal performance data were used to demonstrate an approach for predicting the effects of varying cattle and sheep stocking rates, in mixed‐species grazing systems, on the performance of cattle and sheep.",

Low digestibility and low rate of digestion limited feed intake only when sheep were grazing dry, wilted kikuyu. At other times, rumen contents were relatively low, and voluntary intakes appeared to have been controlled by other factors. The foaminess of the rumen under circumstances of a low rumen fill seems to suggest that a high saponin content could have limited intake. However, the fact that a high rumen fill coincided with a high in vitro foam production in one instance may imply that a high saponin content was not instrumental in limiting intake. Only the rumen ammonia concentration and the total nitrogen content of the leaves showed a consistent relationship with voluntary intake.",

Possible reasons for the low intakes were found in the high soluble nitrogen and nitrate content of the pasture, its high oxalate content, and its considerable potential for foaming, the latter suggesting the presence of sapbnins. The high fibre content of the material could also have limited intake in wilted, dry or stemmy kikuyu. The relative importance of these factors appears to change with growth stage, the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied, stocking rate and moisture supply. The factors which are detrimental to forage quality such as oxalates and nitrates are higher in the young and actively growing material than in older material, while the in vitro production of foam seems unrelated to forage quality and remained high, despite changes in other factors which detrimentally affected forage quality.",

At each of 100 systematically located points per grazing treatment the nearest plant of each of three target species was recorded as being in one of five defoliation categories which ranged from ungrazed to severely, but uniformly, grazed. Each treatment was sampled at the end of each of three consecutive grazing seasons. The data for each species were subjected to log‐linear and canonical correspondence analyses. In these analyses the proportional composition of defoliation categories was the dependent variable and stocking rate, cattle‐to‐sheep ratio and year were the independent variables. The results indicated that (1) stocking rate had an overriding effect on defoliation pattern; (2) ratio had a lesser but significant influence on the defoliation pattern of all three species; (3) similar defoliation patterns may be achieved at different cattle:sheep ratios provided that the stocking rate is adjusted; (4) the grazing capacity concept must be reconsidered to account for the differing impacts of grazing by cattle and by sheep on individual grass plants; and (5) the sampling technique applied in the study provided meaningful information on the defoliation pattern of the target species.",

    "abstract": "Small-plot cutting trials are of particular importance in research relating to intensive pastures. Undetected changes in soil fertility during the course of experimentation may detract from the validity of results in trials of this kind. Information from field trials conducted in KwaZulu-Natal during the past two decades are used to illustrate the potential impact of soil fertility aspects in small-plot cutting trials. A major potential pitfall is the underestimation of potassium (K) depletion accompanying the removal of herbage at harvesting. In an Italian ryegrass trial 518 kg K ha−1 was removed in harvested material in a single season. Failure to compensate (by fertilizer topdressings) for removals of K may result in growth, particularly in the more favourable treatments, being inadvertently restricted. Soil acidification during the course of experimentation is a second factor which may threaten the usefulness of data from cutting trials. Acidification is promoted by the application of relatively high rates of N fertilizers; in this context, variable acidification where N fertilization is a factor in trials warrants particular attention. Removals, immobilization and leaching of phosphorus and sulphur as well as inherent soil heterogeneity on the trial site are additional important considerations in small-plot trials. The only effective means of dealing with these problems is through the testing of soil samples drawn from individual treatments at suitably regular intervals.",

Ensiling should therefore be considered as an alternative method for conserving the forage. The aim of this study was to determine if the use of a lactic acid bacterial inoculant when ensiling E. curvula is beneficial in terms of the fermentation dynamics during ensiling and the aerobic stability of the silage. The composition of the fresh chopped grass was 37.8+0.1% dry matter, 50.8±2.3% in vitro organic matter digestibility, 5.8±0.3% crude protein, and 79.2±0.34% neutral detergent fibre on a dry matter basis. Eragrostis curvula was ensiled in eighteen mini silos (three replications x six periods) for each of the control and inoculated treatments to follow the fermentation dynamics during ensiling. The pH of the control silage on day 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 122 of ensiling was 5.90, 5.08, 4.81, 4.76, 4.67 and 4.33, and that of the inoculated silage was 5.12, 4.34, 4.24, 4.30, 4.14 and 4.0 respectively. The ammonia nitrogen as percentage of total nitrogen of the control and inoculated silage differed (P<0.05) and was 14.4% and 10.9% respectively. The butyric acid content of the control and inoculated silage was 2.77% and 0.16% (P<0.05), and the lactic acid content 2.22% and 3.15% (P<0.05) respectively. Addition of the lactic acid bacterial inoculant to E. curvula at ensiling resulted in a more rapid drop in pH and better preservation compared to the control silage. Both silages were stable when exposed to air for five days.",

It is especially important in semi-arid environments where, apart from moisture, the levels at which grasses are utilized has a major influence on their persistence in the environment. The effects of selective defoliation and height of defoliation (5 cm and 10 cm stubble heights) on the performance of the grass, Themeda triandra, were investigated in a field experiment for two growing seasons. Performance was measured as tiller production, rate of production, tiller mortality, herbage yield and quality. Tiller production was greater (81 tillers per plant) under non-selective defoliation than under selective defoliation (49 tillers per plant) in the 1995/1996 season. Tiller mortality was higher (66.45%) under heavy selective defoliation than under nonselective defoliation (21.98%). Herbage yield, apart from the control treatment, was high (13.6 g per plant) under light non-selective defoliation. Heavy selective defoliation reduced the nutrient levels (e.g. levels of soluble carbohydrates under heavy selective defoliation were 6 g kg−1 glucose compared to 20 g kg−1 glucose under light non-selective defoliation).",

However, conventional monitoring methods are becoming inadequate to meet future challenges, where quantification of spatial and temporal variation is required. This study proposes an on-site remote sensing method for monitoring above-ground biomass in rangelands. A preliminary model was formulated, based on simple regression relationships between canopy reflectance properties and aboveground biomass. This model was validated in semi-arid environments (Nama-karoo and Kalahari) within the framework of spatial and temporal experimental trials. Model accuracy was found to be primarily a function of canopy structure and vegetation composition where increases in dwarf shrub presence resulted in greater variations of both NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and LAI (Leaf Area Index) measurements. Temporal variation in model accuracy could also be observed which seemed to be associated with precipitation events. It was concluded that the proposed remote sensing method has potential as a ground truthing technique for determination of rangeland biomass. Indications are that this method is well suited for use in grass dominated veld types. With further refinement, implementation of this technique should also be possible in dwarf shrublands.",

Of these systems, multi-paddock rotational grazing gave the best results with continuous stocking resulting in the worst. All three systems studied had long histories of both continuous stocking- and of pauci-paddock rotational grazing. The veld, under both these previous systems of management has stabilised, but at different seral stages. The continuously stocked range stabilised in the early developmental seral stage, consisting mainly of annual grasses. The veld under pauci-paddock rotational management stabilised in the early to mid-developmental seral stage, consisting mainly of perennial grasses. Experimentation on veld in a stable condition is a prerequisite if valid conclusions in respect of rotational grazing and continuous stocking are to be drawn. Rotational grazing on overgrazed veld will result in poor animal performance, while it is generally accepted that continuous stocking on pristine veld will result in excellent animal performance for a number of years. Multi-paddock rotational grazing outperformed both pauci-paddock rotational grazing as well as continuous stocking on both types of veld. This is surprising taking into account the mid-seral stage condition of the vegetation. This supports the argument that with improved veld management, an improved production potential is possible on veld even in a degraded or current condition.

The two acids can also be recovered from the dung of various herbivores and their presence can be used as evidence of grazing by animals such as cattle, hippopotamus and warthogs. The reduced presence of these compounds in the dung of goats supports the fact that goats both graze and browse. Analysis of the dung of typical browsers such as kudu, black rhinoceros and giraffe suggests that kudu and black rhinoceros may occasionally graze when grass is available. p-Coumaric and ferulic acid are not readily detectable by this method in extracts of the major tree species browsed by goats in the area studied. The yield of these two compounds in the dung of goats gives a reasonable estimate of the extent to which goats are known to graze in this area. The simplicity and uniqueness of this approach in obtaining a rough estimate of the extent of grazing by browsing animals is particularly attractive as it is more practical than field observations and invasive techniques studying gut contents.",

Toposequence delineation significantly (p < 0.05) affected fast wetting, slow wetting, mechanical disaggregation, microbial respiration and CEC. There was significant variation and relationship between vegetation types, toposequence delineation and soil properties.

The abundance of P. maximum growing under their canopies was estimated by scoring on a scale of 0 (no P. maximum) to 3 (P. maximum predominates). Presence of P. maximum was mainly associated with larger trees of all three species, and ranged from virtual absence under small trees to pure stands under larger trees. Spearman's rank correlations between tree height and the abundance of P. maximum(median score) were positive and significant. Panicum maximum attained pure stands (score 3) under smaller A. tortilis trees than under either A. karroo or D. cinerea. A median score of 3 was attained under A. tortilis, A. karroo and D. cinerea trees of >2.0m, >4.0m and >4.5m, respectively.

A correlation coefficient of r = 0.7456, calculated for Karoo bushes, indicates that this method can be used to non-destructively estimate available phytomass. This in turn can be used for the prediction of current grazing capacity in areas where Karoo bushes are dominant in the vegetation. In the case of the Karoo grasses, a rather loose definition and interpretation of the canopy spread cover, led to a low correlation coefficient, r = 0.5662. This renders the present method largely unsuited for available phytomass estimations to be used in further predictions of grazing capacity in the mountainous areas where the studied grasses are dominant in the vegetation.

    "abstract": "Wall barley (Hodreum murinum L.) is an annual cool-season grass species that grows in areas with a Mediterranean climate. It has potential as a forage source in Jordan. The objective was to determine seasonal chemical composition of wall barley grown under sub-humid Mediterranean conditions. A field trial was conducted during 2000 and 2001 growing seasons at Samta (32°23'N, 35°50'E) in the Ajloun Mountains, Jordan. Data were collected on 28 February, 15 March, 30 March, 15 April and 15 May. The lowest fibre content of leaves was on 28 February and 15 March, with a range of 19.5% to 23.3%. Fibre content of leaves (73.3%) and stems (79.9%) peaked when the plants were mature (15 May). In contrast to fibre, the protein content decreased gradually with age. Protein content of the leaves on 28 February was 25%, after which it declined gradually and reached 2.9% at maturity. The calcium content of the leaves was higher than that of the stems and was sufficient to meet ewes' maintenance requirements. The Ca content of leaves during the period from 28 February to 30 March was 1.2% to 1.1%, whereas, the content declined with age and reached the lowest value (0.01%) at maturity. The phosphorus content did not show significant variation. It is concluded that age and environmental conditions may affect the nutritive value of wall barley.",

The treatments were (1) forage + groundnut shell (GNS) supplement, (2) forage + cassava peels (CaP) supplement and (3) grazing on forage only. All animals were grazed on natural pasture during the five months dry season period (November 1994 – March 1995). Body weight change, body condition scores (BCS), nutrient digestibility coefficient and economic benefits were the parameters investigated. Body weight changes were 6.3 ± 1.5, 8.4 ± 0.8 and 3.6 ± 1.2kg, for steers on treatments 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Live weight gain was better (P<0.05) in treatments 1 and 2. However, live weight gain was much better (P<0.05) in CaP steers than GNS steers. Nutrient digestibility coefficients by steers on treatments 1, 2 and 3 followed the pattern observed in live weight gain. Supplemented steers had higher (P<0.05) digestibility coefficients than steers that grazed forage only. Digestibility values between treatments 1 and 2 were also different (P<0.05) from each other. The profit margin of supplemented steers was above those steers that grazed only. Socio-economically, it was advantageous to supplement steers with crop residues when grazing on natural pasture in the dry season. Results of this trial demonstrated that steers can maintain their live weight by grazing on natural pasture. However, supplementation with crop residue diets improved live weight gain, BCS and apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients during the dry season. Finally, the ability of the steers on grazing only to maintain their live weight during the period demonstrated the nutritional significance of available natural pasture in the central zone of Delta State, Nigeria during the dry season.",

Ordination of grass species composition did not provide a good degradation gradient, due to domination by different species of annual grasses at many of the sites. However a centred PCA ordination of perennial grass species indicated a degradation gradient. This gradient was used to allocate a range condition score to each site, which was then correlated with other measurements. The range condition score did not correlate well with mulch cover, basal cover, proportion of bare soil, above-ground grass biomass, proportion of moribund grass, proportion of seedlings amongst the perennial grasses, density of woody plants lower than O.5m and canopy cover of browsable woody plants over 0.5m tall. A weak correlation (r2 = 0.68, p<0.0001, n = 20) was obtained through a power trend line with woody canopy cover of only the bush thickening species. A better correlation (r2 = 0.90, p<0.0001, n = 20) was obtained with mean distance from sampling point to the nearest perennial grass. This may therefore be an appropriate indicator to include in range condition score for such types of savanna.",

We used permanent transects (samples) of differing length, ranging from 15–30m. Each transect was made up of contiguous 1m × 1m quadrats (sample units). In each quadrat, we recorded the species present and counted the number of woody alien plants. Chromolaena diminished under annual burning. Species richness and turnover increased in all transects over time. The 25m transect was as efficient as the 30m transect; however, the latter was influenced by an edge effect, confounding the determination of an optimum sample size for monitoring species richness. Species-accumulation curves were unable to predict alpha diversity at scales larger than transect sizes. Species composition was not affected by transect size; transects of 15m offered a 40–50% saving on sampling effort over 25m and 30m transects, respectively.

The dry season utilisation patterns of two woody species, Acacia tortilis and Boscia albitrunca, in two comparable sites but subjected to different kudu densities, were studied to determine if kudu adapt their feeding behaviour in response to animal density. Shoots of plants in the high-density area were vertically more uniformly utilised compared to shoots in the low-density area where browsing was more intense in certain height strata. Thicker shoots were selected in the high-density area and smaller plants selected than in the low-density area. It is concluded that kudu feeding behaviour during the dry season was significantly altered as a result of animal density differences. It is suggested that a high browsing pressure during times of low browse availability probably affects the productivity and recruitment of critical resources and questions the sustainability of such systems.

Overcoming these challenges requires considerable management actions efforts. In this context, the current two-year (2017/2018 and 2018/2019) study investigated the effects of soil surface scarification and reseeding of rangelands with sulla (Hedysarum coronarium L.) on botanical composition, biomass production, water productivity and pastoral value in the Sbaihia community, Tunisia. The experimental design consisted of a randomised complete block design with six replications. The treatments were: (i) soil surface superficial scarification; (ii) reseeding sulla following soil scarification; and, (iii) control. Despite the relatively important interannual variation, the highest aboveground net primary production (2 307 and 5 330 kg dry matter ha-1), water productivity (9.5 and 11.8 kg DM mm-1), and pastoral value (2 099 and 4 853 forage units ha-1) values were recorded in the rangelands reseeded with sulla in both growing seasons. Sulla contribution in the species composition of reseeded rangelands increased from 1.7% in 2018 to 2% in 2019. Although soil surface scarification increased the vegetation cover, its effect on biomass production was not significant. Therefore, combined soil scarification and reseeding well-adapted native forage species has a great potential to improve productivity of semi-arid rangelands.",

In this study, we examined the growth characteristics of C. sericea under glasshouse conditions where water limitation was implemented at different plant ages, and for different durations. Results indicate that preferential resource allocation to the roots, as well as reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration, were early responses to water limitation, irrespective of the age at which water limitation was imposed, or the duration of water limitation. Under water-limited conditions, increased production of protective pigments, such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, was also observed, which helped in recovery after rewatering. It was concluded that after rewatering, all negative impacts of water limitation on morphology and physiology of C. sericea plants were generally returned to well-watered levels. This suggests that C. sericea plants employ a wide range of phenotypic adjustments in response to water limitation, which makes the plants well adapted to areas with high rainfall variability.",

More than 1 300 fires were documented over 13 years in the 48 000 ha Songimvelo Game Reserve in the Barberton Mountainland, South Africa. Most fires were set by pastoralists and were uncontrolled. Lightning fires and prescribed burns made up <2% and <8% respectively of the total area burnt. Median and mean burn areas in the 31 700 ha game-fenced section were 35 and 187 ha respectively with a fire return period of 2.9 years. In the less-grazed 14 000 ha section that receives a higher annual rainfall, median and mean fire sizes were 124 and 501 ha and the return period was 1.5 years. These fire return periods are in line with generally accepted management prescriptions for grasslands. The annual number of fires, individual patches and different fire histories occurring in a moving window across the landscape were consistently higher, compared with those resulting from a small-scale or large-scale fixed fire regime. This laissez-faire approach thus resulted in a fine-scale, dynamic fire pattern with high landscape indices that could be conducive to maintaining biodiversity.",

Sward biomass for optimal energy intake by cattle was derived using intake-digestibility constraint curves and realised livestock productivity from the systems compared. Cattle and sheep, and goats primarily consumed herbaceous and woody plants, respectively. Enteropogon macrostachyus and Panicum maximum, E. macrostachyus and Blepharis integrifolia, and Combretum exalatum and Duosperma kilimandscharica accounted for 33.5% and 9.9%, 16.6% and 10.3%, and 11.7% and 10.7% of cattle, sheep and goats' total energy intake, respectively. Cattle optimised energy intake at 370-610gm−2 of sward biomass and 55.5-64.3% organic matter digestibility. Panicum maximum yielded the highest optimal sward biomass. The energy expenditure of the animals was generally lower under agropastoralism across seasons. During the dry season, more animals (33-50%) lost weight under ranching. Agropastoralism was an efficient system as animals were moved across quality grazing microenvironments that minimised feeding costs and enhanced energy intake. Therefore, mobile grazing strategies, plant diversity and complementary trophic interactions stabilise energy extraction patterns and enhance livestock productivity under agropastoralism. However, human activities that affect plant diversity and mobility will undermine sustainable livestock production in such environments.",

Herbage N yield (kg N ha−1 uptake) was determined for the pasture from herbage N yield of the perennial ryegrass fraction and the clover fraction. Increased fertiliser N rate resulted in increased perennial ryegrass N yields. Perennial ryegrass N yields tend to be lowest during winter (early as well as late winter). Pasture N yield responses were similar to the perennial ryegrass N yields. Except in 2001, higher clover N yields (kg N ha−1) were recorded when no fertiliser N was applied compared to treatments that received fertiliser N. Clover N yields did not differ in the 50–150 kg N ha−1 range and would therefore not influence pasture N yield in that range. Although season of application influenced N yields the response pattern was not consistent among the years covered by the study. Calculating the apparent N recovery rate (difference between N removed in fertilised plots and control plots) can serve as an important tool to evaluate the efficiency achieved with fertiliser N application. More research is needed to develop N removal as a management tool to be used in strategic N fertilisation programmes. Keywords: HERBAGE NITROGEN YIELDSNITROGEN RECOVERY RATE",

Tierberg-LTER, excluded from livestock since 1987, and two adjacent ranches allowed for a comparative growth study of three shrub species (Osteospermum sinuatum – palatable, Pteronia empetrifolia – moderately palatable, and P. pallens – unpalatable) across contrasting present ungulate herbivory (none in exclosures, wildlife only, or livestock and wildlife combined) and past livestock herbivory (moderate and overgrazed). Marked individuals were measured at irregular intervals over 25 years. Stem basal diameter (mm), height (m) and two canopy diameters (m) were measured at the onset of the study and in 2014. Mean basal diameter growth (mm y−1) varied between species and treatments. Change in mean attribute values was influenced by interactions with grazing history and treatments. Some historical and grazing treatments had a negative effect on the palatable O. sinuatum and no significant effect on moderately palatable P. empetrifolia or unpalatable P. pallens. The age of the originally marked individuals are unknown but >70% of these individuals survived over the 25-year period. Our results support previous findings that dwarf shrubs in deserts are slow growing and long lived, and that grazing regime affects plant growth.",

The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in Nova Odessa city, São Paulo, Brazil. Five rates of P and Ca, respectively, were combined in a 52 incomplete fractional factorial design. Thus, the treatments consisted of 13 P and Ca combination rates (respectively, in mg dm−3): 0‒0, 0‒40, 0‒80, 15‒20, 15‒60, 30‒0, 30‒40, 30‒80, 45‒20, 45‒60, 60‒0, 60‒40 and 60‒80 arranged in a randomised block design with four replications. Mineral composition was evaluated after two harvests (53 d after sowing and 34 d after the first harvest). During the initial growth of the Macrotyloma legume, P × Ca interactions occurred. The P supply antagonistically influenced the nitrogen content. The excess P supply reduced nitrogen accumulation in the shoots and caused a lack of nitrogen in the leaves. The Ca supply synergistically impacted the magnesium content and caused a 'Viets effect' in potassium content.",

Four woody species, namely Dichrostachys cinerea (the dominant woody species in the area), Acacia nilotica, A. gerrardii and A. robusta were severely damaged by the cold. The greatest effect was on trees in a certain height range; 1, 0-3, 0 m in the case of D. cinerea and 0, 5-2.0 m in the case of the Acacia species. There was a negative curvilinear relationship between the number of trees larger than 2, 0 m per hectare and the percentage damage.

Simulated continuous grazing (CG) was also tested. Low‐frequency grazing produced superior DM yields to high‐frequency or continuous grazing. High‐frequency grazing (including CG) promoted a greater level of weed production, particularly during the second year, relative to low‐frequency grazing. Perennial ryegrass producers should therefore adopt low‐frequency grazing to promote DM production and minimize weed invasion. Grazing intensity did not influence DM production. Dry matter production was characteristically elevated during spring and autumn, and relatively less during mid‐ to late‐summer and during winter. Perennial ryegrass pastures therefore produce well when the tropical pasture species are relatively inactive.",

Taken with the requirement to protect resources, this need creates conflicting demands on grazing land management. Concerns for product quality, uniformity and continuity and for animal welfare will increasingly drive production processes. In this paper, the potential of mixed grazing for higher output of quality animal products, within these constraints, is assessed under both temperate and semi-arid conditions. Complementary behavioural patterns between domestic livestock types, particularly in their dietary selection, appear to be the primary basis for development of improved grazing ecosystems. Many of these processes operate at the landscape scale. In addition to increasing animal output, mixed grazing can be used to modify the vegetation. This is of particular importance for manipulating woody species cover in semi-arid areas and hence for improvement of range condition. For rural development, identification with the system and confidence in the purveyor sets the basis for success.",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate some of the mechanisms behind how herbivores select forage at a patch scale. Thirty-six experimental plots were established and fitted with camera traps in Kruger National Park to test forage selectivity by grazers. Plots were manipulated by clearing with a brush cutter and the application of fertiliser. We used generalised linear models to detect trends in probability of occurrence by seven grazing herbivore species using camera trap data. Our results showed that season was a major determinant of species distribution, especially those that are not obligate grazers or feed exclusively in the 0.5 km to 2 km zone from water. We found that most selective feeding occurred in the late wet season when water would be more evenly distributed across the landscape and forage resources close to water would have had the chance to recover from depletion, as a result of dry season use. This has implications for the distribution of artificial water points across the landscape, because areas of reserve forage must be maintained to alleviate grazing pressure close to water.",

People who were forcibly removed in 1974 were resettled in 1995. We describe the impact that people and domestic livestock have had on the vegetation of Riemvasmaak since resettlement. Matched photographs and botanical surveys undertaken at 10-year intervals (1995, 2005 and 2015) were used to estimate the percentage cover of herbaceous (primarily grasses) and woody vegetation of the major land forms (slopes, plains, ephemeral streams). The results of a linear mixed-effects model suggest that herbaceous vegetation decreased significantly from 1995 to 2005 (p < 0.001) and increased significantly from 2005 to 2015 (p < 0.001), whereas woody cover did not change significantly over the study period. Linear regressions of size class and density of individuals for Vachellia erioloba indicate little recruitment over the period 1995–2015, compared with the period before the initial survey in 1995. Precipitation, as well as the density of grazers and browsers, driven by the socioeconomic and cultural changes occurring in Riemvasmaak since 1995, has influenced the change in vegetation cover and the recruitment of V. erioloba.",

This migration leads annually to resource use conflict and deadly attacks between migrating pastoralists and sedentary arable farmers. These conflicts have generated heated scholarly debates over the last few decades. Here, we provide an overview of the nexus between the farmer-herder crises, grassland management, and livestock production and argue for the establishment of irrigated pastures to increase forage production and quality and, thereby, reduce land-use conflicts. This recommendation is offered in place of the often-called-for transition to a ranching system for livestock production. We recommend an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the willingness of stakeholders in the livestock business to pay for fresh or conserved forage resources, as well as robust policies that could attract investment into the establishment, management, and sustainability of commercial forage production.",

We looked for genetic evidence, using qPCR and gel electrophoresis, for the presence of the bacterial nifH gene associated with the roots of four grass species (20 plants each) in a mesic grassland in South Arica, which would indicate the potential for N fixation by diazotrophs. Grasses most tolerant of low N (Aristida junciformis) were predicted to harbour the most diazotrophs, especially compared to those most responsive to fertiliser N (Eragrostis curvula). However, the nifH gene was found in all 80 root samples and did not differ in copy number between species. Sequencing of a representative sample confirmed the identity of the nifH gene. The recently burned half of the grassland had 60% more relative nifH gene copy numbers than the area burned 15 months previously, suggesting that grass growth stimulated by fire could recruit diazotrophs. Given their ubiquity and importance in the N economy of grasslands, research is required to characterise root-associated diazotroph communities, quantify their N fixation rates, and understand their environmental controls.",

Predictive models for the production of browse, at different game feeding levels, on deciduous, semi-deciduous and evergreen trees were developed using multivariate adaptive regression spline functions. The most significant predictors of the production of browse were measurable plant dimensions, namely available canopy volume, stem diameter and foliage density, and climatic variables, namely maximum and minimum daily temperatures and cumulative daily rainfall for each quarter. Comparing the browse production figures of consecutive years supplies land managers with valuable insight whether the browse component of the system is under stress, is maintaining, or is encroaching, as well as the impact of browsers on the system.",

Generalised linear modelling was used to determine the effect of the following environmental conditions on the likelihood of occurrence of P. leubnitziae: type of land use, vegetation type, burning history, total woody species density, soil pH and soil texture. There was no difference in P. leubnitziae presence under wildlife, large livestock and small livestock land use (p = 0.227). Only vegetation type (p<0.001) and total woody species density (p<0.001) significantly affected P. leubnitziae occurrence, with the species being rare in dense mopane woodlands and most likely to occur in mixed thornveld and mixed broadleaf woodland, although this likelihood decreased with increasing total woody species density. A single burn had no effect on P. leubnitziae occurrence, but repeated burning should be investigated as a means to reduce the vigour and recoppicing success of P. leubnitziae.Keywords: burningland useproblem plantstree density",

To reduce plant defence costs it has been argued that there are trade-offs between different types of defences. I tested for a trade-off between CT and thorn defences in Vachellia (Acacia) species. Thorn defences were expressed as thorn biomass, thorn density and thorn length. The relationship between defences was tested using Pearson correlation in addition to that with leaf area. My results support a trade-off between CT and thorn biomass and thorn density but not thorn length. Vachellia karroo (Acacia karroo) had high CT but low thorn biomass and thorn density, whereas V. gerrardii (A. gerrardii) had low CT but high thorn biomass and thorn density. Thorn length was positively correlated with CT and negatively related to thorn biomass and thorn density. Leaf area had a strong positive correlation with thorn biomass and thorn density, a weak negative relationship with CT, and a non-significant correlation with thorn length.

There is renewed interest in non-lethal vs lethal methods of livestock protection, but a systematic comparison is lacking. Using multivariate models, we explored how predator management (shepherd, no shepherd), land tenure, flock characteristics, and environmental factors drive losses of small livestock across the Northern Cape, South Africa. Black-backed jackal and caracal were the dominant livestock predators in both management groups. Predation of small livestock was five-fold lower in the shepherd (1.29% ± 0.38) compared to the non-shepherd group (6.09% ± 0.51; p < 0.0001), with a seven-fold lower-level of lamb predation (1.67% ± 0.51 vs. 11.52% ± 0.99; p < 0.0001). Predator management, livestock type, and flock size (but not land tenure or environmental factors) were predictor variables in a best-fit linear mixed effects model describing small livestock losses (p < 0.0001). We interpret our findings with caution because we could not control for predator and prey abundances, and the non-herder group could have inflated their predation estimates. While the efficacy of shepherding requires more research, we suggest that it is a viable predation management approach in South Africa and beyond.",

Sampling was every 28 days for a year. Variables were sward height, net herbage accumulation, soil cover, tiller density, chemical composition, and in vitro digestibility. A split-plot design was used. Sward height was greater for KY. There were no differences (p > 0.05) for herbage accumulation. TF-33 was 53% live tissue, 30% dead tissue, and 17% other plant material, whilst KY was 50% live tissue, 30% dead tissue, and 18% other plant material. TF-33 showed a higher leaf to stem proportion, while stem was higher in KY. Kikuyu grass and annual ryegrass performed better when associated with TF-33 than in KY pasture. Seasonal changes significantly affected sward height, herbage mass and net herbage accumulation, whereby TF-33 performed better than KY in winter. The multispecies association of diverse grasses and legumes may be complementary at different times of the year due to plasticity among species, and is a feasible option for small-scale dairy systems.",

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of pasture height and structure of an erect tropical grass, Aruana Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. IZ-5) on the intake and performance of young weaned lambs. The experiment was repeated in two consecutive years. Thirty young weaned lambs were equally assigned, each year, to three pasture heights: (1) Tall 75 cm; (2) Medium 50 cm and (3) Short 25 cm. Herbage mass (HM), pasture height, plant morphological composition, pasture nutritional quality, lambs' average daily gain, gain per hectare and herbage intake were measured. The Short treatment had higher (p < 0.05) leaf:stem ratio (L:S; 2.6 ± 0.27) and average daily gain (ADG; 92 ± 10 g day−1) than the Tall treatment (0.9 ± 0.11 and 40 ± 13 g, respectively). The Medium treatment showed intermediate ADG (69 ± 11 g) and L:S ratio (1.4 ± 0.09). The height of the pasture affects the rate at which the number of stems increases relative to the number of leaves. There was a significant interaction between treatment and period (summer and early autumn) for herbage intake. Intake decreased markedly on the Tall treatment from the first to the second period. This study showed that for a better performance of weaned young lambs during summer–autumn, it is important to maintain tropical swards at a short height (25 cm). However, if the grass height exceeds this condition, the use of cattle or a mower are good options to maintain the sward height.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The quantification of defoliation effects on grass vigour is important in understanding veld response to differential management. Effect of grazing on vigour can be determined by measuring regrowth during the season following grazing and comparing treatments with an undefoliated control. In this study, veld was defoliated at varying intensities and frequencies. During the following season, regrowth was measured on all treatments to quantify any residual treatment effects on vigour. Comparisons between measuring yield per tuft and yield per unit tuft basal area of this regrowth revealed marked discrepancies between the methods. These findings were in agreement with previously reported studies. In addition, differences between the mean tuft basal areas were found between treatments. Differences in vigour may reflect a change in tuft area as well as amount of growth per unit tuft area. Quantification of residual effects of grazing on plant vigour should thus logically be done using techniques based on plant yields, rather than on the basis of yield per unit tuft basal area. Techniques are available for the measurement of regrowth of all species present using quadrats, and this measure, expressed as species yield per unit land area, gives extra significance to the results.",

Measurements recorded each year included plant height, number of tillers per plant, oven-dry forage mass and seed yield. Forage and seed production increased in response to increasing sowing rate. The highest production values were obtained at a sowing rate of 45 kg ha−l Increasing sowing rate to 60 kg ha−l reduced both forage and seed yield, indicating that the optimum seeding rate for wild oat is 45 kg ha−1 Forage and seed yield had a cubic relationship with sowing rate, having R2 values of 0.55 and 0.78, respectively. Tiller production showed a negative linear relationship with sowing rate (R2 = 0.35).",

The effect of sample size on the precision and accuracy of parameters of sward height distributions was examined by drawing sub-samples (n=10) of increasing sample size (50 to 1 000) from simulated height data (n=10 000) from three different, typical height distributions, viz. normal (ungrazed), bimodal (leniently grazed) and positively skewed (intensely grazed). The coefficient of variation of components of all three distributions decreased sharply with increasing sample size and CVs for all means were <15% with 200 height measures, and <10% for all means, with the exception of the 'tall' mean in the bimodal distribution, at a sample size of 100. At a given sample size, proportions in the two components were less-precisely measured than the means, especially when the components are equally represented in the population (i.e. bimodal), where 500 measurements are required for a precision of 15%. Accuracy also increased with sample size, and with 400 samples, deviations were within 10% of the true values for most parameters of the three distributions. A sample size of 200 is recommended for quantifying the mean height of 'short' and 'tall' components of the sward whereas 400-500 samples are required to precisely estimate their relative proportions.",

Treatments comprised of a full season rest (FSR), closing at the end of December (CED) and closing at the end of January (CEJ). Each treatment was grazed annually as foggage by 12 ten-month-old Afrikaner weaners. The number of animals on any specific treatment was determined daily. Dry matter production was determined when grazing started and at the end of the grazing period. Furthermore, the leaf to stem ratio was determined at the start of the grazing period for the first two trial seasons. The physical foggage height was also determined before grazing started and after termination. An exclusion cage (1 m × 1 m) was placed in each plot at the beginning of the grazing period. The material from exclusion cages was clipped at the end of the grazing period according to the grazing pattern of the adjacent area of the plot. These clippings were analyzed for crude protein, in vitro dry maller digestibility and acid detergent fibre content. The in vitro dry matter digestibility values were relatively normal. The average crude protein value for all the species in the CEJ treatment was 7.47% compared to 5.85% and 5.83% for the CED and FSR treatments respectively. Furthermore, the CEJ treatment had the lowest fibre content. In practice the clipping (or grazing) of tropical grass species at the end of January and resting till winter is indicated.

Skirted shrubs appear to defend G. occidentalis by preventing access to plants and by reducing the accessibility of G. occidentalis foliage to the large muzzle of eland. Compared to eland, domestic stock such as goats, have a smaller body and muzzle, and these features may allow them to overcome the physical defence offered by skirted shrubs against the browsing of G. occidentalis. Our study of G. occidentalis browsed by domestic stock indicated that mature and seedling G. occidentalis typically occurred with skirted shrub species. Mature and seedling G. occidentalis growing with skirted shrubs had lower intensities of browsing than other G. occidentalis, and mature G. occidentalis growing with skirted shrubs had greater numbers of fruit than other G. occidentalis. In our study area, a non-selective grazing/browsing system is used and camps are grazed/browsed until a high proportion of forage is removed from most plants. Under this system, mature and seedling G. occidentalis are common within the study area and skirted shrubs appear to provide adequate defence for G. occidentalis against browsing by domestic stock.",

It involves modelling livestock population dynamics as discrete-time logistic equations with fixed carrying capacities. The fixed carrying capacities are generated endogenously using time-series ranch data, covering a period of 15 years, from 1987 to 2001, in a commercial ranching enterprise. The model incorporates interaction parameters, generated endogenously. The estimation of the logistic models involves estimation of econometric models for each livestock species, followed by the recovery of the logistic models mathematically. Optimisation procedures are employed to determine the optimal stocking levels and the optimal off-take levels. The model-generated carrying capacities are 2 985, 791 and 201 animal units (AUs) for cattle, sheep and goats, respectively. Optimal stocking levels are 1 369, 154 and 69 AUs for cattle, sheep and goats, respectively, while the optimal off-take levels are 857, 88 and 63 for cattle, sheep and goats, respectively. This shows that the logistic models-based system analysis is applicable to the management of mixed-species commercial ranching enterprises.

In tropical montane grasslands, such changes are predicted to follow shifts in the percentage cover and abundance of species following the C 3 and C 4 photosynthetic pathways. Reliable methods of detecting impacts of such changes on biomass and forage nutrient quality will likely provide a synoptic scale link between carbon sequestration, nutrient cycles and environmental change. Remote sensing approaches provide efficient methods to assess changes in vegetation composition quickly and are efficient for assessing vegetation in large areas. Multitemporal data obtained using broadband multispectral instruments have been used inconsistently to discriminate C 3 and C 4 grasslands and to draw some inferences. Advancements in narrowband hyperspectral systems are expected to offer greater potential for accurate mapping of C 3 and C 4 composition in grasslands. This paper presents an overview of the uses of optical remote sensing for C 3 and C 4 discrimination, which is consistent with the PFT concept used in land-surface modeling schemes. This review describes the structural properties and biochemical characteristics that affect C 3 and C 4 grass reflectance.

Vegetation structure, species richness, composition and diversity were compared between polluted and control sites. Concentrations of arsenic, chromium, copper, lead and zinc in soils were significantly higher closer to a 99-year-old mine dump than in a control site and exceeded internationally recommended guidelines by as high as 11 times. Mine dump pollution has significantly reduced woody plant densities, species richness and diversity in the affected area due to disappearance of pollution-sensitive species and preponderance of tolerant ones. Species composition and structure of vegetation close to the mine dump significantly changed, possibly due to negative impacts of heavy metals on recruitment as pollution-sensitive species died off, whereas tolerant species invaded the vacated ecological niches. Ordination analyses confirmed a strong pollution gradient, with measured heavy metals accounting for 57.3% of the observed variation in species data, suggesting that other factors are also important determinants in the area. It is recommended that the mine dump and its surrounds should be rehabilitated and regular monitoring should be carried out to remedy the situation and arrest further pollution of the surrounding environment.

    "abstract": "Themeda triandra is a perennial tussock grass endemic to Africa, Australia and Asia. Within these regions it is found across a broad range of climates, geological substrates and ecosystems. Because it is widespread across these areas it has great economic and ecological value, as it is a relatively palatable species across most of its range. It is of critical importance in supporting local populations of both native and introduced herbivores, and is thus central to wildlife and livestock production, and consequently rural livelihoods. It is an important climax or subclimax species that is well adapted to fire, a common element of many areas where it is found. Inappropriate grazing management, however, can result in a decline of Themeda , as it is not well adapted to an uninterrupted, selective grazing regime. A decline in abundance of Themeda in a grassland is usually coupled to a decline in grazing value, species richness, cover and ecosystem function. In spite of its significant ecological and economic importance, there has been no attempt to review and synthesise the considerable body of research undertaken on this grass. Our aim is to summarise and synthesis work previously undertaken and identify areas where further research is required.

The objective of this study was to determine the physiological response of Medicago sativa and Festuca arundinacea to cutting under different water regimes in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In a field experiment, two cutting intensities were applied under irrigation and under rainfed (water deficit) conditions. Water potential, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were measured. Based on the results, M. sativa showed higher transpirational water losses under rainfed conditions when compared to those of F. arundinacea , regardless of cutting treatment, because of the higher stomatal conductance. However, leaf water potential remained higher in M. sativa , suggesting a more effective root, stem or leaf related water uptake system. In addition, under water deficit, stomata of M. sativa were less sensitive to low values of water potential, probably resulting in higher productivity when compared to F. arundinacea . Cutting resulted in higher stomatal conductance and, therefore, higher transpiration in both species. Moreover, under water deficit, cutting positively affected water potential, especially in F. arundinacea , alleviating the effect of ageing.

    "abstract": "Abstract The chemical composition and in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) of various utilization forms of grain sorghum residues were investigated. Two grain sorghum cultivars, SNK 3640 (bitter tasting) and Pioneer 8564 (sweet tasting), were used. Each taste type was grown on two soil types, viz. Rensburg and Bainsvlei. The results indicate that energy availability as reflected by the IVDMD, acid detergent fibre (ADF) content, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) content, and water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content, seemed to be highest for fresh total plant residues (IVDMD = 53.9%) and for leaves of fresh plant residues (IVDMD = 52.3%). Silage made from fresh total plant residues seemed to be somewhat lower in energy availability (IVDMD = 49.4%), while leaves of frosted plant residues (IVDMD = 44.8%), frosted total plant residues (foggage) (IVDMD = 44.0%), and hay made from fresh total plant residues (IVDMD = 42.4%), seemed to be lowest in energy availability. A high WSC content (18.9%) accompanied with a relatively low NDF content (68.8%) was measured for fresh total plant residues while a relatively low NDF content (67.5%) was also measured for silage. Variation in the IVDMD of grain sorghum residues occurred among taste and soil types. The crude protein (CP) content of leaf material (12.6% for fresh, and 10.6% for frosted, leaves) was higher than the CP content of the various utilization forms of total plant residues which varied between 5.8 and 6.5%. Crude protein quality, as measured by the percentage of nitrogen appearing as non‐protein nitrogen (NPN) and the percentage of nitrogen associated with ADF (ADF‐N), was most favourable for fresh (NPN = 19.1% and ADF‐N = 13.4%) and frosted (NPN = 22.5% and ADF‐N = 12.5%) leaf material. The NPN and ADF‐N values, respectively, varied between 28.4 and 53.7% and between 17.6 and 21.2% for the various utilization forms of total plant residues. Frost had little detrimental influence on the content and quality characteristics of CP. Phosphorus content was highest for fresh (0.20%) and frosted (0.18%) leaf material. Phosphorus values for the various utilization forms of total plant residues varied between 0.10 and 0.12%. Soil type significantly (P<0.05) affected the chemical composition and IVDMD of grain sorghum residues, with Rensburg the more favourable soil type. Fermentation properties of silage reflected a lactic acid type of fermentation, showing grain sorghum residues to be suitable for successful ensiling. The chemical composition and IVDMD of the silage showed that ensiling was a more effective method to preserve fresh grain sorghum residues than it was to preserve it as hay or as foggage.",

The mean calibrated disc height was 11.8 cm. Estimated fuel load at mean disc height, with standard error (SE), was 4 593±113 kg ha−1. Using this equation to estimate fuel load at the calibrated mean, the precision of the estimates varied depending on the number of disc readings. As sample size increased there was at first a rapid reduction in the SE and hence in the 95% confidence limits (CL) of the predicted fuel load. There was little reduction in the CL with increasing sample size for more than 100 observations. To achieve a CL±10% of 5 000 kg ha−1, 100 samples are needed. With fuel loads of less than 4 000 kg ha−1, more than 160 samples are required to achieve the same precision. Sampling with more than 100 readings is not, however, recommended owing to the poor reward (precision) per unit of sampling effort.",

Range managers consequently require detailed information on the financial and ecological implications of various stocking strategies in order to formulate viable management systems. Data collected over seven seasons (1986–1993), from a series of extensive grazing trials in the semi‐arid savanna of KwaZulu‐Natal with cattle stocked at three rates (0.17, 0.23 and 0.30 LSU ha−1) were used to develop a bioeconomic stocking model (LOWBEEF). The model comprised two biological sub‐models (BEEF and GRASS), and an integrated economic component. The BEEF sub‐model related seasonal live mass gain to stocking rate and rainfall. The GRASS sub‐model related residual herbage at the end of summer to summer stocking intensity, range condition (indexed as the sum of proportions of three key forage species, Themeda triandra, Panicum maximum and P. coloratum) and rainfall. The period over which supplementary feeding would be required to maintain cattle mass was related to residual summer herbage mass. The biological sub‐models were linked to an economic component model (ECON) to reflect the influence of various environmental and economic parameters on profitability.",

This paper aims to (1) review mixed‐grazing research and development carried out in Ireland and in the semi‐arid Senegalese Sahel; (2) evaluate results in relation to other grazing lands; and (3) identify research and development strategies for the future with emphasis on Africa. A systems approach is suggested as the best model. The strategy for the semi‐arid area is to measure dietary selection by cattle, sheep and goats when grazed separately and mixed, and to select mixes and overall grazing intensities which would satisfy the objectives of combining productive and protective vegetation resource‐use. New methodology was developed. Under temperate conditions mixed sheep/steer grazing increased animal growth rate by 7–10% or stocking rate by 13%. Benefits were also obtained using mixtures of suckler cows and sheep and using lambs grazing dairy pastures in early winter. Roundworm burdens in lambs were also reduced. In semi‐arid range sheep diets were intermediate between widely differing cattle and goat diets. The herbaceous layer dominated sheep and cattle diets, and woody species the goat diets. Large between‐year and season variations occurred. It is necessary to select the correct animal mix and grazing intensity to combine efficient and ecologically balanced use of vegetation. Vegetation dry matter availability was of little use in estimation of pasture value. It appeared that the critical stocking rate or grazing is that which gives the optimum use of the most vulnerable vegetation fraction and for sustainability the application of this to all vegetation fractions. Within‐plot vegetation state, dietary origins from a common vegetation menu and patterns of herds and individual animal uses of spatial and temporal variation are essential. Use of mixtures increases options to improve resource use, maintain a more balanced subclimax vegetation and to build improved grazing ecosystems.

It appears that the increase in grass growth following bush clearing more than offsets the loss in edible browse, but there is a need for more data. The multiple species utilization theory is considered to have been given an incorrect emphasis. Mixed herbivore communities do make better use of vegetation, but it is the enormous amount of overlap and flexibility in their habitat preferences, movements and diet which is important and which gives the system stability, rather than the earlier concept of non-overlapping, rather rigid separation. At the secondary production level it is concluded that game are less efficient than cattle for meat production. Integrated game and cattle ranching may well be the optimum form of land use and there is a need for a long-term policy aimed at domestication and selection and breeding programmes using the larger browsing species.

Subtropical thicket, largely used for goat pastoralism, suffers extensive transformation typical of desertification. We measured body growth and mohair production of Angora goats in both untransformed and desertified thicket paddocks over one year. Body growth and mohair length and diameter did not differ between the two treatments. We interpret the lack of responses in terms of the above-average rainfall during the study. In contrast, mohair mass was lower in the untransformed paddock, resulting in a decline in mohair production. We suggest that this counterintuitive result reflects the combing out, and therefore loss, of hair in the densely vegetated site. This study failed to demonstrate a decline in secondary productivity in desertified thicket and highlights the importance of replicating such studies in space and time.

Seven Sudangrass genotypes generated by individual plant selection within the land race ‘Garawi’ were evaluated across seven environments in Khartoum State in 2003–2006. Selection criteria were based on forage as well as seed-setting attributes. The objectives were to develop improved and reproducible cultivars from the parent population Garawi. The results indicated that two genotypes, S.(32-2)A and S.51, were superior to the parent population in forage yield, protein content, average stability of yield superiority and reproducibility. The increment in yield was attained without significant delay in flowering duration. Both genotypes were recommended for forage production under the traditional green chopping system. S.(32-2)A was officially released under the name Sudan-1 by the Variety Release Committee in February 2009. The newly developed genotypes will contribute to widening the currently narrow genetic base of Sudangrass cultivars.

Prudent grassland management might mitigate deleterious changes in species composition in multispecies grasslands. This study, conducted in a horticultural tunnel, explored the interactions of drought duration, and the period of uninterrupted postdrought growth before defoliation, on phytomass, tiller production and mortality of Aristida junciformis, Eragrostis curvula, Hyparrhenia hirta and Themeda triandra. Pretreatment tiller production was highest for Aristida and Eragrostis, followed by Hyparrhenia and then Themeda. Mortality was positively related to tuft size and drought duration. Tiller mortality was controlled by a species × drought interaction and the covariate tuft-size. All species lost tillers following a 28-day drought, with the highest loss in Eragrostis and lowest in Themeda. Phytomass production was positively related to recovery, and inversely related to drought duration. Species-specific differences in production were apparent only in the no-drought treatment, where Hyparrhenia produced more phytomass than Themeda and Eragrostis. Aristida had the lowest phytomass production and showed little plasticity across drought treatments. Results indicated that postdrought rest is important for phytomass production, and that species may exhibit a tradeoff between productivity and survival.",

    "abstract": "The long-term establishment sequence of the woody component of the Sourish Mixed Bushveld of the Limpopo province was studied and documented. Vegetation surveys were conducted at a protected site at the Towoomba Agricultural Development Centre during 1977 and 2000. Over the 23-year period, bush density at the site increased by 33%. Changes in the woody component indicated a shift from an acacia-dominated site to one dominated by broadleaved tree species. Early colonisers included mostly Acacia species ( A. karroo, A. robusta, A. nilotica, A. gerrardii, A. tortilis, A. caffra, A. habeclada and A. mellifera ), Dichrostachys cinerea and a few broadleaved species ( Ximenia caffra, Dombeya rotundifolia and Searsia spp.). Intermediate colonisers included various shrubs ( Diospyros lycioides , the Maytenus/Gymnosporia species group, Euclea species, Carissa bispinosa and Grewia spp.), a limited number of tree species ( Pappea capensis , Boscia albitrunca and Ziziphus mucronata ) and only two legumes ( A. robusta and Peltophorum africanum ). Late colonisers included only broadleaved shrubs and Waterberg Mountain Sourveld tree species ( Grewia flavescens, Tarchonanthus camphoratus, Berchemia zeyerii, Cassine transvaalensis, Schotia brachypetala, Ximenia caffra, Heteropyxis natalensis, Terminalia sericea, Vangueria infausta and Searsia lancea ). The leguminous and broadleaved components appeared to have distinct establishment sequences. Acacia spp. appeared to facilitate the early invasion of broadleaved woody species.

The relation between range types produced by the classification and the environmental parameters measured were investigated using a two‐group, and a multi‐group stepwise linear discriminant function analysis. The first split of the TWINSPAN dendrogram separated savanna from open grassveld. The open grassveld was characterized by Themeda triandra, Microchloa caffra, Eragrostis capensis and E. plana and the savanna by Setaria neglecta, Sporobolus fimbri atus,Panicum stapfianum and Cymbopogon plurinodis. The two range types were best discriminated by rainfall, soil depth and altitude with sites in the grassveld corresponding to deep soils and receiving rainfall of more than 450 mm a‐1, and sites in savanna corresponding to shallow soils and receiving rainfall of 400–500 mm a‐1. Further divisions within these two range types were related to soil textural and chemical characteristics of the A‐horizon. Multi‐group discriminant function analysis identified eight environmental variables which best discriminate between range types at level 3 of the hierarchical dendrogram. Rainfall, soil depth and altitude were selected as the most important environmental variables discriminating between range types. Reclassification by discriminant analysis using the eight selected environmental factors resulted in a 67% concurrence with range types. It is proposed that the area be stratified on the basis of the current classification for monitoring and management purposes.",

In one trial, wether lambs maintained livemass whereas, in the other, dry ewes and wether lambs both lost 8–10% of their initial mass, irrespective of differences in foggage quality. Grazing capacity was proportional to the yield of foggage. Although the percentage leaf in the foggage in the different treatments varied from 72 to 89, only some 50% of the total herbage was utilized. The estimates of quality indicated that a higher level of utilization would have resulted in poorer sheep performance.",

Seca were screened for their ability to establish at five coastal sites of Maputo province, Mozambique. Three grazing treatments were imposed in strips: continuous access, dry‐season‐only access and an ungrazed control. Grazing pressure was dependent on the movement of communal cattle and goat herds. Mean seedling emergence ranged from a low of 28% for Graham to a high of 78% for Siratro. First season mean seedling vigour (1–10) differed (P=0.01) among entries and ranged from 4.0 for Graham to 8.0 for Seca. First‐year dry season individual plant vigour showed an interaction (P=0.1) between grazing treatment and entry with Siratro and Seca plots averaging 3.0 or better. Dry season plot cover likewise showed an interaction (P=0.002) between treatment and entry with Siratro and Seca averaging over 20%. Second rainy season vigour showed differences (P=0.03) among species only, with Siratro and Seca having values over 7.0. Plot cover was likewise differentiated only among species (P=0.0006) with Siratro and Seca both covering 59% of their plots, superior to C. ternatea (19%), L. leucocephala (9%), Archer (7%), Verano (16%), Fitzroy (28%), Graham (29%), and Wynn (4%). Oxley (36%) was undifferentiated from either group. Overall, Siratro and Seca had the best establishment whilst Oxley showed promise.

Active local participation in management initiatives, equitable distribution of costs and benefits and popular support of the programme are prerequisites to collective management. These factors were assessed at the first two RMAs to be established in Lesotho (1 and 2, established in 1982 and 1985, respectively). In RMA 2 the residents were more systematically involved in developing the programme. In both RMAs active participation was largely confined to activities which were either mandated in RMA regulations and enforced, or voluntary but consistent with pre‐programme practices. In spite of possible regressive impacts on livestock distribution and supplemental feeding requirements, participants did not view equity as problematic. Popular programme support was high, particularly at the older RMA. These findings suggest that significant progress has been made in setting the stage for collective management but continued outside support is required at both RMAs.",

Variables monitored included air temperature, relative humidity (RH), wind speed, and rainfall. The influence of these variables on patterns of NH3 loss was assessed graphically and by using Spearman's ranked correlation analysis. A daily pattern of loss was observed in the flux of NH3, with the greatest losses occurring between 10h00 and 14h00 on every sampling day. High temperatures and wind speeds promoted losses whilst rainfall events (in excess of 5 mm) inhibited losses, apparently by transporting applied fertilizer into the soil profile. Losses were suppressed at low temperatures, low wind speeds, and high RH. The highest overall loss recorded (3.7% of applied N) was lower than that expected for sub‐tropical conditions.",

The clover content of the pastures declined, while the grass component increased with increased pasture age on both nitrogen treatments, leading to grass domination by the end of the trial period. The clover content (%) of the green dry matter (DM) was higher and the grass content (%) lower on the zero‐nitrogen than the nitrogen‐fertilised pastures, with the average daily gain of the sheep and wool production per ewe unit highest at low stocking rates on the zero‐nitrogen treatment. However, the total amount of green DM was higher on the nitrogen‐fertilised than on the unfertilized treatment, resulting in higher stocking rates for maximum wool and meat production per hectare. A higher profit margin was realised at lower stocking rates on the zero‐nitrogen treatment when compared with the fertilised treatment. The low weaning mass of the lambs at high stocking rates on the fertilised pastures questions the profitability of using nitrogen fertiliser on irrigated grass/clover pastures.",

The responses of a relatively unpalatable shrub (Pteronia tricephala), and of a shrub of greater palatability (Eriocephalus ericoides) were examined at high, intermediate and at low stocking rates. These responses were compared with the ecophysiological attributes in the absence of browsing (control). Despite the two species being of different palatabilities, the estimates of the extent of plant utilization confirmed that both species were browsed at all stocking rates. No significant changes in ecophysiological processes were apparent in E. ericoides at high stocking rates. However, non‐structural carbohydrate status decreased at the highest stocking rates, which may signify a loss in plant vigour. In contrast, P. tricephala responded to high stocking rates with an improvement in plant water relations, and an elevation in net photosynthetic rates. The carbohydrate status of heavily browsed P. tricephala plants remained unchanged, and leaf polyphenol concentrations decreased. These findings suggest that relatively more palatable shrubs such as E. ericoides may not be able to survive continuous heavy browsing, and that less palatable shrubs, such as P. tricephala, have compensatory mechanisms that operate only at high stocking rates. These compensatory responses may increase the acceptability (low polyphenol levels) of relatively unpalatable shrubs, and may confer a competitive advantage (high carbon reserves and elevated photosynthesis) on these shrubs when subjected to browsing at high stocking rates.",

Pasture nutritive value was assessed by measures of crude protein (CP), metabolisable energy (ME), water‐soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF). Pasture mineral content was assessed by estimates of the major minerals phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg), and trace minerals manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). Apart from some exceptions, applications of N, with and without additional P, K and S generally increased pasture CP and ME content in autumn and CP content in spring. Again with some exceptions, pasture WSC content was unaffected by fertiliser application in autumn, but was decreased by some treatments (containing N and N with P, K and S) in spring. Fertiliser treatments generally had no effect on pasture NDF content at Sites 1 and 3 during autumn and spring. At Site 2, some treatments (containing N and N with P, K and S) reduced pasture NDF content in autumn while during spring some treatments (containing N and N with P, K and S) increased pasture NDF content. Different N fertilisers applied at the same rate, with and without additional P, K and S, generally produced the same effect on pasture nutritive value. The application of P, K and S in the absence of N generally had no effect on pasture nutritive value. Apart from some exceptions, pasture P content was increased by fertiliser treatments including P, K and S, but N on its own did not influence pasture P content. Pasture K content was generally not influenced by treatment. At Site 1 during autumn and spring, and at Site 3 during spring, treatments containing P, K and S increased pasture S content while applications of N had no effect. At Site 2 during autumn, P, K and S increased pasture S content relative N only, while during spring pasture S content was generally increased by all treatments. At Site 3 during autumn, applications of N decreased pasture S content while P, K and S increased pasture S content relative to no fertiliser. Pasture Na and Ca content were generally not influenced by treatment. Pasture Mg content was not influenced by treatment at Sites 2 and 3. At Site 1 during autumn and spring, however, some treatments (containing N and N with P, K and S) increased pasture Mg content. Fertiliser treatments produced no consistent patterns or differences with respect to trace minerals (Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn).",

The study was conducted during the period June to December 1999 in order to capture both the dry and wet season effects. The grass biomass in the sub-canopy zone (2-4m from tree trunk) was found to be significantly higher than in the mid-canopy (0-2m from tree trunk) and open grassland zones (4-6m from tree trunk) during the dry season. However, the difference between the sub-canopy and the open grassland was not significant during the wet season, implying that the role of a tree canopy in enhancing grass biomass is greater during the dry than the wet season. Variations in percent grass species composition from the mid-canopy to the adjacent open grassland were observed, indicating that while B. glabra canopy cover favours certain grass species, other species find the micro-climatic conditions under the canopy unfavourable. Soil organic matter in the mid-canopy zone was significantly higher than in the sub-canopy and adjacent open zones during both dry and wet season. Although the sub-canopy zone exhibited significantly higher soil moisture content than the mid-canopy and open grassland zones during the dry season, the difference between the sub-canopy and the adjacent open grassland during the wet season was not significant, suggesting that the tree canopy influence on soil moisture is more pronounced in the dry than the wet season.",

    "abstract": "The Lets’eng-la-Letsie wetland is an official Ramsar site, but the wetland and upland catchment areas suffer from overgrazing, erosion and over exploitation. Chrysocoma ciliata has a reputation as an unpalatable invader and is particularly common on the drier northern slopes. The objectives of the study were to quantify the phytomass of this shrub with the aid of a developed allometric phytomass quantification technique and to evaluate the ecological significance of this shrub within the area. Highly significant (p < 0.001) positive regressions with coefficients of determinations as high as r2 = 0.94 between phytomass and plant canopy diameter were achieved. The upland slopes support a high density of more than 35 000 C. ciliata plants ha−1 with a phytomass of more than 3 600 kg DM ha−1 and a correspondingly low herbaceous phytomass of 446.57 kg DM ha−1. The edible parts of the plants (flowers, leaves and shoots <2.0 mm in diameter) were estimated to be 1 198 kg DM ha−1, with a crude protein content of 8.84%. There was evidence that C. ciliata is intolerant of wet conditions and the degradation of the catchment areas will result in drier soil profiles, which will favour the further spread of this species.",

A 20-year simulation study was conducted using the Sustainable Grazing Systems model to analyse implications of different stocking rates (SRs) and simple rotational grazing systems (SRGSs) for rangeland-based Brahman steers. Simulations included three SRGSs (two, three and four paddocks per herd) and four SRs that were compared for their effects on grass production, dry matter intake (DMI) and live weight gain (LWG). Stocking rates included a recommended SR of 10 ha livestock unit (LU)−1, 30% high (7 ha LU−1) and, 50% and 100% low (15 and 20 ha LU−1), respectively, SR. Overall, there were no observable differences in the long-term response of grass production and DMI to all treatments for SRGS and SR. In addition, effects of SRGSs on animal production were almost similar across treatments in short and long timeframes, but differential responses of LWG to SRs were more pronounced regardless of time. These findings provide a useful criterion for choosing effective SRs to achieve sustained grass and animal production with lowest risk.",

Cumulative germination, final germination percentage (FG%), and time taken to reach 50% of the final germination (T50) were determined for each species–treatment combination. Species × salinity interaction was significant (p < 0.01) for cumulative germination, FG% and T50. Cumulative germination increased gradually up to 17 days and thereafter declined. The highest FG% for all grass species was attained under distilled water (0 mS m−1), ranging from 38% to 94%, and declined significantly (p < 0.01) with an increase in salinity. T50 increased with increasing salinity for all grass species. Eragrostis curvula var. Ermelo and Lolium multiflorum var. Archie were the quickest to germinate and attained significantly (p < 0.01) higher values of FG%, of 45% and 50%, respectively, at 600 mS m−1, indicating higher salt tolerance than the other species. Overall, increasing salinity reduced the germination performance of all grass species tested; however, Archie and Ermelo showed higher potential for rehabilitation of coalmine spoils irrigated with saline water.",

Technology transfer describes the conventional process whereby researchers develop 'improved' systems that are then promoted as models for boosting production. Where rangelands are traditionally used by groups of herders, such imposed models have a dismal record. One key reason is that indigenous knowledge, local practices, and traditional regulations have been ignored. In other fields, conventional norms of development are being challenged. Thus, for example, amongst small scale farmers in the developing tropics, participation is now the accepted entry point. So, what is the experience with, and potential for, similar approaches on the rangelands?",

The objective of this study was to assess the performance of S. hamata in northern Ghana. The study was carried out in 15 communities in five districts in September 2003. The instruments used to gather data were questionnaires, direct field measurements and field observations. The results of the study indicated that stylo plants were found in places where oversowing was not carried out. The average plant population densities for new and old plants were similar (13.6 vs 13.8 plants m−2) (p ≥ 0.05). Old plants were found to be significantly (p ≤ 0.05) taller than new plants but the biomass yield of the latter was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) better than the former. Old plants had better flowering ability than the new plants (p ≤ 0.05). Pests of stylo included grasshoppers (Zonocerus variegatus) and black ants (Delichoderus thoracicus). Other plant species were observed to have grown alongside stylo, and some of these were weeds that suppressed the growth of stylo. The study demonstrated that S. hamata was successfully established in community rangelands in northern Ghana.",

The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Forage Genebank maintains 671 Urochloa grass accessions, belonging to 28 species, of which 261 (39%) accessions are Urochloa brizantha (A.Rich.) R.D.Webster. The susceptibility of Urochloa grasses to disease and insect pests is a key challenge to the sustainable production of these grasses in Africa. In this study, using a dot blot assay and RT-PCR, we report for the first time the association of Alfalfa Mosaic Virus (AMV) and Southern Bean Mosaic Virus (SBMV) with 92% of the tested accessions conserved in situ and ex situ in the ILRI forage genebank. In addition, virus transmission from seed to plant and from legume to grass was confirmed through the bioassay test. The detection of these two viruses in Urochloa species presents a new challenge to germplasm conservation, distribution, and their sustainable production in the region, and demands immediate attention towards developing an effective method of cleaning viruses from the conserved germplasm. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to assess the economic importance of diseases in the grasses, and for the selection of germplasm that shows resistance to diseases.Keywords: AMVforage diseasesSBMVUrochloa grasses",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe study aimed to assess the encroachment of woody plants on the rangelands of the Dallo Manna district of Bale Zone, and their impact on plant species diversity and pastoral livelihoods. Plant data were collected from 45 plots at encroaching sites and 4 plots at non-encroached sites, with a size of 20 m × 20 m for comparison. Data on pastoral perceptions were collected through questionnaires, interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. A total of 62 woody species were recorded at both non-encroached and encroached sites, of which 58 species (93.5%) were recorded at non-encroached sites and 24 (38.7%) at encroached sites. Dichrostachys cinerea (L.) Wight and Arn. was the most abundant and dominant invasive woody species, followed by Senegalia mellifera (Vahl) Siegler and Ebinger, and Dalbergia microphylla Chiov. Overall, our results indicated that the effects of woody species encroachment significantly affected rangeland vegetation conditions and livelihoods. The major drivers for the encroachment were found to be fire suppression, overgrazing, and dispersal syndromes. However, in order to understand the exact causes of the woody plant encroachment, multiple variables should be considered in future research. For the successful control of encroachment, insights from an integrated approach will benefit from both local traditional and scientific knowledge of the ecology.Keywords: biodiversityinvasive plantspastoralist livelihoodrangelands",

This study aimed to compare the effects of overgrazing on forage quality of Artemisia sieberi, Zygophyllum eurypterum and Stipa barbata as dominant species producing more than 90% of livestock feed in arid rangelands of Semnan, Iran. The study area was classified into non-grazed and overgrazed sites based on the estimated carrying capacity. Data collection was conducted at the end of the grazing season. The collected forage samples were analysed for crude protein (CP), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), acid detergent fibre (ADF), digestibility, percentage of dry matter digestibility (DMD) and metabolic energy (ME). Results from the t-test indicated that overgrazing led to significant (p < 0.05) reduction in CP, K, P, DMD and ME and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in ADF in A. sieberi and Z. eurypterum, in comparison to plants from non-grazed areas, with CP being the most sensitive qualitative parameter to overgrazing in the two species. Shrubs including A. sieberi and Z. eurypterum showed more susceptibility to overgrazing while the grass species S. barbata proved to be less affected. A rational grazing system is required where A. sieberi and Z. eurypterum are present.Keywords: crude proteinGramineaemetabolic energynon-grazingovergrazing",

For the models, NDVI values were sampled along four independent piosphere gradients that vary in their intensity of use and rest from herbivory. Our results indicate that the model that makes use of NDVI variance after a good rainfall year is able to discern changes in the forage production potential that corroborate threshold changes in the vegetation and soil environment. Our results support the growing body of evidence that increases in the variance of ecosystem processes and services are important indicators of impending threshold changes in social-ecological systems.Keywords: herbivoryNDVIregime-shifttransformationvariance",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study was conducted to compare pod and seed characteristics, nutritive value, digestibility and seed survival of intact medic pods after ingestion by sheep. Different diets comprising the intact pods of six cultivars of the medic species that are most widely sown in South Africa, viz. Medicago truncatula (Paraggio, Parabinga, Sephi and Cyprus) M. polymorpha (Santiago) and M. littoralis (Harbinger AR), were randomly allocated to 30 South African Mutton Merino wethers. Representative feed and faeces samples were collected daily and analysed for dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM) and crude protein (CP). Acid detergent fibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) were also determined and apparent digestibility coefficients were subsequently calculated for DM, OM and CP. Pod and seed characteristics (pod and seed mass, seed to pod ratio, number of seeds per pod, hardseededness and seed recovered after ingestion) were determined. Medicago truncatula cultivars had the highest pod mass (71–91 mg) followed by M. littoralis (27 mg) and M. polymorpha (23 mg). The better seed:pod ratio of M. polymorpha (34%) and M. littoralis (30%), in comparison to the M. truncatula cultivars (18–28%), were associated with significant (PsO.05) differences in the number of seeds per 100 g of pods. This higher seed content of M. littoralis and M. polymorpha was also expressed in higher crude protein, digestible protein and digestible organic matter contents in pods. Medicago polymorpha had the highest (95%) and M. littoralis the lowest level of hardseededness (86%). Medicago polymorpha (23%) was superior to the other cultivars in terms of seed recovered after ingestion by sheep, followed by M. littoralis (9%) and M. truncatula cultivars (4%). This study showed that M. polymorpha (cv. Santiago) is best suited for utilization by sheep during the summer months when medic pods are the major component of their diet.",

Cattle and sheep had similar effects on patch size distribution when stocked at the same number of AUE ha−1. The severity of grazing within a patch was influenced by both stocking rate and cattle‐to‐sheep ratio. Recommendations that cattle should be grazed together with sheep and that cattle should be in greater proportion (in terms of AUE ha−1) than sheep, which are aimed at limiting the severity of grazing by sheep, are supported. However, severe grazing within patches is an inevitable consequence of sheep grazing irrespective of the stocking rate or cattle‐to‐sheep ratio applied.",

Species utilization data were collected by repeated measures at regular intervals on a sample of marked tufts during spring, late summer/autumn, and winter. Selection patterns were examined between and within species in terms of the number of plants defoliated, and the height and frequency of defoliation. Cattle selected for H. hirta in the post‐burn spring period, which was characterized by high quality and low quantity of available forage. As the availability of H. hirta declined, selection for T. leucothrix and T. triandra increased. These results have important implications for the management of extensive areas of old‐lands, which could provide a valuable source of forage in the early spring period following burning and reduce the grazing pressure on veld. The late summer/autumn period was characterized by low intensity of grazing and infrequent grazing of individual tufts. No clear species selection patterns were evident. It is proposed that increased herbage availability may accentuate the potential for area‐selective grazing. T. triandra was the most preferred species during winter, with intermediate selection for H. hirta and little selection for T. leucothrix.",

This is partly due to the benefits of wetland preservation (non‐use) being unpriced, as they are not traded in markets.

The contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to estimate the value of non‐market wetland preservation benefits, by asking members of the Wakkerstroom Natural Heritage Association (WNHA) to, state their willingness‐to‐pay (WTP) to preserve the Wakkerstroom wetland. For option value, the median WTP class ranged from R17.51 to R20.00 per month, whilst existence and bequest values had the same median WTP class which ranged from R15.01 to R.17.50 per month. Well‐designed CVM studies can help to make the public, policy‐makers and individual farmers more aware of the benefits of wetland preservation, leading to more informed decisions being made about wetland use.",

The parameter of concern was proportional species composition. In a first phase, the plot size and number of point observations required to achieve a repeatable assessment of a single plot at a predetermined precision level were investigated. The Chapman‐Richards three‐parameter model was fitted to similarity values obtained from comparisons between successively larger sets of points. This resulted in 140 points being required within a 30 × 30 m plot in order to recover 95% of the internal association of the composition data. In a second phase, the number of plots required for a repeatable assessment of a large stratum was determined. Successively larger nested areas were sampled. Monitoring of a large stratum at 95% of asymptotic replicate similarity would require sets of 21 randomly selected plots. The third and final phase was concerned with the development of a procedure for detecting change. A similarity test made it possible to detect change between successive surveys with a known degree of precision.",

Key to management decision making are the results of vegetation monitoring protocols that are designed to indicate changes in vegetation status. These changes are frequently measured as a proportional species composition and measure of basal cover and based on samples of 100-200 points in specific fixed sites. Minor changes of the magnitude of the order of single percentage points often form the basis of a management decision relating to herbivore stocking rates. These values are often quoted sans confidence limits or any other measure of dispersion. This paper investigates the statistical power of within stand replicates of three commonly encountered point methods, replicated within the same stand on Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve, Gauteng Province, and shows unacceptably high Type II error probabilities.",

Grassland production is determined mainly by climate and soil, provided reasonably sound management practices are employed. It is thus evident that effective planning must necessarily depend heavily on a reliable knowledge of the climate/plant/soil interaction. Photosynthesis is the source of primary production in grassland. A simulation model Putu 2 computes the potential total production, environmental limiting factors as well as the daily water balance, taking rainfall into account. Environmental limitation and total dry matter production for Bloemfontein was computed over three growing seasons. The results show that fairly accurate estimates of total production are possible with the Putu 2 simulation model especially during years of normal and above normal rainfall. The soil water status computed for Themeda triandra dominated veld agrees well with the results obtained in field trials.

The damaging of the shoot apex by grazing, cutting, fire or drought may have a detrimental effect on leaf, shoot and seed production. The shoot apices of Themeda triandra, Elyonurus argenteus and Heteropogon contortus showed the same tendency with respect to elevation before and during flowering. The shoot apices were not elevated more than 1 cm to 1, 5 cm above the soil level for a period of 11 to 14 months. After the shoot apices become reproductive they are raised slowly 2 to 3 cm above soil level. If soil moisture conditions become favourable flowering occurs in due time. Elyonurus argenteus tends to flower 21 to 28 days earlier than T. triandra and H. contortus. Flowering of T. triandra and H. contortus may occur as late as March if soil moisture conditions are not favourable earlier. The carbohydrate (reserve) content of the stubble of all three grasses decreased rapidly under fluctuation soil conditions that resulted in successive regrowth and dying off of the aerial parts of the plants. The moisture content of the leaves dropped quickly under moisture stress conditions. Elyonurus argenteus compares favourably with T. triandra and H. contortus with respect to their in vitro digestibility and crude protein content.

    "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted in the Makambako division of the southern highlands of Tanzania to investigate the effects of regrowth period, season and harvesting frequency on the yield and nutritive value of Chloris gayana. The first experiment was conducted in 2002 in a 4×2 factorial arrangement in a complete randomised block design with six replications. The treatments were period of regrowth (three, six, nine and 12 weeks) and season (early wet season January–March and late wet season April–June). The second experiment was conducted in 2003 in a complete randomised design with six replications. The treatments were four cutting frequencies (three, six, nine and 12 weeks). In Experiment 1, the dry matter yield (DMY) ranged from 1.09–7.99t ha−1 and from 0.97–3.53t ha−1 (P < 0.05), while the crude protein (CP) content ranged from 13.9–8.25% and 16.09–9.85% (P < 0.05) in the early and late wet seasons, respectively. In vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) declined faster with increasing periods of growth in the early than in the late wet season. ME ranged from 9.21–7.29MJ kg−1 DM (P < 0.05) and 8.02–7.87MJ kg−1 DM (P > 0.05) in the early and late wet seasons, respectively. For Experiment 2, the nine- and 12-week cutting frequencies did not differ (P > 0.05) in terms of cumulative DMY (19.07 versus 18.93t ha−1) but produced nearly twice as much as the three- and six- week cutting frequencies (10.18 and 8.32t ha−1). CP, IVDMD and ME decreased while neutral detergent fibre (NDF) increased with decreased cutting frequency. The results of the present study suggest that the optimal balance of dry matter yield and nutritive value of C. gayana at Makambako is reached at the ninth week of regrowth. Regardless of season, dairy farmers in this area who are feeding pure C. gayana must provide energy supplement to their dairy cows.",

The results showed that the sheep were capable of reducing the basal, canopy, and canopy-spread cover significantly. The various species were not all grazed to the same extent. The trampling and disturbing of the ground surface, and foot path formation, were the most conspicuous effects of intensive grazing.

An experimental grid design was used in a randomised sampling method for four replicate samples of three African grasses. The grasses evaluated were: Cenchrus ciliaris L., Digitaria pentzii Stent. and Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.). The bromatological and histological traits analysed included dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre corrected to ashes and protein (NDFap), lignin, mesophyll, vascular bundle, phloem, xylem, vascular sheath, sclerenchyma, bulliform cells, and the adaxial and abaxial epidermis. The type of grass and grazing cycle correlated with DM, NDF and lignin (p < 0.05), whereas CP was not affected by these factors (p > 0.05). Dry matter ranged between 128 and 304 g kg−1; CP ranged between 90 and 167 g kg−1; NDFap between 542 and 707 g kg−1, and lignin between 10 and 40 g kg−1. The proportion of xylem (8.4%), vascular sheath (30.5%) and total vascular bundles (38.1%) were greater in M. maximus (p < 0.05). The percentage of sclerenchyma did not differ between species (p > 0.05). Digitaria pentzii and C. ciliaris had a greater proportion of mesophyll than M. maximus (p < 0.05). Of the three grasses analysed. Digitaria pentzii exhibited the highest forage quality, because it had the lowest concentration of fibre and lignin, with lower proportions of lignified tissues.",

Split-plot complete design experiments with three replications were applied for two consecutive seasons (2020–2021). The treatments were two in situ rainwater harvesting systems [i.e. ridges plus terraces (RD) and terraces (TR)], three seeding rates (i.e. 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 kg ha−1) and two urea fertilisation rates [0 kg ha−1(Z) and 95 kg ha−1(F)]. These treatments were compared to a control (a flat, unfertilised and zero-tillage plot). Hydrological, biological and chemical indicators were used in the assessment. The results showed that the adopted RWH improved semi-arid pastures, with the RD treatment providing the best results for sustaining biomass production, water use efficiency, nutritional quality and soil quality. The highest plant density (112 000 plants ha−1) was associated with the RD3.5 treatment. The FSR1.5-RD treatment resulted in the greatest plant length (63.5 cm) and number of leaves per plant (34.59), whilst the FSR3.5-RD resulted in both the highest fresh biomass (25.9 t ha−1) and dry biomass (6.3 t ha−1). The chemical compositions of M. maximus (i.e. crude protein, organic matter and nitrogen contents) were also substantially improved by fertilisation. The water use efficiency of M. maximus was plant-, management- and climate-dependent.",

Seedling emergence and mortality was recorded daily for 14 days. In the second trial, seeds were allowed to grow under well-watered conditions for one month, after which moisture stress was imposed for 15 and 30 days. Thereafter, the seedlings were uprooted, for shoot and root measurements. Results from these trials show that C. sericea seedlings will establish even at severely reduced water-availabilities, but without subsequent watering, significant seedling mortality will occur. Calobota sericea seedlings displayed a range of morphological adaptive strategies to moisture stress including the minimisation of water loss and optimisation of water uptake. Further research into the impacts of regular cycles of moisture stress is needed to determine if changes in morphology due to prior moisture stress will result in improved adaptation to subsequent moisture stress.",

Two studies were conducted using two grazing systems based on heterogeneous pastures. Herbage mass was estimated using CYM and undisturbed sward height techniques within quadrats (SHQ) or at a set of standard points in the paddocks (SHP). SHQ had a higher adjusted R2 when calibrated with the Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandú (U. brizantha) proportion compared to the simple SHQ model (0.75 vs 0.68), while RSE was lower (0.18 vs 0.21). The R2 increased (0.63 to 0.68), while both residual means and RSE decreased (−2.30 to −0.05 and 0.22 to 0.20, respectively) when SHP was calibrated with U. brizantha. It also resulted in a reduction of mean squared prediction error (MSPE) to CYM, SHQ, and SHP, respectively. The CYM allows for higher accuracy of herbage mass estimation in tropical heterogeneous pastures than undisturbed sward height, irrespective of botanical calibration. However, the botanical composition calibration had positive effects on the models from undisturbed sward height, and the calibration with U. brizantha increased the accuracy of herbage mass prediction.",

When summer rainfall in the Eastern Karoo increases, grassiness increases at the expense of shrub canopy cover. This may drive a transition from shrubland toward grassland. The effect of grass–shrub competition on shrub growth and phenology in the Eastern Karoo is not adequately explained by the root–niche separation hypothesis or the succession hypothesis. In an experiment, we measured shrub growth and phenology in the absence (clipping treatment) and presence (control treatment) of grass over the 2017/2018 rainfall season. Grass clipping changed grass species composition over this period, but grass clipping did not benefit shrubs. We found no competitive effect of grasses on shrubs. However, shrub canopy cover showed a strong linear response to soil moisture, as did canopy cover to temperature. Similarly, soil moisture and temperature were important for stem growth and shrub phenology. Patterns of shrub growth and phenology in response to summer and winter rainfall provide important insight for land managers for optimising production while enabling phenological processes that allow recruitment to take place.",

Fieldwork was conducted in the dry, early wet and late wet seasons. Diet preference was determined using microhistological faecal analysis and browse availability surveys. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test assessed similarity between the observed diet composition based on dung samples and the expected diet composition. To account for potential non-independence between browse availability and diet composition, a weighted approach was employed where browse availability was just one of several contributing factors to the expected composition. Plant species selectivity was quantified by Ivlev's electivity index. Results obtained from this indicated that these black rhinos preferentially browsed certain plant species across different seasons. Plant species observations in the dung samples from the dry season totalled 3 984, with the evergreen Natal gum Euclea natalensis dominating the diet; for the early wet season, plant observations in the dung totalled 1 479, with buffalo thorn Ziziphus mucronata dominating in the diet; for the late wet season, plant observations in the dung totalled 4 424, with the small deciduous tree Ochna pulchra dominating in the diet. By obtaining information on food selection and the availability of browse species across seasons, this study provides a clearer understanding of black rhinos' forage preference in WGR.Keywords: browse availabilityEuclea natalensisfaecal analysisforage preferenceIvlev's electivity indexLimpopo Province",

One-month-old C. sericea seedlings were grown at constant temperatures of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 °C for 30 days. After 30 days the plants were removed and shoot length, root length, stem thickness, number of leaves, middle leaflet length, leaf width, petiole length, shoot fresh and dry mass, and cell membrane stability through electrolyte leakage from the leaves, and shoot water content were measured. Results showed that the optimum temperature for C. sericea seedling growth was approximately 10 °C. Significant seedling mortality was observed at 20 °C, while no mortality was observed between 2.5 and 5 °C, and less than 4% of seedlings died at 10 °C. The majority of measured morphological variables in this study increased significantly from 2.5 °C and 5 °C, reaching a maximum at 10 °C before decreasing significantly at 20 °C. Electrolyte leakage from leaves was significantly more at 2.5 °C and at 20 °C, suggesting that seedlings were more stressed at these temperatures. In conclusion, even though C. sericea has a wide optimum germination temperature range, early seedling growth requires a narrow temperature range for optimum growth and development.Keywords: forage plantlegume foragewater-limited environments",

    "abstract": "AbstractGrazing practices fundamentally shape plant community composition and biodiversity worldwide, more importantly in water-limited environments. This study aimed to investigate plant community composition, species distribution of occurrence and diversity indices in an arid rangeland under different grazing intensities. The quadrat method was used to select 90 × 1 m2 quadrats in heavy-grazing, light-grazing and ungrazed sites. Plant species frequency, relative frequency, abundance, relative abundance and density, as well as species richness, evenness, Shannon diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were calculated. A total of 46 plant species belonging to 17 families were recorded. The Asteraceæ family was represented with the highest frequency (28%). Overall in the study area, around 95%, 70% and 40% of recorded plant families existed in light-grazing, ungrazed and heavy-grazing sites, respectively. The species richness of identified plants in light-grazing and ungrazed sites was 300% and 200% greater, respectively, than in the heavy-grazing sites. Around 85% of existing plants in heavy-grazing sites were therophyte plants. The species frequency, abundance, density and diversity indices were higher in light-grazing sites compared to those under heavy grazing, which indicates a more diverse, heterogenous and balanced plant community in the light-grazing site. Plant communities in light-grazing and ungrazed sites were similar, except for higher species frequency, density and evenness in light-grazing sites. This suggests that light-grazing intensities in the arid rangelands of Jordan enhance plant diversity more than grazing exclusion, which encourages decision-makers and environmentalists to implement regulations prohibiting intensive grazing in the arid rangelands of Jordan.Keywords: exclude grazingovergrazingplant diversity indicesheavy grazingrangeland",

    "abstract": "Abstract Satellite‐derived vegetation indices were used to identify a geochemical mound of higher active greenness in the Karoo National Park, Beaufort West, South Africa. We determined whether this mound was occupied by plants with higher CO2 assimilation rate. Plant cover on and off the mound was determined. Three woody species with high cover were selected for further investigation. Two deep‐rooted species, Rhigozum obovatum Burch. and Eriocephalus ericoides (L.f.) Druce, showed greater net CO2 assimilation rates on the mound. Net CO2 assimilation rates for the third species, Pentzia incana (Thunb.) Kuntze were similar both on and off the mound. In an attempt to find a mechanistic basis for the elevated CO2 assimilation rates, the relationships between soil factors, foliar nutrients and CO2 assimilation capacity were also examined. Our results suggest that the elevated net CO2 assimilation was not mediated via improved soil or plant water relations on the actively greening mound, nor through a difference in nitrogen levels in the soil or plant material, but possibly by way of the higher sub‐soil phosphorus levels measured from the geochemical mound. Genotype and cover cannot alone be used for rangeland condition assessment since localized elevated soil nutrient status (patchiness) contributes to greater photosynthetic carbon gain which may confer superior browsing responses to plants occurring on these mounds.",

The performance of T. repens was determined over five years (1981/1982 to 1985/1986), at two defoliation frequencies, four levels of nitrogen (0, 400, 800 and 1 600 kg N ha−1 ‐ total applied over five years), and either the removal or recycling of harvested material. Frequent, compared to infrequent defoliation, resulted in higher dry matter (DM) yields from the second year onwards. Dry matter yields were positively affected by the recycling of material, compared to no recycling. A mean DM yield of 191 ha−1 in the first year and 12 t ha−1 in the final year, was obtained. The highest DM yields occurred during October for all years and lowest DM yields from January to March. The first and final year showed similar peaks (late October) and troughs (March till April). Crude protein (CP) content of the herbage was influenced more by frequency of defoliation than recycling of material, where the highest CP content in any year was obtained from frequent defoliation. Nitrogen fertiliser applied up to a total of 1 600 kg N ha−1 over five years had no effect on either DM yield or crude protein content. This study has shown that T. repens could be a productive pasture for at least five years in the subtropical region of Gauteng, South Africa. Productivity and quality of T. repens were enhanced by a defoliation interval of less than five weeks and when soil high fertility was maintained by recycled plant material.",

Development of bushdumps appeared to reduce herbaceous production underneath the clumps by up to 90%. The herbaceous layer underneath the bushdumps was distinctly different to that of the open grassland and it also had slightly higher quality compared to that of grassland. Effective bush control measures are warranted if these savanna areas are to sustain beef and mutton production as is currently the case.",

Exponential regression (y = a + brx) of the logged biomass data provided the most accurate and precise description of the tree height-biomass and DPB-biomass relationships. More than 75% of the variation in wood and total tree yield was accounted for by the regressions on tree height, at an accuracy of within 8% of the true mean. The regression for edm on height was poor (r2 = 0.57) and was not improved substantially by including the number of basal stems as a predictor.

The effects of various preservation methods on the chemical composition and IVDMD of babala, harvested at different maturity stages (first harvest), were also studied. The yield of forage dry matter (DM) and of the in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM) was found to be maximal at the pipe and bloom stages while crude protein (CP) yield was highest at the pipe stage. The chemical composition and IVDMD showed that the quality of fresh babala harvested at the pipe stage (IVDMD = 706 g kg−1 DM; CP = 231 g kg−1 DM) was higher than that of fresh babala harvested at the ripe stage (IVDMD = 594 g kg−1 DM; CP = 120 g kg−1 DM). Preservation by means of hay‐making at the pipe and bloom stages resulted in well preserved forage while haying at the ripe stage resulted in greatly reduced forage quality. Ensiling, which was performed on an in vitro basis, was characterized by an extensive breakdown of protein‐N to NPN which was limited when ensiled with formic acid plus formalin. Ensiling without additives (untreated) accomplished effective fermentation at the bloom and ripe stages but was characterized by a clostridial fermentation at the pipe stage. This was prevented when ensiled with chemical additives (formic acid, formalin, formic acid plus formalin) which caused a corresponding improvement in forage quality. Formalin containing additives, however, increased the ADF‐N fraction. It also tended to induce a clostridial type of fermentation accompanied with some deterioration of energy‐related forage properties when used at the ripe stage. Babala at the bloom stage was successfully ensiled by all methods, with additives restricting the fermentation process.",

Twenty‐four mature Holsteins either grazed pasture or received maize silage in a dry‐lot as the only forage in the diet during each of two autumn and spring studies. A grain mix was allotted at 1 kg per 2.75 kg of 3.5% fat‐corrected milk (FCM). Herbage present was estimated with a disc meter. More herbage dry matter was provided during both spring periods (P<0.05) from T and K than from J pasture. Cows on S ate more (P<0.05) grain mix supplement and tended to gain more mass (P<0.10) during one autumn and one spring period than cows on pasture, but did not consistently produce more actual milk and 3.5% FCM than cows grazing fescue pastures. There was no consistent advantage in actual milk production for cows on any fescue cultivar throughout the study. Animals grazing T produced less (P<0.05) actual milk than those grazing K during the spring of each year, and less than those grazing J in spring, 1991. Milk fat and protein concentrations did not differ (P≥0.05) for cows on different pasture treatments but the trend was for greater (P<0.10) milk fat content for cows on S. The production of 3.5% FCM did not differ for cows grazing different fescue cultivars, except cows on J produced more milk than those on T during one spring period. Cows in early lactation (autumn periods) lost mass while those in mid‐lactation (spring periods) gained or at least maintained their mass. Grazing fescue pastures can be a viable herbage substitute for maize silage when pastures are of high nutrient content.

Wall barley seeding rates of 10kg ha-1, 20kg ha-1, 30kg ha-1 and 40kg ha-1 were evaluated in field studies that were conducted for two years at Ramtha Agricultural Research Station (32°33'N 36°0'E) located 22km to the east of Irbid. Measurements recorded each year included plant height, number of tillers per plant, oven-dry forage weight, seed yield and protein content. Forage and seed production increased in response to increasing sowing rate, and was highest at a sowing rate of 30kg ha-1. Tiller numbers showed a negative response to increasing sowing rate. Plant height and crude protein content did not respond to seeding rate, but they varied with years (P ≤ 0.05). Protein content did not respond to seeding rates.

    "abstract": "Bush encroachment has been recognised in southern Africa since the late nineteenth century. Our review of 23 studies showed that the rate of woody cover change has ranged from −0.131 to 1.275% y −1 . Encroachment was most rapid on small protected areas, intermediate under commercial tenure, and slowest under communal tenure and large, natural environments with mega-herbivores present. Several drivers of bush encroachment, which interact and change over time, have been proposed. Fires, for example, were actively suppressed during the early twentieth century. However, rainfall interacts with fire and the rate of woody increase under fire exclusion is linearly related to mean annual rainfall. A reduction in browsing herbivores from the nineteenth century would have had a positive cumulative effect on woody cover whilst an increase in grazing herbivores would have reduced the competitive effect  of grasses. Encroachment was most rapid during the high rainfall, mid-1970s, which followed the 1960s drought when cattle numbers were at their peak, and the grass layer was degraded. Increasing atmospheric [CO 2 ] and climate change have emerged as important drivers in the recent literature. Bush encroachment depends on the interplay of history, environment, management and vegetation, recognition of which is essential for containing encroachment.

    "abstract": "Condensed tannins are ecologically important compounds in plants for several reasons, e.g. as herbivore deterrents or protecting photosynthetic tissues against ultraviolet radiation. The hand-held Dualex Series 4 instrument was originally developed for indirect determination of flavonol concentrations in crops. Flavonols are low-molecular-weight phenolics from which condensed tannins are synthesised. Therefore, it was expected that the Dualex’s ‘flavonol index’ (range 0.00–3.00) could be used to predict condensed tannin concentrations, providing a rapid, cost-effective, non-destructive method to sample more species and more plants per treatment than destructive methods used for wet-chemistry tannin assays. Thirteen broad-leaved woody species were sampled at the Nkuhlu and Letaba exclosures in Kruger National Park during December 2011. Four plants were sampled per species by collecting 100 leaves per plant, measuring the flavonol index of each leaf and pooling them in classes of 0.10 flavonol units. Condensed tannin concentrations were determined according to the acid-butanol assay with Sorghum tannin as standard. Regression models (condensed tannin = a *flavonol index – b ) were significant for only four species: Acacia nigrescens ( Senegalia nigrescens ), Euclea divinorum, Spirostachys africana and Combretum zeyheri . Other than high variation in chemistry among plants, poor calibration results were likely caused by high chemical variation within leaves.

The objective of this study was to investigate the re-establishment of C. mopane over a 19-year period on seven plots thinned to different tree densities. Thinning was completed during 1989 and measurements done annually from 1990 to 1995 and again during 2008. Absolute tree densities (plants ha −1 ) increased in the low tree density plots, whereas in the high tree density plots the tree densities declined. Changes in leaf phytomass of the C. mopane trees were more pronounced than changes in absolute tree densities and growth of the remaining trees mainly occurred as increases in canopy diameter, rather than increases in tree height. Growth of established trees displayed an exponential increase in growth with declining tree density demonstrating the suppressive effect of inter-tree competition on the growth of individual trees. A trend towards an equilibrium appears to exist where some self thinning occurred in the dense plots, opposed to increases in the number and size of trees in the thinned plots. Considering the benefits of trees (soil enrichment and food to browsing herbivores), tree thinning rather than tree clearing is recommended.

    "abstract": "The experiment was conducted to determine the seasonal effects on the availability, chemical composition and digestibility of a grazing dry-land lucerne pasture, as measured on samples either collected by hand or with oesophageally fistulated (OF) sheep. The pasture was monitored monthly for a period of thirteen months. An overall mean amount of 647 kg DM ha−1 of material was monitored during the experimental period. Lucerne, as a percentage of the total DM availability was relatively low (approximately 19%), probably due to the preference of sheep to select lucerne in spite of the other available material. Both the crude protein (CP) content and the organic matter (OM) digestibility of the samples showed a seasonal tendency with higher values during the winter and lower values during the summer. Mean OM, CP, organic matter digestibility (OMD), acid detergentfibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) contents of 91.7%, 10.7%, 57.5%, 47.1% and 74.0%, respectively, were obtained with hand-clipped samples, while the corresponding composition of samples collected by OF sheep was 83.1%, 21.0%, 64.7%, 38.2% and 58.4%, respectively. The sheep were able to select forage samples with a higher CP content than those collected by hand throughout the year. This was, however, not the case with the organic matter digestibility of the samples during the growing season July to October. The CP content of fistula extrusion samples (f) could be predicted from hand-clipped samples (h) from the linear relationship, CPf = 10.51 + 0.97CPh (r = 0.59). The study provided figures on the chemical composition and digestibility of dryland lucerne pasture at grazing in a Mediterranean environment.",

Putative vegetation types were delineated using Landsat 8 imagery, then sampled with 73 plots for vegetation composition and structure, and topo-edaphic properties. Classification followed a four-stage process. Valley dambo and floodplain grasslands were first separated as landscape units from wooded plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was then used to identify 13 vegetation types based on woody composition and structure. Convex hull plots on a principal component analysis biplot successfully delineated the topo-edaphic environment and woody structure of each type. Linear discriminant analysis confirmed differences in topo-edaphic environment among types. The main environmental gradient was from vertic clays, supporting open Acacia woodland, to sandy soils, supporting miombo woodland, but other gradients were also important. Of a total of 193 woody species recorded, 25 occurred only on large termitaria. An influence of environmental gradients independent of plant-available moisture and nutrients is emphasised. Total woody cover decreased conspicuously on clay-rich soils with increased water availability. A functional vegetation classification of this nature is considered an essential first step towards the informed management of rangeland for large herbivores. Potential applications for management are discussed.",

We assessed the effect of slope aspect on fiber and mineral composition of forage species present to provide information on the importance of slope for species characterization and nutritional value for domestication. Tissue samples from six replicates of the same species occurring on opposing aspects were collected for nutritional assessment. Results on the data showed that fibre and mineral composition differed in species occurring on different slopes, albeit with few exceptions. The concentrations of P, K and Mg in some species were significantly higher on the cooler and wetter south facing slopes relative to north facing slopes. Nutrient elements in soil samples collected from each site varied with slope aspects and elements. It is recommended that topography should be considered when studying forage nutritional assessments as part of future domestication programs.",

A study was conducted to characterise vegetation from such fields, and assess its grazing suitability across four agroecological regions (AER II – AER V) characterised by annual rainfall ranging from 750 mm to 400 mm, and five categories of fallow age groups (0-5; 6-10; 11-20, > 20 years and normal rangeland). Most fallow fields did not mature into woodlands but remained grasslands with or without sparse shrubs regardless of the period of fallowing and AER because of high stocking rates. There were no variations in palatability, ecological value, diversity, biomass and grazing capacity across fallow age groups. However, significant differences were observed across AERs. The quality of vegetation from fallows in AER II and III was poor but good in AER IV and V. The quantity of vegetation from fallows in AER II was higher than from other AERs. However, all fallow fields from the four AERs had low grazing capacity than expected from literature. We conclude that using fallow fields for uncontrolled grazing is unsustainable. There is need to investigate better management strategies for livestock production in fallow fields.",

The ability of a grass plant to recover from fire may be influenced by the fire frequency and intensity (influenced by seasonal weather conditions and fuel load), defoliation and competition from neighbouring plants. This study sought to investigate factors influencing the fire and herbivore dynamics of an evergreen C3 grass, Festuca costata, in a high-altitude C4 dominated grassland in the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa. We experimentally examined the effect of fire frequency, defoliation and competition from neighbours on the growth dynamics of F. costata. Annual burning significantly decreased aboveground biomass production, number of tillers and tuft circumference of F. costata. Defoliation similarly reduced aboveground biomass production, number of tillers, tuft circumference and specific leaf area of F. costata. Competition from neighbouring plants reduced aboveground biomass production, number of tillers and tuft circumference of F. costata. Given the expected variable impacts of increasing CO2 levels and temperature on C3 and C4 grasses, these results provide insights for managing the matrix of C3 and C4 grasses in the Drakensberg grasslands in a changing climate.",

Relevant legislation has not regarded D. obovata as an encroacher species in grasslands. The abundance and distribution patterns of D. obovata in four conservation areas were mapped in the field and captured as GIS layers to facilitate calculation of the proportion of each grassland area deemed to have been encroached over two decades. Management records for 17 conservation areas were analysed to determine whether there were associations between different management practices and D. obovata encroachment. We found that more than one third of grasslands present in 1999 were lost to encroachment by D. obovata and that some grassland areas were almost completely (99%) encroached. Results of a Chi-squared test and principal components analysis of management records indicated that the absence of large herbivores was significantly associated with D. obovata encroachment into grasslands. We conclude that D. obovata should be listed as a woody encroacher species and that some conventional management practises applied to control woody encroachers, such as the use of fire, are ineffective against D. obovata.",

Nine Brachiaria cultivars were evaluated for leaf rust, leaf spot and leaf blight diseases and agronomic performances in two agro-ecological zones of Rwanda. The relationships between agronomic traits and area under diseases progress curve (AUDPC) were determined using Pearson correlation analysis. Cultivars differed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) for their response to these three diseases. Basilisk, Marandu, MG4, and Xaraes exhibited moderately resistant to resistant response to all three diseases, but Cayman and Cobra were susceptible to leaf rust. Site × cultivar × harvest interaction was significant for diseases and agronomic parameters (p ≤ 0.05). Cultivars also differed significantly for biomass production and dry matter content (p ≤ 0.05). The highest biomass producers were Marandu and Xaraes, and Cayman, Cobra and Piata had highest dry matter content. The AUDPC for leaf rust and leaf spot had negative and significant correlation with biomass yield. Our study concludes a satisfactory level of resistance in Basilisk, Marandu, MG4 and Xaraes to all three foliar disease in Rwanda. We recommend routine surveys for emerging and re-emerging Brachiaria diseases and studies to develop effective management measures against Brachiaria diseases.",

Nodulation of T. repens is often poor, because of suboptimal environmental conditions or absence of host-specific rhizobia. The cultivars Huia, Haifa, Ladino and Regal were selected, as these are popular cultivars available in South Africa. Thousand seed mass (TSM) of each cultivar was measured to determine viability of seed and the possible interaction between TSM and nodulation. Mean TSM values of the cultivars differed significantly, with Huia having the highest TSM followed by Haifa, Ladino and Regal. Biomass production was also measured as an indicator of nitrogen fixation efficiency. The cultivar Huia, with the highest TSM values, resulted in the highest biomass production. Nodulation indices were determined from the size, number and colour of the nodules. All plants, regardless of cultivar, formed nodules within 8 weeks. It was concluded that TSM had no effect on nodulation. Planting date with associated temperature effects and the intrinsic cultivar effect also had no influence on nodulation. It was therefore concluded that nodulation potential of the four cultivars tested was similar under environmental conditions that prevailed during the study.",

Determination of foliar macronutrients and proximate chemical compositions was undertaken using five diameter classes (11–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–50 and 51–60 cm at breast height). In both cases, four replications in randomised complete blocks were considered. Data on foliar nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), digestible crude protein (DCP), ether extract (EE), crude fibre (CF), ash content and nitrogen free extract (NFE) were collected. Results revealed that the tree diameter size had an effect on foliar N, P, K, DM, CP, DCP, EE and CF, whereas it had no effect on ash content and NFE. The results also showed that F. thonningii leaves are a good source of nutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates and minerals) as well as fibre and are within the recommended range for ruminant livestock growth and development. Hence, use of F. thonningii as a supplement/substitute livestock feed to low-quality grasses during the periods of feed scarcity should be widely considered.

The yields of fodder sorghum and pearl millet were better under severely water stressed conditions (W1) in comparison to that of maize. However, maize yields under control conditions (W4), were the highest. Soybean produced higher yields than cowpeas. Cowpeas were more digestible than soybeans and also had a higher crude protein content than the other four crops. Fodder sorghum and pearl millet have comparable digestibilities and crude protein contents. Maize has a high digestibility but is very poor in crude protein content. It is thus advisable to combine maize with a legume. Whether soybean or cowpeas should be considered would depend on the need of bulk or protein. Under dryland conditions (W1) fodder sorghum and pearl millet would be better choices than maize.",

All possible combinations of spring, summer, autumn and winter served as the 16 treatments. The infiltration measurements were determined by means of a flood type concentric ring infiltrometer. The results showed that grazing during any one of the seasons reduced the infiltration capacity of the soils. The detrimental effects of summer and autumn grazing were, however, larger titan those of winter and spring grazing. Highly significant positive correlations between infiltration capacity and veld condition, as measured in terms of the basal cover of climax grasses, were obtained.

After many years of efforts to combat desertification and promote sustainable land management, it is surprising that these diverging perceptions remain so fixed. They prevailed throughout the process of establishing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and continue for a variety of reasons, which include the relatively slow, iterative processes of science related to rapid demands of human crises and change. In reality all relevant scientists, whether they be social or biophysical, as well policy- and decision-makers need to, and often do, work together to adequately address the desertification challenge. This paper uses practical examples of important desertification policy processes and measures that integrate critical science information, including examples on setting sustainable land management (SLM) standards, developing land-use planning frameworks, and establishing SLM monitoring and evaluation systems.",

The objective of this study was to determine the physiological response of Medicago sativa and Festuca arundinacea to cutting under different water regimes in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In a field experiment, two cutting intensities were applied under irrigation and under rainfed (water deficit) conditions. Water potential, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were measured. Based on the results, M. sativa showed higher transpirational water losses under rainfed conditions when compared to those of F. arundinacea, regardless of cutting treatment, because of the higher stomatal conductance. However, leaf water potential remained higher in M. sativa, suggesting a more effective root, stem or leaf related water uptake system. In addition, under water deficit, stomata of M. sativa were less sensitive to low values of water potential, probably resulting in higher productivity when compared to F. arundinacea. Cutting resulted in higher stomatal conductance and, therefore, higher transpiration in both species. Moreover, under water deficit, cutting positively affected water potential, especially in F. arundinacea, alleviating the effect of ageing.",

Fresh samples were collected randomly from Leucaena regrowth and sorted into four types of samples (primordial tips, young leaves, mature leaves and edible twigs). The samples were divided into two portions and handled as fresh or air-dried. Mimosine was extracted from the fresh and air-dried samples with dilute hydrochloric acid. Chemical analysis was done by indirect spectrophotometric methods. A General Linear Model procedure was used to determine the impact of the variables on the concentration of mimosine. The results showed that air-dried samples in both seasons contained significantly (P < 0.05) more mimosine than the corresponding fresh samples by an average of 34%. Fresh autumn samples collected at 12:00 contained more mimosine (15.43%) than samples collected at 15:00 (9.09%) and 9:00 (4.48%) in comparison with corresponding summer samples. Similarly, air-dried autumn samples collected at 12:00 contained more mimosine (47.15%) than samples collected at 9:00 (43.57%) and 15:00 (40.12%) in comparison with the corresponding summer samples. Dehydration of samples elevated the concentration of mimosine by 39.09%, 31.72% and 31.03% for samples collected at 9:00, 12:00 and 15:00, respectively. It was concluded that dehydration of samples had the most significant impact on the concentration of mimosine followed by the time of defoliation and the season.",

The test kit consisted of a culture medium (Fe2), serum test tubes, disposable syringes and needles, stomach tube, cheesecloth and ferric chloride reagent. The objectives were to test a field kit for practicality and reliability, to assess the spread of the bacteria among sheep flocks within the farm in Phase 1, and to monitor the persistence of the bacteria with and without Leucaena forage in the diet for 5 months in Phase 2. Three sheep flocks (20 young ewes, 30 older ewes and 11 wethers) were screened in Phase 1; and in Phase 2, four wethers were monitored for 19 weeks with and without Leucaena forage in the diet. In Phase 1, wethers tested positive within 6.364 ± 0.48 d, while the ewes took longer (16.5 ± 0.14 d). All flocks were infested with the bacteria even without prior inoculation. In Phase 2, the four wethers on Leucaena diet tested positive within 5.0 ± 0.0 d, but without Leucaena in the diet it took 12.08 ± 0.0, 11.0 ± 4.46, 11.67 ± 5.76, and 6.92 ± 0.0 d, respectively. The bacteria persisted for 5 months without Leucaena in the diet. This confirmed that the field test kit was simple, reliable and fast, and the bacteria are contagious and very persistent.",

The use of tebuthiuron on a farm in the Cymbopogon–Themeda veld type in the Zastron district of the Free State has led to the formation of bare patches in the grass layer. This study investigated patterns of emergence and survival of monocotyledonous oats ( Avena sativa ) and dicotyledonous cabbage ( Brassica oleracea ) in soils collected from bare patches resulting from the application of tebuthiuron between two and eight years earlier. Untreated soils provided a control. Both oats and cabbage emergence was high and not related to herbicide application. After about two weeks, plants growing in tebuthiuron-treated soil began to die, and after 60 d only four of the 299 emerged seedlings were alive, but showed signs of mortal phytotoxicity. Mortality in the control was low. It was concluded that tebuthiuron residues in the bare patches may preclude recolonisation by seed for at least eight years  following application.

    "abstract": "Ficus thonningii is a multipurpose browse tree in northern Ethiopia. Despite its importance, techniques for quantifying its browsable biomass have not been developed. To develop best-estimation equations, the dendrometric parameters total height (H), crown height (CH), crown diameter (CD), diameter at stump height (DSH), diameter at breast height (DBH), crown depth (CDp), crown area (CA) and crown volume (CV) were measured from 12 sampled trees comprising three age ranges. Leaves and edible twigs of the sampled trees were clipped, oven dried, weighed and recorded as dry weight (DW). Regression analysis and a multicollinearity test were employed to remove non-significant predictors of DW. Results showed that only CV, CA, CD, CDp and DSH showed a strong correlation with DW. There was high collinearity between CD and CA, CD and CV, and CA and CV. However, CV and DSH had a higher correlation with DW than their counterparts, which suggested their use in the model. Therefore, the best allometric equation was: DW = 0.8470*CV − 0.2202*DSH − 1.5315 ( R 2 = 0.99). This equation estimated that F. thonningii produces a very high amount of browsable biomass at all ages compared to common fodder species. The model can be used to plan the browsing rate and understand the ecological role of the species.

The chemical composition and in vitro digestibility of organic matter (IVDOM) of these samples were determined. Crude protein concentration ranged between 123–262 g kg DM –1 , and tended to be higher in spring than in the other seasons. The acid detergent fibre ranged between 175–312 g kg DM –1 and also tended to be higher in autumn than in either spring or summer. The  IVDOM values in this study were high (>700 g kg DM –1 ) compared to values reported in literature for the same species and other browse species such as Cassia sturtii , Tripteris sinuatum and Sutherlandia microphylla . The concentrations of calcium (Ca), sodium, zinc and manganese (Mn) appear to be higher in autumn while the concentrations of phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), potassium and copper (Cu) tended to be lower at this time compared to other seasons. In spring, the concentrations of Ca and Mn appear to be low while those of P, Mg and Cu are relatively high compared to the other seasons. However, the P content of Z. mucronata foliage was deficient in summer and autumn, while Cu was deficient in all seasons. African Journal of Range & Forage Science 2009, 26(2): 103–105",

    "abstract": "We studied the effects of browsing on the plant architecture and volume-biomass relationships of three dominant dwarf shrubs – Artemisia herba-alba, A. mesatlantica and Teucrium mideltense – in a sagebrush steppe in the Central High Atlas Mountains, southern Morocco. For this purpose, we developed power-law volume-biomass functions based on nonlinear regressions for each of these species, under both browsed and unbrowsed conditions. These functions were then applied to individual-based annual monitoring data from inside and outside a browsing exclosure to calculate standing biomass for each of the years from 2004 to 2009. The biomass of the three species was well predicted by the allometric functions, and different functions for the browsed and unbrowsed conditions reflected changes in plant architecture. Browsing had a significant negative impact on biomass for A. herba-alba but not for A. mesatlantica , whereas its effects on T. mideltense were inconsistent between years. The fact that the latter two species hardly benefited from browsing exclusion might be because of increased competition from the more dominant A. herba-alba . During the study period, the standing biomass increased whether or not there was browsing, which might be because of the recovery of the shrubs after a preceding severe drought. Further studies are needed in order to investigate the generality of the findings.

    "abstract": "Studies on plant phenology and browse capacity require effective methods to rapidly quantify plant dimensions such as tree height, height of maximum canopy diameter, height of first leaves, maximum canopy diameter, and diameter of trunk(s) at height of first leaves. Here we describe a method for estimating tree dimensions and calculating canopy volume using a measuring staff (for calibration), a digital camera and our VolCalc software. The method requires a photograph be taken of the measuring staff placed next to an object whose measurements are to be determined. The two objects must be adjacent to one another in the photograph. For rapid analysis, multiple photographs of different objects can be taken over a short period of time using the measuring staff. The method is not limited to plants and can be used to determine, for example, browser height, height at which browsers feed, and primate resource abundance. The method has been tested in the field and provides a fast and precise tree dimension parameter estimation option, where sampling time is of the essence. Test results compare well to alternative methods currently utilised, showing improved precision and faster field data collection times, which are important to researchers and ecologists.

    "abstract": "The study represents the first efforts since 1909 to develop improved Sudangrass ( Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, syn. S. sudanense (Piper) Stapf) cultivars from the  original genetic stock existing in the Sudan. Seven Sudangrass genotypes generated by individual plant selection within the land race ‘Garawi’ were evaluated across seven environments in Khartoum State in 2003–2006. Selection criteria were based on forage as well as seed-setting attributes. The objectives  were to develop improved and reproducible cultivars from the parent population Garawi. The results indicated that two genotypes, S.(32-2)A and S.51, were superior to the parent population in forage yield, protein content, average stability of yield superiority and reproducibility. The increment in yield was attained without significant delay in flowering duration. Both genotypes were recommended for forage production under the traditional green chopping system. S.(32-2)A was officially released under the name Sudan-1 by the Variety Release Committee in February 2009. The newly developed genotypes will contribute to widening the currently narrow genetic base of Sudangrass cultivars. Seed of the newly  developed genotypes can be provided in small amounts for research purposes upon written request to the author.

    "abstract": "Spines in plants have evolved to reduce mammalian herbivory, and their main function may be to protect twigs more than photosynthetic tissue. Type and frequency of spines vary at different scales. We hypothesised that different types of spines affect animal foraging through different mechanisms. We studied feeding behaviour by twig-browsing goats in relation to two types of spines of Acacia tortilis  using experimental manipulation of the occurrence of spines. Feeding time, number of biting actions, number and diameter of bites on trees (post-trial) and total intake were recorded. The removal of either long  straight spines or short hooked spines resulted in no feeding responses by goats. The removal of both types of spines tended to increase feeding time resulting in more and larger bites with larger bite diameters and in increased total intake and utilisation compared to control branches. The removal of spines had no effects on feeding rate, expressed as biting actions per minute, number of twigs bitten per minute or intake rate (grams per minute). Both types of spines reduced total intake and utilisation of browse, but the functional mechanisms were different with the long straight spines mainly influencing bite size and short hooked spines mainly affecting number of bites.

    "abstract": "The Great Fish River Reserve (GFRR), in the Eastern Cape, has proved to be particularly suitable for the black rhinoceros that have been introduced over the past 20 years. In captivity, these animals often suffer from a number of disease conditions, certain of which may be related to antioxidant deficiencies in their diet. Therefore, the antioxidant capacities of the leaves of 25 bush species in the GFRR was determined by the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods and the total phenolics by the Folin-Ciocalteau procedure. The plant species Ozoroa mucronata, Putterlickia pyracantha, Phyllanthus verrucosus, Maytenus capitata, Euclea undulata and Jatropha capensis were found to have the highest antioxidant capacity by the three methods, whereas for total phenols Putterlickia pyracantha was replaced in the top six by Carissa bispinosa . The black rhinoceros in this area appear to favour plants of varying antioxidant capacity and do not seem to select browse species for this property.

The herbicides 2,4-D amine (480 g ai l -1 ), metsulfuron methyl (600 g kg -1 ) and picloram (240 g l -1 ) were tested at three levels each. Manual control comprised hoeing and pulling out parthenium plants by hand. Treatments were applied in mid-December 2006. Surveys were conducted prior to treatment and again in March 2007. The untreated control had a mean mortality of 16% at the end of the growing season, attributed to self thinning. Parthenium mortalities above 80% were achieved with metsulfuron methyl 18–75 g ai ha -1 , picloram 270–360 g ai ha -1 and both manual control techniques. Broadleaf species, 10 out of 15 of which were alien, were severely affected by herbicides but alien forbs appeared to benefit by the selective removal of parthenium in the manual control treatments. Native grasses filled the space vacated by broadleaf species in the plots treated with herbicide. However, none of the treatments offered lasting control because parthenium regeneration density a year later was no different to densities at the start of the trial. Successful management of parthenium rests on a strong commitment to follow-up spraying until alternative vegetation has covered and stabilised areas under treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of different nitrogen fertiliser application levels in combination with different defoliation intervals on the dry matter (DM) production and water‐use efficiency of ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum,) cv. Midmar. In a field trial, four nitrogen levels (0, 150, 300 and 450 kg N ha−1) were combined with five defoliation intervals (every 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks and twice a season). Soil moisture levels were measured with a neutron hydroprobe and were used to schedule irrigation. The dry matter production, nitrogen‐use efficiency (NUE), plant DM content and water‐use efficiency were influenced (P<0.01) by nitrogen level, defoliation interval, and the interaction between these factors. Total DM production varied from 64 to 20 922 kg DM ha−1. Dry matter production per unit of applied N decreased with an increase in N level within a defoliation interval. The plant DM content varied from 14.0% to 35.6%. The plant DM content decreased (P<0.05) with increasing N applications, while a lengthening of the defoliation interval resulted in an increase (P<0.05) in the DM content. No difference (P>0.05) was found in total water used when plants received N. Water‐use efficiency varied from 1.2 to 25.8 kg DM ha−1 mm−1 water received.",

Effects of applying different N fertilisers (e.g. urea and ammonium nitrate) at 45 kg N ha−1 in autumn, with and without phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and sulphur (S) on N fixation were also tested (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, percentage N derived from the atmosphere (percent Ndfa) by white clover varied between 87% and 91% in the period after (24 to 36 days) N application. Increasing rates of N and time of application did not influence percent Ndfa. The amount of N fixed by white clover ranged from 0.8 to 3.7 kg N ha−1 in the period after N application. Increasing rates of applied N produced a significant (P<0.05) linear increase in the amount of N fixed. In Experiment 2, percent Ndfa and amount of N fixed (1.9 to 4.1 kg N ha−1) were unaffected by different N fertilisers, with and without P, K and S, in the period after (37 days) fertiliser application. For both experiments, fertiliser N increased dry matter yield while having no effect on white clover composition. It is concluded that single applications of N during the autumn and early winter benefit pasture growth without adversely affecting white clover N fixation or clover composition. This finding, however, will require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Zero grazing is the cornerstone of dairying in intensively cultivated smallholdings in Kenya. The cut and carry method of forage harvesting increasingly is leading to soil mining, especially of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). This problem is more serious in the Central highlands where the prevalent soil type, nitisol, is inherently low in P and N. A study was carried out at the University of Nairobi, Kabete from October 1999 until July 2000 to determine the effects of low rates of N and P fertilisers on productivity of an African annual clover, Trifolium quartinianum cv. Mealton 5, for zero grazing in Kenyan highland smallholdings. Fertiliser applications were: no fertiliser (P0N0); 27 kg N ha−1 as urea (P0N1); 30 kg P ha−1 as triple superphosphate (TSP) (P1N0); and 27 kg N ha−1 as urea and 30 kg P ha−1 as TSP (P1N1). Plant field establishment was enhanced more by application of both P and N than application of each fertiliser alone. Plant canopy cover and dry matter yield were highest in PINI and PIN0 treatments. Nodule number per plant was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) increased by P application. Leaf crude protein was increased similarly by fertiliser application. The results showed that Mealton 5 productivity (both quality and quantity) was enhanced similarly by applying either 30 kg P ha−1 in TSP form or TSP with urea at 30 kg P ha−1 and 27 kg N ha−1.

Chromatoplates, when visualised under ultraviolet light, revealed a number of fluorescent compounds, some of which were common in both the fistula and bush sample extracts. By comparing the presence of characteristic compounds in the fistula sample with those that appear identical in particular bush species, dietary preferences of browsers can be established.

Cutting at zero height (above the soil surface) increased plant height, stem thickness, green and dry foliage yield per plant, green and dry foliage yield per hectare, water use efficiency and nitrogen-free extract yield per hectare. The highest values for chlorophyll content, percentages of crude protein, crude fibre, ether extract and ash, and yields per hectare of protein, fibre, ether extract and ash were produced with cutting at 30 cm height. The highest nitrogen-free extract percentage was obtained with cutting at 60 cm height.

Therefore, it is necessary to establish planting and harvesting management strategies for this cultivar. This study evaluated the effect of cutting intensity (preservation mother cladode, and mother + primary cladodes) and different planting densities (55 555; 27 777; 13 888 and 6 944 plants ha−1) on the morphology and productivity of the forage cactus cv. MEE, in 10-year-old cultivation under rainfed conditions. A split-plot design was used where planting density was allocated to the main plots and harvesting intensity to the sub-plots. Each treatment combination was replicated four times. The data were submitted to ANOVA, Tukey's test, and principal component analysis at 5% (p < 0.05). Post-harvesting preservation of the primary cladodes promoted greater dry matter production (9.2 t ha−1 year−1), crop water accumulation (86.6 t ha−1 year−1), and rainwater use efficiency (11.4 kg of DM mm−1) (p < 0.01). Primary cladodes preservation positively influenced the productive characteristics of the forage cactus, and the planting density of 13 888 plants ha−1 (0.72 m2) favoured the productivity of this cultivar. These findings can guide planting and harvesting strategies for cultivating MEE cactus.",

The chemical composition and anti-nutritional factors of the selected IFTS were analysed. Among the 37 selected IFTS species, crude protein (CP) ranged from 83.3 to 230.5 (mean, 134.3) g kg−1 dry matter (DM); CP was greater than 80 g kg−1 DM in all selected species. Condensed tannin (CT) content varied from 2.57 to 210.91 g kg−1 (p < 0.05) among the selected species, of which 72% had < 40 g kg−1 DM, an amount that is tolerable for ruminants. Farmers' preferences and the nutritive value of the selected fodder species were positively correlated (p < 0.05) for CP (0.61), organic matter digestibility (0.303) and metabolisable energy (0.25). Farmers' preference ranking and the nutritive value of the plants were considered to select the top 14 IFTS, all of which had CP > 110 g kg−1, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) < 350 g kg−1, and CT < 40 g kg−1.

Simulated continuous grazing (CG) was also tested. Low-frequency grazing produces superior DM yields to high-frequency or continuous grazing. High-frequency grazing (including CG) promoted a greater level of weed production, particularly during the second year, relative to low-frequency grazing. Perennial ryegrass producers should therefore adopt low-frequency grazing to promote DM production and minimize weed invasion. Grazing intensity did not influence DM production. Dry matter production was characteristically elevated during spring and autumn, and relatively less during mid- to late-summer and during winter. Perennial rye grass pastures therefore produce well when the tropical pasture species are relatively inactive.

The model was based upon measured ingestive and digestive characteristics of different grass species and incorporates an explicit digestive constraint based upon rumen mass and turnover rate. Sensitivity analysis indicated that forage quality, through its effects on digestion rate, had a far greater impact on predicted ADG than ingestion rate. There were major differences between grass species in their predicted potential to support ADG. Overall, predicted ADG was greatest for Hyparrhenia hirta, and to a lesser extent for Cynodon dactylon, but lowest for Andropogon appendiculatus, Eragrostis plana and Microchloa caffra. For all species, predicted ADG declined through the grazing season and most species appeared incapable of meeting animal maintenance energy requirements in winter. Predicted ADG increased with plant height in all species until the seasonal limit set by voluntary feed intake was reached. At all sites predicted ADG declined through the grazing period but the magnitude and rate of this decline was strongly dependent upon species composition in terms of the nutritive value and the relative and absolute abundance of the species present at a site. Species composition, through its effect on diet quality, is therefore likely to be a major determinant of animal production on Döhne Sourveld.",

This effect may be ascribed largely to better moisture conditions achieved with mulching although, at high rates of manuring, additional benefits could also be ascribed to the circulation of nutrients. The cost effectiveness of manuring is, however, doubtful. Although manuring improves the response to inorganic fertilization it will not reduce the need for such fertilization. The application of manure at 20 t ha‐1 on large areas would be preferable to 40 t ha‐1 on smaller areas, but this can only be recommended where costs are debited to feedlot waste product disposal.",

Increasing levels of applied N did not have a significant effect on root OM content in the 50–100 mm or the overall 0–200 mm soil depth category. Lower levels of applied N (120–360 kg N ha−1 a−1) may be more conducive to promoting deeper root development than higher levels of applied N (480–720 kg N ha−1 a−1), but this would require investigation beyond one year. Perennial ryegrass is extremely shallow‐rooted, with approximately 75 % of the root mass occurring in the top 50 mm of the soil.

A study was undertaken at Towoomba Research Station, Limpopo Province, South Africa to evaluate no tillage (0C), one initial tillage (1C), annual tillage (AC) and two mulch treatments (0M + M as 2t hay ha–1). The study was conducted from 1990 to 1994, with a below average rainfall. It was done in a camp where the sward had a dense cover and a camp with an uneven, sparse cover. It can be concluded that with such rainfall seasons there was no necessity to aerate the grass, where the cover was dense. Mulch and tillage had a positive effect on DM production (1–2t ha–1), in areas with a sparse cover, but there was doubt that it had any financial benefit.",

The results showed that Aster muricatus und Plinthus karooicus were most preferred; Eriocephalus spinescens and Pentzia incana were somewhat less preferred. No significant differences in preference existed in respect of the remaining six species: Salsola nigrescens, Phymaspermum parvifolium, Ruschia vulnerans, Eriocephalus glaber, Pteronia glauca and Chrysocoma tenuifolia. The latter species were, however, better eaten in the absence of the four more preferred species. Chrysocoma tenuifolia was apparently least acceptable to the sheep under all conditions. The indications are that the presence or absence of more acceptable species determines the order of preference of less preferred species.

In order to assess forage quality of Amaranthus caudatus in response to irrigation levels (irrigation after 70, 140 and 210 mm of evaporation from class A pan) as main plots and foliar sprays of abscisic acid (ABA; 50 μM), salicylic acid (SA; 3 g l–1) and potassium sulfate (PS; 3 g l–1) as subplots. A water shortage from 70 to 210 mm of evaporation decreased the stomata conductance and leaf-area index, but the crude protein concentration, dry matter digestibility, leaf/stem ratio, forage yield and total nitrogen were increased from 70 to 140 and then decreased. Using deficit irrigation for amaranth can reduce water usage without significant yield loss, so that water use efficiency remains at the relatively high levels. Leaf water potential, relative water content, leaf-area index, total chlorophyll, carotenoid, crude protein, dry matter digestibility, leaf/stem ratio and forage yield were increased by foliar sprays. Significant reduction in forage quality occurred at delayed harvest. Forage yield of potassium sulfate treated under severe stress was increased by 29% and 56% at flowering and seed set stages, respectively.",

This session will provide an up to date overview of the extent of desertification in Africa and reflect on some of the problems associated with the measurement of the phenomenon. New perspectives of looking at the problem, particularly those offered by the Dahlem Desertification Paradigm, will be shared and an emphasis of the session will be to explore the complexity of the relationships between biophysical and socio-economic factors as determinants of desertification. In particular, the role of land tenure and poverty as primary causes of land degradation will be considered. A case study from Botswana will examine the impact of different land tenure regimes on plant diversity and soil parameters around water points. Similarly, evidence for a link between poverty and degradation will be explored using information from the recently completed national review of land degradation in South Africa. A third case study from Ethiopia will investigate the role that agro-ecological change might have on the spread of malaria in the region. The hypothesis that is tested here is that the new agro-ecology of maize production in the area has significantly increased the incidence of malaria and facilitated its spread to previously unaffected zones. Finally, an alternative futures analysis of a range of plausible land use options for parts of Namibia will be evaluated in terms of this country's National Programme to Combat Desertification. The session will be concluded by a half hour panel discussion in which general issues concerned with the desertification debate in Africa will be addressed.\nAfrican Journal of Range & Forage Science 2003, 20(2): 101-106",

    "abstract": "Range Science, as a developing discipline in southern Africa, is reviewed over its 60 years of formal existence. The context of the African political and socia-economic environment is used as a background to examine the impact that range science has made on the agricultural and conservation arenas. The relations between organised agriculture, government, conservation agencies and the non-formal sector regarding the development of the discipline are reviewed. The role of professional societies, such as the Grassland Society of Southern Africa and the Zimbabwe Grassland Society, are seen as key to the future development of the discipline and a sustainable land-use, involving the region's rangelands, in both the resource-poor and well-resourced sectors. The need to adapt to the dynamic political and economic environment as well as the changing human- and financial-resource allocations by government is debated. As a consequence of globalisation and improving international trade, a more environmentally conscious legislation is developing. Range Science can playa key role in the rehabilitation of areas exploited for their mineral resources. This for example requires the development of a partnership between the discipline and industry to ensure that the training of scientists equips them with the skills to operate out of the their traditional home of servicing commercial agriculture. To this must be added the re-tooling of current professionals to adapt to their new role in servicing resource-poor farmers and communal landowners. This, in turn, impacts upon the tertiary education sector and its curricula. Strategies for making a positive and constructive contribution to the development of the regions rangeland resources and the discipline are presented.",

    "abstract": "A large proportion of the nutrients ingested by grazing animals are returned to the pasture in dung and urine. These by-products of animal digestion contain many ingredients necessary for plant growth, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). Disadvantages include a tendency for K levels to increase in soils where large quantities of animal waste are applied. A field study was undertaken on kikuyu pastures on the Cedara Research Station in the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal in order to evaluate the effects of excretal returns on animal performance and soil properties. Two treatments (T1 and T2) involved no overwintering on kikuyu, followed by no N fertilisation during summer (T1) or the application of 250kg of N/ha during the summer (T2). The third treatment comprised overwintering on the kikuyu with no N fertilisation during the subsequent summer (T3). Overall, initial live mass of the trial animals was 221.6 ± 3.1kg and the live mass gain was 67.6 ± 3.1, 96.2 ± 3.1 and 80.7 ± 3.1kg per steer for T1, T2 and T3 respectively. As expected, the K levels in the soils of the dunged pasture increased. Before N fertilisation of kikuyu pastures with a relatively high fertility status is undertaken, overwintering cattle on the pastures should be considered. Fertiliser N should only be applied if the expected increased return in livestock sales is greater than the cost of the N fertilisation.",

    "abstract": "Rangeland animal farming requires a continual supply of adequate quality forage to a) sustain animal output targets, b) facilitate flexibility to vary reproductive cycle dates for continuity of offtake, c) avoid enforced sale dates and d) alleviate the need to overgraze. The integration of herbaceous and/or woody forage to supplement natural range grazing, particularly in dry season, continues to be a serious research challenge. The many environmental, physical, biological, economic and social issues involved require an interdisciplinary research approach and also that scientists must understand diverse farming systems to gain the confidence of potential users. In two main papers and 70 posters, Session B6 aims to evaluate progress and to chart future research and development strategies for improved resource use. It would be entirely naive to suggest that all of the issues raised could be captured in this truncated summary and it is hoped that it will serve to arouse interest and discussion which will in turn advance the understanding and future research outlook for the areas involved. \n\nOne main paper examines various management options to overcome possible conflict between increasing demand to satisfy human requirements for food and other needs based on combining animal farming with the protective use of natural resources. Resource conservation is defined and the effects of climate and animal based factors are explored in relation to the main aim of achieving a good fit between animal food requirements and vegetative food supply over the whole year. The relative effects of dry and wet season grazing are closely examined for a range of climatic, soil and vegetation biotypes with emphasis on the effects of the scale at which they are assessed and the relative importance of the plant–climate and plant–animal components. The suggestion that the impact of grazing is related to the presence of key resource areas in dry season is questioned. The extension of the discussion to the development of whole grazing ecosystems with and without alternative food sources (intensive and non-intensive systems) represents an embodiment of the many management interventions outlined. Alternative improved grazing/resting managements are suggested to ensure continuity of forage supply and preservation of range condition. The paper provides a component checklist as a basis for future research planning. \n\nThe role of improved forages and their integration to supplement natural range vegetation is discussed in the second main paper with particular emphasis on improving smallholder welfare and maintenance of landscape function. It is argued that the latter is not restricted to the maintenance of the original mix of plant species. Evidence of regeneration of degraded rangeland is quoted for which the use of compatible species mixtures is advocated. The historic high expectancy and disappointing rate of adoption are emphasised, citing some experiences of undesirable evolutionary dominance and possible loss of biodiversity caused by the use of exotic forages as one cause. However, over-utilisation is presently considered a much greater cause of rangeland degradation and loss of biodviersity. The comparative advantages and limitations for the development of indigenous as opposed to exotic germplasm are outlined. Three strategies for the integration of improved forages to improve the standard of living, especially of smallholders, are outlined, mindful of various farmer and farming conditions and associated community specific socio-economic circumstances which tend to preclude their use. The specific values of a range of herbaceous and woody species are examined. It is suggested that improved forage species will have greatest impact in increasing livestock products in the more intensive mixed crop-livestock systems. Reference to success in related technology uptake in SE Asia provides hope for the future. \n\nAbout half of the posters examine aspects of yield and feed value of a wide range of plant species and also their use ranges in about 20 countries. Between 5% and 10% of the posters are concerned with each of supplementary forage, specific legume species, sylvopastoral systems and drought tolerance. Land tenure, irrigation, chemical fertilisation, rehabilitation of degraded rangeland, seed germination, gene banks, communal grazing, grazing selection and extension/development are other areas included to give a comprehensive cover of the present state of knowledge on forage production for rangelands. \n\nIt is anticipated that discussion will further explore the many topics covered and clarify future research orientation. Property rights to germplasm before and after improvement or modification requires clarification as is this may have serious consequences related to collection and other related issues. Discussion of the relatively slow uptake of research results and why research tends to be organised on a commodity basis when the opposite is true for the majority of commercial users appears appropriate in the context that scientists must understand farming systems and be aware of the broader context into which the improved technology will be integrated so that potential users can identify with the results and have confidence in their adoption. \nAfrican Journal of Range & Forage Science 2003, 20(2): 175-193",

    "abstract": "Abstract The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) makes special mention of the desertification problem in Africa. This session will provide an up to date overview of the extent of desertification in Africa and reflect on some of the problems associated with the measurement of the phenomenon. New perspectives of looking at the problem, particularly those offered by the Dahlem Desertification Paradigm, will be shared and an emphasis of the session will be to explore the complexity of the relationships between biophysical and socio-economic factors as determinants of desertification. In particular, the role of land tenure and poverty as primary causes of land degradation will be considered. A case study from Botswana will examine the impact of different land tenure regimes on plant diversity and soil parameters around water points. Similarly, evidence for a link between poverty and degradation will be explored using information from the recently completed national review of land degradation in South Africa. A third case study from Ethiopia will investigate the role that agro-ecological change might have on the spread of malaria in the region. The hypothesis that is tested here is that the new agro-ecology of maize production in the area has significantly increased the incidence of malaria and facilitated its spread to previously unaffected zones. Finally, an alternative futures analysis of a range of plausible land use options for parts of Namibia will be evaluated in terms of this country's National Programme to Combat Desertification. The session will be concluded by a half hour panel discussion in which general issues concerned with the desertification debate in Africa will be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Rangeland animal farming requires a continual supply of adequate quality forage to a) sustain animal output targets, b) facilitate flexibility to vary reproductive cycle dates for continuity of offtake, c) avoid enforced sale dates and d) alleviate the need to overgraze. The integration of herbaceous and/or woody forage to supplement natural range grazing, particularly in dry season, continues to be a serious research challenge. The many environmental, physical, biological, economic and social issues involved require an interdisciplinary research approach and also that scientists must understand diverse farming systems to gain the confidence of potential users. In two main papers and 70 posters, Session B6 aims to evaluate progress and to chart future research and development strategies for improved resource use. It would be entirely naive to suggest that all of the issues raised could be captured in this truncated summary and it is hoped that it will serve to arouse interest and discussion which will in turn advance the understanding and future research outlook for the areas involved. One main paper examines various management options to overcome possible conflict between increasing demand to satisfy human requirements for food and other needs based on combining animal farming with the protective use of natural resources. Resource conservation is defined and the effects of climate and animal based factors are explored in relation to the main aim of achieving a good fit between animal food requirements and vegetative food supply over the whole year. The relative effects of dry and wet season grazing are closely examined for a range of climatic, soil and vegetation biotypes with emphasis on the effects of the scale at which they are assessed and the relative importance of the plant-climate and plant-animal components. The suggestion that the impact of grazing is related to the presence of key resource areas in dry season is questioned. The extension of the discussion to the development of whole grazing ecosystems with and without alternative food sources (intensive and non-intensive systems) represents an embodiment of the many management interventions outlined. Alternative improved grazing/resting managements are suggested to ensure continuity of forage supply and preservation of range condition. The paper provides a component checklist as a basis for future research planning. The role of improved forages and their integration to supplement natural range vegetation is discussed in the second main paper with particular emphasis on improving smallholder welfare and maintenance of landscape function. It is argued that the latter is not restricted to the maintenance of the original mix of plant species. Evidence of regeneration of degraded rangeland is quoted for which the use of compatible species mixtures is advocated. The historic high expectancy and disappointing rate of adoption are emphasised, citing some experiences of undesirable evolutionary dominance and possible loss of biodiversity caused by the use of exotic forages as one cause. However, over-utilisation is presently considered a much greater cause of rangeland degradation and loss of biodviersity. The comparative advantages and limitations for the development of indigenous as opposed to exotic germplasm are outlined. Three strategies for the integration of improved forages to improve the standard of living, especially of smallholders, are outlined, mindful of various farmer and farming conditions and associated community specific socioeconomic circumstances which tend to preclude their use. The specific values of a range of herbaceous and woody species are examined. It is suggested that improved forage species will have greatest impact in increasing livestock products in the more intensive mixed crop-livestock systems. Reference to success in related technology uptake in SE Asia provides hope for the future. About half of the posters examine aspects of yield and feed value of a wide range of plant species and also their use ranges in about 20 countries. Between 5% and 10% of the posters are concerned with each of supplementary forage, specific legume species, sylvopastoral systems and drought tolerance. Land tenure, irrigation, chemical fertilisation, rehabilitation of degraded rangeland, seed germination, gene banks, communal grazing, grazing selection and extension/development are other areas included to give a comprehensive cover of the present state of knowledge on forage production for rangelands. It is anticipated that discussion will further explore the many topics covered and clarify future research orientation. Property rights to germplasm before and after improvement or modification requires clarification as is this may have serious consequences related to collection and other related issues. Discussion of the relatively slow uptake of research results and why research tends to be organised on a commodity basis when the opposite is true for the majority of commercial users appears appropriate in the context that scientists must understand farming systems and be aware of the broader context into which the improved technology will be integrated so that potential users can identify with the results and have confidence in their adoption.",

    "abstract": "Biological complexity in rangelands arises from spatially-linked ecological states and processes. Herbivores, humans and other agents integrate distinct spatial units into complex systems by moving among and exploiting these units. Spatial heterogeneity plays a central role in the structure and function of grazed ecosystems, but modern human land-use tends to compress the scale at which people and animals can respond to heterogeneity by fragmenting large intact landscapes. Fragmentation is the breaking apart of habitat without incurring habitat loss — in grazed ecosystems this usually implies a diminished ability of large herbivores to access natural heterogeneity in vegetation and topography. As fragmentation occurs, ecosystems are simplified by breaking up interdependent spatial units into separate entities, compartmentalising them into isolated sub-units. The result of this simplification is a reduction in the scale over which complex interactions among environment, large herbivores, and human management takes place. In this symposium, we consider the effects of fragmentation of rangelands and ensuing loss of biological complexity for a variety of processes including behaviour and performance of large herbivores, responses of plant communities to herbivory, and functioning of human social and economic systems. We invite posters that consider quantification of complexity and fragmentation, that describe biological and human consequences of fragmenting grazed ecosystems, and that address options for management and policy aimed at enhancing biological complexity and spatial integrity of grazing systems worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Ryegrass and clover, when grown under optimal conditions in mixed stands interact in response to available light energy. With other resources non-limiting, pasture production is determined by the efficiency with which solar radiation is intercepted by canopies and converted into dry matter. The aim of this study was to investigate the nature of these interactive responses in terms of morphological and physiological mechanisms. Pasture canopy structure and growth were studied under a four-weekly clipping treatment. The ability of the mixed canopy to intercept photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was investigated and compared to the individual pasture components. In addition, utilization of intercepted light was quantified. Light use efficiency (CO2 fixed per unit absorbed PAR) as well as photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv Fm −1) were studied. The results indicate that the interactive responses between ryegrass and clover in mixtures resulted in increased production as well as increased light interception abilities. Morphological characteristics (i.e. canopy structure) of the various components was found to be of major importance in determining light interception ability. There were no significant differences amongst the various treatments in their ability to utilize intercepted PAR for CO2 assimilation. However, slight increases in the ability of photosystem II to utilize assimilated CO2 during photosynthesis were present in monocultures compared to mixed stands. These physiological differences did not have an effect on production potential of the mixed stands.",

Both sensitivity to photo-period and low temperature requirement influenced yield during summer. Early cultivars of Medicago truncatula and M. littoralis with little or no low temperature requirement grew normally during summer and yielded well. It is concluded that thorough testing of these species in the summer rainfall region is warranted.

The root system of ten C. pyracanthoides shrubs consisted of a taproot system supported by a well developed fleshy secondary root system. Minimum branching of secondary roots occurred, resulting in the absence of tertiary and feeder roots. Weak relationships existed between root distribution, plant height and canopy diameter, but subjectively estimated, secondary roots extended horizontally at an average depth of 15 ‐20 cm to a distance of more or less 1–1.5 times the canopy diameter and 1.5–2 times tree height. It is proposed that the correct placement of soil‐applied arboricides and/or absorption mechanisms may be critical for effective chemical control of C. pyracanthoides.",

We observed a reduction in non-fibrous carbohydrates and an increase in the fibrous fraction, whereas starch plus soluble fibres (B1) showed a quadratic behaviour. As for the degradation kinetic parameters of the silages, an increase in gas production and degradation rate (B) was observed, whereas the fraction (A) decreased; the other parameters were not affected by the lengthening of storage time. The dietary simulation showed a reduction in protein, metabolisable energy and average daily gain (ADG), requiring more storage time to gain a point in the body condition score. The in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and total digestible nutrients (TDN) showed quadratic responses, whereas the digestibility of neutral detergent fibre and the milk production estimates were not affected by the storage time of maize silages. It is recommended to store maize silages for up to 221 days, because after this period there is a reduction in the digestibility of silages.",

Savannas had a greater pH and greater mean concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, Na and C compared with the grasslands. Tree seedlings are likely to be more constrained in the grasslands than in the savannas because of Al toxicity and deficiency of P, Cu and B. Of the nutrients analysed, B is likely to have had the greatest effect on vegetation structure for two main reasons. Firstly, the mean concentration of B in the grassland (0.05 mg kg−1) was approximately ten times less than the concentration expected to constrain plant growth. Secondly, the extreme scarcity of B is likely to have reduced the vigour of tree seedlings more than that of the grass sward because grasses have a considerably lower requirement for B than eudicot trees. We suggest that abiotic soil forming processes such as colluvial action and aeolian deposition are the primary factors influencing pH and concentrations of B, both of which have a disproportionate effect on tree establishment.",

It is not known whether soil properties in the grasslands affect tree establishment. As a first step in identifying soil properties potentially underpinning differences in vegetation structure, we analysed the soil chemistry of the pedoderm (0–2 cm) in Dichrostachys patches and adjacent open grassland. Relative to the Dichrostachys patches, the pedoderm of the grassland was significantly richer in K (1.4-fold), Ca (2.6-fold), Mg (3.4-fold), Mn (1.7-fold), B (1.2-fold) and Na (1.6-fold).

It is unlikely that the vigour of tree seedlings, tree ramets or grasses in the Dichrostachys patches would be constrained by the concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Mn, B and Na, or the pH, at the study site. Greater concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Mn, B and Na in the pedoderm of the grassland are, however, likely to be linked to relatively greater nutritive value of the grass sward and in turn greater herbivory pressure.

    "abstract": "Panicum coloratum is a species of C4 type grass native to South Africa. In Argentina, it is valued for its production of good quality forage in environments where resources are limiting, although it is infrequently cultivated in livestock systems. The purpose of this study was to estimate the narrow sense heritability (h2) of the caryopses fall character using the Progeny-Parent Regression method and characterise molecular diversity using ISSR-type markers. The only significant value obtained was in week five, which gives an indication of the existence of additive genetic variance and also its stability. The ISSR markers allowed confirming the existence of genetic variability between cultivars and within individuals of the same cultivar through bands and unique alleles per genotype. The individuals of the Kapivera cultivar have been able to genetically differentiate themselves from the individuals of the Bambatsi cultivar by detecting loci and alleles that differentiate both cultivars. These markers proved to be effective for the distinction of the cultivars analysed and a wide variability has been observed in the species. The characterisation of the genetic diversity within the cultivars of P. coloratum var. makarikariense constitutes a fundamental step for its potential incorporation into breeding programs developed in the species.",

The study showed that trends in herbage quality were related mainly to plant maturity. As more species mature, forage quality declines and falls below animal nutritional requirements, especially for young animals. With declining forage quality, the manager has the option of moving stock to areas of less‐mature forage, supplementing the forage or modifying the demand placed upon it.",

The four legume‐grass pastures consisted of mixtures of the two legumes with combinations of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) and brome grass (Bromus unioloides). The average production in terms of dry matter, stocking rate, average daily gain and total live weight gain of the three lucerne‐based pastures was higher and more constant than that of pastures based on red clover. Lucerne was also a more persistent legume component than red clover. Choice of grass species had very little influence on production and the inclusion of grass in both lucerne‐ and clover‐based pastures did not improve production. Pastures with a brome grass component, however, tended to be higher‐producing than the other legume‐grass mixtures. It is concluded that pure lucerne or legume‐grass pastures based on lucerne are the most productive dryland pastures for this area.",

This crop appeared to be a more appropriate choice in such studies, but further investigation is needed to confirm this observation. The use of uninoculated subterranean clover as a reference crop seemed problematic, since inoculation with effective rhizobia could not be prevented. Relatively high variation in δ15N values for inoculated subterranean clover was obtained compared to the atom% 15N values.

Experiments were conducted to determine if populations respond dissimilarly to planting density, and if the ability to statistically distinguish among populations is density‐dependent. Two, 2‐y studies compared the yield of five populations of kleingrass at three plant densities (6.1, 10.8 and 24.2 plants m‐2). Although all populations produced more dry matter per plant with decreasing density, population x density interactions were absent. In addition, experiments at all three densities had equivalent power to statistically separate populations. Kleingrass yield trials can be established at a density which will accommodate mechanical transplanting and harvesting equipment with confidence that the relative differences among populations determined from research plots will be similarly observed in swards.",

Irrigation resulted in a decrease of the above-mentioned concentrations only in trees that were not defoliated. The results support the decrease of the above-mentioned concentrations only in trees that were not defoliated. The results support the theory of optimal defense and thus indicate that polyphenols are a possible cause of unpalatability in P. afra.

Two methods of mixing, namely mixing of the components in the same row and alternate rows of the two species, were compared at two nitrogen levels and three seeding rates of the grass component. The method of mixing and seeding of the grass had little effect on dry matter production. On the other hand, the application of 240 kg N ha -1 increased the dry matter production of the different mixtures significantly, but at the same time changed the botanical composition drastically owing to the suppression of the clover component. The weighted crud protein content of the mixtures were significantly higher where 240 kg N ha -1 was applied owing to a positive response of both the grass and the clover to nitrogen. Generally speaking, crude protein production followed dry matter production closely.

The main characteristics of conservation are that it (1) is altruistic, (2) expresses a value judgement, and (3) is literally non-falsifiable. Conservation is not widely practised because (1) its altruism, being non-Darwinian, will not be performed spontaneously, (2) there is a mistaken attempt to consider phenomena absolutely rather than recognise the value-driven and theory-laden nature of all human activities, (3) its ethic, if taken literally, cannot be written operationally, and (4) there is a dependence on poorly-falsifiable ecological theories (e.g. neo-Clementsianism). Proposed remedies are to (1) define our ultimate frames of reference, (2) enthuse the public of the chosen core-values, (3) develop operational conservation goals, (4) assess the degree of goal-attainment, (5) try to correct departures, and (6) align individual and societal interests by manipulating market-forces.

An altered sward structure (cut to a height of 30 mm) demonstrated higher volatilized N losses after fertilizer application than a sward retaining approximately 1.00 mm of residual herbage. The mean difference between treatments was estimated at 765 ± 109 g N ha‐1 (P<0.05) for 33 h after the application of urea at 50 kg N ha‐1. This implies that residual herbage remaining on a pasture at the time of N fertilizer application may reduce volatilized N from the pasture.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nitrogen was applied as ammonium nitrate in solution to kikuyu pasture at 225 kg N ha‐1, split into three equal dressings and applied in October, December and February. The first, at 75 kg N ha‐1 was labelled in the ammonium ion and the latter two dressings were not labelled. Herbage, soil and roots were sampled monthly to determine the proportions of the labelled N in the herbage, root and soil over the season. Total 15N recovered over the season, as a percentage of that applied as 15NH4NO3, was 99.0%. A total of 52.1% of the labelled N was recovered in the herbage over the season, the highest recovery being in November. Recovery rates declined from November through to March. However, the accumulated recovery of 15N was curvilinear over the season. The recovery rate of 15N in the roots was lower than in the herbage, and the highest percentage recovered was in December. The 15N recovered, as a percentage of that applied, in the soil depth classes showed similar trends. The highest percentage of I5N was recovered in the 0–300 mm depth class and the lowest in the 600–1000 mm depth class. Leaching of 15N, although minimal, did occur over the season.",

Apart from the seed yield itself, time of planting centro did not have any significant effect on the number of flowers per inflorescence, pods per seedhead, seeds per pod and weight of 100 g seeds of centro. There was a negative correlation between seed yield and time of planting centro at all cassava interrow spacings. A similar correlation was found for cassava interrow spacing at the various times of planting the legume, due to a reduction in the population of centro. Seed yield was maximized (982 kg ha‐1) when centro was planted at the same time with cassava and at a spacing of 1 m × 1 m.",

The model was developed using veld production data collected during the 1980/81 growing season. The theory successfully simulated production in three subsequent years, each with widely differing climatic conditions. Carbohydrate translocation within plants, in each growth stage, is driven by the ration of the existing mass of given plant parts to the total plant mass. The mass in each plant organ strives to attain an optimal proportion of the total plant mass by means of the translocation of carbohydrate. In each growth stage a maximum translocation rate is possible into and out of each plant organ. The actual translocation rate varies sigmoidally with the relative mass ratio deviation from the desired proportion.

The mixture receiving 240 kg N ha -1 showed an advantage of 3% and 10%, respectively, for dry matter production and crude protein production. Heavy defoliation (50 mm) increased the partial LER value of the grass component and consequently the combined LER. A grass seeding rate of 10-20 kg ha -1 ensured a well-balanced mixture.

The influence of different intensities of defoliation on the root growth of the species was also looked at. It was found that even a lenient defoliation treatment (120mm height), effected root growth negatively, but that root growth was only stopped completely at the most severe (40mm) height treatment. The influence of different combinations of intensity and frequency of defoliation on production and quality of the grass, was also studied. It was found that frequency of defoliation has the greatest effect on production and quality. Production was increased but quality decreased when defoliation was delayed for nine weeks. The six-weekly defoliation gave the highest production of crude protein and a high production of digestible organic matter.
