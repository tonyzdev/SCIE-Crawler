    "abstract": "This review summarises the evidence that chronic low grade inflammation triggers changes that contribute to the mental and physical ill health of patients with major depression. Inflammation, and the activation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis by stress, are normal components of the stress response but when stress is prolonged and the endocrine and immune system become chronic resulting in the activation of the peripheral macrophages, the central microglia and hypercortisolemia, the neuronal networks are damaged and become dysfunctional. The proinflammatory cytokines, in addition to activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and thereby increasing cortisol synthesis, also activate the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway. This results in the synthesis of the neurotoxic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate agonist quinolinic acid and 3-hydroxykynurenine thereby enhancing oxidative stress and contributes to neurodegeneration which characterise major depression particularly in late life.While antidepressants attenuate some of the endocrine and immune changes caused by inflammation, not all therapeutically effective antidepressants do so. This suggests that drugs which specifically target the immune, endocrine and neurotransmitter systems may be more effective antidepressants.The preliminary clinical evidence that some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib, can enhance the response to standard antidepressant treatment is therefore considered and a critical assessment made of the possible limitations of such an approach to novel antidepressant development.",

These measures consisted of the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scales, Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS), the Mental Health Questionnaire (MHQ-14) and DASS-21. The results of these measures were compared.Of 786 admissions in total, the number of fully completed (ie paired admission and discharge) data sets for the DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress subscales were 337, 328 and 347, respectively. All subscales showed statistically significant reductions in mean scores from admission to discharge (P < 0.001) and were significantly correlated with all MHQ-14 subscales and significantly related to CGI scale categories. The total DASS-21 and total HoNOS scores were also significantly correlated.The findings from the present study support the validity of DASS-21 as a routine clinical outcome measure in the private in-patient setting.",

GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs (i.e. exenatide, geniposide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, and semaglutide), increased neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and the medial striatum in animal models. Additionally, GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs were associated with modulating changes in multiple apoptotic pathways and upregulating survival pathways. GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs are positively associated with neurogenesis. This effect may have translational implications insofar as disparate mental disorders that are characterized by neurogenesis defects (e.g. depressive disorders and neurocognitive disorders) may be benefitted by these agents.",

Electroencephalography research suggests increased alpha, theta and beta activity in frontal and posterior regions, some gamma band effects, with theta activity strongly related to level of experience of meditation; however, these findings have not been consistent. The few neuroimaging studies that have been conducted suggest volumetric and functional change in key brain regions.Preliminary findings from treatment outcome studies provide support for the application of mindfulness-based interventions in the treatment of affective, anxiety and personality disorders. However, direct evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation per se in the treatment of psychiatric disorders is needed.

Method A literature search was conducted through the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. Combinations of the following search terms and keywords were used to identify relevant studies: ‘alcohol’, ‘fetal alcohol spectrum disorders’, ‘fetal alcohol syndrome’, ‘FAS’, ‘FASD’, ‘MRI’, ‘DTI’, ‘MRS’, ‘neuroimaging’, ‘children’ and ‘infants’. Results A total of 64 relevant articles were identified across all modalities. Overall, studies reported smaller total brain volume as well as smaller volume of both the white and grey matter in specific cortical regions. The most consistently reported structural MRI findings were alterations in the shape and volume of the corpus callosum, as well as smaller volume in the basal ganglia and hippocampi. The most consistent finding from diffusion tensor imaging studies was lower fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies are few to date, but showed altered neurometabolic profiles in the frontal and parietal cortex, thalamus and dentate nuclei. Resting-state functional MRI studies reported reduced functional connectivity between cortical and deep grey matter structures. Discussion There is a critical gap in the literature of MRI studies in alcohol-exposed children under 5 years of age across all MRI modalities. The dynamic nature of brain maturation and appreciation of the effects of alcohol exposure on the developing trajectory of the structural and functional network argue for the prioritisation of studies that include a longitudinal approach to understanding this spectrum of effects and potential therapeutic time points.",

There is a growing consensus that IBD is associated with anxiety- and depression-related symptoms. Psychological symptoms appear to be more prevalent during active disease states with no difference in prevalence between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Behavioural disturbances including anxiety- and depression-like symptoms have also been observed in animal models of IBD. Results The likely mechanisms underlying the association are discussed with particular reference to communication between the gut and brain. The close bidirectional relationship known as the gut–brain axis includes neural, hormonal and immune communication links. Evidence is provided for a number of interacting factors including activation of the inflammatory response system in the brain, the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, and brain areas implicated in altered behaviours, changes in blood brain barrier integrity, and an emerging role for gut microbiota and response to probiotics in IBD. Discussion The impact of psychological stress in models of IBD remains somewhat conflicted, however, it is weighted in favour of stress or early stressful life events as risk factors in the development of IBD, stress-induced exacerbation of inflammation and relapse. Conclusion It is recommended that patients with IBD be screened for psychological disturbance and treated accordingly as intervention can improve quality of life and may reduce relapse rates.",

Background: Cognitive impairment is the most consistent neurological complication of acquired and degenerative brain disorders. Historically, most focus was on dementia but now has been broadened to include the important construct of mild cognitive impairment. Methods: Systematic search and review of articles linked quality of life (QoL) and cognitive complications of neurological disorders. We excluded QoL in dementia. Results: Our search identified 249 publications. Most research examined patients with brain tumours, stroke, epilepsy, head injury, Huntington's disease, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Results suggested that the majority of patients with epilepsy, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke and head injury have subtle cognitive deficits early in their disease course. These cognitive complaints are often overlooked by clinicians. In many cases, the cognitive impairment is progressive but it can also be relapsing-remitting and in some cases reversible. Despite the importance of severe cognitive impairment in the form of dementia, there is now increasing recognition of a broad spectrum of impairment, including those with subclinical or mild cognitive impairment. Even mild cognitive difficulties can have functional and psychiatric consequences–especially when they are persistent and untreated. Specific cognitive deficits such an inattention, dysexecutive function and processing speed may affect a number of quality of life (QoL) domains. For example, cognitive impairment influences return to work, interpersonal relationships and leisure activities. In addition, fear of future cognitive decline may also impact upon QoL. Conclusions: We recommend further development of simple tools to screen for cognitive impairments in each neurological condition. We also recommend that a thorough cognitive assessment should be a part of routine clinical practice in those caring for individuals with neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "Objective Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease characterised with seizures. The aetiology of the most generalised epilepsies cannot be explicitly determined and the seizures are pronounced to be genetically determined by disturbances of receptors in central nervous system. Besides, neurotransmitter distributions or other metabolic problems are supposed to involve in epileptogenesis. Lack of adequate data about pharmacological agents that have antiepileptogenic effects point to need of research on this field. Thus, in this review, inflammatory aspects of epileptogenesis has been focussed via considering several concepts like role of immune system, blood–brain barrier and antibody involvement in epileptogenesis. Methods We conducted an evidence-based review of the literatures in order to evaluate the possible participation of inflammatory processes to epileptogenesis and also, promising agents which are effective to these processes. We searched PubMed database up to November 2015 with no date restrictions. Results In the present review, 163 appropriate articles were included. Obtained data suggests that inflammatory processes participate to epileptogenesis in several ways like affecting fibroblast growth factor-2 and tropomyosin receptor kinase B signalling pathways, detrimental proinflammatory pathways [such as the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)–interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) system], mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, microglial activities, release of glial inflammatory proteins (such as macrophage inflammatory protein, interleukin 6, C–C motif ligand 2 and IL-1β), adhesion molecules that are suggested to function in signalling pathways between neurons and microglia and also linkage between these molecules and proinflammatory cytokines. Conclusion The literature research indicated that inflammation is a part of epileptogenesis. For this reason, further studies are necessary for assessing agents that will be effective in clinical use for therapeutic treatment of epileptogenesis.",

Our objective was to increase our understanding of the role of brain lipids in pathophysiology of aging and age-related cognitive impairment. Methods Levels of 650 individual lipids, across 26 lipid subclasses, were measured utilising a high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis platform. Results Monoacylglycerols (MAG), diacylglycerols (DAG), and the very-long-chain fatty acid 26:0 were elevated in the grey matter of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and old dementia (OD) cohorts. Ethanolamine plasmalogens (PlsEtn) were decreased in the grey matter of the young dementia (YD) and OD cohorts while and phosphatidylethanolamines (PtdEth) were lower in the MCI, YD and OD cohorts. In the white matter, decrements in sulphatide levels were detected in the YD group, DAG levels were elevated in the MCI group, and MAG levels were increased in the YD and OD groups. Conclusion The parallel changes in grey matter MAGs and DAGs in the MCI and OD groups suggest that these two cohorts may have a similar underlying pathophysiology; consistent with this, MCI subjects were more similar in age to OD than to YD subjects. While PlsEtn and phosphatidylethanolamine were decreased in the YD and OD groups they were unaltered in the MCI group indicating that alterations in plasmalogen synthesis are unlikely to represent an initiating event in the transition from MCI to dementia.",

Thousand four-hundred and eighty-five studies were identified, but only 39 were included for qualitative analysis and 27 for quantitative analysis. Overall, we found that ADHD persisted into adulthood with a mean rate of 43% and was mainly associated with both substance/alcohol use disorders and antisocial behavior and, less frequently, with anxiety and depressive disorders. The prevalence of persistent ADHD in adulthood reported by studies published after 2011 (55%) was higher than that reported by studies published previously from 1985 to 2011 (34%), suggesting a greater focus on ADHD in recent years.

Recently, the observation of the antidepressant effects of ketamine brought on a new wave of studies regarding the comprehension of the neurobiology of depression and the development of new and more effective antidepressant drugs. Methods: Thus, in this paper, we present a historical review of the development of monoaminergic antidepressant drugs and the role of ketamine as the introductory agent of a new era in the research of the neurobiology of depression. Results: Firstly, we review how the pharmacological treatment for major depression started, and we point out the main drugs discovered, the researchers involved, and how the studies developed have contributed to the understanding of the neurobiology of depression. Secondly, the major problems regarding the clinical efficacy and acceptance of these drugs are discussed, and the introduction of the glutamatergic system as a target for antidepressant drugs is presented. Finally, we review how ketamine revealed itself as an exciting option towards obtaining pharmacological agents to treat depression, through the understanding of biological markers. Discussion: Ketamine contributed to confirm that different targets of the glutamatergic system and neurotrophic pathways are strictly related to the neurobiology of depression. There are several antidepressant drugs based on ketamine's mechanism of action already in the pipeline, and glutamatergic-targeted antidepressants may be on the market in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was initially used for the treatment of schizophrenia, but over the years with the advent of antipsychotics, its use in schizophrenia has been limited. Treatment guidelines vary in their recommendations for the use of ECT in schizophrenia. The usual indications of its use among patients with schizophrenia include treatment resistance, to augment pharmacotherapy, to manage catatonia, suicidal behaviour, severe agitation and clozapine-resistant schizophrenia. Available literature, including meta-analysis and systematic reviews, suggest that ECT is a safe and effective treatment in patients with schizophrenia. However, despite the available evidence, it is highly underutilised and is often used as one of the last resort among patients with schizophrenia. This review focuses on the indications of use of ECT in schizophrenia, studies evaluating its effectiveness, efficacy in certain special situations like first episode schizophrenia, adolescents, catatonia etc., predictors of response to ECT in schizophrenia and influence of various ECT-related parameters on efficacy/effectiveness among patients with schizophrenia. From the review, it can be concluded that ECT is not only is beneficial as an augmenting strategy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia but also can be used effectively in patients with schizophrenia in various other situations.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gut microbiota (GM) has previously been associated with alterations in rodent behaviour, and since the GM is affected by the diet, the composition of the diet may be an important factor contributing to behavioural changes. Interestingly, a magnesium restricted diet has been shown to induce anxiety and depressive-like behaviour in humans and rodents, and it could be suggested that magnesium deficiency may mediate the effects through an altered GM. METHODS: The present study therefore fed C57BL/6 mice with a standard diet or a magnesium deficient diet (MgD) for 6 weeks, followed by behavioural testing in the forced swim test (FST) to evaluate depressive-like behaviour. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed 2 day after the FST to assess metabolic alterations. Neuroinflammatory markers were analysed from hippocampus. GM composition was analysed and correlated to the behaviour and hippocampal markers. RESULTS: It was found that mice exposed to MgD for 6 weeks were more immobile than control mice in the FST, suggesting an increased depressive-like behaviour. No significant difference was detected in the GTT. GM composition correlated positively with the behaviour of undisturbed C57BL/6 mice, feeding MgD diet altered the microbial composition. The altered GM correlated positively to the hippocampal interleukin-6. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we hypothesise that imbalances of the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced by consuming a MgD diet, contributes to the development of depressive-like behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Chronic low-grade inflammation has been observed in major depression and other major psychiatric disorders and has been implicated in metabolic changes that are commonly associated with these disorders. This raises the possibility that the effects of dysfunctional metabolism may facilitate changes in neuronal structure and function which contribute to neuroprogression. Such changes may have implications for the progress from major depression to dementia in the elderly patient. The purpose of this review is to examine the contribution of inflammation and hypercortisolaemia, which are frequently associated with major depression, to neurodegeneration and how they detrimentally impact on brain energy metabolism. A key factor in these adverse events is insulin insensitivity caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines in association with desensitised glucocorticoid receptors. Identifying the possible metabolic changes initiated by inflammation opens new targets to ameliorate the adverse metabolic changes. This has resulted in the identification of dietary and drug targets which are of interest in the development of a new generation of psychotropic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Long COVID refers to the lingering symptoms which persist or appear after the acute illness. The dominant long COVID symptoms in the two years since the pandemic began (2020-2021) have been depression, anxiety, fatigue, concentration and cognitive impairments with few reports of psychosis. Whether other symptoms will appear later on is not yet known. For example, dopamine-dependent movement disorders generally take many years before first symptoms are seen. Post-stroke depression and anxiety may explain many of the early long COVID cases. Hemorrhagic, hypoxic and inflammatory damages of the central nervous system, unresolved systematic inflammation, metabolic impairment, cerebral vascular accidents such as stroke, hypoxia from pulmonary damages and fibrotic changes are among the major causes of long COVID. Glucose metabolic and hypoxic brain issues likely predispose subjects with pre-existing diabetes, cardiovascular or lung problems to long COVID as well. Preliminary data suggest that psychotropic medications may not be a danger but could instead be beneficial in combating COVID-19 infection. The same is true for diabetes medications such as metformin. Thus, a focus on sigma-1 receptor ligands and glucose metabolism is expected to be useful for new drug development as well as the repurposing of current drugs. The reported protective effects of psychotropics and antihistamines against COVID-19, the earlier reports of reduced number of sigma-1 receptors in post-mortem schizophrenic brains, with many antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs being antihistamines with significant affinity for the sigma-1 receptor, support the role of sigma and histamine receptors in neuroinflammation and viral infections. Literature and data in all these areas are accumulating at a fast rate. We reviewed and discussed the relevant and important literature.",

    "abstract": "The first publication demonstrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with alterations in the gut microbiota appeared in 2008 (Maes et al., 2008). The purpose of the present study is to delineate a) the microbiome signature of the phenome of depression, including suicidal behaviours (SB) and cognitive deficits; the effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and recurrence of illness index (ROI) on the microbiome; and the microbiome signature of lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc). We determined isometric log-ratio abundances or prevalences of gut microbiome phyla, genera, and species by analysing stool samples from 37 healthy Thai controls and 32 MDD patients using 16S rDNA sequencing. Six microbiome taxa accounted for 36% of the variance in the depression phenome, namely Hungatella and Fusicatenibacter (positive associations) and Butyricicoccus, Clostridium, Parabacteroides merdae, and Desulfovibrio piger (inverse association). This profile (labelled enterotype 1) indicates compositional dysbiosis, is strongly predicted by ACE and ROI, and is linked to SB. A second enterotype was developed that predicted a decrease in HDLc and an increase in the atherogenic index of plasma (Bifidobacterium, P. merdae, and Romboutsia were positively associated, while Proteobacteria and Clostridium sensu stricto were negatively associated). Together, enterotypes 1 and 2 explained 40.4% of the variance in the depression phenome, and enterotype 1 in conjunction with HDLc explained 39.9% of the variance in current SB. In conclusion, the microimmuneoxysome is a potential new drug target for the treatment of severe depression and SB and possibly for the prevention of future episodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Chronic stress responses can lead to physical and behavioural health problems, often experienced and observed in the care of people with intellectual disabilities or people with dementia. Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a bio-signal for stress, which can be measured by wearables and thereby support stress management. However, the how, when and to what extent patients and healthcare providers can benefit is unclear. This study aims to create an overview of available wearables enabling the detection of perceived stress by using EDA. Methods: Following the PRISMA-SCR protocol for scoping reviews, four databases were included in the search of peer-reviewed studies published between 2012 and 2022, reporting detection of EDA in relation to self-reported stress or stress-related behaviours. Type of wearable, bodily location, research population, context, stressor type and the reported relationship between EDA and perceived stress were extracted. Results: Of the 74 included studies, the majority included healthy subjects in laboratory situations. Field studies and studies using machine learning (ML) to predict stress have increased in the last years. EDA is most often measured on the wrist, with offline data processing. Studies predicting perceived stress or stress-related behaviour using EDA features, reported accuracies between 42% and 100% with an average of 82.6%. Of these studies, the majority used ML. Conclusion: Wearable EDA sensors are promising in detecting perceived stress. Field studies with relevant populations in a health or care context are lacking. Future studies should focus on the application of EDA-measuring wearables in real-life situations to support stress management.",

Due to the prominent role of language in psychiatry, e.g., for diagnostic assessment and psychotherapy, these tools may be particularly useful within this medical field. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on generative AI applications in psychiatry and mental health. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search was conducted across three databases, and the resulting articles were screened independently by two researchers. The content, themes, and findings of the articles were qualitatively assessed. RESULTS: The search and screening process resulted in the inclusion of 40 studies. The median year of publication was 2023. The themes covered in the articles were mainly mental health and well-being in general - with less emphasis on specific mental disorders (substance use disorder being the most prevalent). The majority of studies were conducted as prompt experiments, with the remaining studies comprising surveys, pilot studies, and case reports. Most studies focused on models that generate language, ChatGPT in particular. CONCLUSIONS: Generative AI in psychiatry and mental health is a nascent but quickly expanding field. The literature mainly focuses on applications of ChatGPT, and finds that generative AI performs well, but notes that it is limited by significant safety and ethical concerns. Future research should strive to enhance transparency of methods, use experimental designs, ensure clinical relevance, and involve users/patients in the design phase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Extant literature implicates the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on modulating alcohol-associated behaviors, with a particular emphasis of these agents on neural circuits subserving reward and appetite control. Herein, we explore the potential effects of GLP-1RAs on alcohol-associated behaviors in brain regions implicated in reward processing facilitating the repurposing of these agents for the treatment and prevention of problematic drinking. Understanding how GLP-1's analogs interact with alcohol-related behaviors may underscore the development of therapeutic strategies for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and those with comorbid metabolic disorders. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, wherein relevant literature was identified through Web of Science, PubMed, and OVID (MedLINE, Embase, AMED, PsycInfo, JBI EBP) from database inception to October 27th, 2024. Preclinical and clinical studies examining the association between GLP-1RAs and alcohol-related behaviors were assessed. Results: Preclinical studies (n = 19) indicate that GLP-1RAs attenuate alcohol-related behaviors, with exenatide demonstrating significant dose-dependent effects in high alcohol-consuming phenotypes. Semaglutide and liraglutide are associated with reduced alcohol intake, though their effects were often transient. In human studies (n = 2) with AUD, semaglutide significantly reduced alcohol consumption, while exenatide showed mixed results, with reductions in alcohol drinking within high BMI subpopulations. Discussion: Extant preclinical and clinical literature provides preliminary support for the potential therapeutic role of GLP-1RAs in attenuating alcohol consumption and preference. There is a need for large well controlled studies evaluating the effect of GLP-1RAs as a treatment strategy for behavioral modifications in individuals living with alcohol use disorder.",

However, there are different opinions about the exact number of hand-preference categories and criteria that should be used for their classification. Objectives: This study examined hand-preference categories using the latent class analysis (LCA) and validated them against two external criteria (i.e. hand demonstration test and a series of arbitrary cut-off points). Method: The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was applied to 354 individuals randomly selected from the general population, and the obtained data were analysed using the LatentGOLD software. Results: Three discrete hand-preference clusters were identified, i.e. left-, right- and mixed-handed category. Further subdivision of hand-preference clusters resulted in a non-parsimonious subcategorization of individuals. There was a good agreement between the LCA-based classification and classification based on hand-preference demonstration tests. The highest agreement between the LCA model and the different types of arbitrary classification criteria ranged between 0 ± 50 and 0 ± 70 of the laterality quotient. Conclusions: The study findings supported the view that handedness is not a bimodal phenomenon. However, definitions and subcategorizations of mixed-handedness using the cut-off points that are outside of the recommended range may lead to misclassification of cases. It is hoped that the categorization and validation of handedness developed in the context of this study will make future research in this area less dependent on arbitrary values and criteria.",

Has number of previous episodes any effect on response to group psychoeducation in bipolar patients? A 5-year follow-up post hoc analysis.One of the main utilities of staging in bipolar disorder is enhancing the formulation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies. Hence, it is essential to ascertain whether the number of previous episodes influences treatment response. Hereby, we present a 5-year post hoc study on the efficacy of group psychoeducation for bipolar disorders according to the number of previous episodes.For this subanalysis, we have compared the 5-year outcome of 120 euthymic psychoeducated versus non-psychoeducated bipolar patients according to the number of previous episodes at study entry.Patients with more than seven episodes at study entry did not show any significant improvement with psychoeducation according to time to recurrence. Patients with more than 14 episodes did not benefit from psychoeducation in terms of a reduction of time spent ill. Patients with 7 or 8 episodes showed a benefit in terms of fewer days spent in hypomania, depression, mixed episodes or any episodes but not mania, while patients with 9-14 episodes showed a benefit in terms of fewer days spent in hypomania and depression but not in mixed states or mania. Only patients who presented up to 6 episodes showed reduction in time spent in any episode polarity.The number of previous episodes clearly worsens response to psychoeducation, perhaps in a more subtle way than that observed with other psychological therapies. Psychoeducation should be delivered as soon as possible in the illness course, supporting the idea of early intervention.",

    "abstract": "Impaired social functioning and autistic symptoms are characteristics of schizophrenia. The social hormones oxytocin (OT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) both modulate social interaction and therefore may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We investigated whether men with schizophrenia show altered OT and AVP levels compared with healthy controls (HC) and whether autism symptoms are associated with OT levels.Forty-one men with non-acute schizophrenia and 45 matched HC were enrolled. Schizophrenia was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Blood samples were collected on 2 days, and plasma OT and AVP levels were measured by ELISA immunoassay.The schizophrenia patients had significantly lower plasma OT levels than the HC; a similar trend was found for AVP. Plasma OT levels were associated with severe life events, fewer important attached persons, and a higher score on the PANSS negative scale; the most dominant PANSS items were 'preoccupation', 'emotional withdrawal', and 'passive/apathetic social withdrawal'.These findings support an association between the social hormones OT and AVP and schizophrenia. We suggest that OT metabolism may be altered in schizophrenia, but other possible causes for decreased plasma OT levels in schizophrenia patients include decreased OT synthesis, mRNA expression, and translation. Especially the 'autistic' symptoms of schizophrenia seem to be closely linked to an altered metabolism of OT, the 'attachment' hormone.",

Administration of cannabidiol and imipramine induces antidepressant-like effects in the forced swimming test and increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the rat amygdala. Objective: Cannabidiol is a chemical constituent from Cannabis sativa and it has multiple mechanisms of action, including antidepressant effects. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate behavioural and molecular effects induced by administration of cannabidiol and imipramine in rats. Methods: In the present study, rats were acutely or chronically treated for 14 days once a day with saline, cannabidiol (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg) or imipramine (30 mg/kg) and the animals behaviour was assessed in forced swimming and open-field tests. Afterwards, the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent sandwich assay. Results: We observed that both acute and chronic treatments with imipramine at the dose of 30 mg/kg and cannabidiol at the dose of 30 mg/kg reduced immobility time and increased swimming time; climbing time was increased only with imipramine at the dose of 30 mg/kg, without affecting locomotor activity. In addition, chronic treatment with cannabidiol at the dose of 15 mg/kg and imipramine at the dose of 30 mg/kg increased BDNF levels in the rat amygdala. Conclusion: In conclusion, our results indicate that cannabidiol has an antidepressant-like profile and could be a new pharmacological target for the treatment of major depression.",

Results HAMD-21 score was reduced after l -theanine administration ( p =0.007). This reduction was observed in unremitted patients (HAMD-21&gt;7; p =0.004) at baseline. Anxiety-trait scores decreased after l -theanine administration ( p =0.012) in the STAI test.

Thus, we decided to include studies that were not only randomised-controlled trials. In total, we ended up with 18 articles for our purposes. RESULTS: The combination of depression and DM may be harmful as depression has a strong impact on psychosocial and medical outcomes in patients with DM. Almost all of the trials in this review showed a reduction in depressive symptoms after treatment with an antidepressant in the acute as well as during maintenance phase. It showed that depression improvement had a favourable effect on glycaemic control that was weight independent. Some studies included only subjects with minor depression or with suboptimal-controlled diabetes making it difficult to show an effect. CONCLUSION: From these data, we will recommend choosing an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) if possible to treat a depression among patients with diabetes. If treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant is needed, closer glycaemic monitoring is recommended. Bear in mind that there is a possible risk of hypoglycemia when using SSRIs. Agomelatine and bupropion have shown promising results, but need to be investigated in more trials.",

    "abstract": "Taking the evolutionary development of the forebrain as a starting point, the authors developed a biological framework for the subcortical regulation of human emotional behaviour which may offer an explanation for the pathogenesis of the principle symptoms of mental disorders. Appetitive-searching (reward-seeking) and distress-avoiding (misery-fleeing) behaviour are essential for all free-moving animals to stay alive and to have offspring. Even the oldest ocean-dwelling animal creatures, living about 560 million years ago and human ancestors, must therefore have been capable of generating these behaviours. Our earliest vertebrate ancestors, with a brain comparable with the modern lamprey, had a sophisticated extrapyramidal system generating and controlling all motions as well as a circuit including the habenula for the evaluation of the benefits of their actions. Almost the complete endbrain of the first land animals with a brain comparable with that of amphibians became assimilated into the human amygdaloid and hippocampal complex, whereas only a small part of the dorsal pallium and striatum developed into the ventral extrapyramidal circuits and the later insular cortex. The entire neocortex covering the hemispheres is of recent evolutionary origin, appearing first in early mammals. During the entire evolution of vertebrates, the habenular system was well conserved and maintained its function in regulating the intensity of reward-seeking (pleasure-related) and misery-fleeing (happiness-related) behaviour. The authors propose that the same is true in humans. Symptomatology of human mental disorders can be considered to result from maladaptation within a similar amygdalo/hippocampal–habenular–mesencephalic–ventral striatal system.",

The exact mechanism of DBS remains unclear which causes side effects. The aim of this review was to assess variables causing stimulation-induced chronic psychiatric/personality-changing side effects.The analysis of scientific database (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE) was conducted. The included articles had to be research study or case report and DBS to be conducted in therapeutic purposes. The researches with mental disorders in patients' medical histories were excluded.Seventeen articles were used in the review. In the group of movement disorders the characteristic of side effects was strongly related to the placement of the electrode implantation. Tiredness/fatigue was correlated with DBS in thalamus. Implantations in subthalamic nucleus were mostly followed by affective side effects such as depression or suicide. The higher voltage of electrode was connected with more severe depression after implantation. The analysis of affective disorder contained only three articles - two about OCD and one about depression. Forgetfulness and word-finding problems as activities connected with cognition may be an inevitable side effect if obsessive thoughts are to be inhibited.DBS of subthalamic nucleus should be seen as the most hazardous place of implantation. As a result there is a strong need of 'gold standards' based on the connectivity research and closer cooperation of scientists and clinicians.",

We investigated whether the administration of psilocybin had an antidepressant-like effect in a rat model of depression. Methods: Using the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat model of depression, we assessed the antidepressant-like effect of psilocin and psilocybin, measured as a reduction in immobility time in the forced swim test (FST). We measured locomotor activity in an open field test (OFT) to control for stimulant properties of the drugs. We performed a set of experiments to test different doses, treatment paradigms, and timing of the tests in relation to the drug administration. Results: Psilocin and psilocybin showed no effect on immobility, struggling, or swimming behaviour in the FST and no effect on locomotor activity in the OFT. FSL rats did show significantly more immobility than their control strain, the Flinders Resistant Line, as expected. Conclusion: Psilocin and psilocybin showed no antidepressant-like effect in the FSL rats, despite a positive effect in humans. This suggests that other animal models of depression and other behavioural tests may be more appropriate for translational studies in the effects of psilocybin.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Patients with mental illness are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality, and prioritisation of this group for COVID-19 vaccination programmes has therefore been suggested. Vaccine uptake may, however, be compromised by vaccine hesitancy amongst patients with mental illness, posing a critical public health issue. We conducted two surveys to provide weighted estimates of vaccine willingness amongst patients with mental illness and the general population of Denmark. Vaccine willingness was high in both groups, but slightly lower amongst patients with mental illness (84.8%), compared with the general population (89.5%) ( p &lt; .001). Based on these findings, vaccine hesitancy does not appear to be a major barrier for vaccine uptake amongst patients with mental illness in Denmark, but may be so in other countries with lower general vaccine willingness. Replication of the present study in other countries is strongly warranted.",

The exact pathophysiology of the affective, chronic fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms (labelled as \"physio-affective phenome\") of LC has remained elusive.The current study aims to delineate the effects of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and body temperature during the acute phase on the physio-affective phenome of LC.We recruited 120 LC patients and 36 controls. For all participants, we assessed the lowest SpO2 and peak body temperature during acute COVID-19, and the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMD/HAMA) and Fibro Fatigue (FF) scales 3-4 months later.Lowered SpO2 and increased body temperature during the acute phase and female sex predict 60.7% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of LC. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we were able to delineate a new endophenotype class, which comprises around 26.7% of the LC patients and is characterised by very low SpO2 and very high body temperature, and depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms scores. Single latent vectors could be extracted from both biomarkers, depression, anxiety and FF symptoms or from both biomarkers, insomnia, chronic fatigue, gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms.The newly constructed endophenotype class and pathway phenotypes indicate that the physio-affective phenome of LC is at least in part the consequence of the pathophysiology of acute COVID-19, namely the combined effects of lowered SpO2, increased body temperature and the associated immune-inflammatory processes and lung lesions.",

By choosing the evolutionary development of the forebrain as a starting point, a certain order in the connections can be created. The dorsal diencephalic connection (DDC) system can be applied for the development of biomarkers that can predict treatment response.After providing a brief introduction to the theory, we examined neuroanatomical publications on the connectivity of the DDC system. We then searched for neurochemical components that are specific for the habenula.The best strategy to find biomarkers that reflect the function of the habenular connection is to use genetic variants of receptors, transporters or enzymes specific to this complex. By activating these with probes and measuring the response in people with different functional genotypes, the usefulness of biomarkers can be assessed.The most promising biomarkers in this respect are those linked to activation or inhibition of the nicotine receptor, dopamine D4 receptor, μ-opioid receptor and also those of the functioning of habenular glia cells (astrocytes and microglia).",

In trials, psychiatric rating scale scores employed as outcome variables are invalid and rely on folk psychology-like narratives. Using machine learning techniques, we developed a new precision nomothetic model of mood disorders with a recurrence of illness (ROI) index, a new endophenotype class, namely Major Dysmood Disorder (MDMD), characterised by increased ROI, a more severe phenome, and more disabilities. Nonetheless, our previous studies did not compute Research and Diagnostic Algorithmic Rules (RADAR) to diagnose MDMD and score ROI, lifetime (LT), and current suicidal behaviours, as well as the phenome of mood disorders. Here, we provide rules to compute bottom-up RADAR scores for MDMD, ROI, LT and current suicidal ideation and attempts, the phenome of mood disorders, and the lifetime trajectory of mood disorder patients from a family history of mood disorders and substance abuse to adverse childhood experiences, ROI, and the phenome. We also demonstrate how to plot the 12 major scores in a single RADAR graph, which displays all features in a two-dimensional plot. These graphs allow the characteristics of a patient to be displayed as an idiomatic fingerprint, allowing one to estimate the key traits and severity of the illness at a glance. Consequently, biomarker research into mood disorders should use our RADAR scores to examine pan-omics data, which should be used to enlarge our precision models and RADAR graph.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Administration of antidepressant drugs – principally selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) – may induce clinically significant ‘apathy’ which can affect treatment outcomes adversely. We aimed to review all relevant previous reports. Methods: We performed a PUBMED search of English-language studies, combining terms concerning psychopathology (e.g. apathy) and classes of antidepressants (e.g. SSRI). Results: According to certain inclusion (e.g. use of DSM/ICD diagnostic criteria) and exclusion (e.g. presence of a clinical condition that may induce apathy) criteria, 50 articles were eligible for review. Together, they suggest that administration of antidepressants – usually SSRIs – can induce an apathy syndrome or emotional blunting, i.e. a decrease in emotional responsiveness, to circumstances which would have triggered intense mood reactions prior to pharmacotherapy. The reported prevalence of antidepressant-induced apathy ranges between 5.8 and 50%, and for SSRIs ranges between 20 and 92%. Antidepressant-induced apathy emerges independently of diagnosis, age, and treatment outcome and appears dose-dependent and reversible. The main treatment strategy is dose reduction, though some data suggest the usefulness of treatment with olanzapine, bupropion, agomelatine or amisulpride, or the methylphenidate–modafinil–olanzapine combination. Conclusion: Antidepressant-induced apathy needs careful clinical attention. Further systematic research is needed to investigate the prevalence, course, aetiology, and treatment of this important clinical condition.",

    "abstract": "Background: The United Nations, WHO and the World Bank have called the current prevalence rate of neuro-psychiatric disorder approaches of 1 in 4 individuals worldwide and ‘unheralded public health crisis’. Rates are driven by an early onset, high impairment and high chronicity of these disorders. Most importantly, detection and treatment rates are low, estimated at les than 10% worldwide resulting in 500 million people underserved. The related economic costs soared in 1999 to 120 billion dollars in Europe and North America, with over 60 billion dollars assigned to stress related disorders. Contributing factors are bio-psycho-social and include rapid social change as well as the time compression of modern life resulting in the experience of increased work-life stress that parallels a decade long intensification of activities in the workplace. Coping with the requirements of the new economy of mental performance has lagged behind at many individual and social levels as we cling to adjustments made during the industrial economy of the last century. A climate of transition, and more recently, terror and fear have stressed the landscape of mental health and work already ravaged by the destructive forces of stigma. Aim: This presentation will examine the other side of prosperity from the point of view of stress in the workplace as two global problems converge at this time in history, the escalation of neuro-psychiatric disorders and the increasing dependence on the mental faculties of the world's citizens. In this paper we also discuss how the international community can work together to help reduce the burden of mental disorders worldwide and sketch the implications for research and policy. Conclusions: Ultimately the media will need to be enlisted to educate the public on the value of investments in mental health.",

The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of articles that assess the HPA axis activity from GR and MR in depressed patients and healthy controls with or without early life stress. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and SciELO published between 2000 and 2011, using the following search terms: child abuse , depression , HPA axis , dexamethasone , prednisolone , fludrocortisone and spironolactone . Thirty-four papers were selected for this review. Results: Most studies identified in this review used the dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing hormone test and dexamethasone suppression test. In these studies, hypercortisolaemia was associated with depression. We identified three studies with the Prednisolone suppression test, only one study with the use of fludrocortisone and one with spironolactone. This review found nine studies that evaluated the HPA axis in individuals with early life stress. Conclusions: The majority of the studies assessed in this review show that early life stress leads to permanent changes in the HPA axis and may lead to development of depression in adults. The most consistent findings in the literature show increased activity of the HPA axis in depression associated with hypercortisolaemia and reduced inhibitory feedback. These findings suggest that this dysregulation of the HPA axis is partially attributable to an imbalance between GR and MR. Evidences have consistently showed that GR function is impaired in major depression, but few studies have assessed the activity of MR in depression and early life stress.",

It constitutes a major risk factor for a range of medical and psychiatric problems, including chronic pain, somatisation, anxiety and depression. Alexithymia is a multi-faceted concept, described in terms of cognitive and affective aspects. From a neuropsychological perspective, alexithymia can be defined as a disturbance in affective information processing and social cognition. As the growing literature on brain structures involved in alexithymia is fragmented and sometimes even contradictory, the aim of this article was to review findings on neural substrates with regard to their convergence.A narrative review was performed, including both early neuropsychological and more recent imaging studies, in order to achieve a better understanding of the aetiology of alexithymia.Corpus callosum, cingulate cortex and insula are clearly involved in alexithymia. The amygdala and the orbitofrontal part of the cortex appear to be implicated as mediators, because of their broader involvement in emotional processing and executive control.Notwithstanding the diffuse neural representation, the alexithymia construct can be usefully applied in the clinical and empirical studies of social cognition, particularly when adopting a dimensional neuropsychological approach.",

N2 amplitudes of no-go conditions were lower than those at control group.Individuals with PIU were more impulsive than controls and shared neuropsychological and ERPs characteristics of compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder, which supports that PIU is an impulse disorder or at least related to impulse control disorder.",

The AD patients then underwent follow-up assessments at 6 and 12 months.Cross-sectional comparisons indicated that mild-moderate AD patients produced more word-finding delays (WFDs) and empty and indefinite phrases, while producing fewer pictorial themes, repairing fewer errors, responding to fewer WFDs, produce shorter and less complex phrases and produce speech with less intonational contour than controls. However, the two groups could not be distinguished on the basis of phonological paraphasias. Longitudinal follow-up, however, suggested that phonological processing deteriorates over time, where the prevalence of phonological errors increased over 12 months. Discussion Consistent with findings from neuropsychological, neuropathological and neuroimaging studies, the language deterioration shown by the AD patients shows a pattern of impairment dominated by semantic errors, which is later joined by a disruption in the phonological aspects of speech.",

Therefore, the aim of the present work was to further investigate the potential antidepressant-like effect induced by DNMTi by evaluating the behavioural effects induced by associating DNMTi treatment with conventional antidepressant drugs in mice submitted to the forced swimming test (FST). In addition, brain levels of DNA methylation were also investigated. Methods Mice received systemic injections of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzaD, 0.1, 0.2 mg/kg), RG108 (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg/kg), desipramine (DES, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (FLX, 5, 10, 20, 30 mg/kg) and were submitted to the FST or to the open field test (OFT). Additional groups received a combination of subeffective doses of 5-AzaD or RG108 (DNMTi) with subeffective doses of DES or FLX (antidepressants). Results Subeffective doses of RG108 (0.1 mg/kg) or 5-AzaD (0.1mg/kg) in association with subeffective doses of DES (2.5 mg/kg) or FLX (10 mg/kg) induced significant antidepressant-like effects. Effective doses of RG108 (0.2 mg/kg), 5-AzaD (0.2 mg/kg), DES (10 mg/kg) and FLX (20 mg/kg) atenuated stress-induced changes in DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. None of the treatments induced locomotor effects in the OFT. Conclusion These results suggest that DNMTi potentiate the behavioural effects of antidepressant drugs in the FST and that antidepressants, as well as DNMTi, are able to modulate stress-induced changes in DNA methylation in brain regions closely associated with the neurobiology of depression.",

No effective treatment of this condition is available today. In this study, we have tested a novel pharmacological strategy using the monoaminergic stabiliser (−)-OSU6162. Methods: (−)-OSU6162 was given orally for 4 weeks in doses increasing from 15 to 45 mg b.i.d. to 12 patients suffering from mental fatigue, following upon stroke ( n =6) or TBI ( n =6). (−)-OSU6162 was compared with placebo using a double-blind, randomised cross-over design. Patients included were well rehabilitated physically with no gross impairment in cognitive functions other than those related to the mental fatigue. Results: (−)-OSU6162 caused a remarkable improvement in mental stamina, as evaluated by a self-assessment scale on mental fatigue. Statistical significance was reached on the primary endpoint (Mental Fatigue Scale). There was a trend towards improvement in the secondary endpoints processing speed and attention. Principal component analysis showed an overall positive treatment effect in 7 of 12 patients. Beneficial responses were seen already during the first few days of active drug treatment. Increasing dosage caused no further improvement. Adverse reactions consisted of short-lasting mild nausea and attenuated appetite. These side effects disappeared upon dose reduction. Conclusion: The monoaminergic stabiliser (−)-OSU6162 offers promise as a candidate for treatment of mental fatigue after a stroke or TBI.",

This review examines if it is associated with changes identifiable with current brain imaging technologies. Methods To better understand the mechanisms by which CBT exerts its effects, we undertook a systematic review of studies examining brain imaging changes associated with CBT treatment of depression. Results Ten studies were identified, five applying functional magnetic resonance imaging, three positron emission tomography, one single photon emission computer tomography, and one magnetic resonance spectroscopy. No studies used structural MRI. Eight studies included a comparator group; in only one of these studies was there randomised allocation to another treatment. CBT-associated changes were most commonly observed in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex (VMPFC/OFC) and amygdala/hippocampus. Discussion The evidence, such as it is, suggests resting state activity in the dorsal ACC is decreased by CBT. It has previously been suggested that treatment with CBT may result in increased efficiency of a putative ‘dorsal cognitive circuit’, important in cognitive control and effortful regulation of emotion. It is speculated this results in an increased capacity for ‘top-down’ emotion regulation, which is employed when skills taught in CBT are engaged. Though changes in activity of the dorsal ACC could be seen as in-keeping with this model, the data are currently insufficient to make definitive statements about how CBT exerts its effects. Data do support the contention that CBT is associated with biological brain changes detectable with current imaging technologies.",

Aims A single-blind randomised controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether yoga training or physical exercise training enhance cognitive functions in SZ, based on a prior pilot study. Methods Consenting, clinically stable, adult outpatients with SZ ( n =286) completed baseline assessments and were randomised to treatment as usual (TAU), supervised yoga training with TAU (YT) or supervised physical exercise training with TAU (PE). Based on the pilot study, the primary outcome measure was speed index for the cognitive domain of ‘attention’ in the Penn computerised neurocognitive battery. Using mixed models and contrasts, cognitive functions at baseline, 21 days (end of training), 3 and 6 months post-training were evaluated with intention-to-treat paradigm. Results Speed index of attention domain in the YT group showed greater improvement than PE at 6 months follow-up ( p &lt;0.036, effect size 0.51). In the PE group, ‘accuracy index of attention domain showed greater improvement than TAU alone at 6-month follow-up ( p &lt;0.025, effect size 0.61).

Methods In total, 97 participants were included in the study. Among them, 51 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and the remaining 46 were healthy individuals. Total thiol (–SH+–S–S–) levels and native thiol (–SH) levels in serum of each participant were measured. The amount of dynamic disulphide bonds (–S–S–) and (–S–S–) ×100/(–SH), (–S–S–) ×100/(–SH+–S–S–), and –SH×100/(–SH+–S–S–) ratios were calculated from these values. The obtained data were used to compare Alzheimer’s disease patients with healthy individuals. Results The average total thiol and native thiol levels of patient with Alzheimer’s disease in the study were found to be significantly lower than those levels of healthy individuals. In addition, in the patient group, the –S–S–×100/–S–S+–SH ratio was found to be significantly higher, whereas the –SH×100/–S–S+–SH ratio was found to be significantly lower compared with healthy individuals.

The present study includes representative measures of Gf, Gc, and EF frequently used in clinical practice to examine this Gf–EF relation. It is hypothesised that the Gf–EF relation is higher than the Gc–EF relation, and that working memory in particular (as a measure of EF) shows a high contribution to this relation. Method Confirmatory factor analysis was performed on a mixed neuropsychiatric and non-clinical sample consisting of 188 participants, using the Kaufman Adolescent and Adult Intelligence Test, and three executive tasks of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, covering working memory, planning skills, and set shifting. Results The model fitted the data well [χ 2 (24)=35.25, p =0.07, RMSEA=0.050]. A very high correlation between Gf and EF was found (0.91), with working memory being the most profound indicator. A moderate to high correlation between Gc and EF was present. Current results are consistent with findings of a strong relation between Gf and working memory. Conclusion Gf and EF are highly correlated. Gf dysfunction in neuropsychiatric patients warrants further EF examination and vice versa. It is discussed that results confirm the need to distinguish between specific versus general fluid/executive functioning, the latter being more involved when task complexity and novelty increase. This distinction can provide a more refined differential diagnosis and improve neuropsychiatric treatment indication.",

Also, they have employed heterogeneous exercise interventions and control groups that may lead to an underestimation of the benefits of exercise. In addition, pragmatic trials allowing scalable replication and implementation in routine practice are scarce. Future studies, can consider the research domain criteria as a diagnostic framework, and conduct moderator analyses to identify depressed subgroups with symptomatology and biopsychosocial characteristics associated with differential responses to exercise interventions. The search for biomarkers of the antidepressant responses to exercise should be prioritised. Further, non-physically active comparison groups should be used to minimise treatment cross-overs and thus the underestimation of the effects of exercise interventions. Finally, the use of outcome measures that maintain their validity at low and moderate levels of symptom severity and the development of trials with a pragmatic design are essential.The current evidence base is fraught with methodological considerations that need to be taken into account in order to increase further our understanding on the impact of exercise as medicine in depression. Future research should include moderator analyses, incorporate biomarker assays, use appropriate control and comparison groups, assess outcomes with psychometrically sensitive measures, and prioritise pragmatic trials towards transition to routine practice.",

    "abstract": "Background Neuroimaging studies have indicated that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with alterations in the structure of specific brain regions in children. However, the temporal and regional specificity of such changes and their behavioural consequences are less known. Here we explore the integrity of regional white matter microstructure in infants with in utero exposure to alcohol, shortly after birth. Methods Twenty-eight alcohol-exposed and 28 healthy unexposed infants were imaged using diffusion tensor imaging sequences to evaluate white matter integrity using validated tract-based spatial statistics analysis methods. Second, diffusion values were extracted for group comparisons by regions of interest. Differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity were compared between groups and associations with measures from the Dubowitz neonatal neurobehavioural assessment were examined. Results Lower AD values ( p &lt;0.05) were observed in alcohol-exposed infants in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus compared with non-exposed infants. Altered FA and MD values in alcohol-exposed neonates in the right inferior cerebellar were associated with abnormal neonatal neurobehaviour. Conclusion These exploratory data suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced white matter microstructural integrity even early in the neonatal period. The association with clinical measures reinforces the likely clinical significance of this finding. The location of the findings is remarkably consistent with previously reported studies of white matter structural deficits in older children with a diagnosis of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.",

In the present study, we investigated changes in antioxidants and oxidative stress from an acute to a later stable phase. We hypothesised that the levels of oxidative markers are increased in schizophrenia compared with healthy controls; change from the acute to the stable phase; and are associated with the levels of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and symptom severity. Methods: Fifty-five patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, assessed during an acute phase and 5 years later during a stable phase, and 51 healthy controls were included. We measured antioxidants (α-tocopherol, uric acid, albumin and bilirubin), markers of oxidative stress (F2-isoprostane and reactive oxygen metabolites) and membrane fatty acids. Antioxidants and oxidative stress markers were compared in schizophrenia versus healthy controls, adjusting for differences in sex, age and smoking, and changes over time. Associations between symptoms and PUFA were also investigated. Results: In the acute phase, α-tocopherol was significantly higher ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), while albumin was lower ( p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with the stable phase. Changes in α-tocopherol were associated with PUFA levels in the acute phase. In the stable phase, schizophrenia patients had higher uric acid ( p = 0.009) and lower bilirubin ( p = 0.046) than healthy controls. CRP was higher in patients in the stable phase ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), and there was no significant change from the acute phase. Conclusion: The present findings of change in antioxidant levels in the acute versus stable phase of schizophrenia the present findings suggest that redox regulation is dynamic and changes during different phases of the disorder.",

We performed a standard pairwise meta-analysis using a random effects model and carried out a network meta-analysis (NMA) using the statistical package, R. Quality of evidence was also assessed.We included 67 RCTs in the review and 21 to 45 interventions in the NMA. Paroxetine was most effective in the reduction of symptom severity as compared to placebo. Superior response to treatment was also observed for paroxetine, brofaromine, bromazepam, clonazepam, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, phenelzine, and sertraline. Higher dropout rates were found for fluvoxamine. Brofaromine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline, and venlafaxine performed worse in comparison to placebo for the outcome of dropouts due to adverse events. Olanzapine yielded a relatively high rank for treatment efficacy and buspirone the worse rank for dropouts due to any cause.The differences between drugs and placebo were small, apart from a significant reduction in symptom severity and response for paroxetine. We suggest paroxetine as a first-line treatment of SAD, with the consideration of future research on the drug olanzapine as well as brofaromine, bromazepam, clonazepam, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, phenelzine, and sertraline because we observed a response to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Objective This paper aims to review the available evidence for the use of clozapine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in combination. Methodology Electronic searches were carried out to identify reports describing the combined use of clozapine and ECT. Results Forty reports including 208 patients were identified. The majority of reports were in the form of case reports and case series, with few retrospective and open-label studies. The majority of patients were aged between 18 and 65 years and diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Most of the patients refractory to clozapine were started on ECT as an augmentation therapy; however, in some reports, both ECT and clozapine were started concurrently, and in few cases clozapine was started after ECT. In terms of effectiveness, 37.5–100% patients improved in short-term, and sustained long-term improvement (3 weeks to 24 months) was described in few studies. In terms of the side-effect profile, five patients each had delirium and tachycardia and only four patients were described to have prolonged seizures. Overall, the combination was considered effective and safe. Conclusion There is evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the clozapine–ECT combination and it should be used in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who do not respond to clozapine.",

The aim of this study was to perform a review investigating the interaction between genetic variations located in genes involved in hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA-axis) and stressful life events (SLEs) in depression. Methods: In this systematic review, we selected articles investigating the interaction between genes involved in the HPA-axis, such as Arginine Vasopressin ( AVP ), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) , Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (CRH) , Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone Receptor 1 (CRHR1) , Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone Receptor 2 (CRHR2) , FK506 binding protein (FKBP5) , Nuclear Receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 ( NR3C1) , Nuclear Receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2 (NR3C2) , and SLE. The literature search was conducted using the Pubmed, Embase, and PsychINFO databases in adherence with the PRISMA guidelines. Results: The search yielded 48 potentially relevant studies, of which 40 were excluded following screening. Eight studies were included in the final review. A total of 97 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined in the eight included studies. The most prevalent gene was FKBP5 , and the best studied polymorphism was FKBP5:rs1360780. Two of the five studies reported significant gene–environment (G × E) interactions between rs1360780 and SLE. Overall, four studies reported significant G × E interactions between FKBP5, CRH , or CRHR1 and SLE, respectively. No significant G × E interactions were found for the remaining genes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that genetic variation in three genes in the HPA-axis possibly moderate the effects of SLEs in depression.",

Despite the urgent clinical need, there is no reliable protein biomarker for LBD. Hence, we conducted the first comprehensive systematic review of all Differentially Abundant Proteins (DAP) in all tissues from people with LBD for advancing our understanding of LBD molecular pathology that is essential for facilitating discovery of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LBD. Methods: We identified eligible studies by comprehensively searching five databases and grey literature (PROSPERO protocol:CRD42020218889). We completed quality assessment and extracted relevant data. We completed narrative synthesis and appropriate meta-analyses. We analysed functional implications of all reported DAP using DAVID tools. Results: We screened 11,006 articles and identified 193 eligible studies. 305 DAP were reported and 16 were replicated in DLB. 37 DAP were reported and three were replicated in PDD. Our meta-analyses confirmed six DAP (TAU, SYUA, NFL, CHI3L1, GFAP, CLAT) in DLB, and three DAP (TAU, SYUA, NFL) in PDD. There was no replicated blood-based DAP in DLB or PDD. The reported DAP may contribute to LBD pathology by impacting misfolded protein clearance, dopamine neurotransmission, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity and extracellular vesicles. Conclusion: Our meta-analyses confirmed significantly lower CSF TAU levels in DLB and CSF SYUA levels in PDD, when compared to Alzheimer’s disease. Our findings indicate promising diagnostic biomarkers for LBD and may help prioritising molecular pathways for therapeutic target discovery. We highlight ten future research priorities based on our findings.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments in social communication, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Emerging evidence suggests that immune system dysregulation, particularly alterations in the complement system, may contribute to ASD pathophysiology. This study aimed to compare the serum levels of complement proteins (C1q, C2, C3, C4, MBL, L-Ficolin and hsCRP) between children with ASD and non-ASD controls. Methods: A total of 88 children (44 with ASD and 44 age- and sex-matched healthy controls) participated in this study. Complement protein levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from serum samples. The severity of ASD symptoms was assessed using standardized diagnostic tools, including the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R). Results: Serum C1q levels were significantly lower in the ASD group (p &lt; 0.001). C3 levels were lower (p = 0.033), while C2 levels were slightly higher (p = 0.015) in the ASD group. There are no significant differences in C4, MBL, or L-Ficolin levels. Logistic regression analysis identified reduced C1q levels as a significant predictor of ASD (p = 0.001). However, this study found no significant correlations between complement levels and ASD symptom severity scores. Conclusions: The findings suggest that alterations in complement system proteins, particularly reduced serum C1q levels, may be associated with ASD. Given C1q's critical role in synaptic pruning and neuroimmune regulation, these results support the hypothesis that complement system dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of ASD.",

    "abstract": "Although a considerable amount of evidence has shown that psychological stress alters peripheral and brain cytokines, the physiological significance of cytokine alteration in psychological stress remains to be elucidated. The aims of this review are to analyze the influence of acute and chronic psychological stresses on the cytokine network in animals and in humans, and to explore the pathophysiological implication of the cytokine changes in psychological stress. Acute psychological stress may increase proinflammatory cytokines both in animals and in humans, and increase T-helper-1 cell cytokines in humans. Investigations into the effect of chronic psychological stress on cytokine production in animals gives mixed results. However, in humans, academic exam stress or care-giver's stress appears to induce a shift in the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance toward a Th2 response and increase proinflammatory cytokines. Psychological stress-induced cytokines stimulate the activity of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) and could induce serotonin depletion-related disorders such as depression in susceptible individuals. Psychological stress-induced production of cytokines may increase the risk for human diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and exacerbation of autoimmune diseases. Proinflammatory cytokines may also play a regulatory role in glucocorticoid resistance and may be involved in wound healing and skin barrier function alterations. Finally, psychological stress-induced production of cytokines may play a role in neurodegenerative changes in the brain.",

The goal of this study was to compare the neuropsychological profiles of attention functions in children with ADHD and with ASD and without comorbid ADHD. The hypothesis was that either ADHD and autistic children with comorbid ADHD symptoms were more impaired in inhibition and sustained attention performance and that all individuals with ASD show more deficits in divided attention.Children aged 6 to 18 years old with ADHD (n = 30) or ASD with (n = 21) and without comorbid ADHD (n = 20) and 30 healthy children were included consecutively. Psychopathology was evaluated using the KIDDIE-SADS and symptom checklists for ADHD and ASD according to DSM-IV. Assessed neuropsychological functioning included inhibition, sustained as well as divided attention and alertness tasks.Age and IQ-corrected z-scores were used. Statistically significant group effects were found for the variables sustained attention median (F = 3.2, = .02), hits (F = 3.3, p = .02) and false alarms (F = 3.9, p = .01), divided attention hits (F = 3.3, p = .02), errors (F = 3.1, p = .03) and false alarms (F = 3.3, p = .03) and alertness false alarms (F = 2.9, p = .04). Pearson Correlations revealed associations between ADHD symptoms and sustained attention in the ADHD group and between ADHD symptoms and inhibition in the ASD+ group.Our hypothesis was partly confirmed as ADHD children showed more deficits in sustained attention and ASD children in divided attention tasks.

It is evident that depression and pain frequently coexist, with treatment and outcome implications. Objective: To review the literature on the nature, prevalence and co-morbidity of depression and pain, the biological and psychological mechanisms involved and treatment options, thus presenting a broad overview of the current information available. Methods: Relevant sources were identified from PubMed and Medline databases using a combination of keywords including depression, pain, prevalence, co-morbidity, biological and psychological mechanisms, serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, amygdala, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), antidepressant and psychological therapy. Results: It is evident from the research that depression and pain are common co-morbidities. Pain as a physical symptom of depression affects approximately 65% of patients, leading to less favourable outcomes and greater health care utilization. Moreover, depression is a common feature in chronic pain patients and can affect pain threshold and tolerance. Evidence from biological and psychological studies has revealed mechanisms that link chronic pain to depression. Several classes of anti-depressants and psychological interventions have been used successfully in the treatment of somatic symptoms of depression and for a variety of pain syndromes. Conclusions: Pain and depression are linked by overlapping phenomenology, neurobiology and therapy. They are mutually interacting, and the interaction has significant treatment and outcome implications.",

More recently, however, it has been applied to a range of phenomena within the cognitive neurosciences. Here, we provide an overview of such studies and review our work using CVS to investigate the neural mechanisms of a visual phenomenon – binocular rivalry. We outline the interhemispheric switch model of rivalry supported by this work and its extension to a metarivalry model of interocular-grouping phenomena. In addition, studies showing a slow rate of binocular rivalry in bipolar disorder are discussed, and the relationship between this finding and the interhemispheric switch model is described. We also review the effects of CVS in various clinical contexts, explain how the technique is performed and discuss methodological issues in its application. Methods: A review of CVS and related literature was conducted. Results: Despite CVS being employed with surprising effect in a wide variety of cognitive and clinical contexts, it has been a largely underutilized brain stimulation method for both exploratory and therapeutic purposes. This is particularly so given that it is well tolerated, safe, inexpensive and easy to administer. Conclusion: CVS can be used to investigate various cognitive phenomena including perceptual rivalry, attention and mood, as well as somatosensory representation, belief, hemispheric laterality and pain. The technique can also be used to investigate clinical conditions related to these phenomena and may indeed have therapeutic utility, especially with respect to postlesional disorders, mania, depression and chronic pain states. Furthermore, we propose that based on existing reports of the phenomenological effects of CVS and the brain regions it is known to activate, the technique could be used to investigate and potentially treat a range of other clinical disorders. Finally, the effects of CVS (and its potential effects) on several phenomena of interest to philosophy suggest that it is also likely to become a useful tool in experimental neurophilosophy.",

However, a separate hard problem faces the scientific study of consciousness. The problem arises when distinguishing the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) and the neural constitution of consciousness. Here, I explain this correlation/constitution distinction and the problem it poses for a science of phenomenal consciousness. I also discuss potential objections to the problem, outline further hard problems in the scientific study of phenomenal consciousness and consider the ontological implications of these epistemological issues. Methods: Scientific and philosophic analysis and discussion are presented. Results: The correlation/constitution distinction does indeed present a hard problem in the scientific study of phenomenal consciousness. Refinement of the ‘NCC’ acronym is proposed so that this distinction may at least be acknowledged in the literature. Furthermore, in addition to the problem posed by this distinction and to ‘the hard problem’, the scientific study of phenomenal consciousness also faces several other hard problems. Conclusion: In light of the multiple hard problems, it is concluded that scientists and philosophers of consciousness ought to (i) address, analyze and discuss the problems in the hope of discovering their solution or dissolution and (ii) consider the implications of some or all of them being intractable. With respect to the latter, it is argued that ultimate epistemic limits in the study of phenomenal consciousness pose no threat to physicalist or materialist ontologies but do inform our understanding of consciousness and its place in nature.",

Objective: Altered cardiac autonomic function has been proposed in patients with major depression (MD), but the results are mixed. Therefore, analyses with larger sample sizes and better methodology are needed. Methods: To examine whether cardiac autonomic dysfunction is associated with MD, 498 unmedicated patients with MD and 462 healthy volunteers, aged 18–65 years, were recruited for a case-control analysis. We used the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess depression severity. Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Frequency-domain indices of HRV were obtained. Results: Patients with MD exhibited reduced cardiac vagal control compared to healthy volunteers, and depression severity was negatively correlated with cardiac vagal control. Stratified analyses by suicide ideation revealed more pronounced cardiac vagal withdrawal among MD patients with suicide ideation. Conclusion: This study shows that MD is associated with cardiac autonomic dysregulation, highlighting the importance of assessing HRV in currently depressed patients, given the higher risk for cardiac complications in these individuals. Taking into account that suicidal depressed patients had more adverse patterns of HRV, one might consider the treatment to restore the autonomic function for the patient population having increased susceptibility to autonomic dysregulation.",

AIMS: Evaluate adjunctive YT for cognitive domains impaired in SZ. METHODS: Patients with SZ received YT or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 65, n = 23, respectively). Accuracy and speed for seven cognitive domains were assessed using a computerized neurocognitive battery (CNB), thus minimizing observer bias. Separately, YT was evaluated among patients with Bipolar I disorder (n = 40), Major Depressive Disorder (n = 37), and cardiology outpatients (n = 68). All patients also received routine pharmacotherapy. Patients were not randomized to YT or TAU. RESULTS: Compared with the SZ/TAU group, the SZ/YT group showed significantly greater improvement with regard to measures of attention following corrections for multiple comparisons; the changes were more prominent among the men. In the other diagnostic groups, differing patterns of improvements were noted with small to medium effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial analyses suggest nominally significant improvement in cognitive function in schizophrenia with adjunctive therapies such as YT. The magnitude of the change varies by cognitive domain and may also vary by diagnostic group.",

This paper aims to outline and discuss significant findings in EEG and event-related potential (ERP) research into bipolar disorder (BD). Methods: A literature review was performed through searches of MedLine, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycInfo medical research databases for papers published from 1985 onwards. References of selected articles were also examined for other relevant studies. Results: Differences in general EEG data were found in subjects with BD, namely increased theta and delta and decreased alpha wave bands. Changes in EEG were also found in euthymic BD subjects and those undergoing medication programmes. ERP studies commonly report prolonged latencies and reduced amplitudes in the P300 component. Hyperfunctioning of the right hemisphere in BD was also reported in some studies, although further confirmation of this finding is required. Finally, the effects of medication and the role that genetics plays in EEG still remain unclear. Conclusions: The literature reviewed demonstrates supporting evidence for the presence of significant differences in EEG and ERP data in subjects with BD. However, methodological considerations such as varying mood states and medication status of the patients need to be followed more stringently for future research to bring about a robust model of the cognitive deficits of BD.",

It was also the author's intention to examine the effects of parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) in therapeutic responders to determine if serotonergic mechanisms mediate agmatine's antidepressant effect. Methodology Exogenous agmatine was ingested in doses of 2-3mg/day by depressed subjects with Major Depresssive Disorder (MDD), clinically assessed using the 21 item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Antidepressant responders volunteered to concommittantly ingest parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) at starting doses of 250mg/day, and increased until depressive relapse, mitigating side effects, or a maximum dosage of 1250mg/day.Three depressed subjects showing total illness remission with exogenous agmatine did not relapse after concomitantly adding PCPA. Effective in relieving both psychomotor agitation and retardation, the antidepressant effect was free of physical or behavioural side effects: gastrointestinal discomfort and loose stools in one subject resolved spontaneously within days. All three subjects refused to risk depressive relapse by temporarily stopping agmatine after PCPA was stopped.The antidepressant effect of exogenous agmatine was documented in a small number of MDD subjects, and was not reversed/modified by PCPA confirming findings in animals that therapeutic response is not mediated by serotonergic mechanisms. A NAMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist, agmatine's recognized function in brain as inhibitory modulator of excitatory glutamatergic transmission suggests a pivotal role for brain glutamate, contributing to the ripening glutamatergic basis of depression, and a rational basis for future antidepressant pharmacotherapy.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In bipolar disorder, treatment with antidepressants without concomitant use of mood stabilisers (antidepressant monotherapy) is associated with development of mania and rapid cycling and is therefore not recommended. The present study aimed to investigate the psychopharmacological treatment patterns in bipolar disorder over time, with a focus on antidepressant monotherapy. METHODS: Cohort study with annual cross-sectional assessment of the use of psychotropic medications between 1995 and 2012 for all Danish residents aged 10 years or older with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder registered in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register. Users of a given psychotropic medication were defined as individuals having filled at least one prescription for that particular medication in the year of interest. RESULTS: We identified 20 618 individuals with bipolar disorder. The proportion of patients with bipolar disorder using antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and anticonvulsants increased over the study period, while the proportion of patients using lithium, typical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines/sedatives decreased. The proportion of patients treated with antidepressant monotherapy decreased from 20.5% in 1997 to 12.1% in 2012, and among antidepressant users, the proportion in monotherapy decreased from 47.7% to 23.9%, primarily driven by a decrease in the use of tricyclic antidepressants. CONCLUSION: The results show an increase in the proportion of patients with bipolar disorder being treated with antidepressants in the period from 1997 to 2012. However, in accordance with international treatment guidelines, the extent of antidepressant monotherapy decreased during the same period.",

Previous studies suggested that L-theanine affects the glutamatergic neurotransmission and ameliorates symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were twofold: to examine the possible effects of L-theanine on symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients and to evaluate the changes in chemical mediators, including glutamate + glutamine (Glx), in the brain by using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).The subjects were 17 patients with schizophrenia and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. L-theanine (250 mg/day) was added to the patients' ongoing antipsychotic treatment for 8 weeks. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores and MRS results.There were significant improvements in the PANSS positive scale and sleep quality after the L-theanine treatment. As for MRS, we found no significant differences in Glx levels before and after the 8 week L-theanine treatment. However, significant correlations were observed between baseline density of Glx and change in Glx density by l-theanine.Our results suggest that L-theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia. The MRS findings suggest that L-theanine stabilises the glutamatergic concentration in the brain, which is a possible mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect.",

Objective To measure to what extent psychiatric patients feel they were involved in the process and steps of decision making about treatment choice and to analyse the influence of socio-demographic, clinical, and psychological processes on this perception. Methods Cross-sectional survey involving 1100 consecutive psychiatric outpatients invited to complete the nine-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9), health locus of control and control preferences, self-efficacy and drug attitude scales, as well as a questionnaire including socio-demographic and clinical variables. Results A high response rate of 77% was registered, resulting in a sample of 846 psychiatric outpatients. SDM-Q-9 total score indicate a moderately low degree of perceived participation, with differing perceived implementation of the individual the SDM process steps. Patient diagnosis evidenced significant differences in SDM perception. Patients’ perception of SDM was explained by four main variables: the older the patient, the lower self-reported SDM; having a diagnosis of schizophrenia increases the likelihood of lower SDM; a positive attitude towards psychiatric drugs favors greater SDM, as well as a higher level of self-efficacy. Conclusion The result of this study suggests that SDM is currently not widely practiced in psychiatric care. Further research is needed to examine if the low level of participation self-reported is justified by psychiatric patients’ decisional capacity.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to investigate existing literature in order to delineate whether the use of anaesthesia and timing of seizure induction in a new and optimised way may improve the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE was searched for existing literature, last search on 24 June 2015. Relevant clinical studies on human subjects involving choice of anaesthetic, ventilation and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in the ECT setting were considered. The references of relevant studies were likewise considered. RESULTS: Propofol yields the shortest seizures, etomidate and ketamine the longest. Etomidate and ketamine+propofol 1 : 1 seems to yield the seizures with best quality. Seizure quality is improved when induction of ECT is delayed until the effect of the anaesthetic has waned - possibly monitored with BIS values. Manual hyperventilation with 100% O2 may increase the pO2/pCO2-ratio, which may be correlated with better seizure quality. CONCLUSION: Etomidate or a 1 : 1 ketamine and propofol combination may be the best method to achieve general anaesthesia in the ECT setting. There is a need for large randomised prospective studies comparing the effect of methohexital, thiopental, propofol, ketamine, propofol+ketamine 1 : 1 and etomidate in the ECT treatment of major depressed patients. These studies should investigate safety and side effects, and most importantly have antidepressant efficacy and cognitive side effects as outcome measures instead of seizure quality.",

Although the incidence of syphilis in the Netherlands has declined since the mid-1980s, syphilis has re-emerged, mainly in the urban centres. It is not known whether this also holds true for neurosyphilis.The epidemiology of neurosyphilis in Dutch general hospitals in the period 1999-2010 was studied in a retrospective cohort study. Data from the Dutch sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics were used to analyse the number of patients diagnosed with syphilis in this period.An incidence of neurosyphilis of 0.47 per 100 000 adults was calculated, corresponding with about 60 new cases per year. This incidence was higher in the western (urbanised) part of the Netherlands, as compared with the more rural areas (0.6 and 0.4, respectively). The number of patients diagnosed with syphilis in STI clinics increased from 150 to 700 cases in 2004 and decreased to 500 new cases in 2010. The sex ratio was in favour of men, yielding a percentage of 90% of the syphilis cases and of 75% of the neurosyphilitic cases. The incidence of neurosyphilis was highest in men aged 35-65 years, and in women aged 75 years and above. The most frequently reported clinical manifestation of neurosyphilis was tabes dorsalis. In this study, 15% of the patients were HIV seropositive.The incidence of neurosyphilis in a mixed urban-rural community such as the Netherlands is comparable to that in other European countries. Most patients are young, urban and men, and given the frequent atypical manifestations of the disease reintroduction of screening for neurosyphilis has to be considered.",

We predicted IVR tasks to have greater predictive power than traditional measures when assessing age-related cognitive functioning due to the real-world validity of the tasks. Methods Participants ( n =40) completed the Stroop colour–word test and the trail-making test (TMT) as traditional and commonly used assessments of executive functioning. Participants then completed three IVR tasks; a seating arrangement task, an item location task (both set in a virtual chemistry lab), and a virtual parking simulator. Results Younger adults completed significantly more parking simulator levels ( p &lt;0.001), placed significantly more objects ( p &lt;0.001), and located significantly more items than older adults ( p &lt;0.01), demonstrating higher levels of performance. Significant correlations were found between performance on traditional neuropsychological measures and IVR measures. For example, Stroop CW performance significantly correlated with the number of parking simulator levels completed (τ=0.43, p &lt;0.01). This suggests that IVR measures assess the same underlying cognitive constructs as traditional tasks. In addition, IVR measures contributed a significant percentage of the explained variance in age. Conclusion IVR measures (i.e. number of parking simulator levels completed and number of objects placed in the seating arrangement task) were found to be stronger contributors than existing traditional neuropsychological tasks in predicting age-related cognitive decline. Future research should investigate the implementation of these real-world-based tasks in clinical groups given this promising initial work.",

Hereby it was evaluated whether the NO signalling system is involved in the antidepressant mechanism of ketamine. METHODS: Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats received single i.p. injections of ketamine (15 mg/kg) with/without pre-treatment (30 min prior) with l-arginine (500 mg/kg). Depression-like behaviour was assessed in the forced swim test (FST) in terms of immobility, and the activation state of the Glu/NMDAR/NO/cGMP pathway was evaluated ex vivo in the frontal cortex and hippocampus regions in terms of total constitutive NOS (cNOS) activity and cGMP concentration. RESULTS: l-Arginine pre-treatment prevented the antidepressant-like effect of ketamine in the FST, as well as a ketamine-induced increase in cGMP levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of FSL rats. Ketamine reduced cNOS activity only in the hippocampus, and this effect was not reversed by l-arginine. CONCLUSION: Both the behavioural and molecular results from this study indicate an involvement for the NO signalling pathway in the antidepressant action of ketamine. Although not easily interpretable, these findings broaden our knowledge of effects of ketamine on the NO system.",

The objective of the study was to examine the effects of SB on behavioural abnormalities such as pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) deficits and hyperlocomotion in mice after a single administration of the N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, phencyclidine (PCP). Methods The effects of SB on behavioural abnormalities (PPI deficits and hyperlocomotion) in mice after PCP administration were examined. Furthermore, effects of SB on tissue levels of amino acids were also examined. Results A single oral dose of SB (100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg) attenuated PPI deficits in mice after administration of PCP (3.0 mg/kg, s.c.) in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, L-701,324 (10 mg/kg), an antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, did not affect the effect of SB (1000 mg/kg) on PCP-induced PPI deficits. Furthermore, a single oral dose of SB (1000 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the hyperlocomotion in mice after administration of PCP (3.0 mg/kg, s.c.). However, a single oral dose of SB (1000 mg/kg) caused no changes to d -serine levels in plasma or in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of these animals. Conclusion This study suggests that SB induced antipsychotic effects in the PCP model of schizophrenia, although it did not increase d -serine levels in the brain.",

Although the efficacy of ECT has been demonstrated to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), the brain mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Structural-functional changes occur with the use of ECT as a treatment for depression based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For this reason, we have tried to identify the changes that were identified by MRI to try to clarify some operating mechanisms of ECT. We focus to brain changes on MRI [structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imging (DTI)] after ECT.A systematic search of the international literature was performed using the bibliographic search engines PubMed and Embase. The research focused on papers published up to 30 September 2015. The following Medical Subject Headings (MESH) terms were used: electroconvulsive therapy AND (MRI OR fMRI OR DTI). Papers published in English were included. Four authors searched the database using a predefined strategy to identify potentially eligible studies.There were structural changes according to the sMRI performed before and after ECT treatment. These changes do not seem to be entirely due to oedema. This investigation assessed the functional network connectivity associated with the ECT response in MDD. ECT response reverses the relationship from negative to positive between the two pairs of networks.We found structural-functional changes in MRI post-ECT. Because of the currently limited MRI data on ECT in the literature, it is necessary to conduct further investigations using other MRI technology.",

In the present study, we investigated effects of quercetin on depression-like behaviours and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis in diabetic rats. Methods Experimental diabetes was induced by using streptozotocin, and either 50 or 100 mg/kg quercetin was intraperitoneally administered for 21 days. Following the last treatment, animals were subjected to the forced swim test, and subsequently, the blood was obtained by cardiac puncture to measure plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) levels. Results A significant increase of the total immobile time, accompanied by a decrease in the immobility latency, which suggests a depressive status, was observed in diabetic animals that was reversed by the treatment of 50 mg/kg quercetin. However, the higher dose of quercetin (100 mg/kg) was ineffective in alleviating depression-like behaviours. The plasma concentrations of ACTH, and total- and free-CORT were not affected by both doses of quercetin. Conclusion Therefore, we concluded that the antidepressant-like effects of quercetin in diabetes are independent of the HPA axis.",

We aimed to elucidate changes in cortical GABA content in relation to depression and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Methods In total, 11 patients with major depression or depressive episode of bipolar disorder (mean pre-ECT Ham-17 of 26) and 11 healthy subjects were recruited. GABA was quantified using short-TE MRS in prefrontal and occipital cortex. Other neurometabolites such as glutathione (GSH), N -acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate (Glu) were secondary outcome measures. Results No significant differences in GABA/Cr levels were observed between patients at baseline and healthy subjects in prefrontal cortex, t (20)=0.089, p =0.93 or occipital cortex t (21)=0.37, p =0.72. All patients improved on Ham-17 (mean post-ECT Ham-17 of 9). No significant difference was found in GABA, Glu, glutamine, choline or GSH between pre- and post-ECT values. However, we observed a significant decrease in NAA levels following ECT t (22)=3.89, p =0.0038, and a significant correlation between the NAA decline and the number of ECT sessions p =0.035. Conclusions Our study does not support prior studies arguing for GABA as a key factor in the treatment effect of ECT on major depression. The reduction in NAA levels following ECT could be due to neuronal loss or a transient dysfunction in prefrontal cortex. As no long-term follow-up scan was performed, it is unknown whether NAA levels will normalise over time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Increasing evidence suggests that immunological and inflammatory dysfunctions may play an important role in predisposition, onset, and progression of schizophrenia and related psychosis. The activation of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, especially microglia and monocytes, has been reported in schizophrenia. We carried out this systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate if there are significant differences in monocyte count comparing healthy controls with people suffering from schizophrenia and related disorders. Methods: We searched main electronic databases; nine records met all our criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analyses based on random effects models have been carried out generating pooled standardised mean differences (SMDs) of monocyte count in peripheral blood between schizophrenia and related psychosis and healthy controls. Heterogeneity was estimated. Relevant sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted. Results: Patients showed higher monocyte count as compared with healthy control (SMD = 0.393; p = 0.001). Heterogeneity across studies was from moderate to high ( I 2 = 65.952%); sensitivity analysis leaving out two studies responsible for most of the heterogeneity showed a slightly higher SMD. Subgroup analyses confirmed this result, showing no significant differences in the effect size across different study characteristics. Conclusions: Monocyte count can be considered an indirect marker of microglia activation in the central nervous system. Thus, the observed higher monocyte count in patients could be considered as a possible peripheral marker of microgliaʼs activation in schizophrenia disorder.",

However, little is known about the structural alterations in the brains of people with MDD and suicidal ideation. We examined the gray matter volume (GMV) of the PFC of individuals with MDD and suicidal ideation to determine if PFC volumetric differences contribute to suicidal ideation in patients with MDD. Thirty-five subjects with MDD and suicidal ideation, 38 subjects with MDD but without suicidal ideation, and 43 age- and gender-matched healthy control (HC) subjects underwent T1-weighted imaging. A voxel-based morphometric analysis was conducted to compare the PFC GMVs of the three groups. Further GMV reductions in the left and right dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and right ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) were detected in the MDD with suicidal ideation group compared with those in the HC group and the MDD without suicidal ideation group, whereas the MDD without suicidal ideation group only exhibited significant differences in the left DLPFC relative to the HC group. Our findings demonstrated that left DLPFC reductions were associated with MDD and suicidal ideation, and diminished GMV reductions in the right DLPFC and right VLPFC were only associated with suicidal ideation. These results help us better understand the neuropathological changes in MDD with suicidal ideation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Findings from animal studies indicate that the early gut bacteriome is a potential mechanism linking maternal prenatal stress with health trajectories in offspring. However, clinical studies are scarce and the associations of maternal psychological profiles with the early infant faecal bacteriome are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the associations of prenatal stressors and distress with early infant faecal bacterial profiles in a South African birth cohort study. Methods: Associations between prenatal symptoms of depression, distress, intimate partner violence (IPV) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and faecal bacterial profiles were evaluated in meconium and subsequent stool specimens from 84 mothers and 101 infants at birth, and longitudinally from a subset of 69 and 36 infants at 4–12 and 20–28 weeks of age, respectively, in a South African birth cohort study. Results: Infants born to mothers that were exposed to high levels of IPV had significantly higher proportions of Citrobacter and three unclassified genera, all of which belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae detected at birth. Proportions of these Enterobacteriaceae remained significantly increased over time (birth to 20–28 weeks of life) in infants born to mothers with high levels of IPV exposure compared to infants from mothers with no/low IPV exposure. Infants born to mothers exposed to IPV also had higher proportions of the genus Weissella at 4–12 weeks compared to infants from mothers with no/low IPV exposure. Faecal specimens from mothers exposed to IPV had higher proportions of the family Lactobacillaceae and lower proportions of Peptostreptococcaceae at birth. Maternal psychological distress was associated with decreased proportions of the family Veillonellaceae in infants at 20–28 weeks and a slower decline in Gammaproteobacteria over time. No changes in beta diversity were apparent for maternal or infant faecal bacterial profiles in relation to any of the prenatal measures for psychological adversities. Conclusion: Maternal lifetime IPV and antenatal psychological distress are associated with altered bacterial profiles in infant and maternal faecal bacteria. These findings may provide insights in the involvement of the gut bacteria linking maternal psychological adversity and the maturing infant brain.",

Although cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light (CSF NfL) shows promise in distinguishing neurodegenerative disorders (ND) from psychiatric disorders (PSY), its accuracy in a diagnostically challenging cohort longitudinally is unknown. Methods: We collected longitudinal diagnostic information (mean = 36 months) from patients assessed at a neuropsychiatry service, categorising diagnoses as ND/mild cognitive impairment/other neurological disorders (ND/MCI/other) and PSY. We pre-specified NfL &gt; 582 pg/mL as indicative of ND/MCI/other. Results: Diagnostic category changed from initial to final diagnosis for 23% (49/212) of patients. NfL predicted the final diagnostic category for 92% (22/24) of these and predicted final diagnostic category overall (ND/MCI/other vs. PSY) in 88% (187/212), compared to 77% (163/212) with clinical assessment alone.

In this review, evidence is presented to show how the impact of stress on the central sympathetic system leads to changes in the endocrine, immune and neurotransmitter axes which underlie the main clinical symptoms of depression. Thus it can be shown that the noradrenergic system is dysfunctional in depression, a situation which reflects the chronic hypersecretion of glucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators within the brain in addition to an enhanced activity of the locus ceruleus. With regard to the actions of antidepressants in modulating the stress response and alleviating depression it is now evident that, irrespective of the presumed specificity of the antidepressants for the noradrenergic or serotonergic systems, they all normalize noradrenergic function. This action is due partly to the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the locus ceruleus but also enhances neuronal sprouting which counteracts the neurodegenerative effects of chronic stress.",

However, only recent studies investigating the complexity of respiratory physiology have revealed consistent irregularities in respiratory pattern, suggesting that these abnormalities might be a vulnerability factor to panic attacks. The source of the high irregularity observed, together with unpleasant respiratory sensations in patients with panic disorder (PD), is still unclear and different underlying mechanisms might be hypothesized. It could be the result of compensatory responses to abnormal respiratory inputs or an intrinsic deranged activity in the brainstem network shaping the respiratory rhythm. Moreover, since basic physiological functions in the organism are strictly interrelated, with reciprocal modulations and abnormalities in cardiac and balance system function having been described in PD, the respiratory findings might arise from perturbations of these other basic systems or a more general dysfunction of the homeostatic brain. Phylogenetically ancient brain circuits process physiological perceptions/sensations linked to homeostatic functions, such as respiration, and the parabrachial nucleus might filter and integrate interoceptive information from the basic homeostatic functions. These physiological processes take place continuously and subconsciously and only occasionally do they pervade the conscious awareness as 'primal emotions'. Panic attacks could be the expression of primal emotion arising from an abnormal modulation of the respiratory/homeostatic functions.",

    "abstract": "Background: Animal models of depression and psychopharmacological mechanisms of action suggest the importance of the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) system in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Mood stabilizers have overlapping effects on GABAergic neurotransmission, and antidepressant use has been associated with alterations in GABA B receptor function. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides an opportunity to noninvasively assess cerebral GABA concentrations in anterior paralimbic circuits that have been implicated in mood disorders. Methods: In bipolar disorder patients and healthy control subjects, we used MRS with a modified GABA-edited point resolved spectroscopy sequence (TE 68 ms, TR 1500 ms, 512 averages, total scan time 26 min) to assess GABA in an 18-cm 3 occipital voxel. In addition, in another cohort of bipolar disorder patients and healthy control subjects, we similarly assessed GABA in a 12.5-cm 3 medial prefrontal/anterior cingulate (MPF/AC) voxel. The concentration of GABA was referenced to creatine (Cr) from unedited spectra. Results: In bipolar patients and controls, we consistently detected 3.0 p.p.m. GABA peaks in occipital lobe and MPF/AC. In 16 bipolar (nine bipolar I and seven bipolar II) disorder patients, compared with six healthy control subjects, mean occipital GABA/Cr concentration was 61% higher. In addition, in 15 bipolar (five bipolar I, nine bipolar II, and one bipolar not otherwise specified) disorder patients, compared with six healthy control subjects, mean MPF/AC GABA/Cr concentration tended to be 41% higher. Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorders may have increased cerebral GABA concentrations. Although this was more evident in the occipital lobe, MPC/AC GABA disturbance may be of greater potential interest in view the more established role of MPF/AC in affective processing. Additional studies are warranted to assess changes in GABAergic neurotransmission and the influences of diagnosis, mood state, and medication status in bipolar disorder patients.",

Studies which focused on the functional neural correlates of MM, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and placebo published up to August 2009 were screened in order to be considered for the inclusion.Main findings suggest that long-term MM practice allows a more flexible emotional regulation by engaging frontal cortical structures to dampen automatic amygdala activation. A large overlap exists between cerebral areas activated during MM, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy and those activated by placebo. However, while MM, psychotherapy and placebo seem to act through a top-down regulation, antidepressants seem to act through a bottom-up process.MM seem to target specific brain areas related to emotions and emotional regulation. Similar mechanisms have been observed also in other interventions, particularly psychotherapy.",

Objective: There is a paucity of data about risk factors for suicide attempts in bipolar disorder. The aim of this study is to examine the association between suicide attempts and obesity in people with bipolar disorder. Methods: Two hundred fifty-five DSM-IV out-patients with bipolar disorder were consecutively recruited from the Bipolar Disorder Program at Hospital das Clínicas de Porto Alegre and the University Hospital at the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Brazil. Diagnosis and clinical variables were assessed with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-axis I (SCID I) and Program structured protocol. History of suicide attempts was obtained from multiple information sources including patients, relatives and review of medical records. Patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 were classified as obese. Results: Over 30% of the sample was obese and over 50% had a history of suicide attempt. In the multivariate model, obese patients were nearly twice (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.06–3.69, p = 0.03) as likely to have a history of suicide attempt(s). Conclusion: Our results emphasise the relevance of obesity as an associated factor of suicide attempts in bipolar disorder. Obesity may be seen as correlate of severity and as such, must be considered in the comprehensive management of bipolar patients.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aberrant electrophysiological and hemodynamic processing of auditory oddball stimuli is among the most robustly documented findings in patients with schizophrenia. However, no study to date has directly examined linked patterns of electrical and hemodynamic differences in patients and controls. METHODS: In a recent paper we demonstrated a data-driven approach, joint independent component analysis (jICA) to fuse together functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP) data and elucidated the chronometry of auditory oddball target detection in healthy control subjects. In this paper we extend our fusion method to identify specific differences in the neuronal chronometry of target detection for chronic schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. RESULTS: We found one linked source, consistent with the N2 response, known to be related to cognitive processing of deviant stimuli, spatially localized to bilateral fronto-temporal regions. This source showed significant between-group differences both in amplitude response and in the fMRI/ERP distribution pattern. These findings are consistent with previous work showing N2 amplitude and latency abnormalities in schizophrenia, and provide new information about the linkage between the two. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we use a novel approach to isolate and identify a linked fMRI/ERP component which shows marked differences in chronic schizophrenia patients. We also demonstrate that jointly using both fMRI and ERP measures provides a fully picture of the underlying hemodynamic and electrical changes which are present in patients. Our approach also has broad applicability to other diseases such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, or bipolar disorder.",

Although the neurobiological understanding of major depressive disorder focuses mainly on the monoamine hypothesis, the exact pathophysiology of depression is not fully understood.Animals received daily intra-peritoneal injections of paroxetine (10 mg/kg), nortriptyline (15 mg/kg) or venlafaxine (10 mg/kg) in 1.0 ml/kg volume for 15 days. Twelve hours after the last injection, the rats were killed by decapitation, where the brain was removed and homogenised. The activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in different brain structures were measured.We first verified that chronic administration of paroxetine increased complex I activity in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex. In addition, complex II activity was increased by the same drug in hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex and complex IV activity in prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, chronic administration of nortriptyline increased complex II activity in hippocampus and striatum and complex IV activity in prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebral cortex. Finally, chronic administration of venlafaxine increased complex II activity in hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex and complex IV activity in prefrontal cortex.On the basis of the present findings, it is tempting to speculate that an increase in brain energy metabolism by the antidepressant paroxetine, nortriptyline and venlafaxine could play a role in the mechanism of action of these drugs. These data corroborate with other studies suggesting that some antidepressants modulate brain energy metabolism.",

However, their problems might be related to sedative medication abuse, alcohol abuse or heroin relapse. Sleep is an important issue in this population. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of sleep disorders in heroin addicts receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and analyse the correlation between related factors, such as age at opiate exposure, opiate exposure duration, duration in MMT, methadone current dosage, methadone attendance rate and the severity of sleep disorders. Method: We enrolled 121 heroin addicts who were receiving MMT. We collected data on the duration of insomnia, hypnotic history, Visual Analogue Scale-10 of sleep quality, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), methadone dosage, methadone history and opiate history. Results: The mean of the PSQI was 9.1 ± 5.4, and 70.2% of patients had PSQI scores &gt;5, indicating they were poor sleepers.

Method: A review of the recent empirical research into the role of tryptophan in depression, focusing on dietary methods to influence tryptophan levels. In parallel, a review of recent articles in the general English language media regarding tryptophan and mood. Results: Empirical evidence for improving mood through dietary manipulation of tryptophan is lacking, and it is difficult to change plasma tryptophan levels through diet alone. Tryptophan supplementation and depletion studies suggest that altering tryptophan levels may only benefit certain groups of patients who have a personal or family history of depression. Scientific studies also focus on elucidating mechanisms in depression, rather than treating depression by changing tryptophan levels. However, general media articles often recommend diets and foods to increase blood tryptophan levels and raise brain serotonin levels. Such recommendations are not supported by scientific studies. Conclusion: It is very difficult to alter blood tryptophan levels through dietary methods alone, outside of a laboratory or research setting. Only a small number of lay articles provide sound advice, with general media reports on tryptophan often being hyperbolic and misleading. A clinician should be aware of the type of (mis)information a patient may have accessed and have the scientific knowledge to explain the impracticalities of influencing tryptophan levels through diet alone.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated inconsistent findings regarding the efficacy of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of low-frequency rTMS.A comprehensive literature search (including PubMed, CCTR, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, CBM-disc, NTIS,EAGLE, Clinical Trials, Current Controlled Trials, International Clinical Trials Registry) was conducted dating until June 2014. The key search terms ('Parkinson', 'PD', 'transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'TMS', 'RTMS' and 'noninvasive brain stimulation') produced eight high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCT) of low-frequency rTMS versus sham stimulation.These eight studies, composed of 319 patients, were meta-analysed through assessment of the decreased Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS part III) score. Pooling of the results from these RCTs yielded an effect size of -0.40 (95%CI=-0.73 to -0.06, p<0.05) in UPDRS part III, which indicated that low-frequency rTMS could have 5.05 (95%CI=-1.73 to -8.37) point decrease in UPDRS part III score than sham stimulation.Low-frequency rTMS had a significant effect on motor signs in PD. As the number of RCTs and PD patients included here was limited, further large-scale multi-center RCTs were required to validate our conclusions.",

Objective: To investigate short-term outcomes of a computer-assisted cognitive remediation (CACR) for adolescents with psychotic disorders or at high risk for psychosis. Method: Cognitive abilities and clinical status were assessed at baseline ( N = 32) and at 6-month follow-up ( N = 22) after enrolment in either a CACR (treatment group) or a computer games (control group) program (8 weeks). Results: With regard to the cognitive abilities, no amelioration was found in the control group while, in the CACR group, significant improvements in inhibition ( p = 0.040) and reasoning ( p = 0.005) were observed. Furthermore, symptom severity decreased significantly in the control group ( p = 0.046) and marginally in the CACR group ( p = 0.088). Improvements in cognitive abilities were not associated with symptoms' amelioration. Finally, increase in reasoning abilities was related to the median effective work time in sessions of CACR ( R = 0.64, p = 0.024). Conclusion: At follow-up, enhanced cognitive abilities (reasoning and inhibition), which are necessary for executing higher-order goals or adapting behaviour to the ever-changing environment, were reported in adolescents participants of the CACR. Thus, further studies are needed to confirm and extend these interesting results.",

The study emphasises on publications over the past 20 years. Results Memory impairment in chronic pain patients is substantial, but the aspects of memory (e.g. working memory, long-term memory, and autobiographical memory) in chronic pain patients and the potentially related factors (e.g. age, level of education, pain conditions, emotion, neural network, and use of analgesics) are modest. Memory impairment is interpreted with the attention-narrowing hypothesis and the capacity-reduction hypothesis. Conclusions The currently available data and theory have explained memory impairment in chronic pain patients, but many controversies remain. Future research should focus on the subclinical characteristics of chronic pain, enlarging the sample size, and emphasise on the experimental intervention method and the cognitive neuroscience method.",

As inflammatory responses often include complement level alterations and complement production is influenced by cytokines, we aimed to find out whether complement system is activated in BD in a time-dependent manner and complement factors are involved in BD pathogenesis.Serum C4, factor B, sC5b-9 and neuron-specific enolase levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas peripheral blood mononuclear cell messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of C1q, C4, factor B and CD55 were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction in chronic BD patients (n=22), first episode BD patients (n=24) and healthy controls (n=19).Serum complement levels were significantly reduced in chronic BD patients as compared with first episode BD patients and healthy controls. Serum levels of complement factors showed significant inverse correlation with disease duration, severity of manic symptoms and serum neuron-specific enolase levels. In chronic BD patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cell mRNA expression levels of C1q, C4 and factor B were significantly elevated, whereas the mRNA expression level of the complement inhibitor CD55 was significantly reduced.Our results suggest that complement factor levels are reduced in BD presumably due to overconsumption of the complement system and complement production is increased at mRNA level possibly as a compensation measure. Complement factors might potentially be used as indicators of disease severity, neuronal loss and cognitive dysfunction.",

The present review intended to summarise evidence supporting a role for the endocannabinoid system on the control of neurogenesis and neurogenesis-dependent functions. Studies reporting participation of cannabinoids on the regulation of any step of neurogenesis and the effects of cannabinoid compounds on animal models possessing neurogenesis-dependent features were selected from Medline. Qualitative evaluation of the selected studies indicated that activation of cannabinoid receptors may change neurogenesis in embryonic or adult nervous systems alongside rescue of phenotypes in animal models of different psychiatric and neurological disorders. The text offers an overview on the effects of cannabinoids on central nervous system development and the possible links with psychiatric and neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, brain ischaemia/stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. An understanding of the mechanisms by which cannabinoid signalling influences developmental and adult neurogenesis will help foster the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and neurological disorders.",

The genetic factors that are associated with these symptoms remain uncertain. This systematic review aims to summarise the prevailing evidence from all genetic association studies investigating the genetic variants associated with cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms in people with PD.A systematic review using five online databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and OpenGrey (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42017067431). We completed the quality assessment using the Q-Genie tool.2353 articles were screened, and 43 articles were found to be eligible to be included. A meta-analysis of studies investigating LRRK2 rs34637584 confirmed that the minor allele carriers had significantly less cognitive impairment (p = 0.015). Further meta-analyses showed that GBA variants rs76763715 (p < 0.001) and rs421016 (p = 0.001) were significantly associated with more cognitive impairment in people with PD. Minor alleles of GBA variants rs76763715, rs421016, rs387906315 and rs80356773 were associated with more depressive symptoms in PD. Moreover, APOE ε4 allele has been associated with more cognitive impairment in PD. BDNF (rs6265) and CRY1 (rs2287161) variants have been associated with more depressive symptoms in people with PD.PD carriers of GBA variants are at high risk for cognitive decline and depression. Screening for these variants may facilitate early identification and effective management of these non-motor symptoms. The molecular mechanisms underlying favourable cognitive functioning in LRRK2 rs34637584 variant carriers warrant further investigation.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenia is associated with a reduction of the lifespan by 20 years, with type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease contributing the most to the increased mortality. Unrecognised or silent myocardial infarction (MI) occurs in ~30% of the population, but the rates of unrecognised MI in patients with schizophrenia have only been sparsely investigated. METHOD: Electrocardiograms (ECG) from three psychiatric hospitals in Denmark were manually interpreted for signs of previous MI. Subsequently, ECGs were linked to the National Patient Registry in order to determine whether patients had a diagnosis consistent with previous MI. RESULTS: A total of 937 ECGs were interpreted, 538 men (57.4%) and 399 women (42.6%). Mean age at the time of ECG acquisition was 40.6 years (95% CI: 39.7-41.5, range: 15.9-94.6). We identified 32 patients with positive ECG signs of MIs. Only two of these patients had a diagnosis of MI in the National Patient Registry. An additional number of eight patients had a diagnosis of MI in the Danish National Patient Registry, but with no ECG signs of previous MI. This means that 30 out of 40 (75%) MIs were unrecognised. Only increasing age was associated with unrecognised MI in a stepwise multiple logistic regression model compared with patients with no history of MI, OR: 1.03 per year of age, 95% CI: 1.00-1.06, p=0.021. CONCLUSION: Unrecognised MI is common among patients with schizophrenia and may contribute to the increased mortality found in this patient group.",

Although dopaminergic agents have long been associated with improvement of neuropsychiatric outcomes, to date much of the evidence to date has been in case reports and case series or open label trials. Methods We undertook a systematic review of double-blinded randomised controlled trials (RCT) to determine the effect of dopaminergic agents on pre-defined outcomes of (a) apathy; (b) psychomotor retardation; (c) behavioural management and (d) cognitive function. Databases searched were: Medline, EMBASE, and PsychInfo for human studies. The Cochrane Clinical Trials Database and the TRIP Medical database were also searched. All identified studies, were further hand-searched. Results We identified six studies providing data on 227 participants, 150 of whom received dopaminergic therapy. Trials were compromised by cross-over design, inadequate wash out period, small numbers and heterogeneous outcome measures. However one good quality RCT demonstrates the efficacy of amantadine in behavioural management. One further RCT shows methylphenidate-levodopa is efficacious for mood post-stroke. One study shows rotigotine to improve hemi-inattention caused by prefrontal damage. Conclusion Our systematic review demonstrates an evolving evidence base to suggest some benefits in agitation and aggression, mood and attentional deficits. However, there are key limitations of the studies undertaken to date involving small numbers of participants, heterogeneous outcome measures, and variable study designs. There is a need for on-going large prospective double-blind RCTs in these medications using standardised criteria and outcomes to fully understand their effectiveness in this patient group.",

The cognitive function assessment was carried out with the help of the following tests: Trail Making Test, The Stroop Test, Verbal Fluency Test and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Gene expression on the mRNA and protein level was evaluated for MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 in both groups using RNA extraction, reverse transcription and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Both mRNA and protein expression levels of all the genes were significantly lower in rDD subjects as compared with HS. Having analysed the entire experimental group (N=234), significant interrelations were found between the expression of the analysed genes and the results of the tests used to measure cognitive functions. Increased expression on both the mRNA and the protein level was associated in each case with better performance of all the tests conducted. After carrying out a separate analysis on the people from the rDD group and the HS group, similar dependencies were still observed.The results of our study show decreased expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and TIMP-2 genes on both mRNA and protein levels in depression. Elevated expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-2 positively affects cognitive efficiency: working memory, executive functions, attention functions, direct and delayed auditory-verbal memory, the effectiveness of learning processes and verbal fluency. The study highlights the important role of peripheral matrix metalloproteinases genes in depression and cognitive functions.",

This review aims to discuss the roles of glial cells in the pathophysiology of BD and their contribution to the mechanism of action of mood-stabilising drugs. Methods We critically reviewed the most recent advances regarding glial cell roles in the pathophysiology and treatment of BD and the neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects of these cells. Results Postmortem studies revealed a decrease in the glial cell number or density in the specific layers of prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the patients with BD, whereas there was no difference in other brain regions, such as entorhinal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were the most important glial types that were responsible for the glial reduction, but microglia activation rather than loss may be implicated in BD. The decreased number or density of glial cells may contribute to the pathological changes observed in neurons in the patients with BD. Alteration of specific neurotrophic factors such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and S100B may be an important feature of BD. Glial cells mediate the therapeutic effects of mood-stabilising agents in the treatment of BD. Conclusion Recent studies provide important evidence on the impairment of glial cells in the pathophysiology and treatment of BD. However, future controlled studies are necessary to elucidate different aspects of glial cells contribution to BD, and the mechanism of action of mood-stabilising drugs.",

In the flexible-dose short-term study, treatment with brexpiprazole resulted in numerically greater improvements in PANSS total score than with placebo that approached statistical significance (p=0.056). A meta-analysis of these short-term studies showed a mean change in PANSS total score of -20.1, reflecting a clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms. In the maintenance study, brexpiprazole had a beneficial effect relative to placebo on time to exacerbation of psychotic symptoms/impending relapse (p<0.0001). For all studies, brexpiprazole demonstrated clinically meaningful treatment effects on the Personal and Social Performance scale. Brexpiprazole had a favourable safety profile, with a relatively low prevalence of activating and sedating side effects. Weight gain in the short-term studies was ~1 kg greater than placebo. No safety concerns were observed with brexpiprazole in laboratory values, electrocardiogram, or vital signs.Overall, the results indicate brexpiprazole, used either short-term or as part of a long-term maintenance treatment programme, is an efficacious therapy option in adults with schizophrenia and has a favourable safety/tolerability profile.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to describe how to use the precision nomothetic psychiatry approach to (a) delineate the associations between schizophrenia symptom domains, including negative symptoms, psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, formal thought disorders, psychomotor retardation (PHEMFP), and cognitive dysfunctions and neuroimmunotoxic and neuro-oxidative pathways and (b) create a new endophenotype class based on these features. We show that all symptom domains (negative and PHEMFP) may be used to derive a single latent trait called overall severity of schizophrenia (OSOS). In addition, neurocognitive test results may be used to extract a general cognitive decline (G-CoDe) index, based on executive function, attention, semantic and episodic memory, and delayed recall scores. According to partial least squares analysis, the impacts of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) on OSOS are partially mediated by increasing G-CoDe severity. The AOPs include neurotoxic cytokines and chemokines, oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, IgA responses to neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites, breakdown of the vascular and paracellular pathways with translocation of Gram-negative bacteria, and insufficient protection through lowered antioxidant levels and impairments in the innate immune system. Unsupervised machine learning identified a new schizophrenia endophenotype class, named major neurocognitive psychosis (MNP), which is characterised by increased negative symptoms and PHEMFP, G-CoDe and the above-mentioned AOPs. Based on these pathways and phenome features, MNP is a distinct endophenotype class which is qualitatively different from simple psychosis (SP). It is impossible to draw any valid conclusions from research on schizophrenia that ignores the MNP and SP distinctions.",

The clinical signs and durations of neuropsychiatric complaints and their correlations to sex, age, severity of COVID-19 signs, and vaccination status were screened.A total of 2218 individuals, including 1358 females and 860 males, with an age range of 12-70 years, submitted their responses. The respondents experienced cognitive dysfunction, mood alteration, depression, tinnitus, sleep disorders, and loss of taste and smell, with prevalence rates ranging from 18.9% (tinnitus) to 63.9% (loss of taste and smell). Of the respondents, 2.2-7.7% confirmed the persistence of symptoms for >6 months. Tinnitus was the least common complaint, and only 2.2% of the study participants had tinnitus for >6 months. Meanwhile, mood alteration persisted for >6 months in 7.6% of the study participants. More respondents who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine showed persistent symptoms than those in the other groups. Disease severity and female sex were identified as potential determinants of the development and persistency of such symptoms.Post-COVID neuropsychiatric symptoms were present in considerable percentages of the study participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, persisting for >6 months in up to 7.6% of the participants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Depression is one of the major mental disorders, which seriously endangers human health, brings a serious burden to patients’ families. In this study, we intended to further explore the antidepressant-like effect and possible molecular mechanisms of Salidroside (SAL). We built corticosterone (CORT)-induced depressive mice model and used behavioural tests to evaluate depression behaviour. To explore the molecular mechanisms of SAL, we employed a variety of methods such as immunofluorescence, western blot, pharmacological interference, etc. The results demonstrated that SAL both at 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg can reduce immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST). At the same time, SAL treatment could restore the reduced sugar water intake preference in the sucrose preference test (SPT) in CORT-induced depressive mice and reduce the immobility time in TST and forced swimming experiments (FST). In addition, SAL treatment reversed the reduction in the number of Ki-67, BrdU, and NeuN in the hippocampus due to CORT treatment. SAL treatment also restored the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1α, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and other proteins in the hippocampus. In addition, after blocking SIRT1 signalling with EX527, we found that the treatment with SAL failed to reduce the immobility time in TST and FST, the level of SIRT1 and PGC-1α activity were correspondingly downregulated, and the expression of DCX and Ki-67 in the hippocampus failed to be activated. These findings suggested that SAL exerts antidepressant-like effects by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis through the SIRT1/PGC-1α signalling pathway.",

While inflammation may promote telomere shortening, few studies have investigated the association between telomere length (TL) and markers of immune activation and inflammation in severe mental disorders. Methods: Leucocyte TL defined as telomere template/amount of single-copy gene template (T/S ratio), was determined in participants with SCZ ( N = 301) or BD ( N = 211) and a healthy control group (HC, N = 378). TL was analysed with linear regressions for associations with levels of 12 immune markers linked to SCZ or BD. Adjustments were made for a broad range of potential confounding variables. TL was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the immune markers were measured by enzyme immunoassays. Results: A positive association between levels of soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1A (sTNF-R1) and TL in SCZ ( β = 0.191, p = 0.012) was observed. Plasma levels of the other immune markers were not significantly associated with TL in the BD, SCZ or HC groups. Conclusion: There was limited evidence of association between immune markers and TL in SCZ and BD. The results provide little support for involvement of immune dysregulation, as reflected by current systemic markers, in telomere attrition-related accelerated ageing in severe mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) emitted by rats may reflect affective states. Specifically, 50 kHz calls emitted during juvenile playing are associated with positive affect. Given that depression is characterised by profound alterations in this domain, we proposed that USV calls may configure a suitable tool for assessing depressive-like states. Utilising the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL), a well-established animal model of depression, we assessed USV calls emitted by rats during tickling, a procedure based on juvenile rats' rough-and-tumble play. METHODS: Juvenile FSL rats and their control counterparts, the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) and Sprague Dawley, were submitted to tickling sessions to imitate rats playing behaviour. The rats were tickled daily for 6 weeks starting at PND21. Tickling sessions were recorded for further acoustic analysis of 50 kHz calls. RESULTS: Tickling increased 50 kHz calls in all the strains. FSL rats emitted more calls than control strains and exhibited a higher number of flat-trill combination calls. CONCLUSION: Tickling is a robust method for inducing 50 kHz USV calls. Analysing USV calls emitted during tickling configurates a suitable method for studying affective states relevant to depression. FSL rats did not present anhedonia but rather higher reward sensitivity, which may underlie their stress vulnerability.",

Methods: Participants comprised individuals with tic disorders and age-matched healthy controls, ranging from 6 to 18 years old, all recruited from Korea University Guro Hospital. We ensured a medication-naïve cohort by excluding participants exposed to psychotropic medications for at least three weeks prior to the study. Data included structural and resting-state functional MRI scans, analysed with the CONN-fMRI Functional Connectivity toolbox v20b. The analysis included 22 patients (18 males, 4 females) and 26 controls (14 males, 12 females). Results: Significantly increased global efficiency was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis among tic disorder patients compared to controls. Furthermore, this region displayed enhanced resting-state functional connectivity with its right counterpart in patients versus controls. Conclusion: The inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis, known for its inhibitory role, may reflect adaptive functional adjustments in response to tic symptoms. Increased hubness of the inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis possibly represents functional adjustments in response to tic symptoms. The identified brain region with increased efficiency and connectivity presents a promising avenue for further research into tic expression and control mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Rewards are rewarding owing to their hedonic or metabolic value. Individual differences in sensitivity to rewards are predictive of mental health problems but may reflect variation in metabolic types. We have assessed the association of two distinguishable aspects of reward sensitivity, openness to rewards (the striving towards multiple rewards) and insatiability by reward (the strong pursuit and fixation to a particular reward), with measures of metabolism and activity in a longitudinal study of representative birth cohort samples. We used data of the Estonian Children Personality Behaviour and Health Study (original n = 1238) collected at age 15, 18 and 25. Reward sensitivity and physical activity were self-reported during a laboratory visit, when also blood sampling, measurement of blood pressure, height and weight, aerobic exercise testing and the diet interview, after the participants had kept food diary, took place. In the younger cohort, physical activity was also assessed by accelerometry at age 18 and 25. Across adolescence and young adulthood, openness to rewards was positively associated with physical activity and negatively with blood pressure and serum levels of glucose, insulin and cholesterol levels. In contrast, insatiability by reward was positively associated with serum triglyceride levels and negatively with energy intake and cardiorespiratory fitness. In conclusion, the two facets of reward sensitivity have a fairly different association with a variety of metabolic and health-related measures. This may explain the variable findings in literature, and suggests that individual differences in reward sensitivity are part of a complex physiological variability, including energy expenditure profiles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Major depressive disorder (MDD) is considered a psychiatric disorder and have a relationship with stressful events. Although the common therapeutic approaches against MDD are diverse, a large number of patients do not present an adequate response to antidepressant treatments. On the other hand, effective non-pharmacological treatments for MDD and their tolerability are addressed. Several affective treatments for MDD are used but non-pharmacological strategies for decreasing the common depression-related drugs side effects have been focused recently. However, the potential of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), microRNAs (miRNAs) as cell-based therapeutic paradigms, besides other non-pharmacological strategies including mitochondrial transfer, plasma, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and exercise therapy needs to further study. This review explores the therapeutic potential of cell-based therapeutic non-pharmacological paradigms for MDD treatment. In addition, plasma therapy, mitotherapy, and exercise therapy in several in vitro and in vivo conditions in experimental disease models along with tDCS and TMS will be discussed as novel non-pharmacological promising therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Growing evidence suggests that psychedelic-assisted therapies can alleviate depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and substance use disorder, offering relatively safe profiles, enhanced efficacy, and lasting effects after a few applications. Athletes often experience high levels of stress and pressure, making them susceptible to these psychiatric conditions. However, the effects of psychedelic substances on athletic performance remain largely unknown. Before potential acceptance, evaluating their impact on physical and physiological measures beyond mental health outcomes is crucial. Here, we aim to explore this topic and highlight research directions to advance our understanding. Preclinical studies suggest that psilocybin/psilocin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N , N -dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and ayahuasca possess anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties. Studies investigating the effects of classical psychedelics or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on factors such as muscle strength, motor coordination, locomotion, endurance, fluid and electrolyte balance, hormonal regulation, and metabolism are still scarce. While adhering to regulatory frameworks, further research in animal models, athletes, and non-athletes is needed to address these gaps, compare psychedelics with commonly used psychoactive drugs, and explore the potential prophylactic and regenerative benefits of specific interventions.",

The primary outcome measure was the effectiveness of ACT for suicidality which includes suicidal ideations and attempts. Results: This systematic review and meta-analysis included eight studies, all of which were judged to have a high risk of bias. In the meta-analysis, the pooled standardized mean difference for suicidal ideations was 1.122 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.261 to 1.982). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that ACT is effective for reducing suicidal ideation, but the high risk of bias across studies should be considered as a major limitation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Late-life depression (LLD) arises from a complex interplay among biological, psychological, and social factors. Biologically, three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the distinct clinical features of LLD. The vascular hypothesis supports vascular-related white matter changes in the development of LLD, while the neurodegenerative hypothesis suggests that LLD might be a prodrome of neurodegenerative diseases. The inflammatory hypothesis, which is the main focus of this review, posits that heightened inflammation underlies LLD directly or indirectly through neurodegenerative and microvascular alterations. Methods: This is a non-systematic review on the role played by inflammation in the pathophysiology of LLD and the related opportunities to define biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We searched PubMed from January 2010 through March 2025 for relevant English-language studies. Results: Patients with LLD have elevated circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) as well as evidence of neuroinflammation. Although the exact origin of this inflammatory profile remains unclear, it is thought to be exacerbated by immune cell senescence and the presence of physical comorbidities, including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Pharmacological (e.g., selective serotonin receptor inhibitors) and non-pharmacological (e.g., diet, physical interventions) approaches for LLD seem to exert their therapeutic effect, at least in part, through inflammation-related mechanisms. Conclusion: Recognizing the unique features of LLD compared to depression in other periods of life is an important step toward its proper management. More specifically, understanding the role of inflammation in LLD holds both theoretical and practical implications, including anti-inflammatory or immune-based strategies as potential therapeutic interventions.",

This study investigated related magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) signatures and their correlations with electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and psychometric/neuropsychological measures. Methods: Twenty-eight adults with suspected antibody-positive AP spectrum syndromes were compared with 28 matched healthy controls. Inclusion in the patient group was based on the APS concept, resulting in a heterogeneous group with uniform autoimmunity. MRSI was performed using a spiral-encoded Mescher-Garwood localized adiabatic selective refocusing 3D-MRSI sequence. Glutamate+glutamine (Glx), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), and total creatine (tCr) were reported as ratios to tNAA and/or tCr. EEG was analyzed for intermittent rhythmic delta/theta activity (IRDA/IRTA) using independent component analysis. Results: No significant differences in Glx, GABA, tNAA, or tCr ratios were observed between patients and controls. Correlation analyses in patients showed a trend for a negative association of the IRDA/IRTA rate before hyperventilation with the GABA/tCr ratio in both hippocampi and with the GABA/tNAA ratio in the left hippocampus and Glx/tCr ratio in the right putamen and pallidum. Significant positive correlations were observed between inflammatory CSF markers (white blood cell count and IgG Index) and GABA/tCr and GABA/tNAA ratios in the left caudate nucleus and right isthmus cingulate and thalamus, as well as between negative symptoms in PANSS and higher GABA/tCr ratios in the right putamen. Discussion: No group differences were identified; however, correlations suggest a link between neuroinflammatory CSF markers and negative symptoms with GABAergic signaling in patients. Multimodal diagnostic approaches may provide a better understanding of the link between neuroinflammation, neurochemistry, and EEG slowing.",

If we examine the history of theories of emotion we find a great diversity of views. For example, Darwin, in his 1872 book 'The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals', conceived of emotions as expressive behaviors that had the function of communicating intentions from one animal to another in the presence of conflicts or emergencies. Emotional expressions, from this point of view, regulated interpersonal relations and increased the chances of individual survival.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system are characteristic of depression, and in the majority of these patients these result in HPA axis hyperactivity. This is further supported by the reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX), on the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, during the DEX suppression test and the DEX-corticotropin-releasing hormone (DEX/CRH) test. Because the effects of glucocorticoids are mediated by intracellular receptors including, most notably, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), several studies have examined the number and/or function of GRs in depressed patients. These studies have consistently demonstrated that GR function is impaired in major depression, resulting in reduced GR-mediated negative feedback on the HPA axis and increased production and secretion of CRH in various brain regions postulated to be involved in the causality of depression. This article summarizes the literature on GR in depression and on the impact of antidepressants on the GR in clinical and preclinical studies, and supports the concept that impaired GR signaling is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of depression, in the absence of clear evidence of decreased GR expression. The data also indicate that antidepressants have direct effects on the GR, leading to enhanced GR function and increased GR expression. Hypotheses regarding the mechanism of these receptor changes involve non-steroid compounds that regulate GR function via second messenger pathways, such as cytokines and neurotransmitters. Moreover, we present recent evidence suggesting that membrane steroid transporters such as the multidrug resistance (MDR) p-glycoprotein, which regulate access of glucocorticoids to the brain, could be a fundamental target of antidepressant treatment. Research in this field will lead to new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders.",

Unexpected changes in mental status, new-onset catatonia, episodic tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension, dysarthria, dysphagia, diaphoresis, sialorrhea, incontinence, low-grade temperature elevations, and rigidity should arouse suspicion. Several lines of evidence provide support for the involvement of dopamine. Most of the drugs implicated in NMS are D 2 dopamine receptor antagonists. Central noradrenergic activity is also possibly related to the disorder, as sympathetic hyperactivity is associated with the active phase of NMS. Currently, the definitive role of GABA deficiency in NMS is yet to be established. Differential diagnosis should include malignant hyperthermia, lethal catatonia, lithium toxicity, serotonin syndrome, and heat stroke. A high degree of suspicion and the discontinuation of antipsychotic agents even if the diagnosis is not established are essential for the safety of the patient. Treatment of NMS should be individualized and be based empirically on the character, duration, and severity of the clinical signs and symptoms noted. The initial step in the treatment of NMS is the removal of the offending agent. Full-blown NMS is a serious condition and requires immediate supportive, nutritive, and electrolyte therapies. The administration of drugs that can improve NMS, such as IV dantrolene and/or oral bromocriptine, may also be taken into consideration, based on the severity and nature of the NMS.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, neuroimaging research has identified key components in the neural system that underlies bipolar disorder (BD). The ventral prefrontal cortex (VPFC) and amygdala are highly interconnected structures that jointly play a central role in emotional regulation. Numerous research groups have reported prominent structural and functional abnormalities within the VPFC and amygdala supporting their essential role in a neural system underlying the emotional dysregulation that is a core feature of BD. Findings in BD also include those in brain regions interconnected with the VPFC and amygdala, including the ventral striatum, hippocampus and the cerebellum. Abnormalities in these regions may contribute to symptoms that reflect disruption in functions sub-served by these structures, including motivational, mnemonic and psychomotor functions. This article will first review leads from behavioural neurology that implicated these neural system abnormalities in BD. It will then review findings from structural and functional imaging studies to support the presence of abnormalities within these neural system components in BD. It will also review new findings from studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that provide increasing evidence of abnormalities in the connections between these neural system components in BD. Emerging data supporting differences in this neural system during adolescence, as well as potential beneficial effects of treatment on structure and function will also be presented. Finally, the article will discuss the implications for future investigations, including those for early identification and treatment of BD.",

Our objective was to describe in detail the psychiatric presentation and pathways to care in order to aid the early diagnosis of NMDAR encephalitis.Sera and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with suspected NMDAR encephalitis were tested on HEK 293 cells transfected with the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR. Clinical information was obtained from the referring psychiatrists and neurologists and by review of the clinical records.Samples from 15 patients (13 female, 2 male, mean age 24 years, range 5-56 years) tested anti-NMDAR positive. Twelve of the 15 patients (80%) presented with prominent psychiatric symptoms and 8 were initially referred to a psychiatric service. The most prominent initial psychiatric symptoms were anxiety in seven (47%), behavioural change (often bizarre) in six (40%) and agitation in five (33%). All patients developed psychiatric symptoms in the first 6 weeks of illness. Thirteen patients received psychotropic medications: antipsychotics in 12 and benzodiazepines in 11. Treating physicians considered the psychotropic medication not effective in 11 patients resulting in many drug switches. At nadir, all patients were in a very poor condition. However, eight patients (53%) recovered (almost) completely. Outcome tended to be better in patients who had received early immunotherapy or tumour removal.Autoimmune encephalitis and anti-NMDAR testing in serum and CSF should be considered in patients, especially young females, presenting with atypical psychiatric phenomena. Early diagnosis and treatment will likely improve the prognosis of NMDAR encephalitis.",

Sleep disturbance in mild cognitive impairment: differential effects of current and remitted depression. Objective: Although patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) commonly report sleep disturbance, the extent to which depressive symptoms contribute to this relationship is unclear. This study sought to delineate the contribution of current and remitted major depression (MD) to sleep disturbance in MCI. Methods: Seventy-seven patients meeting criteria for MCI (mean age = 66.6 ± 8.8 years) were grouped according to those with no history of depression (MCI, n = 33), those meeting criteria for current MD [mild cognitive impairment and meeting criteria for current major depression (DEP-C), n = 14] and those with remitted MD [mild cognitive impairment and remitted major depression (DEP-R), n = 30]. Additionally, 17 healthy controls (CON) participated. Sleep was patient-rated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and included assessment of sleep quality, duration, efficiency, disturbances, medications, sleep onset latency and daytime dysfunction. Depression severity was clinician-rated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Results: Overall sleep disturbance was significantly greater in the DEP-C and DEP-R groups in comparison to the CON and MCI groups ( p &lt; 0.001). Only 12% of CON reported sleep disturbance, compared to 30% of MCI, 63% of DEP-R and 86% of DEP-C. Sub-scale analysis showed that the sleep disturbance in depressive groups was most evident across the domains of sleep quality, sleep efficiency, sleep latency and daytime dysfunction. Conclusion: Sleep disturbance in MCI is strongly associated with a current or past diagnosis of MD. The finding that sleep complaints are still prominent in those with remitted depression, suggests that ‘trait' markers exist that may reflect underlying neurobiological changes within the sleep–wake system.",

Research to date has focused on bipolar I disorder, extrapolating results to bipolar II disorder. The current study addresses this discrepancy by exploring cognitive and coping styles in patients diagnosed with bipolar I or II disorder. Methods Participants were recruited from the Sydney-based Black Dog Institute. Diagnoses were derived via the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Baseline cognitive and coping style measures were completed, and mood symptoms assessed over a 6-month period. Clinician-rated mood status was assessed at follow-up to determine the predictive utility of cognitive and coping styles. Results The follow-up sample comprised 151 participants. Differential relationships between cognitive style, coping styles and mood symptoms emerged across the bipolar sub-types. Some key differences were that a broader set of negative cognitive styles were associated with bipolar II depression symptoms; while few relationships were observed between coping styles and bipolar II symptoms. Conclusion Differences in cognitive and coping style relationships with symptom expression across bipolar I and II disorder may provide clinicians with fruitful guides for directing treatment interventions when relevant maladaptive styles are observed. Further exploration of differences in cognitive and coping styles in bipolar I and II disorder is warranted.",

The aim of this study was to explore white matter integrity of PCG in PTSD subjects. Methods: White matter integrity, as determined from fractional anisotropy (FA) value using diffusion tensor imaging, was assessed for PCG in subjects with and without PTSD from a severe mine accident. All subjects were also measured by the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the logical memory subtest and the visual reproduction subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised in China. Sixteen PTSD subjects (8 subjects in each group) in the longitudinal study and 13 PTSD subjects as well as 14 non-PTSD controls in the cross-sectional case–control study were respectively recruited. Results: In the longitudinal study, subjects with PTSD showed increased FA values in left PCG during the follow-up scan. In the cross-sectional study, FA values in bilateral PCG in PTSD subjects were higher than controls. Within the PTSD group ( n = 13), FA values in the left PCG correlated positively with logical memory and negatively with PCL-C intrusion and STAI-trait (STAI-t) subscores. FA values in right PCG correlated negatively with STAI-t and STAI-state subscores. Conclusion: These findings suggest that alterations of white matter integrity in PCG link to mnemonic and affective processing in PTSD over the long-term follow-up period.",

Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Frequency-domain indices of HRV were obtained. The obtained results were evaluated in association with personality traits assessed by the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire.In patients with remitted MDD, no differences in RR intervals and all frequency-domain indices of HRV could be detected as compared with controls. Stratified analyses by the presence of a history of suicide ideation (the SI+ vs. the SI-subgroup) revealed decreased cardiac vagal control in the SI+ subgroup. The correlation analysis revealed an inverse relation between HRV levels and the harm avoidance score (which has been suggested to be associated with serotonergic activity), mainly attributable to the robust association in the SI+ subgroup.Our study shows that cardiac autonomic dysregulation is not shown in remitted MDD patients as a whole but is limited to the subgroup of remitted MDD patients with a history of suicidal ideation. In view of the higher risk for cardiac complications in these vulnerable individuals, one might consider the treatment to restore their autonomic function.",

Secondarily, we also hypothesised that 5-HTTLPR may be a risk factor for MDD. Methods: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hippocampus was studied in 23 inpatients suffering from MDD and in 33 healthy controls. Normalised volumetric MRI data of hippocampus were assessed with adjustment for total brain volume and tensor-based morphometry was used to elucidate structural brain differences. A triallelic genetic marker resulting from two SLC6A4 promoter region polymorphisms, 5-HTTLPR and rs25531, was analysed for association with MDD and quantitative traits. Results: Healthy controls had a smaller relative hippocampal volume (relative to brain size) but a larger total brain volume compared with patients with MDD. For patients compared with healthy controls, atrophy was found in the right temporal lobe and pons medulla. Allele and genotype frequencies were strikingly different from the previous study that we aimed to replicate, and no significant associations with the serotonin transporter polymorphism were found. Conclusions: The present quantitative and morphometric MRI study was not able to replicate the previous finding of association between reduced hippocampal volume in depressed patients and the serotonin transporter polymorphism.",

A follow-up visit was conducted 4 weeks following the completion of treatment. We collected serum samples at baseline and the end of the treatment phase (week 12) to determine changes in interleukin-6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) following NAC treatment. Results NAC treatment significantly improved depressive symptoms on the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) over 16 weeks of the trial.

Literature explicitly investigating the relationship between aberrant salience processing and cannabis use is scarce; with those few studies finding that acute tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) administration (the main psychoactive component of cannabis) can result in abnormal salience processing in healthy cohorts, mirroring that observed in psychosis. Nevertheless, the extent of and mechanisms through which cannabis has a modulatory effect on aberrant salience, following both acute and chronic use, remain unclear.Here, we systematically review recent findings on the effects of cannabis use - either through acute THC administration or in chronic users - on brain regions associated with salience processing (through functional MRI data); and performance in cognitive tasks that could be used as either direct or indirect measures of salience processing. We identified 13 studies either directly or indirectly exploring salience processing. Three types of salience were identified and discussed - incentive/motivational, emotional/affective, and attentional salience.The results demonstrated an impairment of immediate salience processing, following acute THC administration. Amongst the long-term cannabis users, normal salience performance appeared to be underpinned by abnormal neural processes.Overall, the lack of research specifically exploring the effects of cannabis use on salience processing, weaken any conclusions drawn. Additional research explicitly focussed on salience processing and cannabis use is required to advance our understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the association between cannabis use and development of psychosis.",

Their common denominator is the endocannabinoid ligand anandamide (AEA), which is believed to mediate antidepressant-like effect via CB1-R stimulation and depressive-like effect via TRPV1 activation. This is supposed to explain the bell-shaped dose-response curve for anandamide in preclinical models. Methods We investigated this assumption by administering the dual inhibitor of AEA hydrolysis and TRPV1 activation N -arachidonoyl-serotonin (AA-5HT) into the medial prefrontal cortex of rats. AA-5HT was given in three different doses (0.125, 0.250, 0.500 nmol/0.4 µl/side) and rat behaviour was assessed in the forced swim test. Results Our results show significant antidepressant-like effect of AA-5HT (0.250 nmol) but no effects of low or high doses. The effect of 0.250 nmol AA-5HT was partially attenuated when coadministering the inverse CB1-agonist rimonabant (1.6 µg). Conclusion A 0.250 nmol of AA-5HT administration into the medial prefrontal cortex induced a significant antidepressant-like effect that was partially attenuated by locally blocking CB1-receptor.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Patients with functional memory disorder (FMD) report significant memory failures in everyday life. Differentiating these patients from those with memory difficulties due to early stage neurodegenerative conditions is clinically challenging. The current study explored whether distinctive neuropsychological profiles could be established, suitable to differentiate patients with FMD from healthy individuals and those experiencing amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI). Methods Patients with a clinical diagnosis of FMD were compared with patients with a-MCI, and healthy matched controls on several tests assessing different cognitive functions. Patients with clinically established mood disorders were excluded. Patients with FMD and a-MCI were broadly comparable on the level of their subjective memory complaints as assessed by clinical interview. Results The neuropsychological profile of the FMD patients, although they expressed subjective memory and attention concerns during their clinical interview was distinct from patients with a-MCI on tests of memory [semantic fluency, age of acquisition (AoA) analysis of semantic fluency, verbal and non-verbal memory]. FMD patients did not differ significantly from healthy controls, but their scores on the letter fluency and digit cancellation tasks were not significantly different from those of the a-MCI patients indicating a possible sub-threshold deficit on these tasks. Conclusion Whilst subjective complaints are common within the FMD population, no objective impairment could be detected, even on a sensitive battery of tasks designed to detect subtle deficits caused by an early neurodegenerative brain disease. This study indicates that FMD patients can be successfully differentiated from patients with neurodegenerative memory decline by characterising their neuropsychological profile.",

The present study investigates whether lipid levels can make state-dependent markers of suicidal behaviour in Polish patients with mood disorder recently admitted to a psychiatric hospital owing to an acute depressive episode. Materials and methods The study was conducted on 223 patients (73 male and 150 female) with unipolar ( n =171) and bipolar ( n =52) depression. They were interviewed to assess any occurrence of suicidal thoughts, suicidal tendencies and/or suicidal attempts during the 3 months before admission. Laboratory measurements [total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and total lipids] were obtained within 24–72 h after hospital admission. Results Suicidal thoughts, tendencies, and attempts were associated with low total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and total lipids in both male and female patients, in both diagnostic categories. Triglycerides were significantly lower in male and female patients with suicidal thoughts compared with their non-suicidal counterparts. No association with suicidality was found with HDL cholesterol. Conclusions The results of our study support a majority of research showing the association in depressed patients between suicidal behaviour and low levels of total and LDL cholesterol. In addition, the data suggest a similar association with low total lipids, and in some instances, with low triglycerides.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is the leading cause of dementia in the world whose aetiology is still unclear. AD was always related to ageing though there have been instances where people at an early age also succumb to this disease. With medical advancements, the mortality rate has significantly reduced which also makes people more prone to AD. AD is rare, yet the prominent disease has been widely studied with several hypotheses trying to understand the workings of its onset. The most recent and popular hypothesis in AD is the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium homeostasis in the development of the disease though their exact roles are not known. With the sudden advent of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), many previously known pathological hallmarks of AD may be better understood. Several studies have shown the effect of excess calcium in mitochondria and the influence of MCU complex in mitochondrial function. In this article, we discuss the possible involvement of MCU in AD by linking the uniporter to mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium homeostasis, reactive oxygen species, neurotransmitters and the hallmarks of AD – amyloid plaque formation and tau tangle formation.",

Streptococcal infection in paediatric patients causing obsessive compulsive disorder (PANDAS) is another recent example of an infection-based psychiatric disorder. Inflammation associated with neuropsychiatric disorders has been previously reported but there is no standard clinical management approach established. Part of the reason is that it is unclear what factors determine the specific neuronal vulnerability and the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatment in neuroinflammation. The emerging COVID-19 data suggested that in the acute stage, widespread neuronal damage appears to be the result of abnormal and overactive immune responses and cytokine storm is associated with poor prognosis. It is still too early to know if there are long-term-specific neuronal or brain regional damages associated with COVID-19, resulting in distinct neuropsychiatric disorders. In several major psychiatric disorders where neuroinflammation is present, patients with abnormal inflammatory markers may also experience less than favourable response or treatment resistance when standard treatment is used alone. Evidence regarding the benefits of co-administered anti-inflammatory agents such as COX-2 inhibitor is encouraging in selected patients though may not benefit others. Disease-modifying therapies are increasingly being applied to neuropsychiatric diseases characterised by abnormal or hyperreactive immune responses. Adjunct anti-inflammatory treatment may benefit selected patients and is definitely an important component of clinical management in the presence of neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Early flow cytometry studies revealed T cell activation in major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is characterised by activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS) and the compensatory immunoregulatory system (CIRS), including deficits in T regulatory (Treg) cells. This study examines the number of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2) receptor-bearing T/B lymphocytes in MDD, and the effects of in vitro cannabidiol (CBD) administration on CB1/CB2-bearing immunocytes. Using flow cytometry, we determined the percentage of CD20+CB2+, CD3+CB2+, CD4+CB2+, CD8+CB2+ and FoxP3+CB1+ cells in 19 healthy controls and 29 MDD patients in 5 conditions: baseline, stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 with or without 0.1 µg/mL, 1.0 µg/mL, or 10.0 µg/mL CBD. CB2+ was significantly higher in CD20+ than CD3+ and CD4+ and CD 8+ cells. Stimulation with anti-CD3/CD8 increases the number of CB2-bearing CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells, as well as CB1-bearing FoxP3+ cells. There was an inverse association between the number of reduced CD4+ CB2+ and IRS profiles, including M1 macrophage, T helper-(Th)-1 and Th-17 phenotypes. MDD is characterised by lowered basal FoxP3+ CB1+% and higher CD20+ CB2+%. 33.2% of the variance in the depression phenome (including severity of depression, anxiety and current suicidal behaviours) is explained by CD20+ CB2+ % (positively) and CD3+ CB2+% (inversely). All five immune cell populations were significantly increased by 10 µg/mL of CBD administration. Reductions in FoxP3+ CB1+% and CD3+ /CD4+ CB2+% contribute to deficits in immune homoeostasis in MDD, while increased CD20+CB2+% may contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD by activating T-independent humoral immunity.",

For bipolar disorder, the use has been more limited and no studies exist concerning accuracy of bipolar I diagnoses in registers. We have collected an unselected twin sample for a study of bipolar I disorder. We report here the diagnostic procedures and accuracy of bipolar I diagnoses in a nation-wide hospital discharge registry. We evaluated also the accuracy of the medical record-based best-estimate diagnoses, comparing these with the SCID interview diagnoses. From the National Hospital Discharge Register we identified all like-sex twins, born 1940-1957, (N=42), and all like- or opposite-sex twins, born 1961-1969, (N=15), who had at least once a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The best-estimate diagnoses based on medical records, and were made by two doctors blind to each other, and according to DSM-IV-criteria. Diag-noses were then confirmed by SCID interviews, with the mi-nimum follow-up time after the first admission being 6 years. The accuracy of bipolar diagnoses in the register was 92% and 87%, accordingly. When comparing the best-estimate diagnoses to SCID interview diagnoses, there was one false positive case in the first sample, 3.4% [95% CI 0.1% to 7.8%], and none in the second sample. Our study shows that a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder in the hospital discharge register, or if based only on medical records, is highly reliable and stable. These results strengthen the usefulness of regis-ters also in bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "Emotion regulation involves the initiation of new emotional responses and continual alteration of current emotions in response to rapidly changing environmental and social stimuli. The capacity to effectively implement emotion regulation strategies is essential for psychological health; impairments in the ability to regulate emotions may be critical to the development of clinical levels of depression, anxiety and mania.This review provides a summary of findings from current research examining the neural mechanisms of emotion regulation by means of conscious cognitive strategies of reappraisal. These findings are considered in the context of related concepts of emotion perception and emotion generation, with discussion of the likely cognitive neuropsychological contributions to emotion regulation and the implications for psychiatric disorders.Convergent evidence implicates an inhibitory role of prefrontal cortex and cingulate regions upon subcortical and cortical emotion generation systems in the cognitive control of emotional experience. Concurrent modulation of cortical activity by the peripheral nervous system is highlighted by recent studies using simultaneous physiological and neuroimaging techniques. Individual differences in emotion perception, generation of affect and neuropsychological skills are likely to have direct consequences for emotion regulation.Emotion regulation relies on synergy within brain stem, limbic and cortical processes that promote the adaptive perception, generation and regulation of affect. Aberrant emotion processing in any of these stages may disrupt this self-sustaining regulatory system, with the potential to manifest in distinct forms of emotion dysregulation as seen in major psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.",

Objective: To examine whether psychological therapies modulate brain activity and, if so, to examine whether these changes similar to those found with relevant pharmacotherapy in various mental disorders. Methods: Relevant data were identified from Pubmed and PsycInfo searches up to July 2005 using combinations of keywords including ‘psychological therapy’, ‘behaviour therapy’, ‘depression’, ‘panic disorder’, ‘phobia’, ‘obsessive compulsive disorder’, ‘schizophrenia’, ‘psychosis’, ‘brain activity’, ‘brain metabolism’, ‘PET’, ‘SPECT’ and ‘fMRI’. Results: There was ample evidence to demonstrate that psychological therapies produce changes at the neural level. The data, for example in depression, panic disorder, phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), clearly suggested that a change in patients' symptoms and maladaptive behaviour at the mind level with psychological techniques is accompanied with functional brain changes in relevant brain circuits. In many studies, cognitive therapies and drug therapies achieved therapeutic gains through the same neural pathways although the two forms of treatment may still have different mechanisms of action. Conclusions: Empirical research indicates a close association between the ‘mind’ and the ‘brain’ in showing that changes made at the mind level in a psychotherapeutic context produce changes at the brain level. The investigation of changes in neural activity with psychological therapies is a novel area which is likely to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms for therapeutic changes across a range of disorders.",

The subjects were evaluated with a comprehensive assessment battery using Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders (SCID-II) diagnostic tool for BDD, Global Assessment of Functioning, Traumatic Experiences Checklist and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.The prevalence of BDD was 54.3% in the borderline sample.

Traumatic experiences were significant predictor of comorbid BDD diagnosis in BPD patients.Our results suggest a relatively high prevalence of BDD among patients with BPD, and co-occurrence of BDD and BPD remains to be clarified. The additional diagnosis of BDD in patients with BPD may cause a more severe global illness, and these two disorders may share, at least partly, a common psychopathologic mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Stewart G, McGeown WJ, Shanks MF, Venneri A. Anosognosia for memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Objective To investigate whether patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were able to alter their awareness of memory deficits after exposure to a memory task.Thirty normal older adults and 23 mild AD patients participated in the study. Anosognosia was assessed using discrepancies between self- and informant-evaluations of cognitive and functional performance. Participants estimated their performance on the Verbal Paired Associates task at different points in time (before, immediately after the task and after a 1-h delay).AD patients were generally less able to judge their memory abilities than healthy older adults, and tended to overestimate their task performance beforehand. Their prediction accuracy increased immediately after the task, but after a 1-h delay, they again misjudged their abilities at pretesting accuracy levels. Self-carer discrepancy scores of awareness of deficits in memory and other areas correlated significantly with memory tests but not with other neuropsychological tasks in the assessment, and larger discrepancy scores were associated with poorer performance.AD patients can monitor their task performance online, but are unable to maintain awareness of their deficits over time. Loss of awareness of memory deficits (or of any other deficits) in early stage AD may indicate damage to a system which updates a personal knowledge base with recent information. Failure to retain this information impedes abstraction from episodic to semantic memory.",

Abnormal grey matter in victims of rape with PTSD in Mainland China: a voxel-based morphometry study.This study examined changes in brain grey matter in victims of rape (VoR) with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previous research has focused on PTSD caused by various traumatic events, such as war and disaster, among others. Although considerable research has focused on rape-related PTSD, limited studies have been carried out in the context of Mainland China.The study included 11 VoR with PTSD, 8 VoR without PTSD and 12 healthy comparison (HC) subjects. We used voxel-based morphometry to explore changes in brain grey-matter density (GMD) by applying statistical parametric mapping to high-resolution magnetic resonance images.Compared with HC, VoR with PTSD showed significant GMD reductions in the bilateral medial frontal cortex, left middle frontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus and fusiform cortex and significant GMD increases in the right posterior cingulate cortex, postcentral cortex, bilateral precentral cortex and inferior parietal lobule. Compared to VoR without PTSD, VoR with PTSD showed significant GMD reductions in the right uncus, left middle temporal gyrus, and the fusiform cortex, and increases in the left precentral cortex, inferior parietal lobule and right post-central cortex.The findings of abnormal GMD in VoR with PTSD support the hypothesis that PTSD is associated with widespread anatomical changes in the brain. The medial frontal cortex, precentral cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, post-central cortex and inferior parietal lobule may play important roles in the neuropathology of PTSD.",

Clinical observations prompted a review of the pre-clinical and clinical literature on the effects of antidepressant administration or treatment on sperm production and parameters. Findings from the review are discussed to suggest potential underlying mechanisms.Abnormal sperm parameters were associated with treatment with the SSRI citalopram. There was an improvement in sperm concentration, motility, progressive motility and sperm morphology following its withdrawal. There was no similar association during subsequent treatment with agomelatine. The clinical observations reflect findings from animal studies, which indicate that antidepressants can have untoward effects on spermatogenesis.SSRI treatment can be associated with impaired semen quality. Potential underlying mechanisms include changes in sperm DNA integrity, activation of IDO and shifting tryptophan metabolism. Further studies of the effects of antidepressants on spermatogenesis might benefit from including investigation of changes in IDO activity during antidepressant administration.",

    "abstract": "Background The hot water tail-flick test is widely used to measure the degree of nociception experienced by laboratory animals. This study was carried out to optimise interval times for the hot water immersion tail-flick tests in rats. Method Ten different intervals from 10 s to 1 h were tested in 60 Sprague–Dawley male rats. At least eight rats were tested for each interval in three consecutive hot water tail-flick tests. Dixon's up-and-down method was also used to find the optimal intervals. The same rats were then divided into two groups. In Group N, naloxone was injected to reverse the prolonged latency times, whereas saline was used in the control Group S. Results Intervals of 10 s, 20 s, 30 min and 1 h did not significantly impact latencies, yielding similar results in three consecutive tests ( p &gt; 0.05). However, interval times of between 30 s and 20 min, inclusively, caused significantly prolonged latencies in the second and third tests ( p &lt; 0.001). Dixon's up-and-down method showed that 95% of the rats had prolonged latencies in hot water tail-flick tests at intervals longer than 32 s. Naloxone reversed prolonged latencies in Group N, whereas the latencies in Group S were further prolonged in 5 min interval tests. Conclusion The optimal intervals for hot water tail-flick tests are either shorter than 20 s or longer than 20 min. The prolonged latencies after repetitive tests were attributable to an endocrine opioid.",

Background: In remitted bipolar disorder, it is aimed to show the association between social anxiety, self-esteem and stigmatisation. Methods: From two university clinics, a sample of 150 remitted bipolar patients was included in this study. Patients were assessed with Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and sense of stigmatisation subscale of Bipolar Disorder Functioning Questionnaire (Stigma) and were rated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale for mood symptoms. Confirmatory path analysis was performed. Results: The mean age of the patients was 39.5, and 52.7% ( n = 79) were female. Ninety per cent ( n = 135) of the patients had bipolar I disorder. The mean duration of the illness was 13.4 years and the mean number of episodes was 7.8. The model was subjected to confirmatory path analysis and the goodness-of-fit index was calculated to be 0.909, the confirmatory fit index was found to be 0.902 and the root mean square error of approximation was 0.097. Self-esteem was negatively associated with stigmatisation ( r = −0.746). Social anxiety was positively associated with self-esteem ( r = 0.494). Social anxiety was negatively associated with stigmatisation ( r = −0.381). Conclusions: In remitted bipolar patients, social anxiety is very high and this social anxiety seems to be caused by self-stigmatisation and low self-esteem.",

Previous animal studies have suggested that striatal dopamine receptors play a critical role in impulsivity. In this study, we investigated the relationship between self-reported impulsiveness and dopamine D(2/3) receptor availability in striatal subdivisions in healthy subjects using high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) with [11C]raclopride.Twenty-one participants completed 3-T magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution PET scans with [11C]raclopride. The trait of impulsiveness was measured using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). Partial correlation analysis was performed between BIS-11 scores and D(2/3) receptor availability in striatal subregions, controlling for the confounding effects of temperament characteristics that are conceptually or empirically related to dopamine, which were measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory.The analysis revealed that the non-planning (p = 0.004) and attentional (p = 0.007) impulsiveness subscale scores on the BIS-11 had significant positive correlations with D(2/3) receptor availability in the pre-commissural dorsal caudate. There was a tendency towards positive correlation between non-planning impulsiveness score and D(2/3) receptor availability in the post-commissural caudate.These results suggest that cognitive subtrait of impulsivity is associated with D(2/3) receptor availability in the associative striatum that plays a critical role in cognitive processes involving attention to detail, judgement of alternative outcomes, and inhibitory control.",

The objective of this study was to examine the association between serum BDNF levels as a possible peripheral indicator of suicide behaviour in subjects suffering from depression, personality disorders (PDs) and adjustment disorders (ADs) with or without suicide attempt. Methods The research included 172 randomly selected individuals suffering from recurrent depressive disorder (RDD; F 33.2), emotionally unstable PD (F 60.3) and AD (F 43.2), with or without attempted suicide according to the criteria of the ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision) and 60 phenotypically health control subjects. In the group of patients, 73% subjects took some form of psychopharmacotherapy. Serum BDNF levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results Subjects with PD and AD with suicide attempts had significantly lower serum BDNF levels than those without suicide attempts. In groups of subjects with PD and AD, those taking psychopharmacotherapy had higher serum BDNF levels. In the group of subjects with RDD, there were no differences with respect to suicide attempts or psychopharmacotherapy. Logistical regression analysis was indicated that psychopharmcotherapy and serum BDNF levels statistically correlated with suicide attempts. Conclusion The lower levels of BDNF in subjects suffering from PD and AD with suicide attempts, suggest that the serum BDNF level is a potential marker of suicidal behaviour, independent of mental disorders.",

Therefore, analyses with larger sample sizes and better methodology are needed. Methods To examine whether acute schizophrenia is associated with cardiac autonomic dysfunction, 314 unmedicated patients with acute schizophrenia and 409 healthy volunteers, aged 18–65 years, were recruited for a case–control analysis. The severity of schizophrenia symptoms was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) parameters during the supine–standing–supine test. Frequency-domain indices of HRV were obtained. Results Unmedicated patients with acute schizophrenia consistently exhibited reduced mean RR interval and HRV levels in a supine rest and standing position compared with healthy volunteers. The severity of psychopathology, in particular positive symptoms, was negatively correlated with cardiac vagal control. Conclusion These data suggest that acute schizophrenia is accompanied by cardiac autonomic dysregulation. In view of the higher risk for cardiac complications in these patients, one might also consider the antipsychotic treatment in favour of improving cardiac autonomic modulation. Further studies using larger patient groups and controlled therapeutics may better understand the influence of antipsychotic treatment on cardiac autonomic regulation in schizophrenia.",

However, it is not yet clear if repeated treatment with these drugs is required to induce antidepressant-like effects in preclinical models. Objective The aim of this study was to test the effect induced by acute or repeated (7 days) treatment with 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), a preferential inhibitor of neuronal NOS, in rats submitted to the learned helplessness (LH) model. In addition, we aimed at investigating if 7-NI treatment would increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels in the hippocampus, similarly to the effect of prototype antidepressants. Methods Animals were submitted to a pre-test (PT) session with inescapable footshocks or habituation (no shocks) to the experimental shuttle box. Six days later they were exposed to a test with escapable footshocks. Independent groups received acute (a single injection after PT or before test) or repeated (once a day for 7 days) treatment with vehicle or 7-NI (30 mg/kg). Results Repeated, but not acute, treatment with 7-NI attenuated LH development. The effect was similar to repeated imipramine treatment. Moreover, in an independent experimental group, only repeated treatment with 7-NI and imipramine increased BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus. Conclusion The results suggest the nitrergic system could be a target for the treatment of depressive-like conditions. They also indicate that, similar to the positive control imipramine, the antidepressant-like effects of NOS inhibition could involve an increase in hippocampal BDNF levels.",

Methodology Electronic searches were carried out to locate studies reporting various aspects of OCS/OCD in patients with schizophrenia. Results Available evidence suggests that prevalence of OCS/OCD in patients with schizophrenia is much higher than prevalence in general population and it is seen in all the stages of schizophrenia, starting from at risk mental state to chronic/stabilisation/deficit phases. Symptom profile of OCS/OCD in schizophrenia is similar to that seen in patients with OCD only. Presence of OCS/OCD is associated with higher severity of symptoms of schizophrenia and more negative outcome. At present there is very limited data on the efficacy/effectiveness of various pharmacological measures and psychological interventions, for management of OCS/OCD in patients with schizophrenia. There is some evidence pointing towards beneficial effect of certain antipsychotics, antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy. Management of OCS/OCD in patients with schizophrenia involves proper assessment. If the OCS/OCD is related to use of particular antipsychotic use, initial attempt must be made to reduce the dose of antipsychotics, however, if this is not effective, than addition of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) must be considered. If the OCS/OCD is not related to the use of antipsychotic medication, than depending up on the severity of psychotic symptoms, addition of SSRIs must be considered. Conclusion This review suggests that OCS/OCD is highly prevalent among patients with schizophrenia and there is limited good quality evidence to make any specific recommendations for management.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate to what extent a twice daily dose of Transcranial Pulsating ElectroMagnetic Fields (T-PEMF) was superior to once daily in patients with treatment-resistant depression as to obtaining symptom remission after 8 weeks of augmentation therapy. METHODS: A self-treatment set-up of the T-PEMF device was used allowing self-administration by patients in own homes. All patients were treated for 30 min per T-PEMF session. The antidepressant medication the patients were receiving at baseline remained unchanged during the trial. The patients were randomised to either one T-PEMF dose (active dose in the morning and sham in the afternoon) or two T-PEMF doses (active dose both morning and afternoon) in a double-blind procedure. A score of 7 or less on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) was the criterion of remission. RESULTS: In total 34 patients received active T-PEMF once a day and 31 patients twice daily. After 5 weeks of therapy remission was obtained in 26.5% and 32.3% on one dose and two doses of T-PEMF, respectively. After 8 weeks the rate of remission was 73.5% and 67.7%, respectively. The side effects as measured by the Udvalget for Kliniske Undersøgelser scale showed a better toleration of the antidepresssive medication in both treatment groups, which was reflected by the WHO-5 well-being scale with increased scores in both groups of patients. CONCLUSION: The high remission rate obtained by the T-PEMF augmentation was not a dose effect (one versus two daily T-PEMF sessions) but was explained by the extension of the treatment period from 5 to 8 weeks.",

It is conceivable that Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission is implicated in the pathophysiology of ADHD. This study investigated the effect of GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) on the anxiety-like behaviours and cognitive function in knockout mice.In all, 20 adult male mice were divided into two groups: wild-type (WT) group and GAT-1-/- group. The open field test, elevated O-maze (EZM) and Morris water maze were used to evaluate behavioural traits relevant to ADHD.Compared with WT mice, the GAT-1-/- mice travelled longer and displayed an enhanced kinematic velocity with the significant reduction of rest time in the open field test (p<0.05). The EZM showed that GAT-1-/- mice displayed a significant increase in total entries into the open sectors and the closed sectors compared with the WT mice. The WT mice showed shorter latencies after the training session (p<0.01), whereas the GAT-1-/- mice made no difference during probe test, the GAT-1-/- mice spent less time in the target quadrant (p<0.01).Our results demonstrated that GAT-1-/- mice have phenotypes of hyperactivity, impaired sustained attention and learning deficiency, and the performance of GAT-1-/- mice is similar to ADHD symptoms. So, the study of the GAT-1-/- mice may provide new insights into the mechanisms and the discovery of novel therapeutics for the treatment of ADHD.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aim Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and well-tolerated brain stimulation technique with promising efficacy as an add-on treatment for schizophrenia and for several other psychiatric disorders. tDCS modulates neuroplasticity; psychiatric disorders are established to be associated with neuroplasticity abnormalities. This review presents the summary of research on potential genetic basis of neuroplasticity-modulation mechanism underlying tDCS and its implications for treating various psychiatric disorders. Method A systematic review highlighting the genes involved in neuroplasticity and their role in psychiatric disorders was carried out. The focus was on the established genetic findings of tDCS response relationship with BDNF and COMT gene polymorphisms. Result Synthesis of these preliminary observations suggests the potential influence of neuroplastic genes on tDCS treatment response. These include several animal models, pharmacological studies, mentally ill and healthy human subject trials. Conclusion Taking into account the rapidly unfolding understanding of tDCS and the role of synaptic plasticity disturbances in neuropsychiatric disorders, in-depth evaluation of the mechanism of action pertinent to neuroplasticity modulation with tDCS needs further systematic research. Genes such as NRG1, DISC1, as well as those linked with the glutamatergic receptor in the context of their direct role in the modulation of neuronal signalling related to neuroplasticity aberrations, are leading candidates for future research in this area. Such research studies might potentially unravel observations that might have potential translational implications in psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Objective Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a new group of antidiabetic medications quickly gaining popularity. We aimed to examine behavioural and neuroendocrine changes following chronic treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists in animal models. Methods The effects of chronic treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists were determined on behavioural parameters [anxiety level in the light–dark compartment test, the motor activity in automated activity cages, immobility in the forced swimming test (FST)] and on corticosterone release in mice. The possible antidepressant effect of chronic liraglutide treatment was also studied in Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a genetic model of depression. Results Two weeks of treatment with exenatide (10 µg /kg twice daily) or liraglutide (1200 µg/kg once daily) did not affect the anxiety level in a light–dark compartment test nor induce an antidepressant-like effect in the FST in mice. Moreover, chronic treatment with liraglutide had no effect on depression-related behaviour in FSL rats. Interestingly, hypolocomotion induced by the drugs in mice disappeared after chronic dosing. Both of the GLP-1 receptor agonists induced robust increases in corticosterone levels in mice under basal conditions as well as in the case of combination with swimming stress. Remarkably, exenatide was as potent a stimulator of corticosterone release after 2 weeks as after acute administration. Conclusions The increases in corticosterone release seen after acute exenatide or liraglutide treatment do not abate after 2 weeks of treatment demonstrating that tolerance does not develop towards this particular effect of GLP-1 agonists.",

    "abstract": "Objective Co-morbid depression with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often treatment resistant. In developing a preclinical model of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), we combined animal models of depression and PTSD to produce an animal with more severe as well as treatment-resistant depressive-like behaviours. Methods Male Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats, a genetic animal model of depression, were exposed to a stress re-stress model of PTSD [time-dependent sensitisation (TDS)] and compared with stress-naive controls. Seven days after TDS stress, depressive-like and coping behaviours as well as hippocampal and cortical noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) levels were analysed. Response to sub-chronic imipramine treatment (IMI; 10 mg/kg s.c.×7 days) was subsequently studied. Results FSL rats demonstrated bio-behavioural characteristics of depression. Exposure to TDS stress in FSL rats correlated negatively with weight gain, while demonstrating reduced swimming behaviour and increased immobility versus unstressed FSL rats. IMI significantly reversed depressive-like (immobility) behaviour and enhanced active coping behaviour (swimming and climbing) in FSL rats. The latter was significantly attenuated in FSL rats exposed to TDS versus unstressed FSL rats. IMI reversed reduced 5HIAA levels in unstressed FSL rats, whereas exposure to TDS negated this effect. Lowered NA levels in FSL rats were sustained after TDS with IMI significantly reversing this in the hippocampus. Conclusion Combining a gene-X-environment model of depression with a PTSD paradigm produces exaggerated depressive-like symptoms that display an attenuated response to antidepressant treatment. This work confirms combining FSL rats with TDS exposure as a putative animal model of TRD.",

Higher-IAT (more than 50 score, with moderate or severe internet addiction) and lower-IAT (<50 score, with no internet addiction).Alpha band and RTs were affected by IAT, with significant bias (reduced RTs) for high-IAT in response to gambling videos and videogames; and by BAS, BAS-Reward subscale (BAS-R), since not only higher-IAT, but also BAS and BAS-R values determined an increasing of left prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity (alpha reduction) in response to videogames and gambling stimuli for both Go and NoGo conditions, in addition to decreased RTs for these stimuli categories.The increased PFC responsiveness and the lateralisation (left PFC hemisphere) effect in NoGo condition was explained on the basis of a 'rewarding bias' towards more rewarding cues and a deficit in inhibitory control in higher-IAT and higher-BAS subjects. In contrast lower-IAT and lower-BAS predicted a decreased PFC response and increased RTs for NoGo (inhibitory mechanism). These results may support the significance of personality (BAS) and IAT measures for explaining future internet addiction behaviour based on this observed 'vulnerability'.",

Methods Data from 1122 patients with depressive disorders in the REAP-AD study were used. The ICD-10 was employed to diagnose depressive episodes and recurrent depressive disorder. The presence or absence of suicidal thoughts/acts and profile of other depressive symptoms was established using the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for depression. Country/area differences in rates of suicidal thoughts/acts were evaluated with the χ 2 test. In addition, depressive symptom profiles, other clinical characteristics, and patterns of psychotropic drug prescription in depressed patients with and without suicidal thoughts/acts were compared using analysis of covariance for continuous variables and logistic regression analysis for discrete variables to adjust the effects of covariates. Results The rates of suicidal thoughts/acts in 10 countries/areas varied from 12.8% in Japan to 36.3% in China. Patients with suicidal thoughts/acts presented more persistent sadness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.64, p &lt;0.001), loss of interest (aOR=2.33, p &lt;0.001), fatigue (aOR=1.58, p &lt;0.001), insomnia (aOR=1.74, p &lt;0.001), poor concentration (aOR=1.88, p &lt;0.001), low self-confidence (aOR=1.78, p &lt;0.001), poor appetite (aOR=2.27, p &lt;0.001), guilt/self-blame (aOR=3.03, p &lt;0.001), and use of mood stabilisers (aOR=1.79, p &lt;0.001) than those without suicidal thoughts/acts. Conclusion Suicidal thoughts/acts can indicate greater severity of depression, and are associated with a poorer response to antidepressants and increased burden of illness. Hence, suicidal thoughts/acts can provide a clinical index reflecting the clinical status of depressive disorders in Asians.",

While neurobiological correlates have only partially been elucidated, altered levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-like immunoreactivity (LI) in animal models and in the cerebrospinal fluid of depressed patients were reported, suggesting that CGRP may be involved in the pathophysiology and/or be a trait marker of MDD. However, changes in CGRP brain levels resulting from interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors and the response to antidepressant treatment have not been explored.We therefore superimposed maternal separation (MS) onto a genetic rat model (Flinders-sensitive and -resistant lines, FSL/FRL) of depression, treated these rats with antidepressants (escitalopram and nortriptyline) and measured CGRP-LI in selected brain regions.CGRP was elevated in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala (but not in the hypothalamus) of FSL rats. However, MS did not significantly alter levels of this peptide. Likewise, there were no significant interactions between the genetic and environmental factors. Most importantly, neither escitalopram nor nortriptyline significantly altered brain CGRP levels.Our data demonstrate that increased brain levels of CGRP are present in a well-established rat model of depression. Given that antidepressants have virtually no effect on the brain level of this peptide, our study indicates that further research is needed to evaluate the functional role of CGRP in the FSL model for depression.",

    "abstract": "A number of atypical antipsychotic drugs were demonstrated to have anxiolytic effects in patients and in animal models. These effects were mostly suggested to be the consequence of the drugs' affinity to the serotonin system and its receptors. Asenapine is a relatively new atypical antipsychotic that is prescribed for schizophrenia and for bipolar mania. Asenapine has a broad pharmacological profile with significant effects on serotonergic receptors, hence it is reasonable to expect that asenapine may have some anxiolytic effects. The present study was therefore designed to examine possible effects of asenapine on anxiety-like behaviour of mice.Male ICR mice were repeatedly treated with 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg injections of asenapine and then tested in a battery of behavioural tests related to anxiety including the open-field test, elevated plus-maze (EPM), defensive marble burying and hyponeophagia tests. In an adjunct experiment, we tested the effects of acute diazepam in the same test battery.The results show that diazepam reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM, the defensive marble burying test and the hyponeophagia test but not in the open field. Asenapine has anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM and the defensive marble burying tests but had no effects in the open-field or the hyponeophagia tests. Asenapine had no effects on locomotor activity.The results suggest that asenapine may have anxiolytic-like properties and recommends that clinical trials examining such effects should be performed.",

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of such polymorphisms on hippocampal volume in patients with treatment-resistant MDD and healthy controls. Candidate gene risk alleles were hypothesised to be associated with reductions in hippocampal volume. Methods A total of 26 outpatients with treatment-resistant MDD and 27 matched healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging and genotyping for six SNPs in monoaminergic genes [serotonin transporter ( SLC6A4 ), norepinephrine transporter ( SLC6A2 ), serotonin 1A and 2A receptors ( HTR1A and HTR2A ), catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF )]. Hippocampal volume was estimated using an automated segmentation algorithm (FreeSurfer). Results Hippocampal volume did not differ between patients and controls. Within the entire study sample irrespective of diagnosis, C allele-carriers for both the NET−182 T/C [rs2242446] and 5-HT 1A −1019C/G [rs6295] polymorphisms had smaller hippocampal volumes relative to other genotypes. For the 5-HTTLPR (rs25531) polymorphism, there was a significant diagnosis by genotype interaction effect on hippocampal volume. Among patients only, homozygosity for the 5-HTTLPR short (S) allele was associated with smaller hippocampal volume. There was no association between the 5-HT 2A , COMT , and BDNF SNPs and hippocampal volume. Conclusion The results indicate that the volume of the hippocampus may be influenced by serotonin- and norepinephrine-related gene polymorphisms. The NET and 5-HT 1A polymorphisms appear to have similar effects on hippocampal volume in patients and controls while the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism differentially affects hippocampal volume in the presence of depression.",

We assayed, in plasma, IgA responses to six Gram-negative bacteria, that is, Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas putida and Citobacter koseri, progesterone and oestradiol at days 7, 14, 21 and 28 of the menstrual cycle.Significant changes in Δ (actual - 1 week earlier) IgA to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of the six Gram-negative bacteria during the menstrual cycle were observed with peak IgA levels at T4 (day 28) and lows at T1 or T2 (day 7 or 14). The ΔIgA changes in H. alvei, M. Morganii, P. putida during the menstrual cycle were significantly and positively associated with changes in the total DRSP score, and severity of physio-somatic, anxiety and breast-craving, but not depressive, symptoms. The changes in IgA responses to LPS were largely predicted by changes in progesterone and steady-state levels of progesterone averaged over the luteal phase.Menstrual cycle-associated changes in IgA directed against LPS and by inference bacterial translocation may be driven by the effects of progesterone on transcellular, paracellular and vascular pathways (leaky gut) thereby contributing to the severity of physio-somatic and anxiety symptoms as well as fatigue, breast swelling and food cravings.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a debilitating, lifelong neuropsychiatric illness characterised by unsteady mood states which vacillate from (hypo)mania to depression. Despite the availability of pharmaceutical agents which can be effective in ameliorating the acute affective symptoms and prevent episodic relapse, BD is inadequately treated in a subset of patients. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is known to exert neuromodulatory effects on other neurotransmitter systems critical in governing emotions. Several studies ranging from clinical to molecular, as well as anecdotal evidence, have placed a spotlight on the potential role of the ECS in the pathophysiology of BD. In this perspective, we present advantages and disadvantages of cannabis use in the management of illness course of BD and provide mechanistic insights into how this system might contribute to the pathophysiology of BD. RESULTS: We highlight the putative role of selective cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonists in BD and briefly discuss findings which provide a rationale for targeting the ECS to assuage the symptoms of BD. Further, data encourage basic and clinical studies to determine how cannabis and cannabinoids (CBs) can affect mood and to investigate emerging CB-based options as probable treatment approaches. CONCLUSION: The probable role of the ECS has been almost neglected in BD; however, from data available which suggest a role of ECS in mood control, it is justified to support conducting comprehensive studies to determine whether ECS manipulation could positively affect BD. Based on the limited available data, we suggest that activation of CB2 may stabilise mood in this disorder.",

It is modelled by administration of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to induce expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines that then activate indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Here, we ask whether chronic IDO1 inhibition by 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT, added at 2 g/l in the drinking water) or chronic inhibition of tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO2), another enzyme capable of converting tryptophan to kynurenine, by 680C91 (15 mg/kg per os), can rescue LPS-induced (0.83-mg/kg intraperitoneally) anxiety and cognitive deficits. We also investigate the acute effects of 680C91 on serotonergic, dopaminergic, and kynurenine pathway metabolites.We examined LPS-induced deficits in trace fear conditioning and anxiety in the light-dark box and elevated plus maze (EPM) in group-housed C57Bl6/N mice. Kynurenine pathway metabolites and monoamine levels were measured via high-performance liquid chromatography.Chronic blockade of IDO1 with 1-MT did not rescue cognitive deficits or abrogate the anxiogenic behaviour caused by LPS despite a decrease in the brain kynurenine:tryptophan ratio. However, 1-MT by itself demonstrated anxiolytic properties in the EPM. Acute and chronic inhibition of TDO2 elevated brain levels of tryptophan, while chronic inhibition of TDO2 was unsuccessful in rescuing cognitive deficits and abrogating the anxiety caused by LPS.In line with previous studies, we show that LPS administration induces anxiety and cognitive dysfunctions in mice that however were not reversed by chronic blockade of IDO1 or TDO2 at the doses used.",

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in cardiovascular processes. Depressed patients typically show decreased BDNF concentrations. We analysed the relationship between BDNF and depression in a sample of patients with CHD and additionally distinguished between cognitive-affective and somatic depression symptoms. We also investigated whether BDNF was associated with somatic comorbidity burden, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or congestive heart failure (CHF). Methods: The following variables were assessed for 225 hospitalised patients with CHD: BDNF concentrations, depression [Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)], somatic comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index), CHF, ACS, platelet count, smoking status and antidepressant treatment. Results: Regression models revealed that BDNF was not associated with severity of depression. Although depressed patients (PHQ-9 score &gt;7) had significantly lower BDNF concentrations compared to non-depressed patients ( p = 0.04), this was not statistically significant after controlling for confounders ( p = 0.15). Cognitive-affective symptoms and somatic comorbidity burden each closely missed a statistically significant association with BDNF concentrations ( p = 0.08, p = 0.06, respectively). BDNF was reduced in patients with CHF ( p = 0.02). There was no covariate-adjusted, significant association between BDNF and ACS. Conclusion: Serum BDNF concentrations are associated with cardiovascular dysfunction. Somatic comorbidities should be considered when investigating the relationship between depression and BDNF.",

This study aims to describe the impact of prenatal restraint stress on cognition and exploration to an unfamiliar environment at adulthood in an outbred strain of mice. Methods: Late pregnant mice were exposed to restraint stress and adult offspring (60 days of age) behaviours were assessed in the object recognition task and open field test. Findings: Prenatal stress (PNS) impaired new object recognition in male and female mice. Importantly, the learning deficits in female PNS mice were linked to their estrous cycle. Actually, PNS females in metestrus/diestrus but not in proestrus/estrus phases displayed recognition deficits compared to controls. Concerning locomotion in an unfamiliar environment, male but not female PNS mice displayed significant increase, but showed no differences in the distance travelled within the centre zone of the arena. Conclusion: Present findings support the view that maternal restraint-stress during late pregnancy impairs recognition memory in both male and female offspring, and in females, this cognitive deficit is dependent on the estrous cycle phase. Ultimately, these data reinforce that PNS is an aetiological component of psychiatric disorders associated with memory deficits.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the differences between unipolar mania and bipolar disorder in terms of clinical and inflammatory parameters. Methods: The data of 495 hospitalised patients with bipolar disorder diagnoses were analysed retrospectively. Forty met the diagnostic criteria for unipolar mania. Two patients refused to participate in the study. Thirty-eight unipolar mania patients and 42 randomly selected patients with bipolar disorder diagnosis were included in the study. The two groups were compared in terms of sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor, C-reactive protein (CRP), leucocyte and cytokine levels. Results: A total of 40 (8.08%) of 495 patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder met the unipolar mania diagnostic criteria. The number of manic episodes and the number of hospitalisations were statistically higher in the unipolar mania group than in the bipolar disorder group. Among all the manic symptoms, the incidence of symptoms such as euphoria, increased sexual interest, grandiosity and delusions were found to be statistically higher in the unipolar mania group. Interleukin (IL)-6 and CRP levels were significantly higher in the unipolar mania group than in the bipolar disorder group. Conclusion: Unipolar mania differs from bipolar disorder in terms of clinical features and serum IL-6 and CRP levels.",

We hypothesised that there will be neural network patterns of activation and deactivation, which correspond to real-time performance on clinical self-evaluation scales. Methods In total, 20 healthy controls (HC) and 22 patients with major depressive episode have been included. All subjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with paradigm composed of diagnostic clinical self-assessment depression scale contrasted to neutral scale. The data were processed with group independent component analysis for functional MRI toolbox and statistical parametric mapping. Results The results have demonstrated that there exist positively or negatively modulated brain networks during processing of diagnostic specific task questions for depressive disorder. There have also been confirmed differences in the networks processing diagnostic versus off blocks between patients and controls in anterior cingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus. Diagnostic conditions (depression scale) when contrasted to neutral conditions demonstrate differential activity of right superior frontal gyrus and right middle cingulate cortex in the comparison of patients with HC. Conclusion Potential neuroimaging of state-dependent biomarkers has been directly linked with clinical assessment self-evaluation scale, administered as stimuli simultaneously with the fMRI acquisition. It may be regarded as further evidence in support of the convergent capacity of both methods to distinguish groups by means of incremental translational cross-validation.",

There are indications of social dysfunction but limited evidence in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to improve our understanding of social competence in CG by investigating social cognition, neurocognition and emotion regulation. Methods: A comprehensive (neuro)psychological test battery, including self and proxy questionnaires, was administered to CG patients without intellectual disability. Social cognition was assessed by facial emotion recognition, Theory of Mind and self-reported empathy. Standardised results were compared to normative data of the general population. Results: Data from 23 patients (aged 8–52) were included in the study. On a group level, CG patients reported satisfaction with social roles and no social dysfunction despite the self-report of lower social skills. They showed deficits in all aspects of social cognition on both performance tests (emotion recognition and Theory of Mind) and self-report questionnaires (empathy). Adults had a lower social participation than the general population. Parents reported lower social functioning, less adaptive emotion regulation and communication difficulties in their children. Individual differences in scores were present. Conclusion: This study shows that CG patients without intellectual disability are satisfied with their social competence, especially social functioning. Nevertheless, deficits in social cognition are present in a large proportion of CG patients. Due to the large variability in scores and discrepancies between self- and proxy-report, an individually tailored, comprehensive neuropsychological assessment including social cognition is advised in all CG patients. Treatment plans need to be customised to the individual patient.",

Results Highly adherent and partially adherent subjects differed significantly in the stability of the level and the overall serum level of drug acheived. Subject's beliefs about themselves and their illness and their control over the disorder were more important than side-effects in predicting medication adherence. There were marked differences in the primary reasons for non-adherence identified by patients and their clinicians. Conclusion Although the study has a number of methodological limitations, the results suggest that clinical assessment of components of HBMs may improve the detection of patients at risk of non-adherence with mood stabilising medication.",

Circadian rhythm hypotheses (summarized in) have stimulated research into the pathophysiology of SAD, postulating that: 1.The illness is a consequence of delayed phase position, 2.It is correlated with diminished circadian amplitude, or 3.It results from changes in the nocturnal duration between dusk and dawn e.g. of low core body temperature or melatonin secretion. Light is considered to act directly on the circadian pacemaker ('Process C') and not on sleep dependent processes ('Process S'). Thus successful treatment of SAD must act via mechanisms within known retinohypothalamic pathways.

Prematurity and low birth weight as risk factors for the development of affective disorder, especially depression and schizophrenia: a register study.The present study examined whether low birth weight, prematurity or low birth weight adjusted for gestational age are risk factors for the subsequent development of affective disorder, especially depression.A population-based case-control design was applied to the Danish Medical Birth Register and the Danish Psychiatric Central Register to identify all individuals born between 1 January 1974 and 31 December 1990 and diagnosed prior to 29 August 2003 with affective disorder alone (ICD-10 F3; 4297 females, 1861 males), schizophrenia alone (ICD-10 F2; 1364 females, 2292 males) or both disorders (ICD-10 F3 + F2; 450 females, 405 males). The association between low birth weight and the risk of developing affective disorder and/or schizophrenia was analysed by conditional logistic regression analysis.Low birth weight was found to be associated with a significantly elevated risk of developing schizophrenia alone (p = 0.021) and both affective disorder and schizophrenia (p = 0.024), and a non-significantly elevated risk of developing affective disorder alone (p = 0.063). The effect remained significant in the affective disorder and schizophrenia groups (p = 0.039) when correcting for gestational age (premature birth), but was lost in the group with both disorders. Premature birth per se was found to be associated with a significantly elevated risk of developing both affective disorder and schizophrenia (p = 0.00018), an effect that remained significant after adjustment for low birth weight.Prematurity and low birth weight were found to be risk factors for subsequent development of affective disorder (especially depression) and schizophrenia.",

Objective: There are only few studies which investigated the neuropsychological performances of paediatric patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous studies show that most of adult OCD patients had an onset of their first symptoms before the age of 15. Our objective was to evaluate the neuropsychological functions in paediatric patients with OCD. Methods: We compared the executive functions and general intelligence of child and adolescent OCD patients ( n = 20) with age- and gender-matched healthy controls ( n = 20). To compare mentioned skills, a neuropsychological test battery including Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Stroop Test and Verbal Fluency Test was performed. Result: Performances of the OCD and control subjects on neuropsychological tests were statistically analysed by using multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), in which Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) results were taken into consideration as a covariate to observe FSIQ's effect on test scores. Our results showed that the differences in WISC-R Picture Arrangement and Coding scores remained significant when co-analysed with FSIQ scores. In a similar manner, the OCD group exhibited worse performances on STR1-duration, STR3-duration, STR3-error, STR4-duration, STR4-error, STR5-correct response, and STR5-error as compared with the control group when FSIQ scores were taken into calculation. Some variables of the WCST (perseverative responses, percent errors, abstraction-flexibility and categories completed) also yield lower test scores in the OCD group. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding Verbal Fluency Test scores. Conclusion: Our results suggested that paediatric OCD patients had worse abstraction-flexibility, mental set-shifting, verbal comprehension and visuospatial/construction abilities.",

Trait impulsivity in female patients with borderline personality disorder and matched controls.Impulsivity has been shown to load on two separate factors, rash impulsivity and sensitivity to reward (SR) in several factor analytic studies. The aims of the current study were to explore the nature of impulsivity in women with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and matched controls, and the underlying neuronal correlates for rash impulsivity and SR.Fifteen females diagnosed with BPD and 15 matched controls were recruited. All completed the impulsiveness-venturesomeness scale (I7), the sensitivity to punishment (SP) - sensitivity to reward (SR) questionnaire, and performed a Go-NoGo block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm at 3T. Correlation analyses were done with I7, SP and SR scores with the level of activation in different brain areas in the whole group. An independent group t-test was used to explore any differences between the BPD group and the matched controls.I7 scores correlated negatively with activity in the left orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala and precuneus, and bilaterally in the cingulate cortices during response inhibition for the entire sample. SP yielded negative correlations in the right superior frontal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus. No activity related to response inhibition correlated to SR. The Go-NoGo task gave similar brain activity in BPD and matched controls, but behaviourally the BPD group had significantly more commission errors in the NoGo blocks. The BPD group had increased I7 and SP scores indicating rash impulsiveness combined with heightened SP.These results imply that successful impulse inhibition involves interaction between the impulsive and the emotional systems. Furthermore, impulsivity in BPD is described as rash impulsivity, coexisting with increased SP.",

Morbidity events were ascertained from the subject themselves, their health care providers and these sources were also compared.Bereavement was associated with an elevated total burden of illness as well as with mental health and circulatory system categories diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases - Clinically Modified (ICD-9) classification system. The elevation ranged from approximately 20% for any illness to 60-100% among circulatory system disorders. Although in an earlier study there was a downregulation of T-cell function in the bereaved during the first 8 weeks, there was no evidence that the bereavement was associated with increased morbidity in the respiratory or immune system ICD-9 categories long-term.Past epidemiological research has indicated that bereavement of a close family member is associated with adverse health consequences of a generalised morbidity.

Background: Evidence is emerging for the role of dysfunctional mitochondria in pathophysiology and treatment of mood disorders. In this study, we evaluated the effects of acute and chronic administration of fluoxetine (FLX), olanzapine (OLZ) and the combination of FLX/OLZ on mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in the rat brain. Methods: For acute treatment, Wistar rats received one single injection of OLZ (3 or 6 mg/kg) and/or FLX (12 or 25 mg/kg) and for chronic treatment, rats received daily injections of OLZ (3 or 6 mg/kg) and/or FLX (12 or 25 mg/kg) for 28 days and we evaluated the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, II–III and IV in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Results: Our results showed that both acute and chronic treatments with FLX and OLZ alone or in combination altered respiratory chain complexes activity in the rat brain, but in combination we observed larger alterations. Conclusions: Finally, these findings further support the hypothesis that metabolism energy could be involved in the treatment with antipsychotics and antidepressants in combination to mood disorders.",

In contrast to a general trend of improvement in several non-motor variables only small and non-significant differences between (−)-OSU6162 and placebo were found regarding motor functions. Conclusions (−)-OSU6162 offers promise for the treatment of HD, as a drug with good tolerability, capable of improving the patients’ experienced non-motor functions such as energy and mood and thus alleviating symptoms of great importance for their quality of life.",

At 3 years, a questionnaire evaluated self-rated subjective outcome, symptom severity, SF-36 scores, employment status and medical care use.Data from 12 cases (mean age 25.5 ± 8.2; 9 females) and 11 controls (mean age 34.7 ± 13.5; 10 females) showed that 83% of cases had a good subjective outcome (symptom improved or cured) when only 36% of controls had a good outcome (p < 0.05). Cases significantly improved their SF-36 scores on subscales involving physical complaints compared to controls. A minority (20%) of cases reduced or ceased professional activity when 70% of controls did (p < 0.001). Only 16% of cases sought further medical advice for the initial symptom when 73% of controls did. Both groups accepted psychiatric referrals (83% of cases and 73% of controls) and found it beneficial.Early intervention involving both neurologists and psychiatrists is effective for CD in alleviating physical complaints, reducing sick leave and health care use.",

    "abstract": "Objective Substance dependence disorder is a chronically relapsing condition characterised by neurobiological changes leading to loss of control in restricting a substance intake, compulsion and withdrawal syndrome. In the past few years, (endo)cannabinoids have been raised as a possible target in the aetiology of drug addiction. On the other hand, although the exact mechanisms of the genesis of addiction remain poorly understood, it is possible that neuroinflammation might also play a role in the pathophysiology of this condition. Studies demonstrated that (endo)cannabinoids act as immunomodulators by inhibiting cytokines production and microglial cell activation. Thus, in the present review, we explore the possible role of neuroinflammation on the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids on drug addiction. Methods We conducted an evidence-based review of the literature in order to assess the role of cannabinoids on the neuroinflammatory hypothesis of addiction (terms: addiction, cannabinoids and inflammation). We searched PubMed and BioMedCentral databases up to April 2014 with no date restrictions. Results In all, 165 eligible articles were included in the present review. Existing evidence suggests that disruption in cannabinoid signalling during the drug addiction process leads to microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Conclusion The literature showed that inflammation and changes in endocannabinod signalling occur in drug abuse; however, it remains uncertain whether these changes are causally or coincidentally associated with addiction. Additional studies, therefore, are needed to elucidate the contribution of neuroinflammation on the behavioural and neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids on drug addiction.",

The aim of this study was to compare disability levels for three of the most common neurological, non-communicable diseases: dementia, stroke and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Methods We performed a community-based study of people aged 70 years and over in 12 randomly selected villages in the rural Hai district of Tanzania. Participants underwent disability assessment using the Barthel Index, and clinical assessment for dementia, stroke and PD. Results In a representative cohort of 2232 people aged 70 years and over, there were 54 cases of stroke, 12 cases of PD and estimated (by extrapolation from a sub-sample of 1198 people) to be 112 cases of dementia. People with stroke were the most disabled, with 62.9% having moderate or severe disability. Levels of moderate or severe disability were 41.2% in people with dementia and 50.0% in people with PD. However, the higher prevalence of dementia meant that, at a population level, it was associated with similar levels of disability as stroke, with 18.5% of 249 people identified as having moderate or severe disability having dementia, compared to 13.7% for stroke and 2.4% for PD. Conclusions Levels of disability from these conditions is high and is likely to increase with demographic ageing. Innovative, community-based strategies to reduce disability levels should be investigated.",

Methods Subjects were adults ages 18–55 of both sexes ( n =41) who completed the Mind-Wandering Questionnaire (MWQ) and the ADHD module of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Epidemiologic Version. We used Spearman’s rank correlation and Pearson’s χ 2 analyses to examine associations between the ADHD module and the MWQ and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of the ADHD module. Results Out of the three ADHD domains, the inattentive ADHD scores had the strongest association with the MWQ (total: r s =0.34, df=39, p =0.03; inattentive: r s =0.38, df=39, p =0.02; Hyperactive: r s =0.17, df=39, p =0.28). Correlation analyses between individual items on the ADHD module and the MWQ showed that two inattention items (‘failure to pay attention to detail’ and ‘trouble following instructions’) were positively associated with total scores on the MWQ ( p =0.02). These two inattention items had the strongest association with the MWQ ( r s =0.45, df=38, p =0.004). ROC analyses showed that the combined score of the two significant inattention items had the highest efficiency (AUC=0.71) in classifying high-level mind wanderers as defined by scores greater than the median split on the MWQ. The combined score of the two inattention items best identified high-level mind wanderers. Conclusion Results suggest a way to operationalise mind wandering using the symptoms of ADHD.",

Validation took place in a cross-sectional sample of 34 rural-dwelling older adults with mild/moderate dementia alongside 32 non-demented controls in Tanzania. Participants were oversampled for lower educational level. Inter-rater reliability was conducted by two trained raters in 22 older adults (13 with dementia) from the same population.

Methods The study comprised an 8-week prospective treatment period with open-label ADT with double-blind placebo treatment and a 24-week randomised treatment period. Investigators and patients were blinded to treatment periods, randomisation criteria, and timing of randomisation. Patients with early response to open-label ADT were withdrawn at Week 6. Patients fulfilling criteria for inadequate response were randomised to ADT+brexpiprazole 1–3 mg/day, or ADT+placebo. The primary endpoint was full remission: Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score ≤10 and ≥50% decrease from randomisation (i.e. baseline) in MADRS total score for at least 8 consecutive weeks. Results The primary efficacy analysis failed to show a statistically significant difference between the proportions of patients on ADT+brexpiprazole (21.4%) and ADT+placebo (24.9%) achieving full remission; odds ratio: 0.83; p =0.2641. The secondary endpoint of change from baseline to Week 6 in MADRS total score showed no difference between ADT+brexpiprazole and ADT+placebo (−0.4; p =0.3259). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in patients receiving ADT+brexpiprazole was weight increased (9.5% vs. 5.0% in ADT+placebo). The incidence of TEAEs leading to withdrawal in the randomised treatment period was 6.3% in the ADT+brexpiprazole group and 3.4% in the ADT+placebo group. Conclusion Adjunctive brexpiprazole did not differentiate from ADT+placebo on the primary endpoint of full remission. A number of design elements in this previously untried study design may have contributed to the study result. Brexpiprazole was well tolerated.",

Methods Eighty-nine consecutive patients with idiopathic PD who attended to our movement disorders outpatient clinics between January 2011 and June 2014 were included in this study. The diagnosis of PD was confirmed by a movement disorders specialists in Neurology, according to UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria. The Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor was used to assess motor disability and Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&amp;Y) was used to establish disease severity. Cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Patients were also administered the Hamilton depression (HAMD) and anxiety (HAMA) rating scales. The sexual functions of the patients were rated by applying the Turkish version of the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX). Results The mean age at the time of the study visit was 67.74±9.05. Male/female ratio was 1.87. Mean UPDRS total was 29.06±13.96 and mean UPDRS motor was 17.62±9.07. Mean HAMD score was 13.92±10.86, 58.4% of the patients had minor or major depression; and mean HAMA score was 7.94±6.49, 56.2% of the patients had minor or major anxiety. The mean ASEX score was 18.54±7.27 out of a maximum of 30. ASEX total scores were correlated with age, H&amp;Y stage and HAMA scores. Age and also age at onset were correlated with ASEX subdomains except sexual desire. There was no correlation between disease duration and ASEX subdomains. UPDRS motor score was correlated with erection/lubrication. HAMD was only correlated with orgasm satisfaction. HAMA score was correlated with stimulation and orgasm. Conclusion In patients with PD, there may be a common factor that modulates both depression, anxiety and sexual function. Further studies are needed to clarify the exact relationship.",

The two groups could not be distinguished on visual paraphasias. Longitudinal follow-up, however, suggested that visual processing deteriorates over time, where the prevalence of visual errors increased over 12 months.

Electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), an animal model of ECT, have repeatedly been shown to increase hippocampal neurogenesis, and multiple ECS treatments cause retrograde amnesia in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Since recent studies propose that addition of newborn hippocampal neurons might degrade existing memories, we investigated whether the memory impairment after multiple ECS treatments is a cumulative effect of repeated treatments, or if it is the result of a delayed effect after a single ECS.We used the hippocampus-dependent memory task Morris water maze (MWM) to evaluate spatial memory.

    "abstract": "Objectives: Treatment-resistance to antidepressants is a major problem in the pharmacotherapy of major depressive disorder (MDD). Unfortunately, only a few animal models are suitable for studying treatment-resistant depression, among them repeated treatment with Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) appears to be useful to mimic treatment-resistance to monoaminergic antidepressants. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the effectiveness of s-ketamine and rapastinel (formerly GLYX13), modulators of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in ACTH-treated animals.Methods: Naïve male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to repeated subcutaneous injections with ACTH (100 g/0.1 ml/rat/day) for 14 days and drug treatment on the test day (open field and forced swim test) with imipramine, s-ketamine or rapastinel. In addition, assessment of plasma levels of corticosterone and ACTH was carried out.Results: We found that rats repeatedly treated with ACTH for 14 days responded to single injections with s-ketamine (15 mg/kg) and rapastinel (10 mg/kg), but failed to respond to imipramine (15 mg/kg). In the plasma, the levels of corticosterone and ACTH were increased after 14 days of daily treatment with ACTH, independently of the treatment.Conclusion: The present data confirm development of a resistance to treatment following chronic ACTH administration. In addition, the study confirms the possible effectiveness of s-ketamine and rapastinel as treatment options in treatment-resistant depression. Moreover, it highlights the importance of the glutamatergic system in the neurobiology of depression. Further studies are necessary to evaluate how repeated treatment with ACTH leads to a depressed condition resistant to monoaminergic antidepressants.",

    "abstract": "Forgetting history, which frequently repeats itself, is a mistake. In General Psychopathology, Jaspers criticised early 20th century psychiatrists, including those who thought psychiatry was only neurology (Wernicke) or only abnormal psychology (Freud), or who did not see the limitations of the medical model in psychiatry (Kraepelin). Jaspers proposed that some psychiatric disorders follow the medical model (Group I), while others are variations of normality (Group III), or comprise schizophrenia and severe mood disorders (Group II). In the early 21st century, the players’ names have changed but the game remains the same. The US NIMH is reprising both Wernicke’s brain mythology and Kraepelin’s marketing promises. The neo-Kraepelinian revolution started at Washington University, became pre-eminent through the DSM-III developed by Spitzer, but reached a dead end with the DSM-5. McHugh, who described four perspectives in psychiatry, is the leading contemporary representative of the Jaspersian diagnostic approach. Other neo-Jaspersians are: Berrios, Wiggins and Schwartz, Ghaemi, Stanghellini, Parnas and Sass. Can psychiatry learn from its mistakes? The current psychiatric language, organised at its three levels, symptoms, syndromes, and disorders, was developed in the 19th century but is obsolete for the 21st century. Scientific advances in Jaspers’ Group III disorders require collaborating with researchers in the social and psychological sciences. Jaspers’ Group II disorders, redefined by the author as schizophrenia, catatonic syndromes, and severe mood disorders, are the core of psychiatry. Scientific advancement in them is not easy because we are not sure how to delineate between and within them correctly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Inverse relationships between the C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and cognitive performance in acute psychosis have been demonstrated. We aimed to investigate how the serum level and initial change of CRP in acutely admitted patients with psychosis was correlated with cognitive performance during a 6-months follow-up period. Methods The study is part of a pragmatic, randomised trial comparing four different second-generation antipsychotic drugs, and consists of 208 acute phase patients recruited at admittance for psychosis. This study reports data for all groups collectively, and does not compare treatment groups. Measurements of CRP and cognitive performance were conducted at baseline (T1) and after 4 weeks on average after inclusion (T2). Cognition was also assessed after 3 months (T3) and 6 months (T4) of follow-up. Results Global cognition improved during the follow-up period of 6 months, especially in the T1–T2 interval. The different cognitive subdomains showed different time-dependent profiles of improvement, with memory and attention improving significantly also in the later phases. Reduction of the CRP level during the initial follow-up interval (T1–T2) was associated with increased overall cognitive performance in the T2–T4 interval, but not in the T1–T2 interval. For the cognitive subdomains, we found an inverse association between change in CRP level and verbal abilities (T2–T4 interval), and attention (T2–T3 interval). Conclusion These findings indicate that initial changes in the serum level of CRP in the acute phase of psychosis may predict cognitive function in later phases of the disease.",

Methods We applied tract-based spatial statistics for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquired by 3T magnetic resonance imaging. First, we compared fractional anisotropy (FA) between 20 OCD patients and 30 healthy controls (HC). Then, applying whole brain analysis, we searched the brain regions showing correlations between the severities of symptom dimensions assessed by Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised and FA in all participants. Finally, we calculated the correlations between the six symptom dimensions and multiple DTI measures [FA, axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD)] in a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis and explored the differences between OCD patients and HC. Results There were no between-group differences in FA or brain region correlations between the severities of symptom dimensions and FA in any of the participants. ROI analysis revealed negative correlations between checking severity and left inferior frontal gyrus white matter and left middle temporal gyrus white matter and a positive correlation between ordering severity and right precuneus in FA in OCD compared with HC. We also found negative correlations between ordering severity and right precuneus in RD, between obsessing severities and right supramarginal gyrus in AD and MD, and between hoarding severity and right insular gyrus in AD. Conclusion Our study supported the hypothesis that the severities of respective symptom dimensions are associated with different patterns of white matter alterations.",

Methods: The DCHS comprises a population-based birth cohort of 1143 children, of which a subsample completed the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III (BSID-III) at 6 ( n = 260) and 24 months of age ( n = 734). A subset of alcohol-exposed and -unexposed children was included in this analysis at age 6 ( n = 52 exposed; n = 104 unexposed) and 24 months ( n = 92 exposed; n = 184 unexposed). Multiple hierarchical regression was used to explore the associations of PAE with motor and language development. Results: PAE was significantly associated with decreased gross motor [odds ratio (OR) = 0.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.06–0.44, p = 0.001] or fine motor (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.06–0.46, p = 0.001) functioning after adjusting for maternal socio-demographic and psychosocial factors at 6 months of age only. No significant effects were found in either receptive or expressive communication and cognitive outcomes at either time points. Conclusion: PAE has potentially important consequences for motor development in the first 2 years of life, a period during which the most rapid growth and maturation occur. These findings highlight the importance of identifying high-risk families in order to provide preventive interventions, particularly in antenatal clinics and early intervention services.",

METHODS: A questionnaire focusing on affective disorders and the use of social media and online dating was handed out to outpatients from unipolar depression and bipolar disorder clinics and general practice patients with or without a history of affective disorders (latter as controls). The association between affective disorders and use of social media and online dating was analysed using linear/logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 194 individuals with a history of unipolar depression, 124 individuals with a history of bipolar disorder and 196 controls were included in the analysis. Having a history of unipolar depression or bipolar disorder was not associated with the time spent on social media compared with controls. Using the controls as reference, having a history bipolar disorder was associated with use of online dating (adjusted odds ratio: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.3; 3.7)). The use of social media and online dating had a mood-congruent pattern with decreased and more passive use during depressive episodes, and increased and more active use during hypomanic/manic episodes. Among the respondents with a history of affective disorder, 51% reported that social media use had an aggravating effect on symptoms during mood episodes, while 10% reported a beneficial effect. For online dating, the equivalent proportions were 49% (aggravation) and 20% (benefit), respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of social media and online dating seems related to symptom deterioration among individuals with affective disorder.",

The gut-brain axis disturbances might play a significant role in the development of schizophrenia.We compared the gut microbiota of 53 individuals with schizophrenia and 58 healthy controls, using the 16S rRNA sequencing method. Individuals with schizophrenia were assessed using the following scales: the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status.No significant between-group differences in α-diversity measures were observed. Increased abundance of Lactobacillales (order level), Bacilli (class level) and Actinobacteriota (phylum level) were found in individuals with schizophrenia regardless of potential confounding factors, and using two independent analytical approaches (the distance-based redundancy analysis and the generalised linear model analysis). Additionally, significant correlations between various bacterial taxa (the Bacteroidia class, the Actinobacteriota phylum, the Bacteroidota phylum, the Coriobacteriales order and the Coriobacteria class) and clinical manifestation (the severity of negative symptoms, performance of language abilities, social and occupational functioning) were observed.The present study indicates that gut microbiota alterations are present in European patients with schizophrenia. The abundance of certain bacterial taxa might be associated with the severity of negative symptoms, cognitive performance and general functioning. Nonetheless, additional studies are needed before the translation of our results into clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Akathisia is among the most unpleasant side effects related to antipsychotic drug (AP) use, and possible associations between akathisia and agitation, depression and suicidal behaviour, respectively, have been described in previous literature. New generation antipsychotics are however regarded less prone to induce this particular adverse effect compared to older drugs, but evidence is incomplete and in need of confirmation from clinically relevant samples and settings. We, therefore, aim to investigate akathisia at hospital discharge for patients consecutively admitted with acute-phase psychosis and treated with atypical antipsychotics according to guideline-concordant clinical practice. Methods: This exploratory study is part of a naturalistic randomised controlled study in patients admitted with acute phase psychosis ( N = 109). We report cross-sectional data at discharge/first follow-up after acute psychiatric hospital admission for patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. Results: There were statistically significant positive associations between akathisia and the following; suicidality in men (Beta 0.306, p = 0.048), but not in women; agitation in those previously unexposed to antipsychotics (Beta 0.288, p = 0.047) and depression in those exposed to antipsychotics before hospital admittance (Beta 0.375, p = 0.031). Conclusion: Main findings were that akathisia is still a prevalent side effect in a clinically relevant sample of patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Our results suggest that akathisia is significantly associated with depression, suicidality and agitation in different subgroups of patients receiving APs. Akathisia can be detrimental and the relations between akathisia and depression, suicidality and agitation should be investigated further in prospective, hypothesis-testing studies with larger samples.",

The brains were obtained to evaluate the effects of CBD on hippocampal neurogenesis. Results: 6-OHDA-lesioned rats exhibited memory impairments and despair-like behaviour in the novelty-suppressed feeding test and forced swim test, respectively. The animals also exhibited dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), striatum, and ventral tegmental area and a reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis. CBD decreased dopaminergic neuronal loss in the SNpc, reduced the mortality rate and decreased neuroinflammation in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In parallel, CBD prevented memory impairments and attenuated despair-like behaviour that were induced by bilateral intranigral 6-OHDA lesions. Repeated treatment with CBD favoured the neuronal maturation of newborn neurons in the hippocampus in Parkinsonian rats.

Objective: The aim of the study was: (i) to investigate functional and psychological QOL in the individuals after the first ischemic stroke; (ii) to identify the most important correlates of QOL; and (iii) to examine the significance of depression among the other possible predictors of QOL. Methods: A hospital-based sample of 72 stroke patients was followed up to 6 months after stroke onset. QOL was assessed using the Polish version of the Quality of Life Index and the Sickness Impact Profile. A multiple regression procedure was performed to examine relationships between QOL and the study variables. Results: In spite of good recovery, the psychological and functional QOL of the examined patients was impaired, although the negative impact of stroke was greater on the objective QOL than on the subjective QOL. Stroke-related impairment, depression, functional disability and marital status predicted 80% of the variance in the functional QOL. Emotional support, depression and functional disability explained 38% of the variance in psychological well-being. Conclusions: Depression and physical disability were the most important predictors of QOL after stroke since their impact on QOL was more robust in comparison to the remaining variables. For improving QOL, a comprehensive care for patients aimed at reducing physical dependence and ameliorating depressive symptoms could be recommended.",

The DSM-IV now places greater emphasis on the clinical and research utility of the substance-induced disorders classification, and clarifies several important diagnostic issues specific to primary and substance-induced disorders. However, no research consensus exists over the core problem of identifying and differentiating the drug and alcohol intoxication and withdrawal symptoms that can mimic psychiatric symptoms in heavy drinkers and drug users. Objective: To investigate how various diagnostic instruments have measured comorbid psychiatric and substance-use disorders and how each instrument operationalizes the DSM-IV classification. Method: We review the evolution of the concept of comorbidity beginning with its formalization as the ‘primary–secondary’ distinction in the Feighner Criteria. We address the ‘organic–non-organic’ distinction found in the RDC, DSM-III, and DSM-III-R; and finally, review the ‘primary’ and ‘substance-induced’ categories of DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. We describe how these distinctions have been operationalized in widely used diagnostic instruments. Conclusion: Further understanding of these classifications and the relationship of co-occurring psychiatric and substance disorders can be accomplished with the range of available measures, particularly the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders (PRISM), which reliably utilizes and refines DSM-IV classification distinctions.",

    "abstract": "Depressive syndromes are a group of heterogeneous disorders. Atypical depression (AD) with reversed vegetative signs, such as hyperphagia or hypersomnia, is traditionally neglected, demonstrated by the fact that in the most widely used depression scales, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), melancholic symptoms have a specific weight, while, by contrast, reversed vegetative signs are not included. However, epidemiologically and phenomenologically related disorders to AD do exist, such as somatoform disorders, neurasthenia (chronic fatigue syndrome) and fibromyalgia (FM). In this spectrum, here called the AD spectrum, instead a decrease in hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity seems to exist. This has similarities to Cushing's disease, where a suppression of central HPA system activity is accompanied by features of AD and somatization in a considerable number of patients. Opposite vegetative features might therefore be related to the opposite dysregulation of the HPA system. The psychopharmacological intervention in the AD spectrum should therefore differ from that used in typical major depression. MAO inhibitors, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants and 5-HT3 antagonists demonstrated therapeutic efficacy, but the existing studies focused on different aspects. Hypericum extracts might be an alternative pharmacological intervention, which demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in the symptom range of the spectrum.",

Objective: To develop a pathophysiological model of schizophrenia that has greater explanatory power than existing hypotheses of the disorder. Method: Published findings on schizophrenia are integrated with more recent data from human and animal studies of striatal and cerebellar functions. Results: The analysis shows that during phylo- and ontogenesis two primarily motor-control mechanisms are applied at the intentional (limbic) level of functioning to organize emotional and cognitive behavior: one for initiating and dosing (drive) and the other for the representational guidance (guidance) of both movements and intentions. The intentional drive and guidance mechanisms are organized through a ventral, respectively, a dorsal cortical–subcortical circuitry. Conclusions: A deficient implementation of these mechanisms at the limbic domain manifests itself as schizophrenia, whereby the heterogeneity in symptomatology is explained by the extent of the remaining cerebral activity and by the degree of indirect activation of these systems. In general, activation manifests itself as positive symptomatology and the absence of such activation as negative symptomatology. The model provides a more comprehensive explanation for existing clinical and epidemiological data than do the current alternatives. It is compatible with the major prevailing views on the illness, such as the theories that regard this as a progressive neurodevelopmental, or a connectivity disorder, or one resulting from a deficient cerebral lateralization, or an interrupted cortico–thalamo–cerebello–cortical circuitry. The model fits with recent theories in evolutionary psychology and evolutionary psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Background: Our understanding of the neural circuitry involved in mood disorders is rapidly expanding through the ever-increasing application of functional brain imaging techniques. Objectives: A selective review of functional neuroimaging studies in patients with primary mood disorders was undertaken in order to identify points of commonality and controversy in the existing literature. Methods: Articles published between 1980 and July 2005 were identified using a range of keywords from relevant on-line databases and key journals. Results: Increased activity within limbic regions has been consistently associated with depressive states and may also be present in manic states too. Dorsal and ventral prefrontal regions appear compromised as suggested by emerging evidence of cortical inefficiency within prefrontal regions or reductions in their connectivity with limbic areas. Most of the functional changes observed are at least partly reversible following clinical remission although deficits in prefrontal regions may be state-related. Conclusions: Despite the use of disparate functional imaging modalities, there is a convergence of findings, and the results described do not appear to differ between unipolar and bipolar depression. However, further data are required in order to fully determine the functional changes occurring during manic states. Future work will also need to elucidate the effects of medication, the utility of specific cognitive tasks, and blood oxygenation level-dependent interactions within these affective states.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the fundamental features of the neurosphere assay (NSA), which was initially described in 1992, and has since been used not only to detect the presence of stem cells in embryonic and adult mammalian neural tissues, but also to study their characteristics in vitro. Implicit in this review is a detailed examination of the limitations of the NSA, and how this assay is most accurately and appropriately used. Finally we will point out criteria that should be challenged to design alternative ways to overcome the limits of this assay.NSA is used to isolate putative neural stem cells (NSCs) from the central nervous system (CNS) and to demonstrate the critical stem cell attributes of proliferation, extensive self-renewal and the ability to give rise to a large number of differentiated and functional progeny. Nevertheless, the capability of neural progenitor cells to form neurospheres precludes its utilisation to accurately quantify bona fide stem cell frequency based simply on neurosphere numbers. New culture conditions are needed to be able to distinguish the activity of progenitor cells from stem cells.A commonly used, and arguably misused, methodology, the NSA has provided a wealth of information on precursor activity of cells derived from the embryonic through to the aged CNS. Importantly, the NSA has contributed to the demise of the 'no new neurogenesis' dogma, and the beginning of a new era of CNS regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, the interpretations arising from the utilisation of the NSA need to take into consideration its limits, so as not to be used beyond its specificity and sensitivity.",

However, this evidence is limited mostly to out-patient and population-based samples. Further, the role of possible mediating factors such as attachment style and conflict communication are less well investigated in major depression. Objective: The present study aims to investigate whether couples with a depressed partner and nonclinical couples differ in marital satisfaction, attachment style, psychological distress and conflict communication. Gender differences are also investigated. Methods: Seventy-seven couples, who participated in a family intervention trial, were compared with 77 age- and gender-matched nonclinical couples. Results: The depressed patients reported more psychological distress and attachment difficulties and less marital satisfaction than their partners and the nonclinical couples. Partners perceived their relationship as more satisfying than the nonclinical couples. The clinical couples reported less mutual constructive and more mutual avoidant communication in their relationship compared with the nonclinical couples. Finally, female depressed patients reported higher levels of psychological symptoms and were more avoidant attached than male patients. Conclusions: This study shows important differences in several individual and relational characteristics between couples with a depressed partner and nonclinical couples. Further research will be necessary to clarify whether the investigated psychosocial variables play a causal and/or a maintaining role in depression.",

They are also reported to show mild immune system changes, although the relevance of these to altered infection disease presentation in AN and AN pathophysiology is unknown. Thus, in this paper, we suggest a range of immune system changes that might underpin these altered responses to common pathogens, and review a number of recent infectious disease findings for their utility in explaining the pathophysiology of AN.A systematic review of the literature pertaining to immunity and infectious disease in AN was performed.AN is associated with leucopenia, and the increased spontaneous and stimulated levels of proinflammatory cytokines [i.e. interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor α). A range of less consistent findings are also reviewed. Most of these data were not controlled for length of illness, degree of malnutrition, micronutrient or vitamin deficiencies or recent refeeding and starvation.Cytokine disturbances have been suggested to be causally related to AN symptomatology and pathophysiology of AN, although the evidence supporting this assertion is lacking. Immune and cytokine changes in AN do, however, occur in association with a decreased incidence of symptomatic viral infection, decreased clinical response to bacterial infection leading to delayed diagnosis and increased morbidity and mortality associated with the infections.",

We tested the hypotheses that self-reported impulsiveness is increased in adolescents with BD, and that it is present during euthymia, supporting impulsiveness as an early trait feature of the disorder.Impulsiveness was assessed in 23 adolescents with BD and 23 healthy comparison (HC) adolescents using the self-report measure of impulsivity, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), comprised by attentional, motor and nonplanning subscale scores. Effects of subscale scores and associations of scores with mood state and course features were explored.Total and subscale BIS scores were significantly higher in adolescents with BD than HC adolescents. Total, attentional and motor subscale BIS scores were also significantly higher in the subset of adolescents with BD who were euthymic, compared to HC adolescents. Adolescents with BD with rapid-cycling and chronic mood symptoms had significantly higher total and motor subscale BIS scores than adolescents with BD without these course features.These results suggest increased self-reported impulsiveness is a trait feature of adolescents with BD.

Objective: The relationship between autonomic neurocardiac function and schizophrenia remains elusive. This study investigated the relationship between the heart rate variability (HRV) parameters and the severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Methods: Twenty-one patients receiving risperidone monotherapy and 21 matched normal control subjects were evaluated for HRV analysis. The severity of schizophrenic symptoms was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and a five-factor model of the PANSS was used. Results: The value of the ratio of low-to-high frequency spectral power was significantly higher in the patient group. The patient group also showed a significantly lower value of approximate entropy. After controlling the dosage of risperidone, the PANSS total score had significant negative correlations with the standard deviation of all RR intervals (SDNN) and the square root of the mean squared differences of successive normal sinus intervals (RMSSD). With respect to the PANSS factors, the score of the PANSS cognitive/disorganisation factor had significant negative correlations with SDNN and RMSSD. Conclusion: These results provide some evidence that the severity of psychotic symptoms, especially cognitive/disorganisation symptom dimensions, may be associated with reduced HRV, suggesting a potential involvement of neuroautonomic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of specific symptoms of schizophrenia.",

Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether behavioural, metabolic or neuroendocrine abnormalities could be provoked or exacerbated by a high-fat diet (HFD) in an experimental model of IUGR.Methods Pregnant dams were exposed to dexamethasone (DEX) in the third gestational week to induce IUGR. Late adolescent male offspring of DEX- and vehicle-treated dams were then fed a HFD or standard chow for 8 weeks and subjected to a variety of assessments.Results Only diet affected the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response, as HFD doubled the observed corticosterone levels following acute restraint. HFD and prenatal DEX exposure concomitantly exacerbated depressive-like behaviour in the forced swim test, even though no interaction was seen. Prenatal DEX treatment tended to increase the basal acoustic startle response (ASR), while an interaction between HFD and DEX was present in the ASR pre-pulse inhibition suggestive of fundamental changes in neuronal gating mechanisms. Metabolic parameters were only affected by diet, as HFD increased fasting glucose and insulin levels.Conclusion We conclude that chronic HFD may be more important in programming of the HPA axis stress responsiveness than an adverse foetal environment and therefore potentially implies an increased risk for developing psychiatric and metabolic disease.",

A voltage-gated Na + channel (VGSC) is essential for the excitability and electrical properties of the neurons. However, there is still limited information on the role of IL-6 in voltage-gated sodium channels. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of IL-6 on Na + currents in cultured spinal-cord neurons. Methods VGSC currents were activated and recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp technique in the cultured rat spinal cord neurons. The effects of IL-6 concentration and exposure duration were examined. To determine whether any change in the number of channels in the plasma membrane can inhibit IL-6 on VGSC currents, we examined the expression of α 1A (SCN1α) subunit mRNA level and protein level in the neurons before and after IL-6 induction using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results We verified that IL-6, through a receptor-mediated mechanism, suppressed Na + currents in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but did not alter the voltage-dependent activation and inactivation. Gp130 was involved in this inhibition. Furthermore, the spike amplitude was also inhibited by IL-6 in the doses that decreased the Na + currents. Conclusion VGSC currents are significantly inhibited by IL-6. Our findings reveal that the potential neuroprotection of IL-6 may result from the inhibitory effects on VGSC currents.",

Objective: The ability to make inferences about knowledge, thoughts and feelings of others, i.e. perspective taking, is a key element of social cognition. Clinical observations indicate that Korsakoff patients may have impairments in social cognition, but studies are scarce. Also, executive dysfunction is present in Korsakoff patients, which may hamper perspective taking directly. Methods: Twenty-three patients with Korsakoff's syndrome and 15 healthy matched controls were examined on a story comprehension task, in which inferences had to be made that either relied on perspective taking or not. The effects of task complexity were taken into account and executive function was assessed using an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Results: The performance of Korsakoff patients declined with increasing complexity, but the pattern of decline for perspective-taking and non-perspective-taking stories was similar compared to that of the control group. Furthermore, the performance decline with increasing task complexity was directly related to the overall decline in executive functioning. Conclusion: Executive dysfunction, not deficits in perspective taking per se, appears to underlie difficulties in story comprehension in patients with Korsakoff's syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Lack of good animal models for affective disorders, including major depression and bipolar disorder, is noted as a major bottleneck in attempts to study these disorders and develop better treatments. We suggest that an important approach that can help in the development and use of better models is attention to variability between model animals. Results Differences between mice strains were studied for some decades now, and sex differences get more attention than in the past. It is suggested that one factor that is mostly neglected, individual variability within groups, should get much more attention. The importance of individual differences in behavioral biology and ecology was repeatedly mentioned but its application to models of affective illness or to the study of drug response was not heavily studied. The standard approach is to overcome variability by standardization and by increasing the number of animals per group. Conclusions Possibly, the individuality of specific animals and their unique responses to a variety of stimuli and drugs, can be helpful in deciphering the underlying biology of affective behaviors as well as offer better prediction of drug responses in patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective The aim of this paper was to provide a systematic review and update on the available longitudinal studies on the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on language, speech and communication development, as well as associated potential environmental confounders during the preschool period. Methods A literature search was restricted to English, full‐text, peer‐reviewed, longitudinal studies in from 1970 until present: PUBMed, Scopus, Web of Science {C-e Collection, Biological Abstracts, KCI-Kean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index, SciELO Citation Index, Zoological Rec-d}, Academic Search Premier (Africa-Wide Information, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO. Keywords included: prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE); speech or language or communication outcomes; neurocognitive or neurodevelopment or neurobehavioral or neurobehavioural; infant or baby or toddler or preschooler; longitudinal or follow-up. The inclusion criteria included (i) longitudinal cohorts with at least 2 time-points; (ii) association of light, moderate or heavy PAE on language, speech or communication delay, development or disorder; (iii) environmental confounders; (iv) infants up to preschool age. Results Six studies satisfied the threshold for inclusion. Three studies reported that PAE was significantly associated with receptive or expressive delay. These studies demonstrated lower scores on either receptive or expressive communication in the alcohol group in comparison to the non-alcohol group, even after controlling for environmental factors up to 36 months. Conclusion Evidence from the longitudinal studies reviewed suggest that PAE influenced delays in receptive and expressive communication up to 36 months. Contextual risk factors played a significant role in language development over time and especially as children approached school age.",

    "abstract": "Objective Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia play a crucial role in its clinical manifestation and seem to be related to changes in the cholinergic system, specifically the action of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Considering this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the chronic effects of ketamine in the activity of AChE, as well as in behavioural parameters involving learning and memory. Methods The ketamine was administered for 7 days. A duration of 24 h after the last injection, the animals were submitted to behavioural tests. The activity of AChE in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum was measured at different times after the last injection (1, 3, 6 and 24 h). Results The results indicate that ketamine did not affect locomotor activity and stereotypical movements. However, a cognitive deficit was observed in these animals by examining their behaviour in inhibitory avoidance. In addition, an increase in AChE activity was observed in all structures analysed 1, 3 and 6 h after the last injection. Differently, serum activity of AChE was similar between groups. Conclusion Chronic administration of ketamine in an animal model of schizophrenia generates increased AChE levels in different brain tissues of rats that lead to cognitive deficits. Therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate the complex mechanisms associated with schizophrenia.",

Diagnoses were established using the DSM-IV questionnaire in which Axis I and II were considered. The Suicide Intent Scale was also applied.In our sample, 63.6% were females and 36.4% males. With regard to socio-demographic characteristics, the predominant marital status in males was single, and in females married (χ2=5.93, df=2, p=0.05). In occupation the male group was mainly unemployed and housewife in females (χ2=55.51, df=4, p<0.001). Male subjects were more likely to consume alcohol (χ2=20.40, df=1, p≤0.001), cannabis (χ2=16.62, df=1, p≤0.001) or tobacco. The prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis was significantly different because, the male group was mainly diagnosed with substance-related disorders, whereas female participants showed a prevalence of stress-related disorders (χ2=34.17, gl=4, p=0.0001).Our results provide evidence that the characteristics of suicide attempt are different by gender in the Mexican population. Interventions are necessary for the development of prevention strategies that may lead to a reduction in suicidal behaviour. These preventive activities should consider the occupation for the female group and consumption of alcohol, cannabis or tobacco in the male group.",

Here we report the functional recovery results from the ConstaTRE trial.Clinically stable adults previously treated with oral risperidone, olanzapine, or oral first-generation antipsychotics were randomised to RLAI or quetiapine for 24 months. Functional recovery was assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) and two quality-of-life (QoL) measures [Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-12 (SF-12) and Schizophrenia Quality-of-Life Scale Revision 4 (SQLS-R4)].A total of 666 patients were randomised and treated with RLAI (n = 329) or quetiapine (n = 337). Relapse occurred in 16.5% RLAI and 31.3% quetiapine patients. Significant improvements in SOFAS, SF-12, and SQLS-R4 scores were observed from baseline to month 24 with both RLAI and quetiapine. At months 6, and 12, and endpoint, improvement in SOFAS score was significantly greater for RLAI than quetiapine (p < 0.05).Among patients with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the likelihood of functional recovery appears to be higher in those switching to RLAI than to quetiapine, although improvements in functional status and QoL were observed with both treatments.",

However, different methodological approaches and the heterogeneity of patient samples question the validity of the findings. Materials and methods In total, 30 patients were matched for age and sex with 30 healthy controls. All participants underwent T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were used to compare white matter volumes and diffusion tensor imaging between groups. These data were analysed correcting for the effects of multiple comparisons, age, sex, severity and duration of illness as nuisance covariates. White matter hyperintensities were manually identified. Results Increase in fractional anisotropy in cerebellum was the most prominent result. A decrease in fractional anisotrophy in patients comparable with previous studies was located in forceps minor. There were no differences in the white matter morphology or in the white matter hyperintensities between patients and healthy controls. Conclusion Decrease in fractional anisotrophy in forceps minor and increase in cerebellum were found, and they were not due to neither white matter hyperintensities nor morphology of the white matter. Cerebellar hyperconnectivity could be an important part of OCD pathophysiology.",

The dilemma is whether the women should continue medication throughout pregnancy, and maybe accept a minor risk to harm their unborn child, or discontinue medication and increase the risk of recurrence, which can lead to maternal morbidity, thereby endangering themselves and their foetus. Design and methods In September 2016, three electronic search databases; PubMed, Scopus and PsycInfo, were used searching for clinical trials concerning this question. Eight clinical trials concerning risk of recurrence after discontinuation of medication in pregnancy were included. Results There is no consensus concerning the risk of discontinuation of medication during pregnancy among bipolar women. The evidence from the trials included underscore that there seem to be a group of pregnant women who are stable despite they are not receiving mood stabilisers during pregnancy. Besides, there is a group of more severe and more unstable bipolar disorders that seem to benefit of a more close monitoring, support and prophylactic medication during pregnancy and postpartum period to prevent recurrence. Conclusion For the more stable bipolar women we recommend a well planned and more slowly discontinuation of medication before pregnancy. For the unplanned pregnancies it is important to consider the possibility of a more slowly discontinuation. For the more severe conditions of bipolar disorder, it is important to secure a close monitoring of medication. As the risk of postpartum relapse is high, medication may be started soon after delivery.",

Of the many SNPs, NRG1 rs35753505 and catechol- o -methyl transferase (COMT) rs4680 polymorphisms have shown to have a strong association with neuroplasticity effect in schizophrenia. Methods Schizophrenia patients ( n =32) with treatment resistant auditory hallucinations were administered with an add-on tDCS. The COMT (rs4680) and NRG1 (rs35753505) genotypes were determined. The COMT genotypes were categorised into Val group (GG; n =15) and Met group (GG/AG; n =17) and NRG1 genotypes were categorised into AA group ( n =12) and AG/GG group ( n =20). Results The reduction in auditory hallucination sub-scale score was significantly affected by COMT-GG genotype [Time×COMT interaction: F (1,28)=10.55, p =0.003, ɳ 2 =0.27]. Further, COMT-GG effect was epistatically influenced by the co-occurrence of NRG1-AA genotype [Time×COMT×NRG1 interaction: F (1,28)=8.09, p =0.008, ɳ 2 =0.22]. Irrespective of genotype, females showed better tDCS response than males [Time×Sex interaction: F (1,21)=4.67, p =0.04, ɳ 2 =0.18]. Conclusion COMT-GG and NRG1-AA genotypes aid the tDCS-induced improvement in AVHs in schizophrenia patients. Our preliminary observations need replication and further systematic research to understand the neuroplastic gene determinants that modulate the effect of tDCS.",

Changes in self-reported target complaints, symptom severity, and overall interpersonal problems have been presented for these patients in two previous articles. We now expand upon the existing knowledge by presenting novel data from a number of important observer-based and self-reported outcome domains (diagnostic changes on Axis I and II, changes in overall personality dysfunction, disorder complexity, medication use, health care utilisation, and occupational activity).There were pervasive and significant improvements on all measures during treatment, which were maintained or further improved during follow-up. Fourteen months after the end of treatment, 46.26% of patients had recovered in terms of Axis I pathology, 63.79% had recovered in terms of Axis II pathology, 71.18% had returned to work, and there was a 28.62% reduction in regular use of psychotropic medications. Health care utilisation was reduced by 65.55%, and there were large improvements in disorder complexity and levels of personality dysfunction.The treatment programme was highly effective for patients with common and complex treatment-resistant mental disorders. Results are encouraging for the relatively large number of patients who tend not to benefit from standard formats of treatment for debilitating psychological problems.",

Hence, in this systematic review, we aimed to investigate the interaction between hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) genes and CM in depression. Methods: We conducted a literature search using the Pubmed, Embase, and PsychINFO databases in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included studies investigating GxE interactions between HPA-axis genes [Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), Arginine Vasopressin (AVP), Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone (CRH), Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone Receptor 1 (CRHR1), Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone Receptor 2 (CRHR2), FK506 binding protein (FKBP5), Nuclear Receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1), Nuclear Receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2 (NR3C2)] and CM in depression. Results: The literature search identified 159 potentially relevant studies. Following screening, 138 of these were excluded. Thus, 21 studies, investigating a total of 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms, were included in the final study. The most prevalent genes in the current study were CRHR1 and FKBP5. Significant GxE interactions were reported in seven of eight studies for CRHR1:rs110402 and CM, and in five of eight studies for FKBP5:rs1360780 and CM. In summary, our results suggest possible GxE interactions between CRHR1, FKBP5, NR3C1, and NR3C2 and CM, respectively. For the remaining genes, no relevant literature emerged. Conclusions: We find that genetic variation in four HPA-axis genes may influence the effects of CM in depression.",

Response to imipramine, venlafaxine and ketamine treatment (all 10 mg/kg×7 days) alone and in combination were subsequently studied.TDS exacerbated depressive-like behaviour of FSL rats in the FST. Imipramine, venlafaxine and ketamine were ineffective as monotherapy in TDS-exposed FSL rats. However, combining imipramine with either venlafaxine or ketamine resulted in significant anti-immobility effects and enhanced coping behaviours. Only ketamine+imipramine (frontal-cortical 5HIAA and NA), ketamine alone (frontal-cortical and hippocampal NA) and venlafaxine+imipramine (frontal-cortical NA) altered monoamine responses versus untreated TDS-exposed FSL rats.Exposure of FSL rats to TDS inhibits antidepressant response at behavioural and neurochemical levels. Congruent with TRD, imipramine plus venlafaxine or ketamine overcame treatment resistance in these animals. These data further support the hypothesis that exposure of FSL rats to a PTSD-like paradigm produces a valid animal model of TRD and warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is prevalent in traumatic brain injury (TBI), and is often associated with poor outcomes and cognitive impairment, including memory deficits. Few studies have explored visual memory after TBI and its relationship to executive functioning. Executive functioning is crucial for remembering an object's location, operating devices, driving, and route finding. We compared visual memory performance via the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test 6 and 12 months after DAI.In total, 40 patients (mean age 28.7 years; 87.5% male) with moderate-to-severe DAI following a road traffic accident completed the 1-year follow-up. There was a three-phase prospective assessment. In phase 1 (1-3 months after trauma), patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). In phases 2 (6 months) and 3 (12 months), they completed the BDI, STAI, and a neuropsychological battery [ROCF copy and recall, digit span forward/backward, Grooved Pegboard test, intelligence quotient (IQ) by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III)].There was an improvement in ROCF recall over time (p=0.013), but not ROCF copy (p=0.657).There was no change in executive function (Savage scores) copy (p=0.230) or recall (p=0.155). Age, years of education, severity of the trauma, and IQ did not influence ROCF recall improvement.There are time-dependent improvements in visual memory in patients with DAI. Neuroplasticity in the 1st months after trauma provides an opportunity for visuospatial memory learning. The present findings may be useful to formulate management plans for long-term TBI rehabilitation.",

When the animals completed 7, 14 and 45 postnatal days, they were killed and the whole brain was dissected for biochemical analysis. Animals with 45 postnatal days were submitted to behavioural tests of locomotor activity, social interaction and stereotyped movements. Results: It was observed that the animals presented schizophrenia-like behaviour at 45 postnatal days associated with the increase of NLRP3 inflammasome expression and IL-1β levels on 7, 14 and 45 postnatal days. Conclusion: This study shows that MIA may be associated with a schizophrenia-like behaviour. This behaviour can be induced to a neuroinflammatory profile in the brain. These evidences may base future studies on the relationship between neuroinflammation and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: A few former studies suggested there are partial overlaps in abnormal brain structure and cognitive function between Hypochondriasis (HS) and schizophrenia (SZ). But their differences in brain activity and cognitive function were unclear. Methods: 21 HS patients, 23 SZ patients, and 24 healthy controls (HC) underwent Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with the regional homogeneity analysis (ReHo), subsequently exploring the relationship between ReHo value and cognitive functions. The support vector machines (SVM) were used on effectiveness evaluation of ReHo for differentiating HS from SZ. Results: Compared with HC, HS showed significantly increased ReHo values in right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and right fusiform gyrus (FG), while SZ showed increased ReHo in left insula, decreased ReHo values in right paracentral lobule. Additionally, HS showed significantly higher ReHo values in FG, MTG and left paracentral lobule but lower in insula than SZ. The higher ReHo values in insula were associated with worse performance in MCCB in HS group. SVM analysis showed a combination of the ReHo values in insula and FG was able to satisfactorily distinguish the HS and SZ patients. Conclusion: our results suggested the altered default mode network (DMN), of which abnormal spontaneous neural activity occurs in multiple brain regions, might play a key role in the pathogenesis of HS, and the resting-state alterations of insula closely related to cognitive dysfunction in HS. Furthermore, the combination of the ReHo in FG and insula was a relatively ideal indicator to distinguish HS from SZ.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The quality of life and lifespan are greatly reduced among individuals with mental illness. To improve prognosis, the nascent field of precision psychiatry aims to provide personalised predictions for the course of illness and response to treatment. Unfortunately, the results of precision psychiatry studies are rarely externally validated, almost never implemented in clinical practice, and tend to focus on a few selected outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we have established the PSYchiatric Clinical Outcome Prediction (PSYCOP) cohort, which will form the basis for extensive studies in the upcoming years. Methods: PSYCOP is a retrospective cohort study that includes all patients with at least one contact with the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region in the period from January 1, 2011, to October 28, 2020 ( n = 119 291). All data from the electronic health records (EHR) are included, spanning diagnoses, information on treatments, clinical notes, discharge summaries, laboratory tests, etc. Based on these data, machine learning methods will be used to make prediction models for a range of clinical outcomes, such as diagnostic shifts, treatment response, medical comorbidity, and premature mortality, with an explicit focus on clinical feasibility and implementation. Discussions: We expect that studies based on the PSYCOP cohort will advance the field of precision psychiatry through the use of state-of-the-art machine learning methods on a large and representative data set. Implementation of prediction models in clinical psychiatry will likely improve treatment and, hopefully, increase the quality of life and lifespan of those with mental illness.",

ACE2 catabolizes angiotensin II and produces angiotensin (1-7), an agonist of Mas receptor. Mice lacking the Mas receptor (angiotensin 1-7 receptor) exhibit anxiety-like behaviours. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis of the involvement of ACE2 genetic variant (G8790A) on response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In a randomised control trial, 200 newly diagnosed Iranian patients with major depressive disorder completed 6 weeks of fluoxetine or sertraline treatment. Patients with a reduction of 50% or more in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score were considered responsive to treatment. G8790A polymorphism was determined in extracted DNAs using restriction fragment length polymerase chain reaction method. Our results show that the A allele and AA and GA genotypes were significantly associated with better response to SSRIs (p = 0.008; OR = 3.4; 95% CI = 1.4-8.5 and p = 0.027; OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.2-9.2, respectively).

The A allele was significantly associated with better response to sertraline (p = 0.0001; OR = 7.6; 95% CI = 2.5-23.3).

Recent research suggests that this molecule may be a biomarker of response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We examined the effect of ECT on serum S100B and its utility as 1) a biomarker of a depressive state and 2) a predictor of ECT response. We also wanted to ensure that ECT does not cause a marked serum S100B-elevation, indicating neural distress. Methods: We measured serum S100B in 22 in-patients treated with ECT due to depression. Depression severity was assessed using 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17). The data were collected before an ECT series, within one week after the series (post-ECT), and at a six-month follow-up. Changes in serum S100B and clinical outcomes were tested using a linear mixed model. A relationship between serum S100B and the clinical outcomes was examined using Spearman and partial correlation. Results: Serum S100B did not change significantly immediately after an ECT series or six months later. The post-ECT serum S100B-change was not associated with the clinical effect (rho=.14, n=22, p=.54). The baseline serum S100B did not predict the clinical effect when controlling for age (r =.02, n=22, df=19, p=.92). Conclusion: The study neither supports serum S100B as a state marker of depression nor a predictor of ECT response. No evidence for ECT-related neural distress was found.",

Participants from the Safe Passage Study in pregnancy were approached when their child was ∼6 years old and completed structural brain magnetic resonance imaging to examine with archived PAE and PTE data ( n = 51 children–mother dyads). Linear regression was used to conduct whole-brain structural analyses, with false-discovery rate (FDR) correction, to examine: (a) main effects of PAE, PTE and their interaction; and (b) predictive potential of data that reflect patterns of PAE and PTE (e.g. quantity, frequency and timing (QFT)). Associations between PAE, PTE and their interaction with brain structural measures demonstrated unique profiles of cortical and subcortical alterations that were distinct between PAE only, PTE only and their interactive effects. Analyses examining associations between patterns of PAE and PTE (e.g. QFT) were able to significantly detect brain alterations (that survived FDR correction) in this small non-clinical sample of children. These findings support the hypothesis that considering QFT and co-exposures is important for identifying brain alterations following PAE and/or PTE in a small group of young children. Current results demonstrate that teratogenic outcomes on brain structure differ as a function PAE, PTE or their co-exposures, as well as the pattern (QFT) or exposure.",

However, ACEis could benefit patients with AD by reducing the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, by central cholinergic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and by peripheral modulation of glucose homeostasis. We aimed to investigate whether the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with clinical changes in patients with AD, while considering apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ϵ4 carrier status and blood pressure response to angiotensin modulators.Consecutive outpatients with late-onset AD were screened with cognitive tests and anthropometric measurements, while their caregivers were queried for functional and caregiver burden scores. Prospective pharmacogenetic associations were estimated for 1 year, taking APOE-ϵ4 carrier status and genotypes of the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism into account, along with treatment with ACEis or ARBs.For 193 patients (67.4% women, 53.4% APOE-ϵ4 carriers), the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.281), while arterial hypertension was prevalent in 80.3% (n = 124 used an ACEi, n = 21 used an ARB). ARBs benefitted mostly APOE-ϵ4 carriers concerning caregiver burden variations, cognitive and functional decline. ACEis benefitted APOE-ϵ4 non-carriers concerning cognitive and functional decline due to improved blood pressure control in addition to possible central mechanisms. The ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism led to variable response to angiotensin modulators concerning neurological outcomes and blood pressure variations.Angiotensin modulators may be disease-modifiers in AD, while genetic stratification of samples is recommended in clinical studies.",

However, clinical practice - as well as the systems and databases in which clinical notes are recorded and stored - change over time. As a consequence, the content of clinical notes may also change over time, which could degrade the performance of prediction models. Despite its importance, the stability of clinical notes over time has rarely been tested. Methods: The lexical stability of clinical notes from the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region in the period from January 1, 2011, to November 22, 2021 (a total of 14,811,551 clinical notes describing 129,570 patients) was assessed by quantifying sentence length, readability, syntactic complexity and clinical content. Changepoint detection models were used to estimate potential changes in these metrics. Results: We find lexical stability of the clinical notes over time, with minor deviations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 2988 data points, 17 possible changepoints (corresponding to 0.6%) were detected. The majority of these were related to the discontinuation of a specific note type. Conclusion: We find lexical and syntactic stability of clinical notes from psychiatric services over time, which bodes well for the use of NLP for predictive modelling in clinical psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Lithium is an effective drug for both the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. However, the precise mechanism of lithium action is not yet well understood. Extensive research aiming to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of lithium has revealed several possible targets. The behavioral and physiological manifestations of the illness are complex and are mediated by a network of interconnected neurotransmitter pathways. Thus, lithium's ability to modulate the release of serotonin at presynaptic sites and modulate receptor-mediated supersensitivity in the brain remains a relevant line of investigation. However, it is at the molecular level that some of the most exciting advances in the understanding of the long-term therapeutic action of lithium will continue in the coming years. The lithium cation possesses the selective ability, at clinically relevant concentrations, to alter the PI second-messenger system, potentially altering the activity and dynamic regulation of receptors that are coupled to this intracellular response. Subtypes of muscarinic receptors in the limbic system may represent particularly sensitive targets in this regard. Likewise, preclinical data have shown that lithium regulates arachidonic acid and the protein kinase C signaling cascades. It also indirectly regulates a number of factors involved in cell survival pathways, including cAMP response element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, bcl-2 and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and may thus bring about delayed long-term beneficial effects via under-appreciated neurotrophic effects. Identification of the molecular targets for lithium in the brain could lead to the elucidation of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and the discovery of a new generation of mood stabilizers, which in turn may lead to improvements in the long-term outcome of this devastating illness (1).",

The percentage of patients meeting each criterion of the AHA was as follows: 46% for abdominal obesity; 44% for hypertriglyceridemia or cholesterol-lowering medication use; 26% for low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or being on a lipid-lowering medication; 45% for hypertension; and 20% for high fasting glucose or anti-diabetic medication use.The prevalence of obesity in our sample of outpatients with bipolar disorder was higher than that observed for the general population of Brazil. The rate of MetS was similar to that observed for the general population. Our data indicate the need for prevention, early detection and treatment of O/MetS in patients with bipolar disorder.",

Outcomes for this condition remain often poor, with considerable personal, social and economic impact. In order to guide clinical practice and future research in this area, we have performed a systematic review of the published literature on the psychological treatment of FNEA.A comprehensive literature search was carried out using key words: non-epileptic seizures; psychogenic seizures; psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; pseudoseizures; funny turns; non-epileptic attack; hysterical seizures; and pseudoepileptic. Studies specifically looking at psychological treatment of FNEA were identified. Studies of patients also having comorbid organic seizure disorders were excluded.17 studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified. A broad variety of psychological interventions for FNEA has been investigated. Only one randomised controlled trial has been completed to date. Existing evidence appears to suggest that various psychological treatments, including presenting the diagnosis, psychoeducation, behavioural therapies and mixed modality treatments, may be effective.While a range of psychological treatments may be beneficial for this patient group, we do not have clear evidence to suggest which treatment is most efficacious. Specific elements of presenting the diagnosis and psychoeducation may be required in addition to traditional cognitive behavioural therapeutic approaches. Large, methodologically robust studies are urgently required to establish the most effective form of treatment.",

Method: A literature search of databases Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL and Embase up to October 2008. The search emphasised empirical research published in the last 10 years and also included older literature. Studies in both adults and children were addressed. Results: Research into omega-3 fatty acids has been substantial but evidence for their potential in treating mood and behaviour is modest. In comparison, there has been much less research into carbohydrate and protein intakes and little evidence for their ability to influence mood and behaviour. Recent trials with food additives suggest their removal from the diet may benefit susceptible children with hyperactivity disorders. Micronutrient supplementation appears to improve mood only in those who were initially deficient in micronutrients. Conclusions: More stringent research designs such as longitudinal studies and the use of biologically inert placebos within randomised controlled trials are needed before supplemental use of omega-3 fatty acids to treat disorders of mood and behaviour can be recommended. Caution is advised regarding the indiscriminate use of diets free of artificial food additives in managing hyperactivity disorders, as they may place an undue burden on individuals and their families. Should omega-3 fatty acid supplementation or the elimination of certain food additives be established as effective, they may provide cost-effective, accessible and well-tolerated adjuncts to standard psychiatric treatments for mood and behavioural disturbances.",

Emotional processing and executive functions in major depressive disorder: dorsal prefrontal activity correlates with performance in the intra-extra dimensional set shift.Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterised by predominately negatively valenced emotional symptoms that are often accompanied by cognitive impairments. We posited that cognitive impairments in MDD are related to altered emotional processing in prefrontal cortex.We compared 20 medication-free patients with MDD and 29 matched healthy controls. Both groups performed an emotional task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Furthermore, they completed the intra-extra dimensional set shift (IED) test probing for cognitive impairments. Then we correlated the results of the IED with the changes in fMRI BOLD signal in MDD patients and healthy subjects.The subcategory of the IED applying extradimensional shift (EDS) showed a divergent performance of the MDD group committing significantly more errors than the control group. Correlating the EDS errors with fMRI signal changes, the healthy subjects showed a positive correlation with the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the right orbitofrontal cortex. MDD subjects, in contrast, showed a positive correlation in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a negative correlation in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC).We hypothesise that the differential correlation in healthy controls and MDD patients may reflect the use of different strategies in their performance. The impaired executive functions, as reflected by altered processing in right DLPFC and left DMPFC, may implicitly influence emotional processing in patients suffering from MDD.",

Objective: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme involved in the production of hypochloric acid as well as other reactive oxygen species. This enzyme plays a significant role in inflammatory processes. In view of the observed associations between depression and such inflammatory processes, as well as of the reports that confirm the presence of oxidative stress in depression, this study was designed to assess the correlation, if any, between the single nucleotide polymorphism G-463A of the MPO gene and the risk of recurrent depressive disorders (DD). Methods: The study was carried out in a group of 149 patients with recurrent DD and 149 healthy control subjects. Genotyping was performed by PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: A comparison between healthy controls and depressive patients showed a statistically significant difference in genotype distribution and allele frequency in the studied groups. Genotype distribution and allele frequency did not correlate with clinical variables of the patients. Conclusion: The obtained results of the study allow us to draw a cautious conclusion about the role of the analysed G-463A MPO polymorphism in recurrent DD development, which, however, requires eventual confirmation in further studies.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and expression of comorbid disorders in female BD patients with OCD.We assessed clinically stable female outpatients with BD: 15 with comorbid OCD (BD+OCD group) and 15 without (BD/no-OCD group). All were submitted to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, with additional modules for the diagnosis of kleptomania, trichotillomania, pathological gambling, onychophagia and skin picking.The BD+OCD patients presented more chronic episodes, residual symptoms and previous depressive episodes than the BD/no-OCD patients. Of the BD+OCD patients, 86% had a history of treatment-emergent mania, compared with only 40% of the BD/no-OCD patients. The following were more prevalent in the BD+OCD patients than the BD/no-OCD patients: any anxiety disorder other than OCD; impulse control disorders; eating disorders; and tic disorders.Female BD patients with OCD may represent a more severe form of disorder than those without OCD, having more depressive episodes and residual symptoms, and being at a higher risk for treatment-emergent mania, as well as presenting a greater anxiety and impulse control disorder burden.",

The present study aimed to investigate the role of GABAergic systems in the modulation of anxiety in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats using the elevated plus maze test.Rats were anaesthetised with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine, and then special cannulae were inserted stereotaxically into the mPFC. After 5-7 days of recovery, the effects of intra-mPFC administration of GABAergic agents were studied.Bilateral injection of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.25, 0.5 and 1 μg/rat) produces an anxiolytic-like effect, shown by significant increases in the percentage of open-arm time (%OAT) and percentage of open-arm entries (%OAE). Intra-mPFC administration of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (0.25, 0.5 and 1 μg/rat) produces significant anxiogenic-like behaviour. However, intra-mPFC injection of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 μg/rat) and the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP35348 (5, 10 and 15 μg/rat) did not alter %OAT and %OAE significantly.The results of the present study demonstrate that the GABAergic system of the mPFC modulates anxiety-related behaviours of rats through GABAA receptors.",

Objectives: Irritability is a common and disabling problem associated with Huntington's disease (HD). However, the underlying causes of such irritability remain unclear. This study investigates the association of irritability in HD with possible aetiological factors including dysexecutive syndrome, depression, anxiety (state and trait) and movement disorder. Methods: Thirty patients with genetically confirmed HD and their carers were recruited from a regional HD neuropsychiatry service. Patients completed two self-reported questionnaires (Irritability, Anxiety and Depression Scale and State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Their carers filled in the Burns Irritability Scale. Patients were also administered the Behavioural Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS), Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Motor component of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). Results: Both self-rated and carer-rated irritability scales showed significant positive correlation with trait anxiety. The self-rated irritability scales also showed significant positive correlation with state anxiety and depression. No association was observed between irritability and dysexecutive syndrome or motor impairment. Conclusions: Trait anxiety might serve as a predictor for irritability in HD. Irritability is unrelated to motor or cognitive features of HD indicating that it is an independent neuropsychiatric manifestation of HD.",

    "abstract": "Background: A well-known technique to assess (psychological) arousal is to measure the skin conductance level (SCL). Although widely used in experimental psychological research, this technique has not been used often in (locked) psychiatric admission settings on patients who are at a high risk of engaging in aggressive behaviour. One of the obvious reasons for this is that measuring skin conductance, until recently, required a substantial amount of equipment. Methods: As technology developed, it became possible to develop small wearable devices in the form of regular watches to measure the SCL as well as other psycho-physiological parameters. To illustrate the potential this may have for the prevention of aggressive behaviour, a case description is provided of a patient in crisis who became physically aggressive while wearing a skin conductance measurement device. Results: Interestingly, the SCL of the patient had been rising sharply before the first signs of aggressive behaviour were visible. Conclusion: Although it concerns an anecdotal case study, this finding suggests that measuring SCL on a continuous basis in patients who are at a high risk of becoming violent, without this procedure having to interfere with their daily life, may open new avenues for preventing aggression at an earlier stage. A large-scale empirical study in a substantial number of (potentially aggressive) patients is needed, however, to investigate the predictive validity of mobile skin conductance assessments on imminent inpatient aggression in a reliable way.",

Method In total, 387 postnatal women filled out a questionnaire concerning their health and social status, as well as the following tests: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Neo Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) Personality Inventory and the Berlin Social Support Scales. After 4–8 weeks, patients responded to another questionnaire with the EPDS and the PHQ-9. Results In total, 48 patients (12.40%) were found to be at risk of postpartum depression between the fourth and eighth weeks after delivery. Premenstrual syndrome [adjusted odds ratio (ORa)=2.93, confidence interval (CI) 1.30–6.63] and EPDS&gt;12 points during the first week after the delivery (ORa=3.74, CI 1.59–9.04) increased the risk of postnatal depression. A similar role is played by a high result in neuroticism scale of the NEO-FFI (ORa=1.50, CI 1.17–1.92) and a positive family history of any psychiatric disorder (ORa=1.03, CI 1.01–1.06). Conclusion A history of premenstrual syndrome and a higher risk of affective disorder soon after a childbirth are associated with greater chances of depressive symptoms in the second month postpartum. This is also the case if a patient is neurotic and has a relative with a history of any psychiatric disorder. Such women should have their mental status carefully evaluated.",

Results : Both exenatide (1–20 µg/kg) and liraglutide (200–1200 µg/kg) decreased the glucose levels up to 30% in freely fed animals. In glucaemically equipotent doses the drugs induced very similar behavioural and hormonal effects: there was no change on anxiety level or immobility time, however, both drugs suppressed motor activity and increased corticosterone levels. Conclusion : We conclude that the two clinically approved GLP-1 receptor agonists induce very similar suppression of motor activity and stimulation of corticosterone release in mice.",

However, comparison of HTR2A gene 102 T/C and 1438 A/G polymorphisms in terms of genotypic and allele frequencies between the two patient groups, with or without a family history of schizophrenia, shows that T- and A-allele frequencies were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the case group that has a history of schizophrenia in their family.In conclusion, our results do not support the hypothesis that the T102C and 1438 A/G polymorphisms in the 5-HT2A receptor gene are associated with schizophrenia, but further studies in a larger sample are needed.",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurobiological disorder with childhood onset and persistence through adolescence and adulthood. ADHD patients frequently show exaggerated emotional responses. The amygdala plays an important role in emotion processing and in the activation of the frontal lobe. We hypothesised that smaller amygdala volumes in ADHD patients would be associated with less control of impulsivity and emotional instability.We studied nine adult patients with ADHD and nine group-matched healthy volunteers using a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. We manually obtained morphometric measurements, which were later processed and compared.Significant negative correlation between the right amygdala volume and Barratt's impulsivity scores was observed (r=-0.756, p=0.018). No correlation was found between impulsivity scores and the volume of the left amygdala. Age was not found to be a contributor of the results.Smaller amygdala volumes have been observed in patients with ADHD. Our results suggest that greater emotional processing and less control of impulsivity are associated with smaller amygdala volumes in ADHD patients. Furthermore, the right amygdala would play a bigger role in impulsivity and behaviour control than the left amygdala. Further studies involving larger samples of adult patients with ADHD and using multimodal designs are needed.",

Methods Male Swiss mice ( n =6–8/group) housed in reversed light/dark cycle were randomly assigned into receive vehicle (10% sucrose), sub-effective doses (1 and 3 mg/kg) or effective doses (10 and 30 mg/kg) of bupropion, desipramine, and fluoxetine and a candidate antidepressant, sodium butyrate (1–30 mg/kg) per gavage (p.o.) 1 h before the forced swim test (FST). Treatments continued daily for 7 and 14 days during retests 1 and 2, respectively. In an additional experiment, mice received fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (10% sucrose or 0.9% saline) p.o. or i.p. before the FST. Mice housed in reversed or standard light/dark cycles received fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) prior FST. Video recordings of behavioural testing were used for blind assessment of the outcomes. Results According to the expected, doses of antidepressants considered sub-effective failed to affect the immobility time of mice in the FST. Surprisingly, acute and chronic treatment with the high doses of bupropion, desipramine, and fluoxetine or sodium butyrate also failed to reduce the immobility time of mice in the FST. Fluoxetine 20 mg/kg was also ineffective in the FST when injected i.p. or in mice housed in normal light/dark cycle. Conclusion Data suggest the lack of efficacy of orally administered bupropion, desipramine, fluoxetine in the FST in Swiss mice. High variability, due to high and low immobility mice, may explain the limited effects of the treatments.",

Lithium salts also appear to stimulate cell proliferation, increase neurogenesis, and delay cell death. Oxidative stress and neurodegeneration may play an important role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and the disease course thereof. The aim of this research is to estimate the influence of lithium (alone and in combination with haloperidol) on the parameters of oxidative stress and viability of SH-SY5Y cell lines in neutral and pro-oxidative conditions. Methods The evaluated oxidative stress parameter was lipid peroxidation. The viability of the cell lines was measured utilising the MTT test. Results In neutral conditions, higher levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were observed in those samples which contained both haloperidol and lithium than in other samples. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Cell viability was significantly higher in therapeutic lithium samples than in the controls; samples of haloperidol alone as well as those of haloperidol with lithium did not differ from controls. Conclusions The results of our study may indicate that lithium possess neuroprotective properties that may be partly due to antioxidative effects. The combination of lithium and haloperidol may generate increased oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Among cognitive reserve markers, educational attainment is the most widely studied, with several studies establishing a strong association with risk of dementia. However, it has not yet been fully examined in delirium. This study aims to analyse the relationship between educational attainment and delirium.The study included elderly hospitalised patients admitted (≥48 h) into an intermediate care unit (IMCU) of Intensive Care Medicine Service. Exclusion criteria were as follows: Glasgow Coma Scale (total≤11), blindness/deafness, inability to communicate or to speak Portuguese. The European Portuguese Version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) was used for delirium assessment.The final sample (n=157) had a mean age of 78.8 (SD=7.6) the majority being female (52.2%), married (51.5%) and with low educational level (49%). According to CAM, 21% of the patients had delirium. The delirium group presented the fewest years of education (median 1 vs. 4), with statistical significance (p=0.003). Delirium was more frequent among male patients [odds ratio (OR) 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.86; p=0.023], as well as those patients with lower education (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.62-0.95; p=0.016), and with respiratory disease (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.20-9.33; p=0.020), after controlling for age and medication.Similar to previous studies, these findings point to a negative correlation between education and delirium. This study appears as an attempt to contribute to the knowledge about the role of cognitive reserve in risk of delirium, particularly because is the first one that has been carried out in an IMCU, with lower educated elderly patients. Further studies are needed to clarify this relationship considering other markers (e.g. cognitive activities), which can contribute to the definition of preventive strategies.",

Using a genetic animal model of depression, this study investigated the long-term effects of pre-pubertal administration of fluoxetine (FLX) on depressive-like behaviour in early adulthood, as well as on central monoaminergic response to an acute stressor. We postulated that pre-pubertal FLX will have lasting effects on animal behaviour and monoaminergic stress responses in early adulthood.Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats received 10 mg/kg/day FLX subcutaneously from postnatal day 21 (PnD21) to PnD34 (pre-pubertal). Thereafter, following normal housing, rats were either subjected to locomotor testing and the forced swim test (FST) on PnD60 (early adulthood), or underwent surgery for microdialysis, followed on PnD60 by exposure to acute swim stress and measurement of stressor-induced changes in plasma corticosterone and pre-frontal cortical monoamine concentrations.Pre-pubertal FLX did not induce a late emergent effect on immobility in FSL rats on PnD60, whereas locomotor activity was significantly decreased. Acute swim stress on PnD60 significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels, and increased pre-frontal cortical norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations. Pre-pubertal FLX significantly blunted the pre-frontal cortical NE and 5-HIAA response following swim stress on PnD60. Baseline dopamine levels were significantly enhanced by pre-pubertal FLX, but no further changes were induced by swim stress.Pre-pubertal FLX did not have lasting antidepressant-like behavioural effects in genetically susceptible, stress-sensitive FSL rats. However, such treatment reduced locomotor activity, abrogated noradrenergic and serotonergic stressor responses and elevated dopaminergic baseline levels in adulthood.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Seclusion and mechanical restraint are coercive interventions used at psychiatric hospitals when patients are at imminent risk of harming themselves and/or others. Although these interventions have been used for decades, it remains unclear whether seclusion or mechanical restraint is superior in terms of efficacy and safety. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review studies comparing the intended and unintended effects of seclusion and mechanical restraint. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Embase was conducted in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. Quantitative studies comparing the intended and unintended effects of seclusion and mechanical restraint were included. RESULTS: The search identified 868 unique records. Fourteen of these (3 reporting on randomized controlled trials and 11 reporting on observational studies) met the predefined inclusion criteria. The study methodology including outcome measures varied significantly across studies. The results of the 11 studies using a subjective outcome measure (patient preference/emotions) were in favour of seclusion, while the 3 studies using an objective outcome measure (duration of coercion/need for transition to other coercive measure) favoured mechanical restraint. There was a high risk of residual confounding by indication and/or bias affecting the reported results. CONCLUSION: Based on the available literature, it cannot be determined whether seclusion is superior to mechanical restraint or vice versa. Further studies using stringent methodology are required to answer this question. A cautious conclusion based on this review is that the availability of both methods seems necessary - as both have their pros and cons.",

Several genetic associations of LBD have been reported and their functional implications remain uncertain. Hence, we aimed to do a systematic review of all gene expression studies that investigated people with LBD for improving our understanding of LBD molecular pathology and for facilitating discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LBD. Methods: We systematically reviewed five online databases (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42017080647) and assessed the functional implications of all reported differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Ingenuity Pathway Analyses. Results: We screened 3,809 articles and identified 31 eligible studies. In that, 1,242 statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05) DEGs including 70 microRNAs have been reported in people with LBD. Expression levels of alternatively spliced transcripts of SNCA, SNCB, PRKN, APP, RELA , and ATXN2 significantly differ in LBD. Several mitochondrial genes and genes involved in ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy–lysosomal pathway were significantly downregulated in LBD. Evidence supporting chronic neuroinflammation in LBD was inconsistent. Our functional analyses highlighted the importance of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-mediated gene silencing, neuregulin signalling, and neurotrophic factors in the molecular pathology of LBD. Conclusions: α-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, defects in molecular networks clearing misfolded proteins, and RNA-mediated gene silencing contribute to neurodegeneration in LBD. Larger longitudinal transcriptomic studies investigating biological fluids of people living with LBD are needed for molecular subtyping and staging of LBD. Diagnostic biomarker potential and therapeutic promise of identified DEGs warrant further research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Suicide is a serious public health issue that affects individuals, families and societies all over the world. International studies provide consistent evidence that the presence of psychiatrists in a region is associated with lesser suicide rates. However, many psychiatric patients including suicidal patients do not have access to psychiatrists. This indicates that mental health and non-mental health social workers need to be involved in suicide prevention efforts. This paper is the first comprehensive work that discusses how to increase the role of social workers in the area of suicide prevention. Methods: A review of the relevant literature. Results: Increasing the role of social workers in suicide prevention efforts may reduce suicide risk in groups and people at elevated risk for suicide, as well as the general population. Conclusion: Recommendations are provided for how the social work profession can improve upon suicide prevention while incorporating universal, selective and indicated suicide preventive interventions. Social work research efforts should focus on how to increase the role of social workers in suicide prevention and the management of suicidal patients. Social work education programmes should modify their curricula and increase their attention on suicide prevention. Mental health social workers need to educate the patient and their family on suicide risk factors. Furthermore, mental health and non-mental health social workers need to educate the general public on suicide risk factors.",

In this study, we investigate the binding of α2-adrenoceptors in regions relevant to depression in an animal model of depression. METHODS: Using in vitro autoradiography techniques and the selective α2-ligand, [3H]RX 821002, we investigated the density of α2-adrenoceptors in female Flinders-sensitive line (FSL) rats, a validated model of depression, and in two traditional control groups - female Flinders-resistant line (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. RESULTS: The α2-adrenoceptor density was increased in most regions of the FSL rat brain when compared with SD rats (10% across regions). Moreover, the α2-adrenoceptor density was further increased in the FRL rats compared with both FSL (10% across regions) and SD rats (24% across regions). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in α2-adrenoceptor binding in cortical regions in the FSL strain compared with the SD control strain is in accord with α2-adrenoceptor post-mortem binding data in suicide victims with untreated major depression. However, the differences in binding observed in the two control groups were unexpected and suggest the need for further studies in a larger cohort of animals of both sexes.",

As symptoms are non-specific and the aetiology of PNA is unknown, the diagnostic process is hampered. We hypothesised that the serotonin metabolism plays a role in the aetiology of PNA. Methods In this controlled study, infants admitted postpartum from February 2012 to August 2013 were included and followed for 3 days. Infants exposed to SADs during at least the last 2 weeks of fetal life were included in the patient group ( n =63). Infants not exposed to psychotropic medication and admitted postpartum for another reason were included in the control group ( n =126). The neonatal urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetid acid (5-HIAA) levels of SAD-exposed infants who developed PNA, SAD-exposed infants who did not develop PNA and control infants were compared. Results The course of the 5-HIAA levels over the first 3 days postpartum differed between infants with and without PNA ( p ≤0.001) with higher 5-HIAA levels in infants with PNA on day 1 (2.42 mmol/mol, p =0.001). Presence of maternal psychological distress modified this relationship. Conclusions A transient disturbance of the neonatal serotonergic system may play a role in the aetiology of PNA. Other factors, including the presence of maternal psychological distress, also seem to play a role.",

Evidence suggests that they may play a role in reward responses and neuroprotection. However, the association of GLP-1R with anhedonia and depression diagnosis has not been studied. Here, we examined the association of GLP-1R polymorphisms with objective and subjective measures of anhedonia, as well as depression diagnosis. Methods: Objective [response bias assessed by the probabilistic reward task (PRT)] and subjective [Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)] measures of anhedonia, clinical variables and DNA samples were collected from 100 controls and 164 patients at McLean Hospital. An independent sample genotyped as part of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) was used to study the effect of putative GLP-1R polymorphisms linked to response bias in PRT on depression diagnosis. Results: The C allele in rs1042044 was significantly associated with increased PRT response bias, when controlling for age, sex, case-control status and PRT discriminability. AA genotype of rs1042044 showed higher anhedonia phenotype based on SHAPS scores. However, analysis of PGC major depressive disorder data showed no association between rs1042044 and depression diagnosis.

Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the efficacy of different strategies to augment clozapine. This systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed the available RCTs that have evaluated the clinical efficacy of various pharmacological agents, non-pharmacological strategies (occupational therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy), and somatic treatment [electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, etc.)] as augmenting agents to clozapine. Methods: Data were extracted using standard procedures, and risk of bias was evaluated. Effect sizes were computed for the individual studies. Results: Forty-five clinical trials were evaluated. The pooled effect size for various antipsychotic medications was 0.103 (95% CI: 0.288–0.493, p &lt; 0.001); when the effect size was evaluated for specific antipsychotics for which more than one trial was available, the effect size for risperidone was −0.27 and that for aripiprazole was 0.57. The effect size for lamotrigine was 0.145, and that for topiramate was 0.392. The effect size for ECT was 0.743 (CI: 0.094–1.392). Risk of bias was low (mean Jadad score – 3.93). Largest effect sizes were seen for mirtazapine (effect size of 5.265). Most of the studies can be considered underpowered and limited by small sample sizes. Conclusions: To conclude, based on the findings of the present systematic review and meta-analysis, it can be said that compared to other treatment strategies, clozapine non-responsive patients respond maximum to mirtazapine followed by ECT.",

However, despite a higher prevalence of cannabis (THC) consumption in patients with psychosis, few studies have investigated the impact of this use on inflammatory markers. Methods: One hundred and two inpatients were included in this retrospective study. Leukocytic formula, hsCRP, fibrinogen levels and urinary THC were measured, and comparisons were performed at baseline and after 4 weeks of cannabis cessation between cannabis users (THC+) and non-users (THC−). Results: After cannabis cessation, we found a greater increase in leucocyte level ( p &lt; 0.01), monocyte level ( p = 0.05) and a statistical trend to a highest increase of lymphocyte level ( p = 0.06) between baseline and 4 weeks in the THC+ group as compared to the THC− group. At 4 weeks, highest leucocyte ( p = 0.03), lymphocyte ( p = 0.04) and monocyte ( p &lt; 0.01) counts were found in the THC+ group, whereas at baseline no difference was found. A positive correlation was found between monocyte count at 4 weeks and baseline Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative subscore ( p = 0.045) and between the variation of monocyte count between baseline and 4 weeks and the PANSS total score at 4 weeks ( p = 0.05). Conclusion: THC cessation is associated with an increase in inflammatory markers, including white blood cell, lymphocyte and monocyte levels, which correlates with symptomatology of patients with psychosis.",

    "abstract": "Early-life adversity (ELA) is one of the strongest predictors of childhood depression that may be exacerbated by a genetic predisposition to develop depression. We therefore investigated the bio-behavioural effects of an early-life stressor in an accepted rodent model of depression.The Flinders sensitive line (FSL) and resistant line (FRL) rats were subjected to an early-life stressor, whereafter their bio-behavioural response during pubertal onset was evaluated. Male and female pups were maternally separated for 3 h per day from postnatal day 02 (PND02) to 17, when they were also weaned. Control animals were left undisturbed, until weaning on PND21. Depressive-like behaviour was analysed on PND21 and reassessed on PND36. Hippocampal monoamine levels, markers of oxidative stress and metabolic markers implicating mitochondrial function were also measured.On PND21, the non-maternal separation and early weaning (non-MSEW) FSL rats spent 10% more time mobile than their FRL controls in the tail suspension test (TST) yet displayed increased depressive-like behaviour in the forced swim test (FST) on PND36. This depressive-like behaviour coincided with increased hippocampal norepinephrine levels, serotonin turnover and a dysfunctional redox state. Maternal separation and early weaning (MSEW) appeared to initially reduce early-life (PND21) depressive-like behaviour in the TST but then induced depressive-like behaviour on PND36 and increased norepinephrine levels more profoundly in the FRL rats.These findings highlight the need to further investigate the stress response pathway in these animals and that the absence or presence of genetic susceptibility may influence the presentation of ELA effects.",

Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of sleeping problems and their relation to sociodemographic characteristics in the Polish population, based on the results of the National Health Interview Survey carried out by the Central Statistical Office in 1996. Methods: A stratified sampling scheme, involving two steps, was used. Standardized prevalence ratios (SPRs and their 95% confidence intervals) were calculated. Assessment of sleep-related problems was based on six questions. A representative Polish sample (47 924 non-institutionalized, adult respondents) was interviewed. Results: Nearly one-fourth of Polish inhabitants suffered from insomnia. The percentage was significantly higher among women (28.1%) than among men (18.1%). The prevalence of insomnia increased with age and was highest in divorced respondents. Respondents of both sexes with higher educational levels suffered from insomnia less often than individuals with lower levels of education. The problem of insomnia applies in a similar degree to inhabitants of both rural and urban regions. About one-twentieth of inhabitants of Poland experienced recent sleep deterioration related to problems. It was associated positively with age, female gender and lower education. About 20% of the population get up not rested in the morning, women significantly more often than men, urban residents more often than rural ones. Conclusions: Sleep-related problems are common and the results are comparable with those from other countries. The findings have important implications, such as the necessity of better education of the public community about the identification and possibilities of treatment of sleep disturbance.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal asymmetry in yearly suicide occurrence is a long-observed phenomenon in psychiatric, suicidological and sociological research, and the effects of seasonal factors on suicidal behaviour have been the focus of a number of earlier studies. Taking into account limitations of data and methods, these studies have in general favoured interpretations based on psychosocial factors. Recent studies have challenged the widely held notion that seasonal effects on suicide are not influenced by age, gender or the circumstances of the act. The suicides committed with violent methods have been shown to follow clearer seasonal patterns than suicides by less violent methods, and differences have been found between male and female cycles of occurrence. The seasonal occurrence of suicides has also been found to differ significantly between the young and the elderly. The use of inappropriate statistics or age- and gender-biased samples may have hidden a seasonal component in some previous studies on attempted suicide. The absence of seasonality in earlier studies on attempted suicide was interpreted as depending upon the minor relevance of psychiatric and biological factors in non-fatal self-harm. However, recent studies have reported clear seasonality in attempted suicide samples, with older people showing greater seasonal effect. Recent literature after 1985 on seasonal variation and weather or climate influence in attempted and completed suicide is reviewed. Suggestions for research and the development of more effective preventative strategies are offered.",

    "abstract": "Our current understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying depressive disorders is not only based on behavioral, neuroendocrine and pharmacological studies in depressed humans, but also on experimental studies in a wide variety of animal models of depression. Ideally, the two approaches should operate in close interaction, each providing additional information to the other approach. However, in practice the animal model approach seems to be rather independent from the human studies. In a critical evaluation of the available animal models of depression, Willner concluded that none of the models fulfilled the criteria of a sufficient face, construct and predictive validity. Although this evaluation was made ten years ago, we feel that the situation has improved very little since that time. Most animal models fail to sufficiently mimic both the etiology and the symptomatology of human depressive disorders. With respect to the etiology, stress and major life events are generally considered to be an important factor in the development of depression. Most of the animal models however use stressors which bear little or no relationship to the biology of the species, i.e. to the situations an animal may meet in its everyday life in a natural habitat. Moreover, these models do not pay attention to the temporal dynamics of the disease. In humans, the disease is characterized by its gradual onset, which is often preceded by symptoms of anxiety. Moreover, a relatively large number of patients suffers from recurrent episodes of depression, which tend to occur with decreasing intervals and increasing duration and severity. If we want to improve our knowledge of the causal mechanisms of depression, animal models which allow an experimental analysis of the temporal dynamics of the disease are essential.",

    "abstract": "Cryotherapy has a long tradition in somatic medicine. Yet we know very little about its impact on psyche and mood disturbances in particular. Therefore there is a real need for scientific investigations into this problem.The study reported here was an initial approach to whole-body cryotherapy (WBCT) as a potential treatment modality for depression and was expected to provide rough data helping to design a future project with extended methodology, larger sample groups and longer follow-up.Twenty-three patients aged 37-70 years gave informed consent to participate in the study. Ten WBCT procedures (160 s, -150°C) were applied within 2 weeks. Participants were recruited from depressed day hospital patients. Antidepressive medication was not ceased. Symptoms were rated at the beginning and end of this intervention using the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Changes in scores were analyzed in the group of patients for every item separately as well as for the sum of all items for each patient.Almost for each individual HDRS item, the overall score for all patients together was significantly lower after WBCT. This means that all symptoms, except for day-night mood fluctuations, were presumably positively influenced by cryotherapy. The HDRS sum-score for each patient after WBCT was lower than that of the baseline and reached statistical significance in a paired samples t-test. Every patient was therefore considerably relieved after WBCT.It appears that WBCT helps in alleviating depression symptoms. Should this be confirmed in the extended study we are currently implementing, WBCT may become an auxiliary treatment in depression.",

Previous studies have shown that the concentration of the compound is increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, it has been found that the CSF concentration of KYNA is positively correlated to CSF concentrations of the monoamine metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in healthy control subjects. Objectives: To study the correlations between KYNA and the monoamine metabolites HVA, 5-HIAA and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol (HMPG) in CSF of male patients ( n = 53, ranging from 20 to 48 years of age) with verified schizophrenia. Methods: CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture, and KYNA analysis was performed with an isocratic reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography system connected to a fluorescence detector. HVA, 5-HIAA and HMPG concentrations were measured by mass fragmentography with deuterium-labelled internal standards. Results: Positive intercorrelations were found between CSF KYNA, HVA and 5-HIAA, while CSF content of HMPG did not correlate to KYNA or any of the monoamine metabolites in CSF. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that increased KYNA formation is associated with an increased dopamine and serotonin turnover in male patients with schizophrenia.",

This study evaluated the prevalence of incidental abnormalities on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a random sample of 60- to 64-year-old community-dwelling individuals as well as successfully followed a referral pathway taking into account of the various ethical issues related to the referral process. The Personality and Total Health ( PATH) Project was designed to study the risk and protection factors of normal ageing, dementia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Method: MRI scans were performed in randomly selected 478 healthy, community-dwelling 60- to 64-year-old individuals. All scans were reported for abnormalities by a radiologist. Results: Abnormalities were detected in 22 (4.8%) subjects, comprising 10 tumours (pituitary adenoma 4, meningioma 3, suprasellar tumour 1, cavernous haemangioma 1, subarachnoid lipoma 1), 6 infarct-like lesions, 2 arachnoid cysts, 1 possible normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 1 each of unconfirmed aneurysm and mesial temporal sclerosis. Further evaluation led to novel intervention in one case of pituitary adenoma, and adjustment of drug treatment to modify risk factors in two cases with subclinical infarction. Conclusion: While no case required immediate referral or urgent surgical intervention, the change in the outcome of treatment of some cases suggests that appropriate referral process should be in place when researchers study large number of subjects in the community using MRI of the brain.",

This paper briefly describes neuroimaging using MRS and provides a systematic review of its application to anxiety disorders. Method: A literature review was performed in the PubMed, Lilacs and Scielo databases using the keywords spectroscopy and anxiety disorder. References of selected articles were also hand-searched for additional citations. Results: Recent studies have shown that there are significant metabolic differences between patients with anxiety disorders and healthy controls in various regions of the brain. Changes were mainly found in N -acetylaspartate, which is associated with neuronal viability, but some of them were also seen in creatine, a substance that is thought to be relatively constant among individuals with different pathological conditions. Conclusions: MRS is a sophisticated neuroimaging technique that has provided useful insights into the biochemical and neurobiological basis of many anxiety disorders. Nevertheless, its utilization in some anxiety disorders is still modest, particularly social phobia and generalised anxiety. Although it is an extremely useful advance in neuroimaging, further research in other brain areas and patient populations is highly advisable.",

Drug-dependent groups included both cocaine and heroin abusers.Classical and emotional Stroop tasks were used to test all drug-dependent patients and controls with no history of addiction. Response times were recorded. An interference effect was obtained by comparing the congruent and incongruent conditions in the classical Stroop version. An attentional bias towards drug cues was derived by comparing latencies in the neutral and emotional conditions of the emotional Stroop.No between-group differences were found in the classical Stroop. In the emotional Stroop, active drug-dependent patients showed higher attentional bias (i.e. longer response times to drug-related words) than any of the other three groups.The attentional bias induced by drug cues in patients with addiction disorder might change depending on the patients' clinical status. All treated patients, whether on opioid substitution therapy or on community therapy, showed less attentional bias towards drug-related stimuli than active drug users, although the observed smaller bias was most likely induced by therapy acting through different mechanisms. Although drug-cues response is influenced by other multiple variables, e.g. motivation, craving, classical conditioning and substance availability, these data lend support to the hypothesis that treatment might contribute to decrease the attentional bias towards drug cues, which seems to play a critical role in achieving a positive outcome in the treatment of addiction.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is closely related to stress reactions and serotonin probably underpins the pathophysiology of MDD. Alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at the gene level have reciprocal consequences on serotonin neurotransmission. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) polymorphisms affect glucocorticoid sensitivity, which is associated with cortisol feedback effects. Therefore, we hypothesised that GR polymorphisms are associated with the susceptibility to MDD and predict the treatment response. Method: Ninety-six subjects with a minimum score of 17 on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) at baseline were enrolled into the present study. The genotypes of GR (N363S, ER22/23EK, Bcl 1, and TthIII 1 polymorphisms) were analysed. The HAMD score was again measured after 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment to detect whether the therapeutic effects differed with the GR genotype. Results: Our subjects carried no N363S or ER22/23EK genetic polymorphisms and three types of Bcl 1 and TthIII 1 genetic polymorphisms. The C/C genotype and C allele at Bcl 1 polymorphism were more frequent in MDD patients than in normal controls ( p &lt; 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively). The genotype distributions did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders. Conclusion: These results suggest that GR polymorphism cannot predict the therapeutic response after antidepressant administration. However, GR polymorphism ( Bcl 1) might play a role in the pathophysiology of MDD. Future studies should check this finding in larger populations with different characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Dikmen M, Cantürk Z, Öztürk Y. Escitalopram oxalate, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, exhibits cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in glioma C6 cells. Objective: Various antidepressants, mainly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been reported to exhibit potent anticancer properties in different cancer cells. In this study, we evaluated the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of escitalopram oxalate (25, 50, 100 and 200 µM) on rat C6 glioma cells. Methods: Cell proliferations were measured by [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) assay, apoptosis was observed by flow cytometric analysis on C6 cells. Results: Significant decreases in the proliferation of C6 glioma cells were detected depending on increases in the escitalopram concentrations and incubation periods. When compared to controls, C6 cell proliferations after 24 h incubation were determined with 97.7, 85.9, 74.5 and 67.9% for 25, 50, 100 and 200 µM escitalopram, respectively, while the cell proliferations after 48 h were established as 96.5, 68.0, 50.7 and 39.9% for 25, 50, 100 and 200 µM concentrations, respectively. IC 50 value of escitalopram was able to be calculated as 106.97 µM after 48 h. Based on Annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) binding capacity for 25, 50, 100 and 200 µM escitalopram, apoptotic effects were determined as 17.0, 22.3, 12.5 and 7.8%, respectively. Conclusion: Based on our findings, escitalopram oxalate was observed to induce cytotoxic and apoptotic activities in C6 cells.",

    "abstract": "Despite clozapine's superior clinical efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), its adverse effects, need for periodic leukocyte monitoring, cost and variable clinical outcomes mandate a clinical need to predict its treatment response. Although cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is the principal determinant of metabolism of clozapine, the role of CYP1A2 gene in the clinical response to clozapine is uncertain. Hence, we investigated its association with treatment responses and adverse events of clozapine in TRS.We evaluated four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the CYP1A2 gene, clinical responses and serum clozapine levels in 101 consecutive patients with TRS on stable doses of clozapine. We defined clozapine response a priori and investigated allelic and genotypic associations. We assessed the socio-demographic and clinical profiles, premorbid adjustment, traumatic life events, cognition and disability of the participants, using standard assessment schedules for appropriate multivariate analyses.Our results revealed that CYP1A2 gene SNP (*1C, *1D, *1E and *1F) were not associated with clozapine treatment response, adverse effects, serum clozapine levels or with disability (p values > 0.10).As CYP1A2 gene SNP do not help to predict the clinical response to clozapine, routine screening for them prior to start clozapine is currently unwarranted. We suggest future longitudinal genome-wide association studies investigating clinical and pharmacogenetic variables together.",

    "abstract": "Objective : Isolation rearing of rats provides a non-pharmacological method of inducing behavioural changes in rodents that resemble schizophrenia or depression. Nevertheless, results are variable within different strains. We focused on neurochemical changes in several in vivo and post-mortem brain regions of Wistar (W) and Lister Hooded (LH) rats following post-weaning social separation. Methods : Experiments were conducted after 6–8 weeks of isolation. For post-mortem studies, prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAC), hippocampus (Hipp) and striatum (St) were collected by tissue dissection. In vivo experiments were conducted by microdialysis in the PFC. Analyses of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) levels and relative turnover were performed by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results : We found significant strain-related differences in biogenic amine content. LH rats were characterised by markedly raised DA, along with its turnover reduction, in all the post-mortem brain regions examined as well as in microdialysis samples, while in W rats 5-HT tissue concentration was lower in PFC and St and higher in NAC and Hipp. Cortical extracellular 5-HT concentrations were increased in group housed and decreased in isolated W animals. Moreover, isolation increased DA concentrations in the PFC of LH rats, and decreased 5-HT in W rats in NAC and Hipp. Lately, 5-HT turnover was also affected by both strain and isolation conditions. Conclusions : This study suggests that W and LH rats have markedly different neurochemical profiles in response to isolation, resulting in altered monoamine levels that vary according to brain area and rat strain. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate rat strain when considering isolation rearing to model symptoms of schizophrenia and/or depression.",

The objective was to compare direct costs and outcomes between PP-LAI and olanzapine pamoate (OLZ-LAI) in treating chronic schizophrenia in Norway from the perspective of the government payer.We used a decision analytic model over a 1-year time horizon. Clinical inputs were derived from the literature and an expert panel; costs were taken from standard lists, adjusted to 2010 Norwegian kroner (NOK). Discounting was not done. Main outcomes included average cost per patient treated, hospitalisations, emergency room (ER) visits and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The pharmacoeconomic outcome was the incremental cost per QALY. Robustness was examined using one-way sensitivity analyses on critical variables and a 5000-iteration probabilistic Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis with all variables included.PP-LAI generated 0.845 QALY at a cost of 151 336 NOK of which 23% was due to drugs; 25% of patients were hospitalised and another 12% required ER visits. OLZ-LAI cost 174 351 NOK (21% due to drugs); patient outcomes included 0.844 QALY, 27% hospitalisations and 14% ER visits. PP-LAI dominated OLZ-LAI in the base case. The analysis was reasonably robust against variations in drug cost but sensitive to small changes in adherence and hospitalisation rates. Overall, PP-LAI was dominant over OLZ-LAI in 54.5% of simulations. Replacing OLZ-LAI with PP-LAI would be cost saving for the Norwegian healthcare system.PP-LAI was cost-effective compared with OLZ-LAI in treating patients with chronic schizophrenia in Norway but sensitive to changes in adherence and hospitalisation rates.",

    "abstract": "Background The World Health Organization estimates that major depression affects about 350 million people all over the world and reports this disorder as the major contributor to the global burden of diseases. Despite the well-defined symptomatology, major depression is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology is not clearly established. Although several treatments are available, most depressed patients do not achieve the complete remission of symptoms. Factors linked to the persistence of the disorder have been investigated, particularly those related to the way of life. Moreover, it has been suggested that nutritional aspects may influence its development. Among them, a diet rich in ω-3 has been associated with a reduced risk of major depression, although its deficiency is associated with depressive disorders. Methods This review provides a general view about evidences of the use of ω-3 in major depression cases. Results Several studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of ω-3 in the prevention and treatment of major depression. However, not all the results have shown significant statistical benefits. Conclusions More studies are necessary to clarify detailed mechanisms of the antidepressant effects of ω-3 and may explain the source of contradictions in results published until the moment.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and Hypothesis Some authors draw a connection between the dopaminergic pathways and emotional perception. The present study is based on that association and addresses the question whether methylphenidate and the resulting amelioration of the disturbed dopamine metabolism lead to an improvement of the facial affect recognition abilities in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods A computer test was conducted on 21 participants, aged 7 – 14 years and with a diagnosis of ADHD – some with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder – conducted the FEFA (Frankfurt Test and Training of Facial Affect), a computer test to examine their facial affect recognition abilities. It consists of two subtests, one with faces and one with eye pairs. All participants were tested in a double-blind cross-over study, once under placebo and once under methylphenidate. Results and Discussion The collected data showed that methylphenidate leads to amelioration of facial affect recognition abilities, but not on a significant level. Reasons for missing significance may be the small sample size or the fact that there exists some overlapping in cerebral connections and metabolic pathways of the site of action of methylphenidate and the affected dopaminergic areas in ADHD. However, consistent with the endophenotype concept, certain gene locations of the dopaminergic metabolism as both an aetiological factor for ADHD and the deficient facial affect recognition abilities with these individuals were considered. Consulting current literature they were found to be not concordant. Therefore, we conclude that the lacking significance of the methylphenidate affect on facial affect recognition is based on this fact.",

    "abstract": "Severe depression may be a risk factor for diagnostic conversion into bipolar disorder (BD), and psychotic depression (PD) has been consistently associated with BD. The aims of the present study were to investigate the stability of the diagnosis of severe depression and the differences between PD and non-psychotic severe depression (non-PD), as well as to assess the effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).Patients who were hospitalised for severe depression (diagnosed according to ICD-10) both with and without psychotic symptoms (n=89; mean age=55.6 years, SD=13.9) from 2001 to 2010 were retrospectively assessed.By the 75th month of follow-up assessments, 11(12.4%) patients had developed BD. Among these 11 converters, nine had developed BD within 1 year after admission. Only sub-threshold hypomanic symptoms were significantly related to developing BD. The number of depressive episodes and history of physical diseases were significantly increased in non-PD compared with PD patients, whereas ECT was significantly increased in PD compared with non-PD patients. There was a significant association between length of stay at the hospital and the number of days between admission and ECT.Sub-threshold hypomanic symptoms may represent a prodrome of BD or an indicator of an already manifest phenotype, especially in older patients, which suggests cautious use of antidepressants. In severe depression, non-PD may often occur secondary to physical diseases and patients may experience increased recurrences compared with PD patients, which may be a more 'primary' disorder and often requires ECT treatments. ECT is effective for severe depression regardless of the presence of any psychotic feature; the earlier ECT is introduced, the better the expected treatment outcome.",

Methods The data of the older cohort ( n = 593, aged 15 years at the original sampling) of the longitudinal Estonian Children Personality, Behaviour and Health Study (ECPBHS) were used. Follow-ups were conducted at ages 18 and 25 years. Aggressiveness, inattention and hyperactivity were reported by class teachers or, at older age, self-reported.

Results MAOA -uVNTR genotype had no independent effect on aggressiveness, hyperactive and inattentive symptoms, and neither was there a genotype interaction with adverse life events. Interestingly, the proportion of male subjects with higher education by the age of 25 was significantly larger among those with MAOA low-activity alleles (χ 2 = 7.13; p = 0.008).

Aims To describe the protocol for an ongoing randomised controlled trial designed to test whether the reported beneficial effects of YT on cognitive function among SZ patients can be replicated. Secondarily, the effects of YT on daily functioning living skills are evaluated. Methods Consenting patients with SZ receive routine clinical treatment and are randomised to adjunctive YT, adjunctive physical exercise (PE) or treatment as usual (proposed N = 234 total, N = 78 in each group).

Within the framework of the functional deafferentiation theory in Parkinson's disease, we hypothesised that motor retardation in bipolar depression is mediated by disrupted subcortical activation, leading to decreased activation of cortical motor areas during finger tapping.We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural activity during self-paced finger tapping to elucidate whether brain regions that mediate preparation, control and execution of movement are activated differently in subjects with bipolar depression (n = 9) compared to healthy controls (n = 12).An uncorrected whole-brain analysis revealed significant group differences in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Corrected analyses showed non-significant differences in patients compared to controls: decreased and less widespread activation of the left putamen and left pallidum; increased activity in the left thalamus and supplementary motor area; decreased activation in the left lateral pre- and primary motor cortices; absence of activation in the pre-supplementary motor area; activation of the bilateral rostral cingulate motor area.Both movement preparation and execution may be affected in motor retardation, and the activity in the whole left-side motor circuit is altered during self-initiated motor performance in bipolar depression.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Immunological theories, particularly the sickness syndrome theory, may explain psychopathology in mood disorders. However, no clinical trials have investigated the association between overall immune system markers with a wide range of specific symptoms including potential gender differences. METHODS: We included two similar clinical trials, the lithium treatment moderate-dose use study and clinical and health outcomes initiatives in comparative effectiveness for bipolar disorder study, enrolling 765 participants with bipolar disorder. At study entry, white blood cell (WBC) count was measured and psychopathology assessed with the Montgomery and Aasberg depression rating scale (MADRS). We performed analysis of variance and linear regression analyses to investigate the relationship between the deviation from the median WBC, and multinomial regression analysis between different WBC levels. All analyses were performed gender-specific and adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, race, and somatic diseases. RESULTS: The overall MADRS score increased significantly for each 1.0×109/l deviation from the median WBC among 322 men (coefficient=1.10; 95% CI=0.32-1.89; p=0.006), but not among 443 women (coefficient=0.56; 95% CI=-0.19-1.31; p=0.14). Among men, WBC deviations were associated with increased severity of sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, inability to feel, and suicidal thoughts. Among women, WBC deviations were associated with increased severity of reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, and pessimistic thoughts. Both higher and lower WBC levels were associated with increased severity of several specific symptoms. CONCLUSION: Immune system alterations were associated with increased severity of specific mood symptoms, particularly among men. Our results support the sickness syndrome theory, but furthermore emphasise the relevance to study immune suppression in bipolar disorder. Due to the explorative nature and cross-sectional design, future studies need to confirm these findings.",

However, significant differences between groups could not be demonstrated. On the other hand, correlation analyses showed a significant correlation between (−)-OSU6162 concentration and change in MFS, FF, and BDI score within the concentration interval 0.1–0.7 µM. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed a larger treatment effect with (−)-OSU6162 in improving MFS and FF symptoms in patients on antidepressant therapy compared to those without antidepressant treatment. Conclusion (−)-OSU6162 was found to be safe and well tolerated. When analysing the entire material (−)-OSU6162 was not found to differ significantly from placebo in alleviating fatigue in ME patients but was superior to placebo in counteracting fatigue in a subgroup of ME patients who received concomitant pharmacological treatment for depression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among young people. Recognition of the contribution of impulsive behaviour may help novice drivers to behave more safely. Previously a brief intervention focusing on impulsive traffic behaviour conducted by psychologists in driving schools had been effective. The aim of this study was an independent re-evaluation of the effect of the intervention, as conducted by driving school teachers, and assessment of the potential associations with candidate genotypes. Methods Driving school students (mean age 22.5, SD=7.9) were divided into intervention ( n =704) and control ( n =737) groups. Driving school teachers were trained to administer the intervention which consisted of a lecture and group work (1.5 h in total) on impulsivity. Traffic offences and crashes were monitored during 3 years, using police and traffic insurance fund databases. Functional polymorphisms of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter genes ( DAT1 VNTR and 5-HTTLPR) were assessed. Results The intervention significantly lowered general traffic risk and prevalence of traffic accidents. DAT1 VNTR 9R carriers, particularly males, had higher general traffic risk in the whole sample. Female 5-HTTLPR s’ allele carriers of the intervention group had the lowest general traffic risk. Intervention was most effective in female DAT1 VNTR 10R/10R homozygotes. Conclusions Brief impulsivity-centred intervention appears as a promising strategy for preventing risk-taking behaviour in novice drivers and can be fully integrated to driving school curriculum.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Antipsychotics often induce excessive weight gain. We hypothesized that individuals with genetic variations related to known obesity-risk genes have an increased risk of excessive antipsychotic-induced weight gain. This hypothesis was tested in a subset of the CATIE trial data-set. METHODS: The CATIE trial compared effects and side effects of five different antipsychotics through an 18 month period. Based on the maximum weight gain recorded, excessive weight gain was defined as >7% weight-gain. Cytoscape and GeneMania were instrumental in composing a molecular pathway from eight selected genes linked to obesity. Genetic information on a total of 495.172 SNPs were available from 765 (556 males) individuals. Enrichment test was conducted through reactomePA and Bioconductor. A permutation test was performed, testing the generated pathway against 105 permutated pathways (p</=0.05). In addition a standard GWAS-analysis was performed. RESULT: GWAS analysis did not detect significant differences related to excessive weight gain. The pathway generated contained 28 genes. A total of 2067 SNPs were significantly expressed (p<0.01) within this pathway when comparing excessive weight gainers to the rest of the sample. Affected genes included PPARG and PCSK1 not previously related to treatment-induced weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular pathway composed from high-risk obesity genes, was shown to overlap with genetics of patients who gained > 7% weight gain during the CATIE trial. This suggests that genes related to obesity, composes a pathway of increased risk of excessive antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Further independent analyses are warranted that may confirm or clarify the possible reasoning behind.",

TRPV1 antagonism in the dorsolateral PAG (dlPAG) induces anxiolytic-like effects in models based on conflict situations. No study, however, has investigated whether these receptors could contribute to fear responses to proximal threat. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that TRPV1 in the PAG could mediate fear response in rats exposed to a predator. Methods We verified whether exposure to a live cat (a natural predator) would activate TRPV1-expressing neurons in the PAG. Double-staining immunohistochemistry was used as a technique to detect c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, and TRPV1 expression. We also investigated whether intra-dlPAG injections of the TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine (CPZ), would attenuate the behavioural consequences of predator exposure. Results Exposure to a cat increased c-Fos expression in TRPV1-positive neurons, mainly in the dorsal columns of the PAG, suggesting that TRPV1-expressing neurons are activated by threatening stimuli. Accordingly, local injection of CPZ inhibited the fear responses. Conclusion These data support the hypothesis that TRPV1 channels mediate fear reactions in the dlPAG. This may have an implication for the development of TRPV1-antagonists as potential drugs for the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: ADHD is a prevalent and highly heritable mental disorder associated with significant impairment, morbidity and increased rates of mortality. This combination of high prevalence and high morbidity/mortality seen in ADHD and other mental disorders presents a challenge to natural selection-based models of human evolution. Several hypotheses have been proposed in an attempt to resolve this apparent paradox. The aim of this study was to review the evidence for these hypotheses. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on empirical investigations of natural selection-based evolutionary accounts for ADHD in adherence with the PRISMA guideline. The PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were screened for relevant publications, by combining search terms covering evolution/selection with search terms covering ADHD. RESULTS: The search identified 790 records. Of these, 15 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, and three were included in the review. Two of these reported on the evolution of the seven-repeat allele of the ADHD-associated dopamine receptor D4 gene, and one reported on the results of a simulation study of the effect of suggested ADHD-traits on group survival. The authors of the three studies interpreted their findings as favouring the notion that ADHD-traits may have been associated with increased fitness during human evolution. However, we argue that none of the three studies really tap into the core symptoms of ADHD, and that their conclusions therefore lack validity for the disorder. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that the natural selection-based accounts of ADHD have not been subjected to empirical test and therefore remain hypothetical.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Korsakoff’s syndrome (KS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by severe anterograde amnesia and executive deficits. Theory of Mind (ToM) is the capacity to represent others’ mental states such as their knowledge, thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and intentions in order to explain and predict their behaviour. Surprisingly this topic has received hardly any attention in research on KS, although the severity of behavioural problems in KS suggest possible ToM difficulties. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess whether cognitive and affective ToM are impaired in patients with KS. Methods We examined 21 KS patients and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls on three standardised tests that assess cognitive and affective ToM, including the subtests of the mini-Social Cognition and Emotional Assessment battery and a specialised version of the Sally–Anne Test. Results KS patients showed largely impaired cognitive and affective ToM compared to healthy controls, as reflected in large effect sizes on both cognitive and affective ToM tests. Executive deficits explained problems in emotion recognition, but not other ToM aspects. Conclusion KS patients have large impairments in both cognitive and affective aspects of social cognition. Their ability to recognise emotions, take the perspective of others, and understand socially awkward situations is vastly compromised. The impairments in ToM functioning are to a large degree functionally discrepant from executive disorders that are commonly present in KS. This study therefore highlights the importance to properly index ToM functioning in neuropsychological assessments for individuals with a possible KS diagnosis.",

Platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) and neuropeptide S receptor 1 (NPSR1) gene polymorphisms have been identified as markers of impulsivity, alcohol use and excessive risk-taking. We aimed to find out how this knowledge on neurobiology of impulsivity applies to drunk driving and traffic behaviour in general.We have longitudinally examined the behaviour of drunk drivers (n = 203) and controls (n = 211) in traffic, in association with their alcohol-related problems, personality measures and the three biomarkers. We analysed differences between the subjects based on whether they had committed driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) violation in a 10-year time period after recruitment or not and investigated further, what kind of predictive value do the different biomarkers have in committing DWI and other traffic violations and accidents.The original drunk drivers group had lower platelet MAO activity but further DWI was not significantly associated with this measure. Being a NPSR1 T-allele carrier contributed to the risk of repeatedly committing DWI. DAT1 9R carriers in contrast were involved in more traffic accidents by their own fault (active accidents), compared to 10R homozygotes in the whole sample. All groups with DWI also had significantly more alcohol-related problems and higher scores in maladaptive impulsivity compared to controls without DWI.Established biological markers of alcohol use and impulsivity can be reliably associated with everyday traffic behaviour and help in contributing to the understanding of the need for more personalized prevention activities.",

Recent evidence suggests that this receptor may be involved in the control of motor functions. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effects of intra-striatal administration of GPR55 selective ligands in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease. Methods: Experimental Parkinson was induced by unilateral intra-striatal administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 10 µg/rat). L-α-lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI, 1 and 5 µg/rat), an endogenous GPR55 agonist, and ML193 (1 and 5 µg/rat), a selective GPR55 antagonist, were injected into the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Motor performance and balance skills were evaluated using the accelerating rotating rod and the ledged beam tests. The sensorimotor function of the forelimbs and locomotor activity were assessed by the adhesive removal and open field tests, respectively. Results: 6-OHDA-lesioned rats had impaired behaviours in all tests. Intra-striatal administration of LPI in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats increased time on the rotarod, decreased latency to remove the label, with no significant effect on slip steps, and locomotor activity. Intra-striatal administration of ML193 also increased time on the rotarod, decreased latency to remove the label and slip steps in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats mostly at the dose of 1 µg/rat. Conclusions: This study suggests that the striatal GPR55 is involved in the control of motor functions. However, considering the similar effects of GPR55 agonist and antagonist, it may be concluded that this receptor has a modulatory role in the control of motor deficits in an experimental model of Parkinson.",

Similar dramatic effects have not been observed in clinical trials with other NMDAR antagonists indicating ketamine may possess unique pharmacological properties. Tetrabenazine induces ptosis (a drooping of the eyelids), and the reversal of this effect, attributed to a sympathomimetic action, has been used to detect first-generation antidepressants, as well as ketamine. Because the actions of other NMDAR antagonists have not been reported in this measure, we examined whether reversal of tetrabenazine-induced ptosis was unique to ketamine, or a class effect of NMDAR antagonists. Methods The effects of ketamine and other NMDAR antagonists to reverse tetrabenazine-induced ptosis were examined and compared with their antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test (TST) in mice. Results All the NMDAR antagonists tested produced a partial reversal of tetrabenazine-induced ptosis and, as expected, reduced immobility in the TST. Ketamine, memantine, MK-801 and AZD6765 were all about half as potent in reversing tetrabenazine-induced ptosis compared to reducing immobility in the TST, while an NR2B antagonist (Ro 25-6981) and a glycine partial agonist (ACPC) were equipotent in both tests. Conclusion The ability to reverse tetrabenazine-induced ptosis is a class effect of NMDAR antagonists. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the inability of memantine, AZD6765 (lanicemine) and MK-0657 to reproduce the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine in the clinic result from insufficient dosing rather than a difference in mechanism of action among these NMDAR antagonists.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of (−)-OSU6162 in doses up to 30 mg b.i.d. in patients suffering from mental fatigue following stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: This 4 + 4 weeks double-blind randomised cross-over study included 30 patients afflicted with mental fatigue following a stroke or head trauma occurring at least 12 months earlier. Efficacy was assessed using the Mental Fatigue Scale (MFS), the Self-rating Scale for Affective Syndromes [Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS)], the Frenchay Activity Index (FAI), and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Safety was evaluated by recording spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs). Results: There were significant differences on the patients’ total FAI scores ( p = 0.0097), the subscale FAI outdoor scores ( p = 0.0243), and on the trail making test (TMT-B) ( p = 0.0325) in favour of (−)-OSU6162 treatment. Principal component analysis showed a clear overall positive treatment effect in 10 of 28 patients; those who responded best to treatment had their greatest improvements on the MFS. Reported AEs were mild or moderate in severity and did not differ between the (−)-OSU6162 and the placebo period. Conclusion: The most obvious beneficial effects of (−)-OSU6162 were on the patients’ activity level, illustrated by the improvement on the FAI scale. Moreover, a subgroup of patients showed substantial improvements on the MFS. Based on these observed therapeutic effects, in conjunction with the good tolerability of (−)-OSU6162, this compound may offer promise for treating at least part of the symptomatology in patients suffering from stroke- or TBI-induced mental fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on general health, mental well-being, and experiences of control compared to pre-pandemic populations. Our hypotheses were that we would observe a significantly lower level of psychological well-being and general health in the 2020 sample compared to the pre-pandemic samples, and that we would observe younger age groups to be the most affected. Method: Two representative Danish populations (2016, n = 1656) and (2017, n = 3366) were compared to a representative Danish population (2020, n = 1538) sampled during the first lockdown in May 2020. Two-tailed tests of proportions were used to investigate possible differences between samples in proportions reporting poorer mental well-being measured by 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index, general health, and internal locus of control. Results: Younger men (aged 18–24) and younger women (aged 18–44) as well as elderly women (aged 65–74) reported lower mental well-being during the early phase of the pandemic compared to the population from 2016. Both women and men in 2020 reported significantly lower levels of internal locus of control compared to the 2017 sample. This was especially true for younger men and women. There were no statistically significant differences in general health between populations. Discussion: This study partly supports the hypothesis that the Covid-19 pandemic affected mental well-being negatively among younger persons. However, longitudinal studies are needed to investigate possible long-term effects of the pandemic on mental health and well-being. Further, qualitative studies are needed to investigate the in-depth consequences of Covid-19.",

Previous history of depression was the main risk factor. The rates of believing in conspiracy theories concerning the COVID-19 were alarming with the majority of individuals (especially females) following some theory to at least some extend.The current paper reports high rates of depression, distress and suicidal thoughts in the HCPs during the lockdown, with a high prevalence of beliefs in conspiracy theories. Female gender and previous history of depression acted as risk factors, while the belief in conspiracy theories might act as a protective factor. The results should be considered with caution due to the nature of the data (online survey on a self-selected but stratified sample).",

Among the latter, obstetric complications (OCs) have been widely studied as risk factors, but it is not yet well understood how OCs relate to the heterogeneous presentations of psychotic disorders. We assessed the clinical phenotypes of individuals with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) in relation to the presence of OCs.Two-hundred seventy-seven patients with an FEP were assessed for OCs using the Lewis-Murray scale, with data stratified into three subscales depending on the timing and the characteristics of the obstetric event, namely: complications of pregnancy, abnormal foetal growth and development and difficulties in delivery. We also considered other two groups: any complications during the pregnancy period and all OCs taken altogether. Patients were clinically evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for schizophrenia.Total OCs and difficulties in delivery were related to more severe psychopathology, and this remained significant after co-varying for age, sex, traumatic experiences, antipsychotic dosage and cannabis use.Our results highlight the relevance of OCs for the clinical presentation of psychosis. Describing the timing of the OCs is essential in understanding the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation.",

Previous studies have investigated levels of selected groups of cytokines in patients on opioid maintenance treatment. Little is known about the levels of multiple cytokines in patients with chronic HCV infection on opioid maintenance treatment. Our aim was to investigate the cytokine profile in patients with active HCV infection with and without opioid maintenance treatment. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in an out-patients population included upon referral for antiviral hepatitis C infection treatment. The level of 27 cytokines was measured in serum using multiplex technology. Patients were interviewed using a modified version of the European addiction severity index. Data pertaining to weight, height, current medication, smoking habits, allergies, previous medical history and ongoing withdrawal symptoms were collected. Non-parametric testing was used to investigate differences in levels of cytokines between the two groups. A 3-model hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyse associations between cytokines and confounding variables. Results: Out of 120 included patients, 53 were on opioid maintenance treatment. Median duration of opioid treatment was 68.4 months. There were no demographical differences between the two groups other than age. IL-1β was lower and eotaxin-1 higher in the group on opioid maintenance treatment than in the non-opioid group. No other inter-group differences in the remaining cytokine levels were found. Conclusion: In HCV infection patients, the impact of chronic opioid administration on peripheral circulating cytokine level is minimal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: It has been suggested that schizophrenia involves dysconnectivity between functional brain regions and also the white matter structural disorganisation. Thus, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has widely been used for studying schizophrenia. However, most previous studies have used the region of interest (ROI) based approach. We, therefore, performed the probabilistic tractography method in this study to reveal the alterations of white matter tracts in the schizophrenia brain. Methods: A total of four different datasets consisted of 189 patients with schizophrenia and 213 healthy controls were investigated. We performed retrospective harmonisation of raw diffusion MRI data by dMRIharmonisation and used the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) for probabilistic tractography. The connectivities between different ROIs were then compared between patients and controls. Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between the connection probabilities and the symptoms and cognitive measures in patients with schizophrenia. Results: After applying Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, 11 different tracts showed significant differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Many of these tracts were associated with the basal ganglia or cortico-striatal structures, which aligns with the current literature highlighting striatal dysfunction. Moreover, we found that these tracts demonstrated statistically significant relationships with few cognitive measures related to language, executive function, or processing speed. Conclusion: We performed probabilistic tractography using a large, harmonised dataset of diffusion MRI data, which enhanced the statistical power of our study. It is important to note that most of the tracts identified in this study, particularly callosal and cortico-striatal streamlines, have been previously implicated in schizophrenia within the current literature. Further research with harmonised data focusing specifically on these brain regions could be recommended.",

This study investigated biomarker levels and diagnostic utility of plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in NPC compared to healthy controls. Methods: Patients with NPC were recruited from a specialist assessment and management service. Data was available from an age and sex-matched healthy control group. NfL and GFAP were measured on Quanterix Simoa HD-X analysers and groups compared using generalised linear models. NfL levels were compared to, and percentiles derived from, recently developed NfL reference ranges. Results: Plasma NfL was significantly elevated in 11 patients with NPC compared to 25 controls (mean 17.1 vs. 7.4 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.001), and reference ranges (all &gt;98 th percentile). NfL distinguished NPC from controls with high accuracy. GFAP levels were not elevated in NPC (66.6 vs. 75.1 pg/ml). Discussion: The study adds important evidence on the potential diagnostic utility of plasma NfL in NPC, extends the literature of NfL as a diagnostic tool to differentiate neurodegenerative from primary psychiatric disorders, and adds support to the pathology in NPC primarily involving neuronal, particularly axonal, degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Though commonly used to model affective disorders, zebrafish display notable differences in terms of the structure and function of the brain serotonin system, including responses to pharmacological interventions, as compared to mammals. For example, elevation of brain serotonin following acute administration of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) generally has anxiogenic effects, both in the clinical situation and in rodent models of anxiety, but previous research has indicated the opposite in zebrafish. However, several issues remain unresolved. We conducted a systematic review of SRI effects in zebrafish models of anxiety and, on the basis of these results, performed a series of experiments further investigating the influence of serotonin-releasing agents on anxiety-like behaviour in zebrafish, with sex-segregated wild-type animals being administered either escitalopram, or the serotonin releaser fenfluramine, in the light-dark test. In the systematic review, we find that the available literature indicates an anxiolytic-like effect of SRIs in the novel-tank diving test. Regarding the light-dark test, most studies reported no behavioural effects of SRIs, although the few that did generally saw anxiolytic-like responses. In the experimental studies, consistent anxiolytic-like effects were observed with neither sex nor habituation influencing treatment response. We find that the general effect of acute SRI administration in zebrafish indeed appears to be anxiolytic-like, indicating, at least partly, differences in the functioning of the serotonin system as compared to mammals and that caution is advised when using zebrafish to model affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Placebo and nocebo effects are widely reported across psychiatric conditions, yet have seldom been examined in the context of gambling disorder. Through meta-analysis, we examined placebo effects, their moderating factors, and nocebo effects, from available randomised, controlled pharmacological clinical trials in gambling disorder. Methods: We searched, up to 19 February 2024, a broad range of databases, for double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of medications for gambling disorder. Outcomes were gambling symptom severity and quality of life (for efficacy), and drop outs due to medication side effects in the placebo arms. Results: We included 16 RCTs ( n = 833) in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size for gambling severity reduction in the placebo arms was 1.18 (95%CI 0.91–1.46) and for quality of life improvement was 0.63 (0.42-0.83). Medication class, study sponsorship, trial duration, baseline severity of gambling and publication year significantly moderated effect sizes for at least some of these outcome measures. Author conflict of interest, placebo run-in, gender split, severity scale choice, age of participants or unbalanced randomisation did not moderate effect sizes. Nocebo effects leading to drop out from the trial were observed in 6% of participants in trials involving antipsychotics, while this was less for other medication types. Conclusion: Placebo effects in trials of pharmacological treatment of gambling disorder are large, and there are several moderators of this effect. Nocebo effects were measureable and may be influenced by medication class being studied. Practical implications of these new findings for the field are discussed, along with recommendations for future clinical trials.",

This introduction to the issue presents a broad perspective of the impact of stressors on immune functioning in animal studies and in humans, considering the potential effects of acute, subchronic and chronic stressors, as well as the contribution of previous stressor experience in promoting neurochemical and immunological alterations. Given the supposition that cytokines may act as immunotransmitters, and immune challenge may be viewed as a stressor, a brief review is provided concerning the impact of stressors and cytokine challenges on central neurochemical functioning, with particular emphasis on the commonalties between the effects of these treatments. It is suggested that by virtue of the neurochemical changes imparted by cytokines, a depressive affect may be instigated, just as it is in response to psychogenic stressors. To this end, an overview is presented concerning the relationship between cytokines and depression, as well as the influence of cytokine treatments on behavioral changes in animal studies and among patients receiving immunotherapy. Provisionally, the data support the view that activation of the inflammatory response system may contribute to affective illness, and that cytokines may act as signaling molecules to activate central nervous system processes regulating mood states.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiological mechanism of auditory hallucination (AH) in schizophrenia remains elusive, but AH can be caused by the abnormality in the speech perception system based on the speech perception neural network model.The purpose of this study was to investigate whether schizophrenic patients with AH have the speech processing impairment as compared with schizophrenic patients without AH, and whether the speech perception ability could be improved after AH had subsided.Twenty-four schizophrenic patients with AH were compared with 25 schizophrenic patients without AH. Narrative speech perception was assessed using a masked speech tracking (MST) task with three levels of superimposed phonetic noise. Sentence repetition task (SRT) and auditory continuous performance task (CPT) were used to assess grammar-dependent verbal working memory and non-language attention, respectively. These tests were measured before and after treatment in both groups.Before treatment, schizophrenic patients with AH showed significant impairments in MST compared with those without AH. There were no significant differences in SRT and CPT correct (CPT-C) rates between both groups, but CPT incorrect (CPT-I) rate showed a significant difference. The low-score CPI-I group showed a significant difference in MST performance between the two groups, while the high-score CPI-I group did not. After treatment (after AH subsided), the hallucinating schizophrenic patients still had significant impairment in MST performance compared with non-hallucinating schizophrenic patients.Our results support the claim that schizophrenic patients with AH are likely to have a disturbance of the speech perception system. Moreover, our data suggest that non-language attention might be a key factor influencing speech perception ability and that speech perception dysfunction might be a trait marker in schizophrenia with AH.",

    "abstract": "Buprenorphine is a partial μ-opioid receptor agonist that is being increasingly used in clinical practice in the treatment of opioid dependence in the UK, USA, and, elsewhere. Its unique pharmacological properties mean it is a relatively safe drug, it can be given by alternate day dispensing, and it is associated with relatively mild symptoms on withdrawal. The interpretation of the research literature on buprenorphine is however, complex, and often appears to be in conflict with how buprenorphine is used in clinical practice. This article describes these apparent contradictions, their likely explanations, and how these may further inform our clinical practice. The article also describes the clinically relevant pharmacological properties of buprenorphine, compares it to methadone, relates the evidence to clinical experience, and provides practical advice on how to manage the most common clinical techniques. The best quality evidence suggests that very rapid buprenorphine induction is not associated with a higher drop-out rate than methadone, that buprenorphine is probably as good as methadone for maintenance treatment, and is superior to methadone and α-2 adrenergic agonists for detoxification. However, buprenorphine cannot yet be considered the ‘gold standard’ treatment for opiate dependence because of the higher drop-out rates that may occur on induction using current techniques, its high-cost relative to methadone, and because the place of buprenorphine in treatment is still continuing to evolve.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often suffer from a number of enduring cognitive impairments such as in attention, memory, speed of processing information and dual-task performance.The aim of this study was to assess the patterns of regional brain activation in response to the Tower of London (ToL) task in a group of patients suffering from chronic TBI using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).fMRI was performed during performance of the ToL planning task in 10 patients suffering from severe TBI and in 10 age- and sex-matched controls using a 3 T magnetic resonance scanner.Performance data showed no difference in response accuracy between the TBI group and the healthy control group. Statistical parametric brain maps showed that the TBI group activates larger and additional areas of the cerebral cortex than the healthy control group both for tasks and for a subtraction contrast between the tasks.The results of this study are interpreted as a cortical reorganization inside the executive system of vigilance and working memory in patients with TBI. Both parietal and frontal areas are recruited to compensate for damaged brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To conduct a comprehensive literature review of the area of neural stem cells and neuropsychiatry. Methods: ‘Neural stem cells’ (NSCs) and ‘neurogenesis’ were used as keywords in Medline (1966 – November 2006) to identify relevant papers in the areas of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This list was supplemented with papers from reference lists of seminal reviews. Results: The concept of a ‘stem cell’ continues to evolve and is currently defined by operational criteria related to symmetrical renewal, multipotency and functional viability. In vivo adult mammalian neurogenesis occurs in discrete niches in the subventricular and subgranular zones – however, functional precursor cells can be generated in vitro from a wide variety of biological sources. Both artificial and physiological microenvironment is therefore critical to the characteristics and behaviour of neural precursors, and it is not straightforward how results from the laboratory can be extrapolated to the living organism. Transplant strategies in PD have shown that it is possible for primitive neural tissue to engraft into neuropathic brain areas, become biologically functional and lead to amelioration of clinical signs and symptoms. However, with long-term follow-up, significant problems related to intractable side-effects and potential neoplastic growth have been reported. These are therefore the potentials and pitfalls for NSC technology in neuropsychiatry. In AD, the physiology of amyloid precursor protein may directly interact with NSCs, and a role in memory function has been speculated. The role of endogenous neurogenesis has also been implicated in the etiology of depression. The significance of NSCs and neurogenesis for schizophrenia is still emerging. Conclusions: There are a number of technical and conceptual challenges ahead before the promise of NSCs can be harnessed for the understanding and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research into fundamental NSC biology and how this interacts with the neuropsychiatric disease processes is required.",

However, the incidence of neurosyphilis presenting initially with psychiatric symptomalogy is unclear. In this article, a clinical case is reported so as to illustrate some of the issues involved.A 33-year-old married man was admitted because of a depressive episode associated with somatic preoccupations and a gradual loss of ability to function a year prior to his admission. The symptoms described above raised the question of an organic brain syndrome associated with the psychotic depression. Some laboratory and additional examinations were performed. Serological tests for syphilis were positive for both the hemagglutination test, Treponema pallidum hemaglutination (TPHA), and the immunofluorescent antibody test, fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS). Based on these findings, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis was made. The patient was treated with benzathine penicillin (2 400 000 units i.m. once a week) for 3 weeks and venlafaxine (150 mg daily) and olanzapine (5 mg daily). His depression disappeared gradually, and he was discharged in partial remission.High-risk groups such as patients with neuropsychiatric diseases should be screened with serological tests so as to prevent morbidity and help eliminate syphilis.",

Methods: Seventy-one Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) patients with BD and 61 healthy volunteers were recruited from the Bipolar Disorder Program at the Clinic Hospital of Barcelona. Patients with ( n = 36, 50.7%) and without ( n = 35, 49.3%) previous suicide attempts were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-P). Previous suicide attempts were carefully investigated by means of patient and caregiver interview and by a standard structured interview from the protocol of our BD Program. The Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) was employed to assess functional impairment. Results: Euthymic patients with previous suicide attempts showed functional impairment, particularly in occupational ( F = 30.39; p = 0.001) and cognitive functioning ( F = 18.43; p = 0.001). In addition, family history of psychiatric illness (χ 2 : 6.49; degrees of freedom (df) = 2;132; p = 0.010), family history of affective disorders (χ 2 = 5.57; p = 0.017), psychotic symptoms (χ 2 = 5.88; p = 0.014) and axis II comorbidity were associated with previous suicide attempts (χ 2 = 5.16; p = 0.021). Conclusion: Bipolar patients with previous suicide attempts had lower overall functioning than patients who did not attempt suicide. Previous suicide attempts were particularly associated with the occupational and cognitive domains of functioning.",

Most studies have shown some benefit in terms of relapse prevention, but have tended to be effective for either the depressed or the manic pole, and not both. Broader outcome parameters such as quality of life have not been reported consistently. The mechanisms whereby treatments might exert their effects have not been clearly delineated. Many studies have excluded patients with bipolar II and other variants, and those with psychiatric and substance use comorbidities, reducing their generalisability. Discussion: Whilst psychosocial treatments show promise in the area of bipolar disorder, more work is required to delineate the effective elements of such interventions, and to ensure generalisability to individuals with bipolar II and other forms of bipolar disorder, as well as those with psychiatric and substance use comorbidities. Other forms of delivery, such as via the internet, deserve further exploration.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The trait of experiencing positive affect could make a unique contribution to the pathogenesis of affective disorders. Animal models of positive emotionality are scarce but 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rats have been associated with rewarding experience. We have previously reported that persistent inter-individual differences in expression of 50-kHz USVs (chirps) exist, and that male rats producing fewer 50-kHz USVs are more sensitive to chronic variable stress (CVS). In this study we examined the effect of CVS on extracellular serotonin (5-HT) levels in hippocampus, comparing high-chirping (HC) and low-chirping (LC) rats. Methods: Male rats were classified as HC- and LC-rats on the basis of stable levels of USV response using sessions of tickling-like stimulation. CVS procedure lasted 4 weeks. The administration of citalopram (1 μM) and measurements of levels of 5-HT were done by microdialysis. Corticosterone levels were also measured from trunk blood. Results: Male LC-rats were more sensitive to CVS: the effect of stress on body weight gain was larger and corticosterone levels from full blood were higher in the stressed LC animals as compared to both the unstressed groups and the stressed HC animals. While no baseline differences in extracellular 5-HT levels in hippocampus were found between groups, the increase in extracellular 5-HT levels induced by citalopram was much higher in LC-rats. Conclusion: Chronic stress appears to modify hippocampal 5-HT overflow in rats with low positive affectivity. This finding supports the notion of greater vulnerability to CVS in male rats with low positive affectivity.",

Animal models are not the perfect tools for the full understanding of human development and behavior, but they can be an important place to start. This review focused on the recent updates of animal model research in autism.We have reviewed the publications over the last three decades, which are related to animal model study in autism.Animal models are important because they allow researchers to study the underlying neurobiology in a way that is not possible in humans. Improving the availability of better animal models will help the field to increase the development of medicines that can relieve disabling symptoms. Results from the therapeutic approaches are encouraging remarkably, since some behavioral alterations could be reversed even when treatment was performed on adult mice. Finding an animal model system with similar behavioral tendencies as humans is thus vital for understanding the brain mechanisms, supporting social motivation and attention, and the manner in which these mechanisms break down in autism. The ongoing studies should therefore increase the understanding of the biological alterations associated with autism as well as the development of knowledge-based treatments therapy for those struggling with autism.In this review, we have presented recent advances in research based on animal models of autism, raising hope for understanding the disease biology for potential therapeutic intervention to improve the quality of life of autism individuals.",

It is hypothesised that the FES is the initial step in the development of pathologically disturbed biochemical status that is characteristic of chronic schizophrenia. Methods Platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) and serum semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) activities, serum concentrations of middle-mass endotoxic molecules (MMEM) and malondialdehyde and parameters of the serum albumin functional state were measured in 26 FES patients and 15 age-matched healthy controls. Results Severity of disorder before the treatment was 75.5 ± 2.2, according to Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score. FES patients were characterised by significant increase in MAO activity (99%) and MMEM concentration (124%) and significant decrease in SSAO activity (26%) as compared with controls. Changes of all other parameters were insignificant. Regression analysis has showed a significant relationship of three parameters – MAO, SSAO and MMEM, with values of PANNS score. Two methods of extraction of factor analysis revealed that MAO and SSAO belonged to Factor 1, whereas MMEM and albumin functional parameters belonged to Factor 2. Conclusion Comparing our earlier data on chronic schizophrenic patients with present data, we hypothesise that FES patients are at the stage that leads to a stable, pathological state of metabolism.",

Results: BPD patients performed significantly worse on the N-back test compared to healthy controls ( p &lt; 0.05), but not on the CPT. The N-back deficit was more pronounced and significant in the 3-back condition and inversely correlated with impulsivity. Conclusions: These results suggest the presence of working memory deficits in BPD that may be linked to greater impulsivity and sustained by impairment in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.",

It has been suggested that the function of glutamate transporters (GLTs) has a major role in the development of neuropathic pain. This study was performed to evaluate various doses of ceftriaxone, a beta-lactam antibiotic, on the symptoms in the rat chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. This drug has been recently introduced as a selective up-regulator and activator of GLT 1 . Methods Neuropathy was induced in adult male Wistar rats and animals were treated intraperitoneally with 100–400 mg/kg of ceftriaxone for seven consecutive days immediately after surgery. Gabapentin (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was used as a reference drug. von Frey filaments, acetone drop and radiant heat methods were used to assess mechanical allodynia, thermal allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, respectively. Results Ceftriaxone in the repeated doses for 7 days showed significant antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects especially at a dose of 200 mg/kg twice a day. Conclusion The results suggest that ceftriaxone as a modulator of glutamate uptake could provide beneficial effects in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain, especially allodynia that is less sensitive to the most available drugs.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Delirium shares symptoms with some mental illnesses. This may lead to misdiagnosis of delirium in psychiatric patients and a risk of inadequate management. Moreover, literature on delirium in psychiatric patients is sparse. The aim was to analyse possible changes in the diagnostic incidence of delirium in psychiatric patients from 1995 to 2011, and to investigate the patients with regard to sex, age, and type of patient. Methods All first time ever diagnoses of delirium among psychiatric patients were identified in the nationwide Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register (DPCRR) from 1995 to 2011. The delirium diagnoses include (1) delirium unspecified, (2) delirium with dementia, and (3) drug-related delirium, all in accordance with International Classification of Diseases-10. The incidence rates were age standardised. Results A total of 15 680 persons diagnosed with delirium for the first time were identified in the DPCRR between 1995 and 2011. The total incidence rate of delirium has decreased, reaching 8.4/1000 person-years in 2011. In 2011, 2.6% of the demented patients were diagnosed with delirium with dementia. Diagnosis of delirium is significantly more common in men, and the three groups of delirium showed a characteristic age distribution. Conclusion Our incidences were markedly lower when compared with previous studies. This suggests a possible underdiagnosis of delirium in psychiatric hospitals and should be investigated further, as delirium is a serious state and identifying the syndrome is important for sufficient treatment.",

Recent research also indicates that both disorders are associated with dysfunction of the N -Methyl-D-Aspartate glutamate receptors (NMDA-R) subunit 1. Methods We present the case of Ms A, 16 years old. Ms A presented with acute personality change, bizarre behaviour, delusional ideas and atypical seizures. She had a family history of psychotic disorders, and autistic traits diagnosed in childhood. She was initially diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Delayed testing of CSF indicated ANRE. As the patient was a Jehovah's witness the treating team was unable to use gammaglobulin therapy; they instead relied on combined plasmapheresis and rituximab. To exclude the possibility that the affected members of this family shared a gene coding for an abnormal configuration of the NMDA receptor subunit 1 we sequenced the region of the GRIN1 gene in DNA extracted from blood in both Ms A and her grandmother. Results Ms A’s condition improved dramatically, though her long-term memory is still demonstrably impaired. No genetic abnormality was detected. Conclusions This case emphasizes how important it is, for a first episode psychosis, to exclude ANRE and other autoimmune synaptic encephalitides, even in the face of significant family history, and if seronegative, the importance of testing for CSF autoantibodies.",

This is similarly the case for depression developing during interferon-α (IFN-α) therapy. Because vulnerability becomes evident in those who slept poorly before IFN-α, we prospectively determined which specific aspect of sleep could predict subsequent depression. Methods Two nights of polysomnography with quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) were obtained in 24 adult, euthymic subjects – all subsequently treated with IFN-α for hepatitis C. Every 2 weeks, a Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score was obtained, and the maximal increase in BDI-II from pre-treatment baseline – excluding the sleep question – was determined. Results The delta sleep ratio (DSR; an index of early-night restorative delta power) was inversely associated with BDI-II increases ( p &lt;0.01), as was elevated alpha power (8–12 Hz; p &lt;0.001). Both delta (0.5–4 Hz) and alpha power exhibited high between-night correlations ( r =0.83 and 0.92, respectively). In mixed-effect repeated-measure analyses, there was an interaction between alpha power and DSR ( p &lt;0.001) – subjects with low alpha power and elevated DSR were resilient to developing depression. Most other sleep parameters – including total sleep time and percentage of time in slow wave sleep – were not associated with subsequent changes in depression. Conclusions Both high DSR and low alpha power may be specific indices of resilience. As most other aspects of sleep were not associated with resilience or vulnerability, sleep interventions to prevent depression may need to specifically target these specific sleep parameters.",

Although the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine are effective for depression and anxiety in schizophrenia, as demonstrated by animal model studies, this has not been clarified for asenapine. Therefore, we compared the effects of asenapine in the conditioned fear stress model with those of clozapine and olanzapine. Method Rats were individually fear conditioned using electrical foot shock in a Skinner box. Approximately 24 h later, individual animals were returned to the same Skinner box (without electrical shock) and their freezing behaviour was observed for 5 min. Animals were treated with asenapine, clozapine, olanzapine, the 5-HT 1A receptor partial agonist buspirone, or the 5-HT 2C receptor antagonist SB242084 at 30 min before freezing behaviour assessment. The 5-HT 1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 or the 5-HT 2C receptor agonist Ro60-0175 was also used concomitantly with asenapine. The effects of asenapine, clozapine, and olanzapine on serotonin release in the rat hippocampus were also measured using in vivo microdialysis. Results Asenapine reduced freezing behaviour, while neither clozapine nor olanzapine reduced freezing behaviour. Buspirone and SB242084 also reduced freezing behaviour. The effect of asenapine in reducing freezing behaviour was not altered by the concomitant administration of WAY100635 or Ro60-0175. Both asenapine and clozapine, but not olanzapine, increased serotonin release in the rat hippocampus.

The DSM-V defines the condition of gambling disorder as a persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behaviour leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. Method: A total of 61 subjects with gambling disorders were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-I), the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) and the Major Depression inventory (MDI). Results: Two-way analysis of variance showed highly significant treatment outcomes associated with reductions in SOGS, F(1,60)=84.79, p<0.0001, MDI, F(1,60)=38.13, p<0.0001, craving, F(1,60)=29.59, p<0.0001, and gambling control, 47.65, p<0.0001.

Finally, there was a significant interaction effect between treatment outcome and comorbidity, F(1,60)=3.90, p<0.005, suggesting that both treatment and comorbidity contributed to reductions in depressive symptoms.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Cross-sectional data show elevated levels of circulating cytokines in psychiatric patients. The literature is divided concerning anti-inflammatory drugs’ ability to relieve symptoms, questioning a causal link between inflammatory pathways and psychiatric conditions. We hypothesised that the development of circulating cytokine levels is related to mental distress, and that this relationship is affected by the use of anti-inflammatory drugs. Methods: The study was a longitudinal assessment of 12-week inpatient treatment at Modum Bad Psychiatric Center, Norway. Sera and self-reported Global Severity Index (GSI) scores, which measure psychological distress, were collected at admission ( T 0 ), halfway ( T 1 ) and before discharge ( T 2 ). Other variables known to distort the neuroimmune interplay were included. These were age, gender, diagnosis of PTSD, antidepressants and anti-inflammatory drugs. A total of 128 patients (92 women and 36 men) were included, and 28 were using anti-inflammatory medication. Multilevel modelling was used for data analysis. Results: Patients with higher levels of IL-1RA and MCP-1 had higher GSI scores ( p = 0.005 and p = 0.020). PTSD patients scored higher on GSI than non-PTSD patients ( p = 0.002). These relationships were mostly present among those not using anti-inflammatory drugs ( n = 99), with higher levels of IL-1RA and MCP-1 being related to higher GSI score ( p = 0.023 and 0.018, respectively). Again, PTSD patients showed higher GSI levels than non-PTSD patients ( p = 0.014). Conclusions: Cytokine levels were associated with level of mental distress as measured by the GSI scores, but this relationship was not present among those using anti-inflammatory drugs. We found no association between cytokine levels and development of GSI score over time.",

While it is known that cholesterol plays a role in neural development and hence low levels of serum lipids could have long-term effects on behaviour, no longitudinal studies showed the association of serum lipids levels with impulsivity. We aimed to examine the prognostic properties of serum lipid levels during childhood and adolescence on measures of impulsivity during early adulthood in a representative birth cohort sample. Methods: We have investigated whether serum lipid levels measured at 9, 15, 18 and 25 years of age have an association with impulsivity in 25 years old young adults. This analysis was based on data of the birth cohort representative samples of the Estonian Children Personality Behaviour and Health Study (original n = 1238). Impulsivity was self-reported with the Adaptive and Maladaptive Impulsivity Scale. Results: Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measured in boys aged 9, 15 and 18 years predicted disinhibition and thoughtlessness in 25-year-old young adults. High scores of disinhibition were associated with low total and LDL cholesterol levels in males but, while less consistently, with high total and LDL cholesterol levels in females. Cross-sectional analysis did not result in systematic outcomes. Conclusions: Serum lipid levels could have an impact on the development of Maladaptive Impulsivity starting from an early age. This effect of cholesterol continues throughout adolescence into young adulthood.",

Since depression and T2DM often co-exist, inflammatory pathways are suggested as a possible link. Hence, the establishment of an immune-mediated animal model would shed light on mechanisms possibly linking depression and metabolic alterations. OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated a behavioural and metabolic paradigm following chronic infusion with low doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using osmotic minipumps in male rats. METHODS: Behavioural testing consisted of evaluating activity level in the open field and depressive-like behaviour in the forced swim test. Metabolic assessment included measurement of body weight, food and water intake, and glucose and insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: LPS-infused rats showed acute signs of sickness behaviour, but chronic LPS infusion did not induce behavioural or metabolic changes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that although inflammation is immediately induced as indicated by acute sickness, 4 weeks of chronic LPS administration via osmotic minipumps did not result in behavioural changes. Therefore, this paradigm may not be a suitable model for studying the underlying mechanisms that link depression and T2DM.",

Therapies are effective in a majority of paediatric patients, however, many only get partial response. It is therefore important to study the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. Methods 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to study the concentration of brain metabolites in four different locations (cingulate gyrus and sulcus, occipital cortex, thalamus and right caudate nucleus). Treatment-naive children and adolescents with OCD (13 subjects) were compared with a group of healthy age- and gender-matched subjects (11 subjects). Multivariate analyses were performed on the concentration values. Results No separation between controls and patients was found. However, a correlation between metabolite concentrations and symptom severity as measured with the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) was found. Strongest was the correlation with the CY-BOCS obsession subscore and aspartate and choline in the caudate nucleus (positively correlated with obsessions), lipids at 2 and 0.9 ppm in thalamus, and occipital glutamate+glutamine, N -acetylaspartate and myo-inosytol (negatively correlated with obsessions). Conclusions The observed correlations between 1 H MRS and CY-BOCS in treatment-naive patients further supports an occipital involvement in OCD. The results are consistent with our previous study on adult OCD patients. The 1 H MRS data were not supportive of a separation between the patient and control groups.",

Methods: A total of 101 cognitively healthy participants (age: 42.3 ± 21.3 years, 62 females) were included in this study. Verbal memory was assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Intake of ( n-3 ) PUFA and SFA was calculated from food-frequency questionnaire-derived data (EPIC-FFQ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were obtained (Siemens Trio 3T scanner) and grey matter volumes (GMV) were assessed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM/SPM8). We examined the association of SFA/( n-3) PUFA ratio and memory performance as well as GMV using regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, body mass index, apolipoprotein E (APOE) status and alcohol consumption. For VBM data, a multiple regression analysis was performed using the same covariates as mentioned before with intracranial volume as an additional covariate. Results: A high SFA/( n-3) PUFA ratio was significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) correlated with poorer verbal memory performance and with lower GMV in areas of the left prefrontal cortex that support memory processes. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a diet rich in PUFAs is likely to exert favourable effects on brain morphology in brain areas important for memory and executive functions. This could constitute a possible mechanism for maintaining cognitive health in older age.",

The aim of this study, therefore, was to assess the impact of lockdown on the mental health of PWD and their carers. Methods: Forty-five carers of PWD completed a telephone interview during the baseline assessment of the SOLITUDE study to gather information on life conditions and changes in symptoms of PWD during lockdown. Associations between changes in symptoms of PWD and carers’ concerns and mental health were investigated. Results: About 44% of carers experienced anxiety and irritability and reported changes in behavioural and cognitive symptoms in PWD. These changes were associated with worse carers’ mental health and concerns about faster disease progression ( χ 2 = 13.542, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: COVID-19-related social isolation has had a negative impact on patients’ and carers’ mental health. Potential long-term neurocognitive consequences require further investigation.",

Several genes have been associated with LBD, but little is known about their contributions to LBD pathophysiology. Each gene may transcribe multiple RNA, and LBD brains have extensive RNA splicing dysregulation. Hence, we completed the first transcriptome-wide transcript-level differential expression analysis of post-mortem LBD brains for gaining more insights into LBD molecular pathology that are essential for facilitating discovery of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for LBD. We completed transcript-level quantification of next-generation RNA-sequencing data from post-mortem anterior cingulate (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) of people with pathology-verified LBD (LBD = 14; Controls = 7) using Salmon . We identified differentially expressed transcripts (DET) using edgeR and investigated their functional implications using DAVID . We performed transcriptome-wide alternative splicing analysis using DRIMseq . We identified 74 DET in ACC and 96 DET in DLPFC after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction (5%). There were 135 and 98 FDR-corrected alternatively spliced genes in ACC and DLPFC of LBD brains, respectively. Identified DET may contribute to LBD pathology by altering DNA repair, apoptosis, neuroplasticity, protein phosphorylation, and regulation of RNA transcription. We confirm widespread alternative splicing and absence of chronic neuroinflammation in LBD brains. Transcript-level differential expression analysis can reveal specific DET that cannot be detected by gene-level expression analyses. Therapeutic and diagnostic biomarker potential of identified DET, especially those from TMEM18, MICB, MPO, and GABRB3 , warrant further investigation. Future LBD blood-based biomarker studies should prioritise measuring the identified DET in small extracellular vesicles.",

While maternal smoking during pregnancy and low-grade peripheral inflammation have been implicated, its neurobiological basis remains incompletely understood. Our aim was to elucidate neuroinflammatory signaling contributing to ADHD and investigate behavioural and molecular changes in a mouse model. Methods: We examined neuroinflammatory signaling using prenatal nicotine exposed (PNE) mice via immunohistochemistry combined with cortical thickness (CT) measurement in the subregions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Mice were exposed to nicotine via drinking water containing 300 μg/ml nicotine and 2% sucrose until weaning 2 weeks prior to mating to induce ADHD-like symptoms, as opposed to controls receiving drinking water containing 2% sucrose alone. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess ADHD-like behaviors and accompanying anxiety on postnatal week 5. Inflammatory pathways in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prelimbic cortex (PL) and infralimbic cortex (IL) were examined using Iba-1 and NF-κB immunolabeling, and microglial morphology was analyzed. Results: Findings showed increased CT, microglial cell number, activity, and NF-κB activation in the ACC, which correlated with attention-related impairment in PNE mice. Increased Iba-1 levels in the PL and IL, along with elevated NF-κB activation in the IL, were observed in PNE mice, which corresponded with a significant increase in anxiety-like behaviors compared to controls. PNE mice also morphologically exhibited microglia activation in all three subregions. Conclusion: Perinatal nicotine exposure contributes to ADHD development through neuroinflammatory signaling, a common end pathway.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been associated with increased risk of osteoporosis, and sertraline may be more potent than citalopram in this regard. Here, target trial emulation was used to investigate whether sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram (the S-enantiomer of citalopram) differentially affect the risk of osteoporosis. Subsequently, it was examined whether SSRIs increase the risk of osteoporosis in a dose-response-like manner. Methods: Danish nationwide registers were used to identify all individuals that initiated treatment for depression with sertraline, citalopram, or escitalopram between January 1, 2007, and March 1, 2019. These individuals were followed until development of osteoporosis, death, or end of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for relevant baseline covariates to emulate randomised treatment allocation to compare the rate of osteoporosis for individuals treated with sertraline, citalopram or escitalopram. Subsequently, the cumulative dose of sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram was calculated, and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess dose-response-like relationships with osteoporosis. Results: We identified 27,280, 65,529, and 17,703 individuals initiating treatment with sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram, respectively. There was no material or statistically significant differential risk of osteoporosis between these groups (adjusted hazard rate ratio, aHRR = 0.98 for citalopram versus sertraline and aHRR = 0.94 for escitalopram versus sertraline). The results were not indicative of the SSRIs having a dose-response-like effect on osteoporosis risk. Conclusions: Sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram do not appear to differentially affect the risk of osteoporosis. The lack of clear dose-response-like relationships suggest that they do not have a causal effect on osteoporosis risk.",

Seven mRNA microarray datasets containing samples from patients with MDD and CHD were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. Combined matrixes of MDD and CAD were constructed for subsequent analysis. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Functional enrichment analyses based on shared DEGs were conducted to identify pivotal pathways. A protein-protein network was also applied to further investigate the functional interaction. Results showed that 24 overlapping genes were identified. Enrichment analysis indicated that the shared genes are mainly associated with immune function and ribosome biogenesis. The functional interactions of shared genes were also demonstrated by PPI network analysis. In addition, three hub genes including MMP9, S100A8, and RETN were identified. Our results indicate that MDD and CHD have a genetic association. Genes relevant to immune function, especially IL-17 signalling pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD and CHD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: New developments in neuro-navigation and machine learning have allowed for personalized approaches to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders. One specific approach, known as the Cingulum Framework, identifies individualized brain parcellations from resting state fMRI based on a machine-learning algorithm. Theta burst stimulation, a more rapid form of rTMS, is then delivered for 25 sessions, 5 per day, over 5 days consecutively or spaced out over 10 days. Preliminary studies have documented this approach for various neurological and psychiatric ailments. However, the safety and tolerability of this approach is unclear. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on 165 unique patients (202 Target Sets) treated with this personalized approach between January 2020 to December 2023. Results: Common side effects included fatigue (102/202, 50%), local muscle twitching (89/202, 43%), headaches (49/202, 23%), and discomfort (31/202, 17%), all transient. The top 10 unique parcellations commonly found in the Target Sets included L8av (52%), LPGs (28%), LTe1m (21%), RTe1m (18%), LPFM (17%), Ls6-8 (13%), Rs6-8 (9%), L46 (7%), L1 (6%), and L6v (6%). Fatigue was most common in Target Sets that contained R6v (6/6, 100%) and L8c (5/5, 100%). Muscle twitches were most common in Target Sets that contained RTGv (5/5, 100%) and LTGv (4/4, 100%). Conclusion: These side effects were all transient and well-tolerated. No serious side effects were recorded. Results suggested that individualized, connectome-guided rTMS is safe and contain side effect profiles similar to other TMS approaches reported in the literature.",

Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) contributes to the metabolism of aripiprazole and risperidone. Variations in CYP2D6 activity may affect treatment response or adverse effects. The impact of these variations on adherence and medication attitudes is unclear. Aims: This study investigates the relationships between CYP2D6 phenotype, self-reported adherence, adverse effects, and attitudes among aripiprazole and risperidone users. Methods: This study analyzed data from the SUPER-Finland cohort of 10,474 adults with psychotic episodes, including 1,429 aripiprazole and 828 risperidone users. The Attitudes towards neuroleptic treatment (ANT) questionnaire assessed adherence and adverse effects in all patients, while medication-related attitudes were examined in a subgroup of 1,000 participants. Associations between CYP2D6 phenotypes and outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression and beta regression in aripiprazole and risperidone groups separately. Results: Among risperidone users, we observed no association between CYP2D6 phenotypes and adherence, adverse effects, or attitudes. Similarly, no link was found between adherence and CYP2D6 phenotypes among aripiprazole users. However, aripiprazole users with the ultrarapid CYP2D6 phenotype had more adverse effects (OR = 1.71, 95 % CI 1.03–2.90, p = 0.041). Among aripiprazole users, CYP2D6 ultrarapid phenotype was associated with less favorable attitudes towards antipsychotic treatment (β = -0.48, p = 0.023). Conclusions: We found preliminary evidence that the ultrarapid CYP2D6 phenotype is associated with increased adverse effects and negative attitudes towards antipsychotic medication among aripiprazole users. CYP2D6 phenotype did not influence adherence, adverse effects, or attitudes among risperidone users.",

However, the genetic architecture between suicidality and subcortical brain volumes remains poorly characterized. Using Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), we investigated the genetic overlap between suicidality and subcortical brain volume. Methods: GWAS summary statistics for suicidal behaviours, including Suicide Attempts, Ever Self-Harmed, and Thoughts of Life Not Worth Living, from the UK Biobank, Suicide from the FinnGen Biobank, and data on seven subcortical brain volumes and Intracranial Volume from the ENIGMA2 study, were used to investigate the genetic correlation between phenotypes as well as potential genetic factors. Results: A common genetic factor was identified, comprising two categories: Suicide Attempt, Ever Self-Harmed, and Thoughts of Life Not Worth Living from the UK Biobank, and Suicide from FinnGen, Intracranial Volume, and subcortical brain volumes. Cross-phenotype GWAS meta-analysis of each category at variant, gene and subnetwork levels unveils a list of significant variants (P-value &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ), and potential hub genes (P-value &lt; 0.05) of consideration. Network, pathway, and Gene Ontology analyses of these joint categories highlighted enriched pathways and biological processes related to blood-brain barrier permeability suggesting that the presence and severity of suicidality are associated with an inflammatory signature detectable in both blood and brain tissues. Conclusion: This study underscores the role of brain and peripheral blood inflammation in suicide risk and holds promise for developing targeted interventions and personalized treatment strategies to reduce suicidality in at-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Compulsive-like rigidity may be associated with hyposerotonergia and increased kynurenine (KYN) pathway activity. Conversion of tryptophan (TRP) to kynurenine (KYN), which may contribute to hyposerotonergia, is bolstered by inflammation, and could be related to altered gut microbiota composition. Here, we studied these mechanisms in a naturalistic animal model of compulsive-like behavioural rigidity, i.e., large nest building (LNB) in deer mice ( Peromyscus sp.). Methods: Twenty-four (24) normal nest building (NNB)- and 24 LNB mice (both sexes) were chronically administered either escitalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; 50 mg/kg/day) or a control solution, with nesting behaviour analysed before and after intervention. After endpoint euthanising, frontal cortices and striata were analysed for TRP and its metabolites, plasma for microbiota derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its binding protein (LBP), and stool samples for microbial DNA. Results: LNB, but not NNB, decreased after escitalopram exposure. At baseline, LNB associated with reduced frontal cortical TRP concentrations and hyposerotonergia that was unrelated to altered KYN pathway activity. In LNB mice, escitalopram significantly increased frontal-cortical and striatal TRP without altering serotonin concentrations. Treated LNB, compared to untreated LNB- and treated NNB mice, had significantly reduced plasma LPS as well as a microbiome showing a decreased inferred potential to synthesise short-chain fatty acids and degrade TRP. Conclusion: These findings support the role of altered serotonergic mechanisms, inflammatory processes, and gut microbiome involvement in compulsive-like behavioural rigidity. Our results also highlight the importance of gut-brain crosstalk mechanisms at the level of TRP metabolism in the spontaneous development of such behaviour.",

Methods: Searches were conducted in the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases, following PRISMA methodology for peer-reviewed empirical articles. The final selection comprised 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria: (1) published articles with quantitative data, (2) aimed at observing the relationship between psychological and neuropsychological symptoms and the electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in institutionalised children, (3) published between 2016 and 2023, and (4) examining institutionalised minors in residential care homes. Results: The articles show that these children exhibit general immaturity in EEG patterns, with a predominance of slow waves (primarily in the theta band). They also demonstrate poorer performance in executive functions (e.g. working memory, inhibition, and processing speed) and cognitive processes, along with a higher risk of externalising problems. However, current evidence does not allow definitive conclusions on whether early EEG abnormalities predict long-term neuropsychological deficits, despite data showing associations between EEG changes and certain cognitive dysfunctions at the time of evaluation. Conclusion: The reviewed evidence suggests that EEG alterations in institutionalised minors are linked to executive dysfunction and increased psychopathological risk. These findings highlight the value of EEG in identifying at-risk children and inform the design of preventive interventions. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify causal relationships.",

The study included 360 participants: 169 AMAB (143 GAHT, 26 controls) and 191 AFAB (141 GAHT, 50 controls). GAHT recipients had significantly higher QoL than controls in both AMAB (p < 0.01) and AFAB (p = 0.02) groups, particularly in the psychological health domain (D2). AFAB participants reported higher overall QoL than AMAB in both GAHT (p = 0.01) and control (p = 0.04) groups, with significance in the social domain among GAHT participants. No significant relationship was found between oestradiol concentrations and QoL for participants AMAB. However, a significant relationship between testosterone concentrations and QoL was observed only in the social relationship domain (D3) for participant AFAB. This study highlights the benefits of GAHT for QoL and differences in QoL between AMAB and AFAB individuals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Clozapine is the only licensed medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, although it is underused. Healthcare professionals (medical and non-medical professionals) play a crucial role in the management of clozapine. Consultant psychiatrists are accountable for the initiation of clozapine, whereas non-medical professionals are often responsible for the monitoring, the management of side effects and patient education. It appears that healthcare professionals' (HCPs) competence and confidence may have an effect on clozapine underutilisation. Aim: To synthesise the most pertinent literature examining the factors influencing HCPs competence and confidence in the management of clozapine and how these factors influence variation in prescribing practice. Methods: A review of the literature focusing on these elements was conducted. The P opulation, C ontext, O utcome (PCO) framework was adopted to support the literature search. The databases Medline, Psychinfo, Scopus, Cinahl, Pubmed, Embase, British Library, Ethos e-thesis, Google Scholar, Dart Europe e-thesis were consulted; the search was completed in January 2025. Screening, selection, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two researchers. Thematic analysis was used to investigate and compare the data emerging from the studies. Results: Thirty-four articles were included in the review. Six themes were identified: attitude toward and knowledge about clozapine, misconceptions (regarding side effects, monitoring and co-morbidities), guidelines, education, training and experience. HCPs self-reported as competent with guidelines (local and national), yet they expressed less confidence in their ability to adhere to them and were uncertain about managing side effects. Lack of education, training and insufficient exposure to clozapine management were significant factors impacting competence and confidence, resulting in clozapine underuse and variance in prescribing practice. The review highlighted a gap in the literature, as only a few studies involving non-medical professionals were found. Conclusions: A general lack of education and training related to clozapine use was identified amongst all professionals. The impact of educational programmes on improving competence and enhancing confidence was considered positive, however when integrated with clinical practice. The studies identified in this review were lacking in the involvement of non-medical professionals. Given their crucial role in managing side effects and educating patients and carers, it is evident that their inclusion in future research is imperative.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: This study presents the most recent data on the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) due to anxiety disorders across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region from 1990-2021, analysed by sex, age, and sociodemographic index (SDI). Methods: We assessed the burden of anxiety disorders using data sourced from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study. The estimates of prevalence, DALYs, and YLDs are provided as numbers and age-standardised rates, accompanied by their 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results: In 2021, the age-standardised point prevalence of anxiety disorders in the region was 5.95 thousand, with an incidence rate of 883.4 per 100,000. The number of YLDs in 2021 reached 4.5 million. From 1990 to 2021, the burden of anxiety disorders increased significantly. Lebanon had the highest burden in 2021. Among both sexes, the 10–14 age group had the highest incidence rate, while the 15–19 age group had the highest prevalence and YLD rates. In 2021, most age groups in the MENA region had YLD rates that were higher than the global average. Conclusion: This study highlights the urgent need for a multidisciplinary approach to prevent and manage anxiety disorders. Ensuring accessible and affordable treatment options for all affected individuals is crucial. Governments should prioritise supporting programmes to effectively address mental health issues, given the unique socioeconomic and geopolitical challenges in the MENA region. By including effective preventive methods alongside treatment in healthcare strategies, the burden of anxiety disorders can be significantly reduced.",

Exome-sequence data has now been made available for the remaining 270,000 participants and a two-stage process was applied in order to test for association in this second sample using only genes showing suggestive evidence for association in the first sample. Methods: Cases were defined as participants who reported having seen a psychiatrist for “nerves, anxiety, tension or depression”. Exhaustive testing of the first sample was carried out using rare variant analyses informed by 45 different predictors of impact of nonsynonymous variants. The 100 genes showing the strongest evidence for association were then analysed in the second sample using the same predictor as had been most statistically significant in the first sample. Results: The results for the 100 nominated genes conformed closely with the null hypothesis, with none approaching statistical significance after correction for multiple testing. Conclusion: Risk of common affective disorder, even if severe enough to warrant specialist referral, is not sufficiently impacted by effects of rare variants in a small enough number of genes that effects can be detected even with large sample sizes. Actionable results might be obtained with a more extreme phenotype but very significant resources would be required to achieve adequate power.

We assessed non-modifiable and modifiable factors associated with the change in well-being and mental health from pre- to during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 26-April-2020 to 22-April-2021. Paired samples t -tests were conducted to assess change in well-being (measured on The World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)) and mental health (a validated composite psychopathology p-score). Sociodemographic, environmental, clinical and behavioral factors associated with change in outcomes were examined. Results: The sample comprised of 1866 adults ( M age=44.26±17.36 years, female=78.9%). Results indicated a significant decrease in well-being ( p &lt;0.001) and increase in p-score ( p &lt;0.001) from pre- to during the pandemic. Having a prior mental health condition was associated with a worsening well-being score, while being female was associated with a worsening p-score. Being of Black African descent was associated with improved p-score and higher socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with improved well-being. Factors associated with worsening of both well-being and the p-score included adulthood adversity, financial loss since COVID-19, and placing greater importance on direct contact/interactions and substance use as coping strategies. Higher education level and endorsing studying/learning something new as a very important coping strategy were associated with improved well-being and p-score. Conclusion: Findings inform the need for targeted interventions to reduce and prevent adverse well-being and mental health outcomes during a pandemic, especially among vulnerable groups.",

Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) tests and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tests (AUDIT) were administered at baseline and six weeks. The antidepressant treatments varied: somewere started, others changed or continued their previous medication, and others had their doses adjusted. Patients started behavioral activation therapy. Linear regression was used with a relative MADRS score change during six weeks as the dependent variable and patient age, AUDIT score, BMI, daily number of cigarettes smoked, sex, and serum IL-1Ra and IL-8 concentrations as independent variables. Higher baseline serum IL-1Ra and IL-8 levels were associated with a smaller relative change in the MADRS-score within the first six weeks of treatment in linear regression analysis (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). In further analysis comparing groups with ≤ 24 and>24 MADRS score only the ≤ 24 MADRS score group showed a similar association. Higher baseline IL-1Ra and IL-8 concentrations were associated with a lesser relative response to depression treatment, particularly in patients with mild depression. Results on IL-8 concur with earlier findings, whereas the association between higher IL-1Ra serum concentrations reduced treatment response is a novel finding.",

These barriers highlight the need for alternative, scalable methods that can effectively simulate social evaluative contexts. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the anxiety-inducing effects of video conferencing exposure, measured through heart rate variability (HRV), using a fully online-based methodology. Methods: A total of 31 participants who reported social anxiety were recruited online and engaged in a simulated video conference task, where they interacted with multiple audience members’ emotional faces on a 3×3 split screen. Their video recordings were analyzed using imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) to obtain HRV data. Baseline anxiety levels were assessed using validated self-report questionnaires, including the State Anxiety Scale (STAI-X1), Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI-X2), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), and Social Phobia Scale (SPS). Results: Pearson correlation analysis revealed that STAI-X1 scores negatively correlated with high-frequency normalized units (HFnu) changes and positively correlated with low-frequency high-frequency (LF–HF) ratio and low-frequency normalized units (LFnu) changes. Similar patterns were observed for STAI-X2. These findings suggest that higher levels of trait and state anxiety are associated with greater reductions in parasympathetic activity and increased sympathetic activation during online video conferencing. Conclusions: This study underscores the clinical potential of online video conferencing as a scalable and accessible exposure therapy for the digital era, eliminating spatial and logistical constraints associated with traditional in-person exposure therapy.",

Methods: Twenty-one healthy women (mean age: 23.6 ± 5.4 years) participated in three sessions: self-selected intensity exercise, moderate-intensity prescribed exercise, and a nonexercise control session. Before each session, participants were exposed to unpleasant stimuli. State anxiety symptoms and affective responses were assessed pre- and post-stimulus exposure and pre- and post-sessions. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA tested state anxiety, while the Friedman test analyzed affective responses. Results: Time significantly affected state anxiety symptoms [F (2,0) = 25.977; P &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.565]. Anxiety increased post-stimulus (P &lt; 0.001) and decreased after all sessions.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: By synthesising findings from both clinical and preclinical research, this review aims to provide an understanding of the interplay between 5-HT2A receptor psychedelics and the immune system and considers how their immunomodulatory effects associate with neuronal and behavioural changes. Methods: A PubMed literature search covering the past 30 years was conducted using keywords such as ‘5-HT2A receptor’, ‘psychedelics’, ‘immune system’, and ‘HPA axis’. Studies were included if they addressed the effects of 5-HT2AR psychedelics on immune function, neuroimmune interactions, or HPA axis involvement. This narrative review synthesises evidence highlighting the bi-directional effects of 5-HT2AR psychedelics between the immune and nervous systems, identified through this search process. Results: Preclinical and clinical studies report that 5-HT2AR psychedelics have some direct immunomodulatory properties with downregulation of gene regulators like NF-κB, and reduced cytokine expression such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β at a central and peripheral level, accompanied by modulation of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol. Direct immunomodulatory effects are mediated by pathways involving serotonin receptors, the Sigma-1 receptor, and the TrkB receptor. Immunomodulation is further mediated indirectly via the HPA axis. Conclusion: Further studies will determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these immunomodulatory effects. There is growing interest in the potential of 5-HT2AR psychedelics for treating a range of mental health and brain disorders. In keeping with their immunomodulatory actions, the likely modulation of brain glia and glial-neuronal interaction remains to be determined, representing a promising direction of further research on the therapeutic potential of 5-HT2AR psychedelics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant public health concern, and current treatments often have limitations in effectiveness and adherence. Psilocybin, a psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms, is being explored as a potential treatment for depression. It primarily acts through the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor but interacts with 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors. Its precise mechanisms remain under investigation. Objectives: (1) To consolidate evidence on psilocybin’s efficacy and safety for depression, (2) to identify limitations in the literature, and (3) to highlight areas needing further research. Methods: This systematic review follows PRISMA guidelines and analyzes 20 studies, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and open-label studies. The studies cover various populations, including individuals with treatment-resistant depression, different dosing regimens, and adjunctive therapies. Results: Psilocybin therapy shows substantial and rapid antidepressant effects, often after one or two sessions with psychological support. Improvements are sustained for weeks or months in many cases. Psilocybin is generally well-tolerated, with mild adverse effects such as anxiety during administration and transient headaches, which are manageable in controlled settings . Conclusions: Psilocybin demonstrates promise as a novel treatment for depression, especially for individuals unresponsive to conventional antidepressants. Further research is needed to refine dosing, explore long-term effects, and understand its mechanisms of action.",

Speech, influenced by physiological stress responses, offers a promising non-invasive, real-time alternative for stress detection. This study examined relationships between speech features, state anger, and salivary cortisol using a validated stress-induction paradigm. Methods: Participants (N=82) were assigned to cold (n=43) or warm water (n=39) groups. Saliva samples and speech recordings were collected before and 20 minutes after the Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test (SECPT), alongside State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) ratings. Acoustic features from frequency, energy, spectral, and temporal domains were analyzed. Statistical analyses included Wilcoxon tests, correlations, linear mixed models (LMMs), and machine learning (ML) models, adjusting for covariates. Results: Post-intervention, the cold group showed significantly higher cortisol and state anger. Stress-related speech changes occurred across domains. Alpha ratio decreased and MFCC3 increased post-stress in the cold group, associated with cortisol and robust to sex and baseline levels. Cortisol–speech correlations were significant in the cold group, including sex-specific patterns. LMMs indicated baseline cortisol influenced feature changes, differing by sex. ML models modestly predicted SECPT group membership (AUC = 0.55) and showed moderate accuracy estimating cortisol and STAXI scores, with mean absolute errors corresponding to ∼24–38% and ∼16–28% of observed ranges, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of speech features as objective stress markers, revealing associations with cortisol and state anger. Speech analysis may offer a valuable, non-invasive tool for assessing stress responses, with notable sex differences in vocal biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Progress in the development of new and improved medications for psychosis has been notably slow and disappointing. The first treatment for schizophrenia was introduced in early 1950s and the majority of medications available today exclusively function through dopamine antagonism. The search for a new drug treatment with a different mechanism of action was extremely slow-paced mainly due to the limited understanding of the aetiology, pathophysiology and genetics of schizophrenia. Given the fact that a third of people do not respond to dopamine antagonists, there is a clear need for an antipsychotic with a different mechanism of action. In 2024, FDA approved a new medication for psychosis branded as Cobenfy. This xanomeline-trospium combination works via cholinergic pathway and the dual M1 and M4 receptor activation helps regulates dopaminergic and glutaminergic neurotransmission as well, thereby restoring balance in these circuits. Acetylcholine also helps improve cognitive processing including attention, learning and sensory gating. In this article, we try to understand the place of this unique drug in the antipsychotic ladder. We also explore the clinical scenarios where this medication can be effective as well as the potential future outlook when it comes to the treatment of schizophrenia",

    "abstract": "Amisulpride, a substituted benzamide derivative, has a unique pharmacological profile characterized by a high affinity for dopaminergic D2/D3 receptors, as well as an affinity for 5-HT7 receptors. Its effectiveness and safety surpass those of traditional antipsychotic drugs and multi-receptor antipsychotic medications in improving global symptoms, including both positive and negative symptoms. This makes it a compelling subject for study. However, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its clinical efficacy in treating schizophrenia remain largely unexplored. We assessed cell viability following amisulpride treatment using the MTT and a real-time cell viability assay. Subsequently, we conducted RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS analyses to identify differentially expressed genes and proteins in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with amisulpride. In the present study, we used RNA-seq analysis to identify downregulated expression of a transcriptional factor, FOSB, in amisulpride-treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, while using LC-MS/MS analysis to identify multiple differentially expressed proteins in these cells. Among these differentially expressed proteins, we confirmed four proteins (ACTG1, ANP32E, CLTC, IPO8) that are differentially expressed under the administration of amisulpride. Our data reveal novel insights into the role of amisulpride in modulating the differential expression of genes and proteins. These findings, which involve genes/proteins related to AP-1 transcription factor family gene regulation, cytoskeleton, histone binding activity, the intracellular trafficking of receptors and endocytosis of a variety of macromolecules, and nuclear localization signal, are particularly significant as they shed light on the molecular underpinnings of the clinical efficacy of amisulpride and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.",

The effects of stress on basic measurements of cellular and humoral immune measures are discussed, including the growing number of studies that have reported alterations in macrophage functions. The latter are key elements in the innate immune response, and like measurements of T cell function and antibody production, are inhibited and enhanced by stressor exposure. This review does not focus on the mechanisms by which stress alters immune function, there being little to add conceptually in terms of what was reported previously (see Kusnecov AW, Rabin BS, Int Arch Allergy Immunol 1994; 105 :107–121.). However, a question is raised in the conclusion as to how stressor effects on immune function should be interpreted, for it is clear that immunological processes in and of themselves elicit central nervous system responses that neurochemically and endocrinologically do not differ from those produced in response to psychological stressors. Therefore, at least in the short term stressor-induced immune changes may not necessarily reflect maladaptive adjustments, although, as demonstrated by some studies reviewed in this paper, they may pose a serious risk to health should stressor exposure be persistent and uncontrolled.",

An approach similar to that in neuropsychology, where cases are grouped based on a discrete deficit, or in this case a discrete symptom, rather than a cause or diagnosis, may be useful in exploring the neural correlates of psychotic symptomatology. Functional neuroimaging provides an excellent tool for investigating the in vivo cortical function of patients with schizophrenia. Auditory verbal hallucinations are one of the most commonly occurring psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia; and this paper examines the progress that has been made in utilizing neuroimaging techniques to investigate auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia and review potential implications for treatment and future directions for research.",

For the description of a behavioural phenotype, the complete spectrum of physical, developmental, neuropsychological and psychiatric aspects is generally not taken into account. Moreover, psychiatric signs and symptoms often do not meet the criteria for a categorical diagnosis.In this study, a further specification of psychotic symptoms in PWS and VCFS is shown as well as a proposal for a new model to ascertain predictors, including behavioural, for a genetic syndrome.Over the past years, 27 patients with PWS and 19 with VCFS were referred for neuropsychiatric evaluation because of psychotic symptoms. In all the patients, a standardised psychiatric examination was performed; seven of the patients with VCFS were evaluated by means of an extensive neuropsychological battery.In both patient groups, a rather specific psychopathological profile seemed to be present, which in the case of patients with PWS showed some resemblance with bipolar affective disorder. In patients with VCFS, no formal psychiatric diagnosis could be established. Because the psychopathological profiles were rather aspecific, they are not sufficient to predict membership of a certain syndrome.A quantitative probabilistic approach toward the description of a (behavioural) phenotype is suggested. For such a procedure, large data sets and international collaboration are required.",

There were few published reports of Hcy levels and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T genotype in geriatric depression. Objective: To investigate the relationship among plasma Hcy level, MTHFR C677T polymorphism and geriatric depression in the Chinese population. Methods: The plasma Hcy level measured by capillary electrophoresis with ultraviolet detection and the C667T polymorphism of MTHFR detected using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay were determined in 116 patients with geriatric depression and in 80 healthy controls. Results: The plasma Hcy level in the patients with geriatric depression was significantly higher than that in controls ( p &lt; 0.001). The age of first episode and comorbid CVD were significantly correlated with plasma Hcy levels in geriatric patients ( p = 0.014 and 0.008, respectively). The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score and plasma Hcy level at baseline showed no significant correlation in the patients ( r = −0.111, p = 0.397). There were no significant differences in the MTHFR C677T polymorphism genotypes and alleles between the patients and the healthy controls ( p = 0.654 and 0.573, respectively). Conclusion: The elevated plasma Hcy level is a risk factor for geriatric depression. MTHFR C667T genotype is not associated with geriatric depression in the Chinese population.",

The psychopathy scores were evaluated by means of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised translated into Turkish (PCL-R). PCL-R is a 20-item, reliable and valid instrument for assessment of psychopathy, both in categorical and dimensional natures. All patients had a total score of 29 (of possible 40) or higher from PCL-R, indicating a high degree of psychopathy.Our results showed no significant differences in ratio of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr) and choline-related compounds in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala-hippocampus regions of cases compared with controls. ACC NAA/Cr was significantly negatively correlated with both the PCL-R total score and the PCL-R factor I score (interpersonal/affective problems) among the cases.As ACC plays an important role in decision-making and emotional information processing, we postulate that the lower NAA/Cr ratio, suggesting impaired neural integrity, may increase the severity of interpersonal/affective problems of the psychopathy factor in male subjects exhibiting APD, high psychopathy overall scores and violent crimes.",

Neuropsychological assessment revealed left hemineglect with SPL, and profile suggested bilateral frontal, right parietotemporal and basal ganglia involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging brain scan showed gliotic cavity secondary to the old haematoma in right putamen with white matter changes in the right frontoparietotemporal lobes.The conceptual framework of body schema can be used to classify many of the neurological disorders of body representation. Generation of SPL comes under the subtype of pathology of updating among the disorders of body schema. The continuous updating allows the body schema to modulate perceptual processing of objects according to their position in space. Brain areas classified as parts of motor system can, under pathological conditions (haemorrhage), influence body perception. So, when she used to move her arm, the representation of the estimated position was not updated by the motor commands. Sensory and motor information therefore becomes discrepant, and failure to integrate these two sources of information leads to loss of normal coherence, and the perceived shape of the body was altered by adding a SPL to accommodate the discrepancy.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Impairment in emotion perception represents a fundamental feature of schizophrenia with important consequences in social functioning. A fundamental unresolved issue is the relationship between emotion perception and face perception. The aim of the present study was to examine whether facial identity recognition (Identity Discrimination) is a factor predicting facial emotion recognition in the context of the other factors, known as contributing to emotion perception, such as cognitive functions and symptoms. Methods: We enrolled 58 stable schizophrenic out-patients and 47 healthy subjects. Facial identity recognition and emotion perception were assessed with the Comprehensive Affect Testing System. Different multiple regression models with backward elimination were performed in order to discover the relation of each significant variable with emotion perception. Results: In a regression including the six significant variables (age, positive symptomatology, Identity Discrimination, attentive functions, verbal memory-learning, executive functions) versus emotion processing, only attentive functions (standardised β = 0.264, p = 0.038) and Identity Discrimination (standardised β = 0.279, p = 0.029) reached a significant level. Two partial regressions were performed including five variables, one excluding attentive functions and the other excluding Identity Discrimination. When we excluded attentive functions, the only significant variable was Identity Discrimination (standardised β = 0.278, p = 0.032). When we excluded Identity Discrimination, both verbal memory-learning (standardised β = 0.261, p = 0.042) and executive functions (standardised β = 0.253, p = 0.048) were significant. Conclusions: Our results emphasised the role of face perception and attentional abilities on affect perception in schizophrenia. We additionally found a role of verbal memory-learning and executive functions on emotion perception. The relationship between those above-mentioned variables and emotion processing could have implications for cognitive rehabilitation.",

Effect of chronic administration of ketamine on the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity caused by chronic mild stress.Recently, we reported that mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV were inhibited in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of rats submitted to chronic mild stress (CMS) and that acute ketamine administration reversed this effect. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of these enzymes may be reversed by chronic administration of ketamine.Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to CMS and chronically treated with ketamine. After 40 days of CMS, consumption of sweet food, adrenal gland weight, body weight and enzymatic activity of the complexes were measured.We verified that CMS decreased the intake of sweet food, increased the adrenal gland weight and the control group gained weight after 40 days but the stressed group did not; ketamine administration reversed these effects. We also verified that chronic administration of ketamine reversed the inhibition of complexes I, III and IV in cerebral cortex. However, in cerebellum, only complex IV inhibition was reversed. The chronic ketamine administration partially reverses the inhibition caused by CMS.We hypothesise that CMS inhibits complexes I, III and IV activities and that chronic administration of ketamine administration partially reverses such an effect. Therefore, it seems reasonable to propose that ketamine administration might be a useful therapy for patients affected by major depression.",

SOX11 is a transcription factor known to play a critical role in the regulation of the neuronal and glial differentiation stage of neurogenesis, so we hypothesised that the identification of its target genes would reveal underlying biological processes relevant to disease. Methods: SOX11 protein was over-expressed in HEK293 cells and transcriptional changes assessed by microarray analysis. Selected candidate genes were further tested for SOX11 activation in quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR studies of HEK293 cells and Western analysis of SH-SY5Y cells. Results: Regulated genes included a previously established SOX11 target, known markers of neurogenesis, as well as several genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Immunofluorescence localised several of the genes within the proliferative subgranular zone of the hippocampus. We observed multiple histone and zinc finger genes regulated by SOX11, many of which were located in two clusters on chromosomes 6 and 19. The chromosome 6 cluster lies within a region of the genome showing the strongest genetic association with schizophrenia. Conclusion: SOX11 appears to regulate a complex programme of chromatin remodelling and downstream gene expression changes to achieve a mature neuronal phenotype. SOX11 target genes are shown to be involved in neurodevelopmental processes important in health and, potentially, disease.",

For the analysis of data conditional univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used.With PD were associated, independently from each other, current smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.82], alcohol consumption (OR = 4.78; 95% CI = 2.67-8.55) and coffee consumption (OR = 2.54; 95% CI = 1.36-4.75). In ever smokers the risk for PD significantly decreased with the increasing number of cigarettes smoked and with increasing duration of smoking. The risk for PD significantly increased with the increasing quantity of alcohol consumption. PD risk was significantly higher in subjects whose average daily consumption of coffee was 1 and 2-3 cups, and it was lower (but not significantly) in those whose daily coffee consumption was 4+ cups. Cases and controls did not differ in duration of alcohol and coffee consumption. The results of multivariate analyses did not substantially change after adjustment on family history positive on PD.The findings of this study support the hypotheses of inverse association of smoking with PD, but an inverse association with coffee was not confirmed.

From a neurobiological point of view early stress influences neuroanatomical structures and is associated with a dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The objective of this article is to review the epigenetic alterations implicated in brain adaptation to early stress events. Method: A review of empirical research of epigenetic alterations associated to early stress events was performed. Results: Neuroanatomic and epigenetic alterations have been observed after early stress events. Epigenetics alterations include DNA methylation, histones modifications and microRNA (miRNA) expression. The most studied is largely the former, affecting genes involved in neuroendocrine, neurotransmission and neuroplasticity regulation after early stress exposition. It includes glucocorticoid receptor, FK506-binding protein 5, arginine vasopressin, oestrogen receptor alpha, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine transporter and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Conclusion: Epigenetic regulation is critical in the interplay between nature and nurture. Alterations in the DNA methylation as well as histones modifications and miRNA expression patterns could explain abnormal behaviours secondary to early stress events.",

The samples were homogenised and the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, some enzymes of Krebs cycle (citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase) and creatine kinase were measured.We verified that chronic administration of escitalopram decreased the activities of complexes I and II-III in cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum and posterior cortex whereas prefrontal cortex was not affected. Complex II activity was decreased only in striatum without affecting prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and posterior cortex. However, chronic administration of escitalopram did not affect complex IV and enzymes of Krebs cycle activities as well as creatine kinase.In this study we showed a decrease in the activities of complexes I and II-III in most of the brain structures analysed and complex II activity was decreased only in striatum.

    "abstract": "Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of a new apathy rating scale in predicting the ability to return to work (RTW) in patients with depression or anxiety a year after discharge from a psychiatric hospital. Methods We evaluated 56 patients with depression or anxiety, who participated in an on-going randomised clinical trial using RTW as primary outcome. The degree of apathy was measured by the Diagnostic Apathia Scale, which contains six items covering the following neuropsychological symptoms: concentration/memory problems, difficulties in decision making, lassitude, tiredness/fatigue, insomnia, and reduced ability to work and engage in personal interests. The scale was analysed for psychometric validity (scalability) and for its ability to predict RTW. Finally, the predictive validity of the Diagnostic Apathia Scale regarding RTW was compared with scales measuring severity of depression/anxiety symptoms, disability, and psychological well-being. Results The Diagnostic Apathia Scale displayed sufficient scalability, that is, the total score was a psychometrically valid measure of apathy. Only the Diagnostic Apathia Scale, and not the scales measuring severity of symptoms, disability, or psychological well-being, had predictive validity regarding RTW. Thus, 76% with ‘clinically significant apathy’ at baseline were unable to RTW versus 50% of the patients without apathy ( p &lt;0.05). Conclusion The Diagnostic Apathia Scale was found to have an acceptable predictive validity in terms of patients’ ability to RTW 1 year after discharge from hospitalisation for depression or anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Bharadwaj B, Sugaparaneetharan A, Rajkumar RP. Graves' disease presenting with catatonia: a probable case of encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. Introduction: Encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (EAATD) is diagnosed when neuropsychiatric symptoms of acute or sub-acute onset occur along with clinical or subclinical autoimmune thyroid dysfunction. Supporting evidence includes the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. The thyroid hormone alteration is not sufficient to explain the neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most commonly described electroencephalographic abnormality in this condition is a generalised background slowing. Clinical descriptions of EAATD have focused mainly on neurological symptoms including seizures, loss of consciousness, myoclonus and cognitive symptoms. Case: We present the case of a 48-year-old lady who presented with catatonia. Her clinical and laboratory features were suggestive of Graves' disease which was hitherto undiagnosed. Anti-thyroid antibodies were positive. Electroencephalogram showed a brief period of temporal delta activity. The findings are suggestive of EAATD. Differential diagnoses of metabolic derangements like electrolyte imbalance, hepatic and renal failure, neuroinfections and psychiatric conditions like acute psychosis were ruled out. Discussion: Treatment involves a course of corticosteroids. Response to corticosteroids, however, is not essential for the diagnosis of EAATD as the patient may respond to symptomatic treatment alone as in our case. Outcomes reported in case series have been generally good as in our patient. Conclusion: This report illustrates the need to keep a high index of suspicion for an organic aetiology in cases presenting with catatonia. A thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation is useful in such cases. In patients with severe neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with thyroid disease, an autoimmune thyroid disease should be considered as a possibility.",

Among patients with recurrent PD, delusions tend to be very similar or identical over several separate episodes during the course of illness, but case-reports illustrating this clinical phenomenon in detail are lacking from the literature. METHODS: Case report describing the 45-year-old Ms. J, who has experienced multiple episodes of PD. The report is based on a review of her medical file. RESULTS: The delusional theme of Ms. J's initial episode of PD reappeared at several subsequent episodes. During the majority of admissions, Ms. J was treated with electroconvulsive therapy, which resulted in significant improvement in the depressive, psychotic and catatonic features. CONCLUSION: Ms. J's case illustrates that PD can be a stable phenotype over many episodes and that it is important to recognize psychotic symptoms in order to prescribe the best possible treatment.",

In rodents, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in both higher order cognition and emotion. Our objective was to determine if bilateral focal ischaemic lesions restricted to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) could be used to model post-stroke anxiety and/or cognitive deficits. METHODS: Groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=9) received bilateral injections of either endothelin-1 (ET-1) (400 pmol) or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) into the mPFC and were tested at various times using both a test of temporal order memory and in an elevated plus maze. Lesions were verified histologically. RESULTS: ET-1 lesioned rats had reduced mobility on post-surgery day 8 that had resolved by day 29 at which time they spent significantly more time in the closed arm of the plus maze CONCLUSION: We conclude that ischaemic lesions localised to the mPFC can be used to model post-stroke anxiety in rats.",

We also investigate potential expectancy bias from the well-known side-effect profile of the active reference that could have affected the study outcome. Methods: Pre-specified sensitivity analyses of the primary end point were performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases (OC). Post hoc analyses of change from baseline in PANSS total score were performed using the mixed model for repeated measures approach with treatment groups split by having typical adverse events with potential for functional unblinding, for example, somnolence , increase in weight , dizziness , dry mouth and sedation . Results: Pre-specified sensitivity analyses showed separation from placebo for brexpiprazole at week 6: LOCF, ANCOVA: −4.3 [95% CI (−8.0, −0.5), p = 0.0254]. OC, ANCOVA: −3.9 [95% CI (−7.3, −0.5), p = 0.0260]. Patients treated with brexpiprazole experiencing typical adverse events with potential for functional unblinding before or at Week 2 had a least square (LS) mean PANSS change of −29.5 (improvement), with a difference in change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS total score between brexpiprazole and placebo of −13.5 [95% CI (−23.1, −4.0), p = 0.0057], and those who did not had an LS mean change of −18.9 and a difference between brexpiprazole and placebo of −2.9 [95% CI (−7.2, 1.4), p = 0.1809]. Conclusion: Pre-specified sensitivity analyses showed separation from placebo for brexpiprazole at Week 6. A post hoc analysis suggested a potential confounding of efficacy rating towards symptom improvement in patients who experience known side effects of quetiapine XR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Growing evidence suggested that antiretroviral (ARV) drugs may promote amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation in HIV-1-infected brain and the persistence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs). It has also been shown that lipid peroxidation upregulates β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression and subsequently promotes Aβ peptide production. In the present study, we examined whether chronic exposure to the anti-HIV drugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and nevirapine induces lipid peroxidation thereby promoting BACE1 and Aβ generation and consequently impair cognitive function in mice. Methods: TDF or nevirapine was orally administered to female BALB/c mice once a day for 8 weeks. On the 7th week of treatment, spatial learning and memory were assessed using the Morris water maze test. The levels of lipid peroxidation, BACE1, amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ1-42) and Aβ deposits were measured in the hippocampal tissue upon completion of treatment. Results: Chronic administration of nevirapine induced spatial learning and memory impairment in the Morris water maze test, whereas TDF did not have an effect. TDF and nevirapine administration increased hippocampal lipid peroxidation and Aβ1-42 concentration. Nevirapine further upregulated BACE1 expression and Aβ deposits. Conclusion: Our results suggest that chronic exposure to TDF and nevirapine contributes to hippocampal lipid peroxidation and Aβ accumulation, respectively, as well as spatial learning and memory deficits in mice even in the absence of HIV infection. These findings further support a possible link between ARV drug toxicity, Aβ accumulation and the persistence of HANDs.",

Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of electronic health records to identify patients treated with C+ECT. We determined the response to C+ECT and the rate of rehospitalisation over the year following treatment with C+ECT. Results: Forty-two patients were treated with C+ECT over a 10-year period. The mean age of the patients at initiation of ECT was 46.3 (SD = 8.2) years (range 27–62 years). The mean number of ECTs given was 10.6 (SD = 5.3) (range 3–25) with the majority receiving twice weekly ECT. Seventy-six per cent of patients ( n = 32) showed a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of ≤3 (at least minimally improved) following C+ECT. The mean number of ECT treatments was 10.6 (SD = 5.3) (range 3–25) with the majority receiving twice weekly ECT. Sixty-four per cent of patients experienced no adverse events. Response to C+ECT was not associated with gender, age, duration of illness or duration of clozapine treatment. Seventy-five per cent of responders remained out of hospital over the course of 1-year follow-up, while 70% of those with no response to C+ECT were not admitted to hospital. Three patients received maintenance ECT, one of whom was rehospitalised. Conclusion: This study lends support to emerging evidence for the effectiveness of C+ECT in clozapine-resistant schizophrenia. These results are consistent with the results of a meta-analysis and the only randomised controlled trial (RCT) of this intervention. Further RCTs are required before this treatment can be confidently recommended.",

Spatial memory was evaluated using Morris water maze (MWM). In addition, the hippocampal concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), thiol, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured using biochemical methods. Results: According to the findings, cisplatin significantly increased the escape latency, while decreasing the time spent and travelled pathway in the target quadrant on the final trial day compared to the control group. Furthermore, pre-treatment with vitamin E significantly reversed all the results in the spatial memory test. The biochemical data indicated that vitamin E could decrease MDA activity and increase thiol and SOD activity compared to the control group. Conclusion: According to the results, vitamin E could improve cisplatin-induced memory impairment possibly through affecting the hippocampal oxidative status.",

The intensity of anxiety was assessed applying the Polish version of 'State-Trait Anxiety Inventory' (STAI); styles of coping with stress were explored employing the Polish version of 'Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations' (CISS) and the author's own questionnaire. Data were analysed using the mean, standard deviation, difference testing (the Mann-Whitney U test), correlation-regression procedure (Kendall's tau, τ correlation coefficient and forward stepwise multiple regression).Officers in the SG faced verbal and physical aggression; nevertheless, scores of officers in both the groups were within the interval of mean scores for all the studied STAI and CISS variables. Officers in the SG achieved significantly higher scores on the state-anxiety scale and the Emotion-Oriented Style (EOS), and lower scores on the Task-Oriented Style (TOS) and Social Diversion (SD). The correlation-regression procedure indicated that there were relationships between anxiety and styles of coping with stress but they differed slightly between the groups.Officers in the SG feel state anxiety stronger and display a stronger preference for the EOS than officers in the RG. Officers in the RG more strongly prefer the TOS and SD. State anxiety is a variable negatively explaining the TOS in the SG, whereas anxiety as a trait is a variable explaining the EOS in both the groups. The coping styles of warders dealing with dangerous prisoners are different and may need specific psychological counselling and training programmes.",

Val66Met (also known as rs6265 or G196A), the only known functional polymorphism of the BDNF gene, has been widely studied and considered to be associated with risk of some psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. However, studies evaluating its association with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) obtained inconsistent results. The purpose of this study was to derive a more precise estimation of the association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and OCD susceptibility by a meta-analysis. Method We carried a structured literature search in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Chinese Biomedical Database up to December 2014; and retrieved all eligible case–control studies according to the including criteria.

Stratified analyses were performed by ethnicity and gender where appropriate. Results A total of eight articles with nine studies including 1632 OCD cases and 2417 controls were identified. No significant association was detected in any comparison when the whole data were pooled together or stratified by ethnicity or gender in all four genetic models ( p &gt;0.05 for each comparison). Conclusion Despite some limitations, our meta-analysis suggests that no significant association exists between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and OCD susceptibility.",

This article applies exploratory meta-analysis to address that topic. METHODS: Data on benefits of deep brain electrical stimulation come from a recent review. Stimulated brain regions included subgenual cingulate, capsular interna, nucleus accumbens, and medial forebrain bundle. Expert opinion plus random number software was used to generate hypothetical values for sham responding. RESULTS: An effect size of 1.71 (95% CI: 1.47-1.96) was obtained for deep brain stimulation versus sham treatment in patients suffering from long-term treatment-resistant depression. CONCLUSION: Preliminary findings on deep brain electrical stimulation suggest that the procedure may be 71% more effective than sham treatment. Expressing these findings as patients-needed-to-treat, deep brain electrical stimulation is required by 2.9 patients with long-term treatment-resistant depression in order for one of them to benefit.",

Objective The goal of this research was to observe whether the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 reduces serotonin-induced scratching behaviour and whether neurotoxic destruction of descending serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways mediate the antipruritic effect of WIN 55,212-2. Material and methods Scratching behaviour was induced by intradermal injection of serotonin (50 µg/50 µl/mouse) to Balb/c mice. The neurotoxins 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 50 μg/mouse) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 20 μg/mouse) are applied intrathecally to deplete serotonin and noradrenaline in the spinal cord. WIN 55,212-2 (1, 3, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently attenuated serotonin-induced scratches. Neurotoxic destruction of neither the serotonergic nor the noradrenergic systems by 5,7-DHT and 6-OHDA, respectively, had any effect on the antipruritic action of WIN 55,212-2. Conclusion Our findings indicate that cannabinoids dose-dependently reduce serotonin-induced scratching behaviour and neurotoxic destruction of descending inhibitory pathways does not mediate this antipruritic effect.",

There was no consensus regarding the area of brain lesions that might lead to a state of anger. Although some authors agreed that lesions on the right side led to angrier behaviour, others found that lesions on the left side were more relevant to anger. Likewise, there was no consensus regarding the prevalence of anger pre or post-stroke. Some authors did not even find that these two conditions were related. Conclusion Although most authors have accepted that there is a relationship between anger and stroke, studies with uniform methodology need to be conducted if this association is to be properly evaluated and understood.",

Personality traits and suicidal behaviour are partially genetically determined and personality has been described as an endophenotype of suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between personality traits with suicidal behaviour and selected serotonergic gene polymorphisms. Methods In the study we included 156 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder (BP) and 93 healthy controls. The personality dimensions were assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). We genotyped two selected polymorphisms of the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 ( TPH1 ) gene (rs1800532 218A&gt;C and rs1799913 779A&gt;C) and polymorphism in the promoter region of serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR, rs25531) related to serotoninergic neurotransmission. Multiple poisson regression, logistic regression and Kruskal–Wallis tests were applied. Results We found numerous differences between the BP patients and the control group in terms of their TCI dimensions/subdimensions. Significant differences were found between patients with, and without, suicidal attempts in fatigability and asthenia (Ha4), as well as in harm avoidance (Ha). We also found that the interactions between TCI subdimensions (the interaction of disordiness (Ns4) and spiritual acceptance (St3), disordiness (Ns4) and integrated conscience (C5), extravagance (Ns3) and resourcefulness (Sd3)) were significantly contributing for suicidal behaviour risk. We found association between all studied genetic polymorphisms and several TCI dimensions and subdimensions. Conclusion Our results confirm that personality traits are partially determined by genes. Both personality traits and the interactions between temperament and character traits, may be helpful in predicting suicidal behaviour.",

Elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines have been detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with BD. This study investigated the association between peripheral inflammatory markers and brain subregion volumes in BD patients.Euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) aged 20-45 years underwent whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging. Plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (also known as YKL-40), fractalkine (FKN), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 (sTNF-R1), interleukin-1β, and transforming growth factor-β1 were measured on the day of neuroimaging. Clinical data were obtained from medical records and interviewing patients and reliable others.We recruited 31 patients with a mean age of 29.5 years. In multivariate regression analysis, plasma level YKL-40, a chemokine, was the most common inflammatory marker among these measurements displaying significantly negative association with the volume of various brain subareas across the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Higher YKL-40 and sTNF-R1 levels were both significantly associated with lower volumes of the left anterior cingulum, left frontal lobe, right superior temporal gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus. A greater number of total lifetime mood episodes were also associated with smaller volumes of the right caudate nucleus and bilateral frontal lobes.The volume of brain regions known to be relevant to BD-I may be diminished in relation to higher plasma level of YKL-40, sTNF-R1, and more lifetime mood episodes. Macrophage and macrophage-like cells may be involved in brain volume reduction among BD-I patients.",

However, exactly which genes are responsible for brain volume variation in adolescents with substance abuse disorders are currently unknown. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether genetic variants previously implicated in psychiatric disorders are associated with variation in brain volume in adolescents with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Methods The cohort consisted of 58 adolescents with DSM-IV AUD and 58 age and gender-matched controls of mixed ancestry ethnicity. An Illumina Infinium iSelect custom 6000 bead chip was used to genotype 5348 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 378 candidate genes. Magnetic resonance images were acquired and volumes of global and regional structures were estimated using voxel-based morphometry. To determine whether any of the genetic variants were associated with brain volume, association analysis was conducted using linear regression in Plink. Results From the exploratory analysis, the GRIN2B SNP rs219927 was associated with brain volume in the left posterior cingulate cortex ( p &lt;0.05), whereby having a G-allele was associated with a bigger volume. Conclusion The GRIN2B gene is involved in glutamatergic signalling and may be associated with developmental differences in AUD in brain regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex. Such differences may play a role in risk for AUD, and deserve more detailed investigation.",

In this study, we evaluated the relation between brain atrophy and the effect of COVID-19-related fear by analysing changes in brain volume over time using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Participants were 25 Japanese patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD), who underwent 1.5-tesla MRI scan twice, once before and once after the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, and the Fear of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Scale (FCV-19S) assessment during that period. We computed regional brain atrophy per day between the 1st and 2nd scan, and evaluated the relation between the FCV-19S scores and regional shrinkage.There was significant positive correlation between the total FCV-19S score and volume reduction per day in the right posterior cingulate cortex. Regarding the subscales of FCV-19S, we found significant positive correlation between factor 2 of the FCV-19S and shrinkage of the right posterior cingulate cortex.There was positive correlation between the FCV-19S score and regional brain atrophy per day. Although it is already known that the psychological effects surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic cause cognitive function decline, our results further suggest that anxiety and fear related to COVID-19 cause regional brain atrophy.",

Results: No group-wise differences in compliance, study discontinuation, major/serious side effects or adverse events were noted. For six assessed clinical variables, the direction of changes were in the desired direction and the effect sizes were greater in the MYT group compared with the TAU group at both time points. Changes in social function variables were greater at 3 months than at 3 weeks. Nominally significant improvement in individual cognitive domains were noted in all groups at both time points. All effect sizes were in the small to medium range. Conclusion: MYT is feasible and acceptable and shows modest benefits for persons with SZ.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: A better understanding of the genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its association with neuroplasticity could play a pivotal role in finding future therapeutic targets for novel drugs in major depressive disorder (MDD). Because there are conflicting results regarding the exact role of BDNF polymorphisms in MDD still, we set out to systematically review the current evidence regarding BDNF-related mutations in MDD. Methods: We conducted a keyword-guided search of the PubMed and Embase databases, using ‘BDNF’ or ‘brain-derived neurotrophic factor’ and ‘major depressive disorder’ and ’single-nucleotide polymorphism’. We included all publications in line with our exclusion and inclusion criteria that focused on BDNF-related mutations in the context of MDD. Results: Our search yielded 427 records in total. After screening and application of our eligibility criteria, 71 studies were included in final analysis. According to present overall scientific data, there is a possibly major pathophysiological role for BDNF neurotrophic systems to play in MDD. However, on the one hand, the synthesis of evidence makes clear that likely no overall association of BDNF-related mutations with MDD exists. On the other hand, it can be appreciated that solidifying evidence emerged on specific significant sub-conditions and stratifications based on various demographic, clinico-phenotypical and neuromorphological variables. Conclusions: Further research should elucidate specific BDNF-MDD associations based on demographic, clinico-phenotypical and neuromorphological variables. Furthermore, biomarker approaches, specifically combinatory ones, involving BDNF should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Coronavirus disease, one of the most disastrous epidemics, has caused a worldwide crisis, and the containment measures applied to decelerate the progression of the pandemic can increase the risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Identifying vulnerable groups in this area can lead us to better resource expenditure, and therefore, this systematic review aims to make a comparison between males and females to determine which of the two groups was most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic regarding OCD. Also, a meta-analysis was designed to investigate the prevalence of OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comprehensive search was conducted among three databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science) until August 2021 which resulted in 197 articles, and 24 articles met our inclusion criteria. Overall, more than half of the articles stated the role of gender in OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several articles emphasized the role of the female gender, and some others the role of the male gender. The meta-analysis revealed a 41.2% overall prevalence of OCD during the COVID pandemic and 47.1% and 39.1% OCD prevalence for female and male genders respectively. However, the difference between the two genders was not statistically significant. Generally, it seems that females are at greater risk of OCD during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the following groups, the female gender may have acted as a risk factor: under-18 years students, hospital staff, and the studies in the Middle East. In none of the categories, male gender was clearly identified as a risk factor.",

In a separate batch of animals, in vivo striatal microdialysis was performed, and tryptophan, kynurenine, quinolinic acid, and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in the dialysate were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).Dual-LPS treatment decreased spontaneous locomotion, exaggerated d-amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, and impaired recognition memory in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In vivo microdialysis showed that dual-LPS treatment elicited metabolic disturbances in the kynurenine pathway with increased extracellular levels of kynurenine and KYNA in the striatum.The present study further supports the feasibility of using the dual-LPS model to investigate inflammation-related psychotic disorders and cognitive impairments.",

Previous studies suggested that adenosine A 2A receptors (A 2A Rs) could play a role in CBD-induced effects. Here, we evaluated the ability of CBD to modify the function of A 2A R. Methods: We used HEK-293T cells transfected with the cDNA encoding the human A 2A R and Gαs protein, both modified to perform bioluminescence-based assays. We first assessed the effect of CBD on A 2A R ligand binding using an A 2A R NanoLuciferase sensor. Next, we evaluated whether CBD modified A 2A R coupling to mini-Gαs proteins using the NanoBiT™ assay. Finally, we further assessed CBD effects on A 2A R intrinsic activity by recording agonist-induced cAMP accumulation. Results: CBD did not bind orthosterically to A 2A R but reduced the coupling of A 2A R to Gαs protein and the subsequent generation of cAMP. Conclusion: CBD negatively modulates A 2A R functioning.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Although disconnectivity among brain regions has been one of the main hypotheses for schizophrenia, the superficial white matter (SWM) has received less attention in schizophrenia research than the deep white matter (DWM) owing to the challenge of consistent reconstruction across subjects. Methods: We obtained the diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data of 223 healthy controls and 143 patients with schizophrenia. After harmonising the raw dMRIs from three different studies, we performed whole-brain two-tensor tractography and fibre clustering on the tractography data. We compared the fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter tracts between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. Spearman’s rho was adopted for the associations with clinical symptoms measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The Bonferroni correction was used to adjust multiple testing. Results: Among the 33 DWM and 8 SWM tracts, patients with schizophrenia had a lower FA in 14 DWM and 4 SWM tracts than healthy controls, with small effect sizes. In the patient group, the FA deviations of the corticospinal and superficial–occipital tracts were negatively correlated with the PANSS negative score; however, this correlation was not evident after adjusting for multiple testing. Conclusion: We observed the structural impairments of both the DWM and SWM tracts in patients with schizophrenia. The SWM could be a potential target of interest in future research on neural biomarkers for schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Rumination is a passive form of negative self-focused cognition that predicts depressive episodes for individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). Individuals with BD also have impaired inhibitory executive control; rumination in BD may therefore reflect executive dysfunction. We investigated the relationship between a neural measure of executive functioning (functional connectivity between the frontoparietal control network [FPCN] and the default mode network [DMN] during an effortful task), behavioural measures of executive functioning (the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) and rumination (the Ruminative Responses Scale). Methods: Fifteen individuals with BD and fifteen healthy controls underwent MRI scans during mental distraction. Using CONN toolbox, between-network FPCN-DMN connectivity values were calculated. We conducted Pearson’s r bivariate correlations between connectivity values, BRIEF and RRS scores. Results: RRS scores were positively correlated with BRIEF Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) scores. In individuals with BD, there was a positive correlation between FPCN-DMN functional connectivity during distraction and BRIEF BRI scores. FPCN-DMN functional connectivity was also positively correlated with RRS ruminative brooding scores. Healthy controls did not show significant correlations between these behavioural and neural measures of executive functioning and rumination. Conclusion: For individuals with BD, the greater the tendency to ruminate and the higher the executive dysfunction, the stronger the connectivity between an executive control network and a network involved in rumination during an unrelated cognitive task. This could reflect continual attempts to inhibit ruminative thinking and shift back to the distraction task. Therefore, engagement in rumination may reflect failed inhibitory executive control.",

We aimed to reveal the relationship between CYP1A1 rs464903 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) rs10249788 associated with the KP and interferon gamma (IFN γ) and oxidative stress in OCD. Methods: In our study, the serum and DNAs of 150 samples, including 100 OCD patients and 50 controls, were used. The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and the levels of IFN γ, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), tryptophan, and kynurenine were determined by biochemical methods. AhR rs10249788 and cytochrome P450 family CYP1A1 rs4646903, which interact directly with the KP, were analysed by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: There were no significant differences between groups in CYP1A1 rs4646903 and AhR rs10249788 while tryptophan and IFN γ were found to be higher in controls ( p &lt; 0.001, for both), and TBARS and indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase were found to be higher in OCD ( p &lt; 0.001, for both). There were significant correlations between IFN γ and TBARS and GSH-Px ( p = 0.028, p = 0.020, respectively) in the OCD group. Conclusions: For the first time studied in OCD, it has been shown that IFN γ, tryptophan, oxidative stress parameters, and gene variants of CYP1A1 rs4646903 anAhR rs10249788 are shown effective on the KP.",

The aim of this study was to compare folate and cobalamin status in patients admitted to an acute psychiatric unit to patients from primary health care, in order to reveal factors which may be important in the follow-up of patents with mental disorders. Methods: Anonymous blood samples tested for folate, cobalamin, the metabolic marker total homocysteine (tHcy), creatinine and glomerular filtration rate, as well as age and gender in patients admitted to a psychiatric acute unit (n=981) and patients from primary health care (controls) (n=32201) were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Median serum folate was 18% lower and median serum cobalamin was 11% higher in patients with mental disorders compared to controls. Folate deficiency was associated with 54% higher median tHcy levels among patients with mental disorders compared to controls. The prevalence of folate deficiency was 31% and of cobalamin deficiency 6% in patients admitted to a psychiatric acute unit in a Norwegian hospital in 2024. Conclusion: Folate, but not cobalamin deficiency, was prevalent in Norwegian patients with mental disorders. The higher tHcy levels in folate deficient patients with mental disorders indicate an impaired folate metabolism, which might be related to genetic factors, such as polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene. Ensuring a serum folate concentration above 15 nmol/L and a serum cobalamin above 250 pmol/L might improve symptoms in patients with mental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Time distortions characterise severe mental disorders, exhibiting different clinical and neurobiological manifestations. This systematic review aims to explore the existing literature encompassing experimental studies on time perception in patients with bipolar disorder (BD), considering psychopathological and cognitive correlates. Methods: Studies using an experimental paradigm to objectively measure the capacity to judge time have been searched for. Selected studies have been described based on whether i) explicit or implicit time perception was investigated, ii) the temporal intervals involved were sub-second or supra-second, and iii) a perceptual or motor timing paradigm was used. Results: Only 11 met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The available literature shows that the performance of BD patients mostly aligns with controls within sub-second timeframes (six articles), while a different pattern emerges within supra-second intervals based on the clinical phase of the disease (seven articles). Specifically, for longer temporal spans, BD patients tend to overestimate the duration during manic states and underestimate it during depressive states. Notably, no studies have directly investigated the neurobiological mechanisms associated with time perception. Conclusion: This review indicates that BD patients exhibit time perception similar to controls within sub-second intervals, but tend to overestimate time and underestimate it based on the clinical phase within supra-second intervals. Expanding the understanding of time perception in BD, particularly in relation to clinical phases and cognitive function, is of great importance. Such insights could deepen our understanding of the disorder, refine diagnostic processes, and guide the development of innovative therapeutic interventions.",

To investigate the complex neurobiological substrate underlying MBI, we evaluated its association with a composite magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measure of concomitant cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) and neurodegeneration; and the interaction effects of MBI and MRI scores on cognitive and clinical trajectory. Methods 253 dementia-free participants (mean age=71.9, follow-up period=49.89 months) from 2 memory clinics were included in this study. 37 (14.6%) participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for MBI, ascertained by repeated neuropsychiatric inventory assessments. MRI scores were computed using a validated weighted sum of white matter hyperintensities volume, presence of infarct, hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness of known Alzheimer’s disease-associated regions. Clinical and cognitive outcomes were evaluated annually using the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes (CDR-SB) and standardized global cognitive scores of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery respectively. Results Lower MRI scores, indicating greater burden of comorbid CeVD and neurodegeneration, yielded a 3.8-fold likelihood of MBI compared to 1.5-fold with larger WMH volume or lower cortical thickness individually. Interaction analyses showed that MBI participants with low MRI scores had greater increase in CDR-SB (B=0.05, SE=0.01, p &lt;0.001) over time. All models involving the composite MRI measure yielded a better fit compared to reduced models with either pathology alone. Conclusion MBI is associated with a composite MRI measure that reflects mixed pathologies of dementia and their co-evaluation may improve risk profiling and identification of memory clinic patients without dementia who are at the highest risk of experiencing clinical decline.",

Immune-related biomarkers including soluble sCD80 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (sCTLA-4) are not well studied in relation to depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue due to PE. Methods The aim is to study serum immune-inflammatory biomarkers of PE and delineate their associations with the Hamilton Depression (HAMD), Anxiety (HAMA), and Fibro-Fatigue (FF) rating Scale scores. sCD80, sCTLA-4, vitamin D, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, zinc, copper, magnesium, and calcium were measured in 90 PE compared with 60 non-PE pregnant women. Results PE women show higher depression, anxiety and FF rating scale scores as compared with control women. sCTLA-4, sCD80, and copper were significantly higher and zinc, magnesium, and calcium significantly lower in PE women than in controls. Multiple regression analysis showed that around 55.8%-58.0% of the variance in the HAMD, HAMA and FF scores was explained by the regression on biomarkers; the top 3 most important biomarkers were sCTLA-4, sCD80, and vitamin D. The sCTLA-4/sCD80 ratio was significantly and inversely associated with the HAMD/HAMA/FF scores. We found that around 70% of the variance in systolic blood pressure could be explained by sCTLA-4, vitamin D, calcium, and copper. Conclusions The findings underscore that PE and depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue symptoms due to PE are accompanied by activation of the immune-inflammatory response system. More specifically, disbalances among soluble checkpoint molecules seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension and neuropsychiatric symptoms due to PE.",

Considering the reports of motor impairments in Kabuki syndrome patients, the first hypothesis of the present study was that this motor dysfunction was a consequence of striatal dopaminergic modulation. The second hypothesis was that the peripheral immune system dysfunctions were a consequence of neuroinflammatory processes. To study these hypotheses the mutant bapa mouse was used as it is a validated experimental model of Kabuki syndrome. Methods: Exploratory behavior, anxiety-like behavior (light-dark test), repetitive/stereotyped behavior (spontaneous and induced self-grooming), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), astrocyte glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) striatal expressions were evaluated in female adult bapa and control mice. Results: Female bapa mice did not present anxiety-like behavior, but exploratory hyperactivity and stereotyped behavior both on the spontaneous and induced self-grooming tests. Striatal TH, GFAP, and Iba1 expressions were also increased in bapa mice. Conclusion: The exploratory hyperactivity and the stereotyped behavior occurred in detriment of the striatal dopaminergic system hyperactivity and a permanent neuroinflammatory process.",

Network analysis is an analytical method that provides a robust framework for evaluating the heterogeneity of depressive symptoms and identifying their potential clinical implications. Objective: To investigate sex-specific differences in the network structures of depressive symptoms in Asian patients diagnosed with depressive disorders, using data from the Research on Asian Psychotropic Prescription Patterns for Antidepressants, Phase 3, which was conducted in 2023. Methods: A network analysis of 10 depressive symptoms defined according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines was performed. The sex-specific differences in the network structures of the depressive symptoms were examined using the Network Comparison Test. Subgroup analysis of the sex-specific differences in the network structures was performed according to geographical region classifications, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South or West Asia. Results: A total of 998 men and 1,915 women with depression were analysed in this study. The analyses showed that all 10 depressive symptoms were grouped into a single cluster. Low self-confidence and loss of interest emerged as the most central nodes for men and women, respectively. In addition, a significant difference in global strength invariance was observed between the networks. In the regional subgroup analysis, only East Asian men showed two distinct clustering patterns. In addition, significant differences in global strength and network structure were observed only between East Asian men and women. Conclusion: The study highlights the sex-specific differences in depressive symptom networks across Asian countries. The results revealed that low self-confidence and loss of interest are the main symptoms of depression in Asian men and women, respectively. The network connections were more localised in men, whereas women showed a more diverse network. Among the Asian subgroups analysed, only East Asians exhibited significant differences in network structure. The considerable effects of neurovegetative symptoms in men may indicate potential neurobiological underpinnings of depression in the East Asian population.",

However, progress is hindered by a lack of a clear and consistent definition. The present systematic review aimed to establish how previous dementia research has defined the term and how existing definitions may be unified. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed , Embase , and Web of Science using only the term ‘psychosocial’ as well as terms related to dementia in the search string. Two blinded reviewers independently conducted the abstracts screening, full-text screening. Definitions used in included records were extracted and their content grouped into categories and domains. For papers presenting empirical findings, quality screening was performed using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists and findings were narratively summarised. Results: A total of n=36 records were identified that provided a definition for psychosocial wellbeing. Conceptualizations most commonly (86 %) included emotional wellbeing, social health (64%), behavioural symptoms (44%), and subjective lived wellbeing (42%). A total of n=23 records also contained empirical data, which indicated that psychosocial wellbeing may be improved by several interventions such as tailored activities and validation group therapies, among others. Discussion: The construct of ‘psychosocial wellbeing’ as currently used in dementia research predominantly incorporates emotional and subjective lived wellbeing, social health, and behavioural symptoms. This indicates an emerging consensus. To progress dementia research and care practice, it is essential that future studies use a common operationalization.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pharmacological treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) involves central stimulants and non-stimulant drugs. Because treatment preferences may vary geographically, we hypothesize that prescription data can be estimated from publicly available sources. First, we explore the relevance of internet search trends as proxies for real-life drug prescription patterns. Second, we identify geographical variations in ADHD drug trends over time. Publicly available Google Trends data for five ADHD drugs were analysed for the years 2010–2023. Temporal and spatial patterns were compared within Scandinavia, and the preference for central stimulants over non-stimulant drugs was compared across 17 countries. We find that internet search trends correlate with ADHD drug prescriptions. In the Scandinavian countries, a dominance of methylphenidate is observed, with rising internet search trends over time in Norway and Denmark. Furthermore, interest in lisdexamphetamine, relative to dextroamphetamine and atomoxetine, has increased sharply in recent years in the Scandinavian countries. The search proportion of central stimulants to non-stimulant drugs in Scandinavia ranges from 81% (Denmark) to 93% (Norway). Overall, internet search trends for ADHD drugs mirror reported prescription patterns and identify a dominance of methylphenidate, with an increasing interest in lisdexamphetamine. As such, search trends may serve as a feasible source for identifying geographical drug preferences.",

Methods: This study involved 156 Chinese adult males (78 smokers and 78 non-smokers) from September 2014 to January 2016. The severity of depressive symptoms was evaluated using the BDI scores. Spearman rank correlation analyses were used to investigate the relationship between CSF FGF19 levels and BDI scores. Additionally, moderation and simple slope analyses were applied to assess the moderating effect of smoking on the relationship between the two. Results: FGF19 levels were significantly associated with BDI scores across all participants ( r = 0.26, p &lt; 0.001). Smokers had higher CSF FGF19 levels and BDI scores compared to non-smokers (445.9 ± 272.7 pg/ml vs 229.6 ± 162.7 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.001; 2.7 ± 3.0 vs 1.3 ± 2.4, p &lt; 0.001). CSF FGF19 levels were positively associated with BDI scores in non-smokers ( r = 0.27, p = 0.015), but no similar association was found among smokers ( r = -0.11, p = 0.32).

The comorbidity of AITD and MDD has been widely demonstrated by large amounts of epidemiological studies. However, the genetic architectures of the comorbidity remain unknown. Methods: We use large-scale GWAS summary data and novel genetic statistical methods to assess the genetic correlation and potential causality between AITD and MDD disorders. We perform cross-trait GWAS meta-analyses to identify genetic risk variants not previously associated with the individual traits. And we use summary data-based mendelian randomization to identify putative functional genes shared between diseases. Results: Both global and local genetic correlation study confirmed the genetic correlation of AITD and MDD. Through multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG), we identified 112 SNPs associated with the conjoint phenotype, but not with individual traits. Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship between MDD (exposure) and AITD (outcome). The summary-based mendelian randomization study found two plausible functional genes for AITD and MDD comorbidity. Conclusions: AITD and MDD are genetically correlated in global and local chromosomal regions. MR analyses support a putative casual effect of MDD on AITD risk, though residual pleiotropy or confounding cannot be fully excluded. These findings highlight the need for triangulation with experimental and longitudinal studies to confirm causality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent among adults and is frequently accompanied by depressive symptoms. While high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been proposed as a potential indicator of depression, existing evidence remains inconclusive. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether increased serum hsCRP or other immune-metabolic biomarkers are associated with depressive symptoms in drug-naïve individuals with obesity and MetS. Methods: A total of 88 drug-naïve patients with obesity and MetS but without coronary-artery disease were enrolled and serum levels of neuro-immune and metabolic biomarkers were assessed. Results: In MetS, the severity of depression, as assessed using the von Zerssen Depression Rating (VZDR) scale was significantly associated with interleukin (IL)-6, leukocyte numbers, triglyceride x glucose (Tyg) index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, Apolipoprotein B (all positively) and mean platelet volume (MPV), visfatin and adiponectin (all negatively). There were no significant associations between hsCRP and severity of depression. In MetS patients, hsCRP is strongly associated with increased leukocyte numbers, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase, uric acid, platelet numbers and MPV, thereby shaping a distinct subtype of MetS, which is not related to depression. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that depressive symptoms in MetS patients are associated with immune–metabolic biomarkers indicating immune activation, atherogenicity and insulin resistance, but not with hsCRP. The reason is that hsCRP in MetS is a biomarker of a specific MetS subtype that is characterized by megakaryopoiesis, hepatocyte activation, and uric acid production, which were not associated with depression.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes in healthcare utilization and self-inflicted injuries at one Swedish Hospital where PIBA was implemented in late 2017. Methods: Patients who signed a PIBA-contract between 2017 and 2023 were included in the study. Data on inpatient care, contacts with the psychiatric emergency department and self-inflicted injuries that resulted in contact with medical care were collected from patients’ medical records. Effects of PIBA were assessed using paired t-tests, comparing pre-post changes 0.5, 1 and 2 years, from initiation of PIBA-contract, respectively. Results: Data from a total of 38 patients were analyzed. There was a marked decrease in inpatient care from voluntary admissions in the first six months after initiation of PIBA. There was also a significant decrease in number of contacts with the psychiatric emergency department (for all patients) in the 1-year pre-post comparison, but not for the 0.5- and 2-year pre-post comparisons. There were no significant reductions in compulsory inpatient care or self-inflicted injuries in our cohort. Patients with contracts extending over several years appeared stable, on average, in their use of care and prevalence of intoxications. Conclusion: The main effect on inpatient care after initiation of PIBA was a reduction in voluntary admissions, coinciding with a shift from voluntary admissions in favor of PIBA. The results support a more widespread utilization of PIBA from a health-economic perspective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: There are differences in IgA responses to tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) in major neurocognitive psychosis (MNP) versus simple neurocognitive psychosis (SNP) and normal controls. MNP and SNP are distinct schizophrenia classes which are differentiated by neurocognitive deficits, phenome features, and biomarker pathways. Nevertheless, there is no data on serum concentrations of those TRYCATs in MNP and SNP. The aim of the present study is to examine serum concentrations of tryptophan and TRYCATs in MNP versus SNP and controls. Methods: This case-control study examines serum levels of tryptophan and TRYCATs in 52 MNP patients, 68 SNP patients and 60 controls in association with overall severity of schizophrenia (OSOS). Results: MNP patients show lower tryptophan, kynurenic acid (KA), 3-OH-anthranilic acid (3HAA), and higher anthranilic acid (AA) and quinolinic acid (QA) than SNP patients and controls. There were no differences between SNP and controls in these TRYCATs. Kynurenine (KYN) was lower in MNP+SNP than in controls. We found that 36.5% of the variance in OSOS was explained by the combined effects of lowered tryptophan, KA, and 3-HK, and increased QA and AA. The most important biomarkers of MNP and OSOS were the QA/KA ratio followed by the QA/3HAA ratio. Conclusions: The alterations in serum TRYCAT levels further emphasize that MNP and SNP represent two biologically distinct subtypes of schizophrenia. The reductions in TRYCATs diminish the antioxidant and immunoregulatory functions of the TRYCAT pathway. Elevated QA levels may exacerbate the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the immune-related and oxidative neurotoxicity in MNP.",

Herein, we conducted a comprehensive synthesis of the effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs on OUDs. Methods: We examined preclinical and clinical paradigms examining the effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs on OUD and OUD-associated behaviours (i.e. opioid self-administration, opioid-seeking behaviour). Relevant articles were retrieved from OVID (MedLine, Embase, AMED, PsychINFO, and JBI EBP Database), PubMed, and Web of Science from database inception to 1 May 2025. Primary studies ( n = 10) examining the aforementioned effects associated with GLP-1 and GLP-1 RA administration were retrieved for analysis. Results: GLP-1 RAs (i.e. exenatide, liraglutide) reduced opioid-seeking behaviour ( p &lt; 0.05) and self-administration of opioid drugs ( p &lt; 0.05) in preclinical paradigms. In addition, results from human studies indicate that GLP-1 administration was associated with reducing the risk of opioid overdose in human studies (aIRR = 0.60, 95% CI [0.43, 0.83]). Conclusion: GLP-1 RAs may affect opioid self-administration as well as the risk for overdose as evidenced by both preclinical and clinical data. There is a need for adequate well-controlled studies to determine whether GLP-1 RAs may provide clinically meaningful improvement and risk reduction in persons living with OUDs.",

Capgras syndrome is thought to be a rare syndrome which commonly occurs in a psychotic context. Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the 5-year prevalence rate of CS in a university hospital in-patient setting and determine associated etiological and sociodemographic factors. Methods: All patient files and medical records were reviewed in detail for the presence of Capgras syndrome. The sociodemographic variables, clinical manifestations, and psychiatric and medical diagnoses of patients who fulfilled clinical criteria for Capgras syndrome were recorded for statistical evaluation. Results: The retrospective evaluation of patient files in 920 cases admitted to our psychiatric in-patient unit over 5 years revealed that 12 patients fulfilled the criteria for Capgras syndrome. The crude prevalence of Capgras syndrome in this population during 5-year period was 1.3% (1.8% for females, 0.9% for males). Schizophrenia (50%) was the most common psychiatric diagnosis in these patients. Only two patients presented with an organic etiology underlying Capgras syndrome. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that Capgras syndrome is not a rare syndrome, and commonly occurs during the course of either functional or organic psychotic illness. Age seems to be an important predicting factor for the etiology of psychosis underlying Capgras syndrome.",

Method : Two randomized, blind, maintenance clinical trials in children and adolescents with bipolar disorders are ongoing at the University Hospitals of Cleveland/Case Western Reserve University Stanley Clinical Research Center for bipolar disorder. The first is comparing the safety and effectiveness of lithium carbonate (Li+) to divalproex sodium (VPA) for up to 76 weeks in youths with stabilized bipolar illness (type 1 or 2). The second study is designed to compare the efficacy of VPA to placebo in the acute management of subsyndromal symptoms of bipolar disorder (‘cyclotaxia’) and the prevention of the full syndrome in children at risk. Both studies use the prospective life-chart method as an outcome measure. Results: Sixty-six youths have received study medication as part of the trial that is comparing Li+ to VPA as a maintenance therapy. In addition, 32 youths have received blinded treatment as part of the ‘cyclotaxia’ prevention study. Combination Li+A/PA treatment appears generally well tolerated and seems to have robust anti-manic and antidepressant effects. Discussion: Since the blind has not been broken on either of these clinical trials, conclusions about the maintenance effectiveness of either VPA or Li+ in youths with bipolar disorder type 1 or 2 cannot be made yet. Similarly, it is unclear whether VPA is superior to placebo in genetically high-risk youths with cyclotaxia. The final results of these trials should provide valuable information about the treatment of juvenile bipolar disorders.",

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of indicators of sleep disturbance, such as quality of sleep, sleep duration, feeling of restfulness in the morning and drug utilization in a randomly selected Polish adult population. Methods: A stratified scheme of sampling involving two steps was used. A representative Polish population sample of 47 924 non-institutionalized adults was interviewed. Assessments of sleep-related problems were based on six questions. Standardized prevalence ratios (SPRs and their 95% confidence intervals) were calculated. Results: Almost one-tenth of Polish inhabitants usually slept badly or very badly, a problem that was more common among women than men. Quality of sleep decreased together with ageing and this process was more rapid in women than in men over 40 years of age. Highly educated respondents had the highest quality of sleep. Up to one-fifth of the general Polish population usually woke up tired in the morning. Mean sleep duration was 7.7 h, with no gender differences. Usage of over-the-counter (OTC) medications was significantly lower than usage of those prescribed by the physician (5 vs. 16%). Women used OTC drugs twice as often as men. Conclusions: It would appear to be necessary to introduce educational programmes for the community as well as for general practitioners in order to correct improper attitudes.",

The greatest increases are seen with clozapine and olanzapine: risperidone has a slight effect, comparable with that of conventional neuroleptics, while ziprasidone and aripiprazole appear from current data to have little effect. In addition, atypical antipsychotics have been associated with metabolic disturbances, particularly glucose dysregulation and dyslipidemia. These effects tend to be more marked with olanzapine and clozapine than with other agents. Weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotics imposes substantial morbidity, in addition to that associated with schizophrenia itself. Furthermore, weight gain can significantly impair patients' quality of life, and leads to non-adherence with treatment. Effective weight management should include the selection of an appropriate atypical antipsychotic and for effective weight management, as well both diet and exercise, formal weight management programs tailored to the needs of schizophrenic patients may be useful, and some patients may benefit from weight-reducing drugs.Weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotics is a common problem that requires effective management. The selection of an agent with a low risk of weight gain, such as risperidone or ziprasidone, is central to such management.",

Clinical services are generally guided by a stage model of change, in which the client's motivation to change (or stage of treatment: engagement, persuasion, active treatment, relapse prevention) informs the optimal selection of appropriate interventions. Psychotherapeutic services for co-occurring disorders include a range of individual (motivational interviewing, cognitive-behavioral counseling), group (stage-wise groups, social skills training, self-help), and family (single family, multifamily formats) interventions. Supplementary interventions are also commonly provided, including psychopharmacological, residential, coerced and involuntary, and vocational rehabilitation. Access to a range of different interventions for co-occurring disorders may improve the ability of clinicians to engage and tailor treatment to meet clients' unique needs. The research base supporting integrated treatment for co-occurring disorders is limited at this time owing to the small number of methodologically rigorous studies from which to draw conclusions. Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that integrated treatment programs improve outcomes compared with nonintegrated approaches, and that more research is needed to evaluate the benefits of these programs.",

    "abstract": "Trends in prevalence in substance misuse in young people in the UK are described: increased use over the last decade, the tendency to polydrug use, the narrowing of the gender gap. The complex issues relating to the description, definition and classification, and diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidity and substance misuse are outlined. The fact that there is no uniformly accepted definition of what constitutes ‘dual diagnosis’ or ‘psychiatric comorbidity’ in young people is highlighted: this variability impacts upon clinical assessment and study design. Despite these considerable drawbacks, a degree of consistency is beginning to emerge in the co-occurrence of some conditions, e.g. disruptive and suicidal behaviours. It is recognized that psychological distress and substance misuse are also associated with multiple social and physical complications. The rapid advances in treatment options are presented. At present the ‘best practice’ is implementation of what works for adults with addiction and young people with psychiatric disorder. This includes psychosocial interventions such as motivational enhancement techniques and cognitive behavioural treatment, as well as appropriate safe (usually), short-term use of a range of pharmacological agents. Very few comprehensive designated adolescent addiction services exist, while child and adolescent mental health services are under serious pressure. Thus the need for a longitudinal and multidisciplinary approach, with appropriate assessment instruments in young people, is required to further explore diagnostic classification which will classify the degrees and patterns of relationships between disorders. In this way it may be possible to build up a picture of the nature and extent of numerous complex, and sometimes overlapping, problems and needs in children and adolescents in a variety of settings: primary and secondary care, the criminal justice system and educational establishments. This might strengthen the development of innovative treatment services where novel interventions are tested as a priority.",

When it presents with only psychiatric symptoms, or with extrapyramidal symptoms secondary to neuroleptic exposure, the diagnosis of underlying Wilson's disease may be missed. Methods: An 18-year-old boy presented to the psychiatric clinic with a manic syndrome and high propensity for extrapyramidal symptoms to neuroleptic. Initial examination revealed splenomegaly and pancytopenia. Subsequent detection of Kayser–Fleischer ring and typical biochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Results: While the psychiatric symptoms came under control with lithium carbonate, extrapyramidal symptoms continue to persist even after neuroleptic withdrawal. Pancytopenia thought to be due to hypersplenism persists, and patient has developed features of liver cirrhosis. Treatment with zinc and folic acid has been started, and the patient is under evaluation for treatment with penicillamine. Conclusion: The psychiatrist needs to recognize that Wilson's disease can uncommonly present with isolated psychiatric symptoms, including mania. Early and severe extrapyramidal symptoms secondary to neuroleptic exposure in an adolescent age group warrants a detailed evaluation to rule out underlying neuropsychiatric conditions.",

    "abstract": "Background: Since bipolar affective disorder has been recorded, clinicians treating patients with this disorder have noted the cyclic nature of episodes, particularly an increase in mania in the spring and summer months and depression during winter. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate seasonality in symptom onset and service admissions over a period of 10 years in a group of patients ( n = 359) with first-episode (FE) mania ( n = 133), FE schizoaffective disorder ( n = 49) and FE schizophrenia ( n = 177). Method: Patients were recruited if they were between 15 and 28 years of age and if they resided in the geographical mental health service catchment area. The number of patients experiencing symptom onset and service admission over each month and season was recorded. Results: In terms of seasonality of time of service admission, the results indicate a high overall seasonality (particularly in men), which was observed in both the schizoaffective and the bipolar groups. In terms of seasonality of symptom onset, the results indicate that seasonality remains in the male bipolar group, but other groups have no seasonal trend. Conclusions: This provides further evidence that systems mediating the entrainment of biological rhythms to the environment may be more pronounced in BPAD than in schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia. These results may help facilitate the preparedness of mental heath services for patients at different times of the year.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia has been associated with limited abilities to interact effectively in social situations. Face perception and ability to recognise familiar faces are critical for social interaction. Patients with chronic schizophrenia are known to show impaired face recognition. Studying first-episode (FE) patients allows the exclusion of confounding effects of chronicity, medication and institutionalisation in this deficit.To determine brain (dys)functions during a face encoding and recognition paradigm in FE schizophrenia.Thirteen antipsychotic-naïve FE schizophrenia patients and 13 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a face encoding and recognition paradigm. Behavioural responses were recorded on line.Patients recognised significantly fewer of previously presented faces than the controls (p = 0.008). At the neural level, both groups activated a network of regions including the fusiform area, occipital, temporal and frontal regions. In brain activity, the two groups did not differ in any region during encoding or recognition conditions (p > 0.05, corrected or uncorrected).Our findings show impaired face recognition without a significant alteration of related brain activity in FE schizophrenia patients. It is possible that neural changes become more strongly evident with progression of the illness, and manifest themselves as behavioural impairments during the early course.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is presumed to be higher among people with schizophrenia who take antipsychotic medication, most of which blocks the dopamine D2 receptor. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the G-protein β3 subunit (GNB3) C825T polymorphism is associated with antipsychotic-induced RLS in schizophrenia.We examined 178 Korean patients with schizophrenia. All of the subjects were evaluated using the diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group and the International Restless Legs Scale. Genotyping was performed for the C825T polymorphism in the GNB3 gene.The genotype distribution did not differ significantly between antipsychotic-induced RLS patients and patients who had no-RLS symptoms (χ 2 = 4.30, p = 0.116). The genotypes of the C825T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were classified into two groups: C+ (CC and CT genotypes) and C- (TT genotype). The presence of the C allele (C+) was associated with an increased likelihood of RLS (χ 2 = 4.14, p = 0.042; odds ratio = 2.56, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-6.47).These results suggest that the GNB3 C825T SNP is associated with RLS in schizophrenia. However, confirming this association requires future larger scale studies in which the effects of medication are strictly controlled.",

Environmental factors contribute to the onset of the disorder in individuals at increased genetic risk. Cognitive deficits have emerged as endophenotypes and potential therapeutic targets for schizophrenia because of their association with functional outcome. The aims of this review were to analyse the joint effect of genetic and environmental (G×E) factors on liability to schizophrenia and to investigate relationships between genes and cognitive endophenotypes focusing on practical applications for prevention and rehabilitation. Methods: Medline search of relevant studies published between 1990 and 2008. Results: In schizophrenia, examples of G×E interaction include the catechol- O -methyl transferase (COMT) (Val158Met) polymorphism, which was found to moderate the onset of psychotic manifestations in response to stress and to increase the risk for psychosis related to cannabis use, and neurodevelopmental genes such as AKT1 (serine-threonine kinase), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), DTNBP1 (dysbindin) and GRM3 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 3), which were associated with development of schizophrenia in adulthood after exposure to perinatal obstetric complications. Neurocognitive deficits are recognised as core features of schizophrenia that facilitate the onset of the disorder and have a great impact on functional outcome. Neurocognitive deficits are also endophenotypes that have been linked to a variety of genes [ COMT , neuregulin (NRG1), BDNF , Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia 1 ( DISC1 ) and dysbindin] conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia. Recently, it has emerged that cognitive improvement during rehabilitation therapy was under control of COMT (Val158Met) polymorphism. Conclusion: This review could indicate a pivotal role of psychiatric genetics in prevention and rehabilitation of schizophrenic psychoses.",

Information regarding medical history, health practices, life stressors, and coping strategies was obtained two weeks prior to admission. At this initial meeting, as well as three days after surgery, and at one month follow-up immunological tests were performed and the level of psychological distress was assessed. The study additionally included measures of post-operative complications, and infections and negative effect during follow-up.Pre-operative immune status emerged as a key variable exerting strong effects on subsequent immune function and, thereby producing significant, indirect effects on every recovery variable. Pre-operative distress was directly linked to increased mood disturbance at follow-up. Moreover, distress significantly influenced immune function both before and after surgery, which mediated a significant impact on most recovery variables. Active coping behaviour directly increased the risk of a complicated recovery.The study demonstrated that distress-induced changes in immune functioning have clinical relevance. Overall, the present findings suggest that recovery from surgery is facilitated in patients with a well-functioning immune system, a low-level of pre-operative distress and a passive coping disposition.",

A Pilot, 15-month, randomised effectiveness trial of Risperidone long acting injection (RLAI) versus oral atypical antipsychotic agents (AAP) in persons with bipolar disorder.Long-acting injectible antipsychotic agents are rarely considered in the treatment of bipolar patients [bipolar disorder (BPD)]. We posited that BPD patients receiving risperidone long-acting injections [Risperidone long-acting injections (RLAIs)] would experience fewer negative clinical events than those receiving oral atypical antipsychotic agents (AAP).Adult BPD patients in a hypomanic, manic or mixed episode were randomised to either oral risperdone followed by RLAI (n = 23) or an AAP (n = 25) for 15 months. Any mood stabilizers were continued. An independent clinician board declared any clinical events that occurred but the treatment assignment was concealed.Nine of the 48 patients who participated in this study did not improve, leaving 39 patients in 1-year extension. RLAI patients received the following bi-weekly dosages: 25 mg (n = 9), 37.5 mg (n = 8), and 50 mg (n = 6). The AAP group included aripiprazole (n = 11, 15-30 mg/day), quetiapine (n = 8, 300-700 mg/day), olanzapine (n = 5, 15-25 mg/day), and ziprasidone, (n = 1, 160 mg/day). In total, 47 clinical events were declared. The RLAI-treated group experienced significantly fewer clinical events (mean: 0.86 ± 0.73) compared with the AAP group (1.61 ± 1.29), t = 2.29, d.f. = 37, p = 0.028 (95% CI = 0.087-1.421). Of all, 50% of the AAP subjects gained ≥ 7% of their baseline body weight as did 38% of the RLAI-treated patients.RLAI-treated patients experienced significantly fewer negative clinical events. Further exploration should focus on which subtypes of BPD patients might benefit from RLAI treatment. Weight gain in BPD subjects requires clinical attention. Limitations include an open design, small sample size and the inability to conclude on whether this strategy is useful for depressive episodes.",

Conventional depression rating instruments are designed to capture the characteristics of unipolar depression and have limitations in capturing the breadth of bipolar disorder.The Bipolar Depression Rating Scale (BDRS) was administered together with the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) in a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial of N-acetyl cysteine for bipolar disorder (N = 75).A factor analysis showed a two-factor solution: depression and mixed symptom clusters. The BDRS has strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.917), the depression cluster showed robust correlation with the MADRS (r = 0.865) and the mixed subscale correlated with the YMRS (r = 0.750).The BDRS has good internal validity and inter-rater reliability and is sensitive to change in the context of a clinical trial.",

Emotional vulnerability and cognitive control in patients with bipolar disorder and their healthy siblings: a pilot study.There is evidence that, even in remission, patients with bipolar disorder (BD) have deficits in cognitive function and emotional regulation. Siblings of patients with BD are also reported to exhibit minor dysfunction in neuropsychological domains. In this study, we examined the interference of acute mood state with reaction time (RT) and response inhibition in euthymic patients with BD, in their healthy siblings and in healthy controls.A total of 34 patients with bipolar I disorder, 22 healthy siblings and 33 healthy controls performed a stop-signal paradigm after induction of a transient intense sadness and a relaxed mood state. The differences in RT and the response inhibition were compared between the groups.Euthymic patients with BD displayed a higher emotional reactivity compared with their siblings and with controls. Compared with controls, patients with BD showed longer RTs in a relaxed mood state and a delay in response inhibition during emotional activation.The present study provides evidence for the clinical observation that patients with BD have shorter RTs when in a state of emotional arousal rather than in a relaxed state. Inhibitory deficits in these patients may be because of a too strong emotional arousal. The results show that in patients with BD, relaxation and emotional arousal are inversely associated with performance in a neuropsychological task. This is in contrast to findings in healthy individuals suggesting a dysbalance in emotional regulation in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Causative relations between infections and psychosis, especially schizophrenia, have been speculated for more than a century, suggesting a hypothesis of association between schizophrenia and hereditary immune defects. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a pattern-recognition molecule of the innate immune defence. MBL deficiency is the most common hereditary defect in the immune system and may predispose to infection and autoimmunity. Mannan-binding lectin serine protease-2 (MASP-2) is an MBL-associated serine protease mediating complement activation upon binding of MBL/MASP to microorganisms. The objective was to investigate if schizophrenia is associated with serum concentrations of MBL and MASP-2 or with genetic variants of the genes MBL2 and MASP2 encoding these proteins. Methods: The sample consisted of 100 patients with schizophrenia and 350 controls. Concentrations of MBL and MASP-2 in serum were measured and seven single nucleotide polymorphisms known to influence these concentrations were genotyped. Results: Significant association of disease with genetic markers was found in MBL2 but not in MASP2 . Significant difference in MBL serum concentration was found between patients and controls when adjusting for MBL2 haplotypes. For concentrations of MASP-2, a significant interaction effect between a MASP2 variant and disease was found. Interestingly, MASP-2 levels also depended significantly on variants in MBL2 exon 1. Conclusion: This study supports previous studies showing increased complement activity in patients with schizophrenia, indicates aetiological heterogeneity among patients and underlines that multilocus genotypes have to be considered when investigating effects on MBL level. It appears that inclusion of additional components from the system of complement activation is warranted.",

Moreover, cases categorised into twelve 1‐month intervals were also analysed by means of a validated chronobiologic inferential method (single cosinor) to search for cyclic variability. Results During the analysed period, the hospital database contained 74 379 records referring to 42 625 subjects (52.7% females). Delirium diagnoses were 1300 (1.7% of total sample), 668 of whom in females (51.4%) and 632 in males (48.6%). Events of delirium were more frequent in winter and autumn (26.6 and 26.5%, respectively) than in spring (23.5%) and summer (23.4%). Chronobiological analysis yielded a significant peak of delirium events in January, when considering both the total raw number of cases and the percent of admissions. Conclusions The study seems to indicate in patients hospitalised in medical units, a higher rate of occurrence of delirium in autumn‐winter, similar to that reported for acute medical diseases. The role of possible underlying favouring or triggering factors deserves further research.",

    "abstract": "Our systematic review in BMC Psychiatry concluded that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo significantly increase the risk of serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients with major depression and the potential beneficial effects of SSRIs seem to be outweighed by the harms. Hieronymus et al. accused us of methodological inaccuracies and blatant errors. In their post-hoc analysis of our data, they reported that SSRIs only increase the risk of SAEs in elderly and seems safe for non-elderly patients. They also found our review misleading because our efficacy analyses were based on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; we included suboptimal SSRI doses; and we missed some ‘pivotal trials’. We do not agree with Hieronymus et al. regarding several of the ‘errors’ they claim that we have made. However, we acknowledge that they have identified minor errors and that we missed some trials. After rectifying the errors and inclusion of the missed trials by us and Hieronymus et al., we re-analysed the data. The updated analyses are even more robust and confirm our earlier conclusions. SSRIs significantly increase the risk of an SAE both in non-elderly ( p =0.045) and elderly ( p =0.01) patients [overall odds ratio 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.73; p =0.002; I 2 =0%]. Moreover, SSRIs did not change noticeably the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the internationally accepted scale (mean difference −2.02 points; 95% CI −2.38 to −1.66; p &lt;0.00001). We found no differential effect of dose ( p =0.20).",

Results Observer ratings of retardation correlated with instrumental assessments of fine and gross motor functioning. In contrast, observer ratings of agitation did not correlate with observer ratings of retardation or with the instrumental measures. These associations were partly influenced by age and, to a lesser extent, by depression severity. Conclusion Psychomotor disturbance is a complex concept with different manifestations in depressed patients.

Background: Blonanserin is effective for the treatment of schizophrenia in Korea and Japan. Methods: We administered blonanserin to 48 Japanese patients with schizophrenia for whom other atypical antipsychotics were not sufficiently effective or tolerated. Results: Previous antipsychotics were replaced with blonanserin because of its effectiveness (54.2%; 26/48) or tolerability (45.8%; 22/48). Blonanserin was more effective in 65.4% (17/26) of the and better tolerated in 95.5% (21/22) of the patients. Of 48 patients, 33 continued blonanserin for 1 year. The mean Clinical Global Impression of Severity scores improved from 4.60 to 2.48. The mean Global Assessment of Functioning score improved from 29.8 to 51.7. Nineteen patients (39.6%; 19/48) had a social role. The reasons for discontinuation of blonanserin were ineffectiveness against psychosis (27.1%; 13/48) or intolerability (4.2%; 2/48). The ratio of discontinuation for intolerability versus ineffectiveness was 0.15, which was the lowest among atypical psychotics.

    "abstract": "Although depressive symptoms are preponderant in the course of bipolar (BP) disorders, the treatment of BP depression remains a controversial issue with different clinical approaches available. This review addresses the issues of whether antidepressants (ADs) are effective in treating acute and long-term BP depression, risks linked to ADs and what alternatives to ADs are available.We searched the MEDLINE databases using the following syntax: [bipolar depression AND unipolar depression AND (antidepressants OR anticonvulsants OR lithium OR antipsychotics OR dopamine-agonists OR psychoeducation OR psychotherapy OR electroconvulsive therapy OR transcranial magnetic stimulation)]. The search included studies published up to 31 May 2009 and conducted on adults.In the acute treatment of BP depression ADs are effective with no differences among drug classes. However, neither the switch into (hypo)mania induction rate nor the suicide risk linked to AD use are definitely established. The effectiveness of long-term AD use is limited to highly selected samples of patients with positive acute response. The risk of long-term ADs causing cycle acceleration and rapid cycling induction concerns a subpopulation of patients. Valid alternatives to ADs in treating acute BP depression are quetiapine, an olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, and electroconvulsive therapy for more severe patients. Lamotrigine is effective and safe in preventing depressive relapses. Psychotherapy and psychoeducation represent effective adjunctive treatments.In the treatment of BP depression there is not a specific effective treatment for all the patients. Interventions should therefore be personalised and the scientific evidence should be adapted to each patient's clinical features.",

    "abstract": "Objective Several studies have reported that vegetarian diets are associated with a higher prevalence of major depression. Therefore, we hypothesised that the consumption of animal products, especially eggs, may have positive effects on mental health, especially on major depression, because a previous study reported that egg consumption produces numerous beneficial effects in humans. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of chronic whole-egg treatment on depression-like behaviours in Wistar rats, a control strain, and Wistar Kyoto rats, an animal model of depression. Methods In both the rats, either whole-egg solution (5 ml/kg) or distilled water (5 ml/kg) was orally administrated for 35 days. During these periods, the open-field test (OFT) was conducted on the 21st day, and a forced swimming test (FST) was enforced on the 27th and 28th days. On the 36th day, the plasma and brain were collected. Results Chronic whole-egg treatment did not affect line crossing in the OFT, whereas it reduced the total duration of immobility in the FST on both strains. Furthermore, interestingly, the results indicated the possibility that whole-egg treatment elevated the incorporation of tryptophan into the brain, and the tryptophan concentration in the prefrontal cortex was actually increased by the treatment. Conclusion This study demonstrated that whole-egg treatment exerts an antidepressant-like effect in the FST. It is suggested that whole egg may be an excellent food for preventing and alleviating the conditions of major depression.",

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the genetic association of this polymorphism with schizophrenia in the Zhuang and Han populations of south China. Subjects and methods A total of 282 patients (188 Han and 94 Zhuang) and 282 healthy subjects (188 Han and 94 Zhuang) were recruited. Of these, 246 schizophrenia patients underwent an assessment of psychotic symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). A TaqMan genotyping assay method was used to determine the genotypes. Results We did not find a significant association of rs12807809 polymorphism with schizophrenia in the total pooled samples, or in the separate ethnic groups. However, in Han schizophrenia patients, quantitative data analyses showed that the CC genotype of the rs12807809 polymorphism was associated with PANSS aggression subscale score and activation subscale score. Furthermore, carriers of the C allele of rs12807809 polymorphism among Han schizophrenia patients had higher scores of general, activation, depression, aggression, and global symptoms than the T allele carriers.

Conclusions: It seems that any OC, without distinction in typology and severity, could unspecifically impair the neurodevelopment and inducing NSS expression.

Materials and methods The study was carried out at the Mental Health Research Institute, Tomsk, Russian Federation. This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised in parallel-group study enrolled 40 patients. As a part of complex therapy, patients from the main group ( n =20) received anaferon, a drug containing ultra-high dilutions of affinity-purified antibodies to human interferon γ as the active pharmaceutical ingredient; patients from the comparative group ( n =20) received placebo. Duration of the therapy was 30±5 days. Assessment of severity of symptoms and changes in them were made using clinical scales: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Clinical Global Impression, Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale. Spontaneous and phytohemagglutinin-induced production of interferon γ by immunocompetent cells in supernatants of 48 h whole blood culture of patients was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results The reduction of interferon-producing potential by immunocompetent cells in comparison with reference normal value was shown in total group of patients ( n =40) before combined therapy. During the treatment, increase of spontaneous interferon γ production and favourable changes in psychopathological symptoms as compared with placebo were shown in subjects receiving anaferon. It was found that favourable changes in clinical symptoms assessed using clinical scales with a high degree of confidence correlated with high level of spontaneous interferon γ production. Conclusion Anaferon as a part of complex therapy of patients with schizophrenia contributes to enhancement of its efficacy acting via mechanism of psychoimmunomodulation.",

A cursory analysis, however, suggests the analysis of SAEs conducted by the authors to be marred by both methodological inaccuracies and blatant errors. After having corrected for these apparent mistakes, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we also accounted for a possible moderating effect of age; while this suggests SSRIs to be safe drugs in the non-elderly, they do confirm what is already known, that is, that they may enhance the risk for SAEs in the old. Given the loose definition of SAE, including also innocuous phenomena, the possible clinical significance of the latter observation, however, remains unclear until the nature and actual impact of the SAEs in question have been clarified. Moreover, with respect to efficacy, we find the paper in BMC Psychiatry misleading: first , the authors seem unaware of the well-established shortcomings associated with the conventional efficacy parameter on which their analysis is based, second , they have included suboptimal SSRI doses and third , they have missed some pivotal trials. Unless there are explanations for the many peculiarities in this paper that have escaped us, and which may be satisfactorily clarified by the authors, it seems important that the conclusions presented in this paper be publicly rectified.",

Methods: A reward sensitivity measurement scale was constructed on the basis of large item pool collected from birth cohort representative samples (the Estonian Children Personality Behaviour and Health Study; original n = 1238). Affective Neuroscience Personality Scale (ANPS) and the Adult Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Self-Report Scale (ASRS) were administered in young adulthood. A variant (rs4570625) of the gene encoding tryptophan hydroxylase 2 ( TPH2 ) that is responsible for the synthesis of central serotonin was genotyped. Results: Reward sensitivity consisted of two orthogonal components, operationally defined as Openness to Rewards and Insatiability by Reward, that respectively characterise the striving towards multiple rewards and the strong pursuit and fixation to a particular reward. While SEEKING and PLAY (and to lower extent CARE) of the ANPS co-varied with Openness to Rewards, FEAR, SADNESS, and ANGER were related to Insatiability by Reward. The total score of ASRS was moderately correlated with Insatiability by Reward, while the association with Openness to Rewards was negligible. However, ASRS Inattention had some negative relationship with the Social Experience facet of Openness to Rewards. The T/T homozygotes for the TPH2 promoter polymorphism had lower Insatiability by Reward but not Openness to Rewards. Conclusions: Behaviours sensitive to rewards are separable to the components of variability and fixation, and these components are differentially related to affective aspects of personality, attention, and hyperactivity as well as to TPH2 genotype.",

Plane-assisted suicides occur within an overwhelmingly male, middle aged population who, in addition to suicide, commit large scale acts of murder. Issues of divorce, separation, and threats to masculinity appear integral to an effective prevention program.

    "abstract": "Stressful life events play an important role in the aetiology of human mood disorders and are frequently modelled by chronic social defeat (SD) in rodents. Exploratory phenotype in rats is a stable trait that is likely related to inter-individual differences in reactivity to stress. The aim of the study was to confirm that low levels of exploratory activity (LE) are, in rodents, a risk factor for passive stress coping, and to clarify the role of medium (ME) and high (HE) exploratory disposition in the sensitivity to SD.We examined the effect of SD on male Wistar rats with LE, ME, and HE activity levels as measured in the exploration box. After SD, the rats were evaluated in social preference, elevated zero maze, and open-field tests. Brain tissue levels of monoamines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.Rats submitted to SD exhibited lower weight gain, higher sucrose consumption, showed larger stress-induced hyperthermia, lower levels of homovanillic acid in the frontal cortex, and higher levels of noradrenaline in the amygdala and hippocampus. Open-field, elevated zero maze, and social preference tests revealed the interaction between stress and phenotype, as only LE-rats were further inhibited by SD. ME-rats exhibited the least reactivity to stress in terms of changes in body weight, stress-induced hyperthermia, and sucrose intake.Both low and high novelty-related activity, especially the former, are associated with elevated sensitivity to social stress. This study shows that both tails of a behavioural dimension can produce stress-related vulnerability.",

This review delves into the historical progression of research focused on the behavioural effects of BK and other drugs that act via similar mechanisms to provide new insights into the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders. Evidence from experiments with animal models indicates that BK modulates defensive reactions associated with panic symptoms and the response to acute stressors. The mechanisms are not entirely understood but point to complex interactions with other neurotransmitter systems, such as opioids, and intracellular signalling cascades. By addressing the existing research gaps in this field, we present new proposals for future research endeavours to foster a new era of investigation regarding BK's role in emotional regulation. Implications for psychiatry, chiefly for panic and depressive disorders are also discussed.",

However, some literature suggests that not all illicit substances may lead to aggression, notably psychedelics. This narrative review investigates the associations between serotonergic psychedelics and MDMA on aggressive behaviour. Methods: PubMed and PsycINFO were searched for original, peer-reviewed articles evaluating the effects of serotonergic psychedelics and 3,4-methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) on violent and aggressive behaviour using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: After removing duplicates, a total of 555 articles were screened, with 16 meeting the inclusion criteria. One additional article was obtained through reference screening bringing the total to 17 articles. Of these 17 articles, 14 studies focused on MDMA and three on serotonergic psychedelics. Findings were mixed, with some results demonstrating increased aggression following psychedelics and others suggesting protective effects. Limitations in the current literature include varied definitions of psychedelics, lack of standardised objective outcome measures and failure to control for confounding. Conclusion: As psychedelic research continues to expand, further assessment on the effects of serotonergic psychedelics and MDMA on aggressive behaviour is required.",

However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying ECT. This systematic review aims to critically review all structural magnetic resonance imaging studies investigating longitudinal cortical thickness (CT) changes after ECT in patients with unipolar or bipolar depression. Methods: We performed a search on PubMed, Medline, and Embase to identify all available studies published before April 20, 2023. A total of 10 studies were included. Results: The investigations showed widespread increases in CT after ECT in depressed patients, involving mainly the temporal, insular, and frontal regions. In five studies, CT increases in a non-overlapping set of brain areas correlated with the clinical efficacy of ECT. The small sample size, heterogeneity in terms of populations, comorbidities, and ECT protocols, and the lack of a control group in some investigations limit the generalisability of the results. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that ECT can increase CT in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. It remains unclear whether these changes are related to the clinical response. Future larger studies with longer follow-up are warranted to thoroughly address the potential role of CT as a biomarker of clinical response after ECT.",

Here we aim to investigate the protective effects of genistein, a plant-derived anti-inflammatory drug, against TBI-induced anxiety, and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: A rat model of TBI was constructed using the lateral fluid percussion injury method. Genistein at the doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg were used to treat rats at 30 min, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h up to 14 days after TBI. The evaluation of neurological deficit was performed preoperatively, on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after TBI. The elevated plus maze test was carried out to assess anxiety and explorative behaviours, and the open field test was performed to assess locomotive activities. Brain injury was assessed by measuring brain water content and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling staining. Inflammatory responses were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA and protein expression were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. Results: In the behavioural level, genistein treatment alleviated TBI-induced anxiety behaviours and neurological deficit in rats. In the meanwhile, brain oedema was also reduced by genistein treatment, showing alleviating effects of genistein at the pathological level. TUNEL staining also showed reduced apoptosis in rats treated with genistein. Genistein also inhibited Nlrp3/caspase-1 signalling, unveiling the effects of genistein in altering molecular pathways in brains with TBI. Conclusion: Genistein alleviates anxiety-like behaviours in TBI rats, which may be mediated via inhibiting Nlrp/caspase-1 signalling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The dorsal midbrain comprises dorsal columns of the periaqueductal grey matter and corpora quadrigemina. These structures are rich in beta-endorphinergic and leu-enkephalinergic neurons and receive GABAergic inputs from substantia nigra pars reticulata. Although the inferior colliculus (IC) is mainly involved in the acoustic pathways, the electrical and chemical stimulation of central and pericentral nuclei of the IC elicits a vigorous defensive behaviour. The defensive immobility and escape elicited by IC activation is commonly related to panic-like emotional states. To investigate the role of κ-opioid receptor of the IC in the antiaversive effects of endogenous opioid receptor blockade in a dangerous situation, male Wistar rats were pretreated in the IC with the κ-opioid receptor-selective antagonist nor-binaltorphimine at different concentrations and submitted to the non-enriched polygonal arena for a snake panic test in the presence of a rattlesnake and, after 24 h, prey were resubmitted to the experimental context. The snakes elicited in prey a set of antipredatory behaviours, such as the anxiety-like responses of defensive attention and risk assessment, and the panic-like reactions of defensive immobility and either escape or active avoidance during the elaboration of unconditioned and conditioned fear-related responses. Pretreatment of the IC with microinjections of nor-binaltorphimine at higher concentrations significantly decreased the frequency and duration of both anxiety- and panic-attack-like behaviours. These findings suggest that κ-opioid receptor blockade in the IC causes anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like responses in threatening conditions, and that kappa-opioid receptor-selective antagonists can be a putative coadjutant treatment for panic syndrome treatment.",

Methylation of adenosine at N 6 (m 6 A) is one of the most common and important cellular modiﬁcation occurring in the mRNA of eukaryotes. Evidence that m 6 A mRNA methylation is involved in regulation of stress response and that its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders is accumulating. We have examined the acute and subchronic (up to 18 days once per day intraperitoneally) effect of the first METTL3/METTL14 activator compound CHMA1004 (methyl-piperazine-2-carboxylate) at two doses (1 and 5 mg/kg) in male and female rats. CHMA1004 had a locomotor activating and anxiolytic-like profile in open field and elevated zero-maze tests. In female rats sucrose consumption and swimming in Porsolt’s test were increased. Nevertheless, CHMA1004 did not exhibit strong psychostimulant-like properties: CHMA1004 had no effect on 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations except that it reduced the baseline difference between male and female animals, and acute drug treatment had no effect on extracellular dopamine levels in striatum. Subchronic CHMA1004 altered ex vivo catecholamine levels in several brain regions. RNA sequencing of female rat striata after subchronic CHMA1004 treatment revealed changes in the expression of a number of genes linked to dopamine neuron viability, neurodegeneration, depression, anxiety and stress response. Conclusively, the first-in-class METTL3/METTL14 activator compound CHMA1004 increased locomotor activity and elicited anxiolytic-like effects after systemic administration, demonstrating that pharmacological activation of RNA m 6 A methylation has potential for neuropsychiatric drug development.",

Information of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder diagnosis and OCS/OCD status was ascertained from structural or free-text fields through natural language processing (NLP) algorithms based on artificial intelligence techniques during the observation window of January 2007 to December 2016. Associations between comorbid OCS/OCD and recorded Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) for problems with activities of daily living (ADLs), living conditions, occupational and recreational activities, and relationships were estimated by logistic regression with socio-demographic confounders controlled. Of 15,412 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder, 2,358 (15.3%) experienced OCS without OCD, and 2,586 (16.8%) had OCD recorded.

Sensitivity analysis revealed similar outcomes. Comorbid OCS/OCD was associated with poorer psychosocial functioning in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder.

    "abstract": "Zinc is a trace element which plays a fundamental role in a wide range of biochemical processes in living organisms. Zinc is an essential component of various proteins and is an important factor for physiological function of the mammalian nervous and immune systems. In the central nervous system (CNS), zinc is found at high concentrations in hippocampal neurons. These neurons possess mechanisms for zinc uptake and storage in synaptic terminals and for the stimulation of zinc release along with neurotransmitters. In the central nervous system, zinc modulates predominantly the excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) amino acid neurotransmission pathways. In the immune system, zinc is necessary for the physiological activity of the thymus and T-cell-dependent responses. Zinc deficiency impairs the activities of the neuroendocrine and immune systems in mammalian organisms. This paper reviews the alterations in the blood and brain zinc concentrations in relation to the neuroimmune pathophysiology and treatment of depression. Major depression is related to lowered serum zinc concentrations, which may be caused by the acute phase and the inflammatory response in that illness. Repeated administration of antidepressants selectively increases and redistributes brain zinc in the hippocampus. Since zinc is an inhibitor of the glutama-te/NMDA receptor, these data are in accordance with the glutamate hypothesis of antidepressant action.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews the arguments that support the approach regarding the 'inflationary' influence of the negative affectivity (NA) trait, or neuroticism, on relationships between perceived stress (e.g. different means of self-report of psychosocial stress such as major life events or daily stress) and subjective physical health (e.g. somatic symptomatology, health complaints). It has been explained that the said inflationary effect could distort the interpretation of the results that are found if it is done in terms of stress-objective health relationships (known in terms of health behavior, biological markers, morbidity and mortality) and that, in this sense, the NA would be a contaminant. This is why it has been suggested that in these cases, the effect of NA on predictor and criterion relationships should be controlled. The present critical review doesn't support these conclusions. Also, this paper deals with the empirical analysis of some matters that refer to one of the arguments mentioned, namely that NA is a general and penetrating factor that impregnates perceived stress (we will focus on daily stress or hassles) and subjective health measures (we will focus on somatic symptoms), as well as its relationships. We also analyze the role of positive affectivity (PA). The empirical analysis carried out uses a combination of within and interindividual methods. Contrary to the hypothesis regarding the moderating effects (specifically, inflationary) of NA on relationships between daily stress and somatic symptomatology, NA has only presented direct significant effects on both variables (between subjects), while its moderating effects are modest and non-significant. However, PA appears not to have any direct significant effects, but it does have moderating effects (specifically, buffering effects). Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings and we make some suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder can be characterized in terms of a profile of abnormal deviations on multiple personality dimensions using the temperament and character inventory (TCI). Borderline patients show poor character development, including low TCI self-directedness (irresponsible, blaming) and low TCI cooperativeness (hostile, intolerant). Their temperament is explosive or unstable due to a combination of high TCI harm avoidance (anxious, shy), high TCI novelty seeking (impulsive, quick-tempered), and low reward dependence (cold, aloof). Consequently they are usually dysthymic with an admixture of anxiety and anger, and regulate their social problems and intense emotions in immature ways. Genetic and psychobiological studies have led to identification of biological correlates of each of the TCI dimensions of personality, including individual differences in regional brain activity, psychophysiological variables, neuroendocrine abnormalities and specific gene polymorphisms. Each dimension of personality involves complex non-linear interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors and, in turn, each personality dimension interacts with the others in influencing the way an individual directs and adapts to his or her life experiences. Systematic clinical trials have shown that these personality variables predict the response to pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments. For example, high harm avoidance and low self-directedness predict slower response and more rapid relapse with both antidepressants and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Treatment with drugs and/or psychotherapy can be individually matched to the patient's profile of temperament and character traits, rather than treating a heterogeneous group of patients as if they had a discrete, homogeneous illness. Fundamental change in cognitive schemas depends on attention to all aspects of character, especially self-transcendence, which has previously been neglected in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Personality integration requires non-resistance to our natural intuitive awareness, rather than intensified intellectual and emotional defenses.",

    "abstract": "Background: Somatization has been defined in a number of ways. Despite their differences, these definitions have one element in common, namely the presence of somatic symptoms that cannot be explained (adequately) by organic findings. Objective: The primary objectives of the dissertation were to gain a better insight into the concept of somatization, and to study (prospectively) the relationship between neuroticism and alexithymia, two personality traits that have been shown to be related to somatization, the affective state dimensions positive and negative affect (or psychological distress) and medically unexplained symptoms. Method: A selective review was conducted regarding conceptual and methodological issues related to somatization. A total number of 318 patients, presenting to their primary care physician with medically unexplained symptoms, participated in the prospective study. Both at baseline and at 6-month follow-up a number of measures were filled out with respect to somatization, neuroticism, alexithymia, negative and positive affect, anxiety and depression. Results: The concept of somatization was clarified, thereby making use of the distinction between presenting and functional somatization. The personality traits neuroticism and alexithymia were found to have an indirect influence on symptom reports. Both the cross-sectional and follow-up data pointed to the importance of positive and negative affect as determinants of (changes in) number of symptoms (over time). Negative affect, together with the alexithymia dimension measuring difficulty identifying feelings, predicted symptom persistence. Conclusions: The theoretical as well as therapeutic implications of the present paper may give an impetus to new research in the domain of somatization.",

A concomitant assessment of depression, body mass index and age was made to evaluate the possible correlation with personality dimensions.Adolescent ANR patients scored higher in persistence, harm avoidance and cooperativeness, and lower in novelty seeking and self-transcendence than control women. ANB patients scored in the middle between ANR and control females, but differences did not reach the significance level with either group, except for the self-transcendence dimension where they scored significantly higher than those with ANR.The deviations in temperamental profile of adolescent ANR are similar to those reported in adult patients. The ANB adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa show less prominent deviations from the personality of control women. With regard to the character dimension of cooperativeness, adolescents with ANR scored higher than controls, in contrast to the observations in adult patients. This may reflect the effect of illness on the development of character.",

Patients received naltrexone or acamprosate or a combination of naltrexone and acamprosate or placebo for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed weekly by interview, self-report, questionnaires and laboratory screening. Additionally, follow-up evaluation based on telephone interview of participants, general practitioners and relatives was conducted 12 weeks after terminating the medication.At week 12, the proportion of subjects relapsing to heavy drinking was significantly lower in the group with combined medication compared with both placebo and acamprosate (P < 0.05). No difference was detectable between acamprosate and naltrexone, both of which were superior to placebo (P < 0.05). Relapse rates were 28% (combined medication), 35% (naltrexone), 50% (acamprosate) and 75% (placebo). After follow-up (week 24), combined medication led to relapse rates significantly lower than placebo, but not lower than acamprosate. Again, both naltrexone and acamprosate were superior to placebo. Relapse rates were 80% (placebo), 54% (acamprosate), 53% (naltrexone) and 34% (combined medication).The results of this study highlight the stability of effects of pharmacotherapy on relapse prevention in alcohol dependence.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mirtazapine is an antidepressant first approved in the Netherlands in 1994 for the treatment of major depressive disorder. However, evidence suggests its effectiveness in a variety of other psychiatric disorders and non-psychiatric medical conditions. Objective: The present paper reviews the published literature on the off-label indications of Mirtazapine. Methods: A search of the relevant literature from MEDLINE, PsycLIT and EMBASE databases, included in the Science Citation Index and available up to March 2006, was conducted using the terms mirtazapine, case-reports, open-label trials and randomized controlled trials. Only articles referring to conditions other than major depression were included in this present review. Results: Off-label use of mirtazapine has been reported in panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dysthymia, menopausal depression, poststroke depression, depression as a result of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, elderly depression, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced depression, hot flashes, alcohol and other substance use disorders, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, tension-type headaches, cancer pain, fibromyalgia, schizophrenia and other less frequent conditions. Conclusions: So far, data on the off-label usefulness of mirtazapine are limited and mainly based on observations from case reports or open-label studies. However, positive cues suggest that confirmation of these preliminary data with randomized controlled trials may give sufficient evidence to warrant the use of mirtazapine in a broad range of disorders.",

Anesthesia-relevant symptoms influence the preanesthetic management (eg difficulties in articulation, dementia), the induction of anesthesia (eg oromandibular rigidity, seizures, dysphagia, aspiration) and the postoperative care (eg respiratory disability).Reports concerning the anesthetic management of patients with PKAN are very limited, possibly as a result of the rareness of the disorder. Like many other patients with neurodegenerative diseases, patients with PKAN have many anesthesia-relevant symptoms, leading to numerous anesthetic management challenges. In general, the anesthetic complications associated with PKAN are usually no different from those associated with other neurodegenerative diseases, and the management of these are usually concordant.",

There was also a statistically significant correlation between several Q-LES-Q and OBS-SR domains.The presence of subthreshold OCD is correlated with poorer QoL. More research is needed to evaluate if specific therapeutic interventions targeting subthreshold obsessive-compulsive symptoms can lead to a significant improvement in the QoL of the affected individuals.",

Allele and genotype frequencies of this polymorphism were studied in different ethnic groups of schizophrenic patients. However, the results have been inconclusive.To determine whether the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism is associated with schizophrenia or influences its psychopathological symptoms in Han Chinese population.We recruited 256 schizophrenic patients and 285 normal controls matched for gender, age and ethnicity. Pretreatment psychotic symptoms were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) in 128 acutely exacerbated schizophrenic in-patients. Genotyping of Ser9Gly polymorphism was performed with a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method and reconfirmed by a direct sequencing technique.No significant difference was found between either patients with schizophrenia or with more homogeneous schizophrenic subgroups and healthy controls in genotype distributions and allele frequencies for the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism. Similarly, DRD3 Ser9Gly genotype differences failed to reach significance in PANSS global, positive, negative and general symptoms scores. There is a trend (P = 0.064) towards higher PANSS positive symptoms scores in subjects carrying the Gly/Gly genotype.This study does not support the role of DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism in increasing genetic risk for schizophrenia in Han Chinese population. Still, there is a possibility that the DRD3 Ser9Gly variant may reflect genetic variation of severity of positive symptoms in acutely exacerbated schizophrenia. Further studies are warranted to investigate the effect of the DRD3 Ser9Gly polymorphism in relation to longer time course of schizophrenia, including treatment response to antipsychotics.",

Symptomatic clusters were evaluated by the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD).The frequencies of S/S genotype and S allele in 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were significantly higher in UPD patients than in healthy controls. There was a significant difference in distributions of genotypes in 5-HT2CR Cys23Ser polymorphism between UPD patients and control subjects, but the difference became no significant when the data were further stratified by gender. The patients with genotypes G/G and T/G of 5-HT1DβR T371G polymorphism had significantly lower scores of diurnal variation evaluated by HAMD than those with genotype T/T, while the patients with genotype T/G had significantly higher scores of hopelessness than those with genotypes G/G and T/T. There were no significant differences in genotypic and allelic distributions of TPH1 A218C, 5-HT2AR -1438G/A or 5-HT6R C267T polymorphisms between the case and control groups.The study demonstrates that 5-HTTLPR and 5-HT2CR Cys23Ser polymorphisms might contribute to susceptibility of UPD, and the genotype T/T in 5-HT1DβR T371G polymorphism might be a risk factor for diurnal variation, while T/G might be a protective factor against hopelessness in Han Chinese populations.",

Objective: To establish clinical, cognitive and neural correlates of self-monitoring deficits in schizophrenia, which according to various theoretical models can account for the first-rank symptoms of this disorder. Methods: Relevant data were identified from PubMed and PsycInfo searches up to July 2006 using combinations of keywords including ‘self-monitoring’, ‘symptoms’, ‘self-agency’, ‘neuropsychological’, ‘cognitive’, ‘brain activity’, ‘PET’ and ‘fMRI’. Conclusions: Self-monitoring deficit is most consistently observed in patients with schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations and passivity experiences. This deficit may not be schizophrenia specific. At present, there are insufficient direct data to reach meaningful conclusions about the cognitive correlates of this deficit. Functional neuroimaging studies in patients with schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations point to defective engagement of the neural regions known to be involved in self-monitoring in healthy people. Further multimodal studies using validated cognitive and clinical measures, self-monitoring paradigms and appropriate imaging tools to analyze patients with schizophrenia with and without self-monitoring deficits are required to increase our understanding of this topic.",

Methods: Two adolescent chronic inhalant users with similar psychosocial disadvantages (eg unstable and dysfunctional families, state-based care, school absenteeism and forensic issues) and histories of comorbid drug use and mental health problems were assessed using a battery of paper and pencil and computerised neuropsychological tests. Results: Contrary to the expectations of her case manager, one participant performed within the normal range for her age in all domains of intellectual ability, while the other participant, in line with the expectations of her case manger, showed marked cognitive deficits and intellectual disability. Conclusions: The typically complex presentation of chronic inhalant users (ie disadvantaged psychosocial backgrounds, comorbid psychopathology and poor motivation/engagement) is rarely considered when investigating associated cognitive and intellectual functioning. Future research should more carefully consider the role of such factors, given the evidence suggesting that they can considerably alter (accentuate or diminish) the association between inhalant abuse and neuropsychological impairment.",

The current study examined the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of a number of young adult heroin-dependent patients who had attempted suicide.We studied a group of 108 young adult heroin-dependent patients in our in-patient clinics. All diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I-II Disorders (SCID-I, II). The age range of patients was 18-24 years. Their substance abuse histories were assessed by semistructured interview. The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) was administered to all the patients. Serum total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were routinely measured. In the statistical analyses, Student's t test, and chi-squared tests were applied.Of the 108 heroin-dependent patients, 40 (37.0%) had histories of attempted suicide. There was a statistically significant difference in the age at which heroin use had commenced between female attempters [mean = 16.82, standard deviation (SD) = 3.06] and nonattempters (mean = 18.32, SD = 2.68, t= 2.25, P < 0.05). Both the male (mean = 33.35, SD = 4.05) and the female (mean = 28.00, SD = 5.36) attempters had significantly higher ASI scores than did the male (mean = 20.16, SD = 3.80) and the female (mean = 18.88, SD = 4.14) nonattempters (t= 14.34, P < 0.001; t= 5.25, P < 0.001, respectively).

In particular, low levels of total cholesterol and HDL-C might indeed be associated with violent suicide attempts in young heroin-dependent patients.",

Among psychiatric disorders, bipolar disorder ranks highest in suicidality with a relative risk ratio of completed suicide of about 25 compared to the general population. Regarding the biological hypotheses of suicidality, low blood cholesterol level has been extensively explored, although results are still conflicting. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there were differences in the serum cholesterol levels in hospitalized bipolar disorder men patients with history of suicide attempts ( n = 20) and without suicide attempts ( n = 20). Additionally, we investigated if there were differences in the prevalence of MetS according to NCEP ATP-III criteria in these two groups of patients. Results of the study indicated significantly lower serum cholesterol levels ( P = 0.013) and triglyceride levels ( P = 0.047), in the bipolar disorder men with suicide attempts in comparison to bipolar disorder men without suicide attempts. The overall prevalence of MetS was 11/40 (27.5%). On this particular sample it was higher in the non-attempters 8/20 (40.0%) than in attempters 3/20 (15.0%) bipolar men group, but without statistical significance. Lower concentrations of serum cholesterol might be useful biological markers of suicidality in men with bipolar disorder.",

Relation between neuritic plaques and depressive state in Alzheimer's disease.To investigate for the first time in a prospective study the relationship between depressive state and the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, using a scale for depressive symptoms in dementia, while controlling for clinical severity of dementia.Within the framework of a prospective longitudinal study of depression in Alzheimer's disease, patients with dementia underwent a clinical evaluation every six months during the last years of their lives, using the Cornell scale for depression in dementia to assess depressive symptoms and using the Functional Assessment Staging scale to control for clinical severity of dementia. The brains of 43 Alzheimer patients were obtained. The last clinical evaluations prior to death together with post-mortem neuropathology measures were analysed.We found a correlation between the Cornell scores and the sum score for the density of neuritic plaques in the entire cortex (p = 0.027), and even stronger in the temporal cortex (p = 0.012). The observed correlations were independent of sex, age of death, clinical dementia severity and duration of Alzheimer's disease.This study shows a positive relationship between depressive state at time of death and the presence of neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease, which is independent of the clinical severity of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Prior studies have indicated that both high and low school grades are associated with development of bipolar disorder (BD), but these studies have not adjusted for parental history of mental disorder, which is a likely confounder. Furthermore, the association between school grades and bipolar I disorder (BD-I) has not been studied. Therefore, we aimed to study the association between school exam grades and subsequent development of BD and BD-I while adjusting for parental history of mental disorder. Methods We conducted a register-based nationwide cohort study following 505 688 individuals born in Denmark between 1987 and 1995. We investigated the association between school exam grades and development of BD or BD-I with a Cox model adjusting for family history of mental disorder and other potential confounders. Results During follow-up, 900 individuals were diagnosed with BD and 277 of these with BD-I. The risk for BD and BD-I was significantly increased for individuals not having completed the exams at term [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for BD (aHR=1.71, 95% CI: 1.43–2.04) and for BD-I (aHR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.13–2.19)]. Also, having low exam grades in mathematics was associated with increased risk of both BD (aHR=2.41, 95% CI: 1.27–4.59) and BD-I (aHR=2.71, 95% CI: 1.41–5.21). Females with very high exam grades in Danish (percentile group&gt;97.7) had a significantly increased risk of BD-I (aHR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.19–5.23). Conclusions The potential to develop BD seems to affect the school results of individuals negatively even before BD is diagnosed – with females having the potential to develop BD-I as a possible exception.",

However, no serious neuropathological investigation of this protein in the schizophrenic brain has yet been performed. In this study, to confirm the change in neuropathological findings due to the pathogenesis of this disease, we observed the expression of myelin-oligodendrocyte directly in the brain tissue of schizophrenia patients. Methods Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) was evaluated in the cortex of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the hippocampus in 10 schizophrenic and nine age- and sex-matched normal control postmortem brains. Results The expression of MOG was significantly lower in the middle layer of the neocortex of the STG and stratum lucidum of CA3 in the hippocampus in the long-term schizophrenic brains (patients with ≥30 years of illness duration) than in the age-matched controls. Furthermore, the thickness of MOG-positive fibre-like structures was significantly lower in both regions of the long-term schizophrenic brains than in the age-matched controls. Conclusion These findings suggest that a long duration of illness has a marked effect on the expression of MOG in these regions, and that myelin-oligodendrocyte abnormalities in these regions may be related to the progressive pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",

Moreover, these patients' scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) were significantly correlated with rCBF in some gyri of the frontal, parietal, and limbic lobes. Our present study aimed to understand how vascular factors and metabolic disease influenced the relationship between rCBF and ADAS-cog scores.We divided late-onset AD patients into two groups according to their Hachinski Ischemic Score (HIS), low vascular risk patients had values of ≤4 (n=25) and high vascular risk patients had scores ≥5 (n=15). We examined rCBF using brain perfusion SPECT data.The degrees and patterns of reduced rCBF were largely similar between late-onset AD patients in both groups, regardless of HIS values. Cognitive function was significantly associated with rCBF among late-onset AD patients with low vascular risk (HIS≤4), but not among those with high vascular risk (HIS≥5). Furthermore, metabolic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, disrupted the relationships between hypoperfusion and cognitive impairments in late-onset AD patients.Factors other than hypoperfusion, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, could be involved in the cognitive dysfunction of late-onset AD patients with high vascular risk.",

Thus, the ERN is a promising candidate as a psychiatric biomarker. Basic methodological requirements for a biomarker are that their measurements are standardised and reliable. The aim of the present study was to establish ERN acquisition in a reliable, time-efficient and patient-friendly way for use in clinical practice. Methods Healthy subjects performed a speeded Eriksen Flanker Task that increases the number of errors. In a test–retest design ( N = 14) with two sessions separated by 28 days we assessed the reliability of the ERN. To ensure external validity, we aimed to replicate previously reported correlation patterns of ERN amplitude with (A) number of errors and (B) negative affect. In order to optimise the clinical use of the task, we determined to which extent the task can be shortened while keeping reliability &amp;gt;0.80. Results We found excellent reliability of the ERN (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.806–0.947) and replicated ERN correlation patterns. The task can be halved to a patient-friendly length of 200 trials (recorded in 8 min) keeping reliability &amp;gt;0.80. Conclusions The modified task provides reliable and efficient recording of the ERN, facilitating its use as a psychiatric biomarker.",

Voxel-based analysis using the normalised images of cortical volume data was examined, and the fractional anisotropy value at three component fibres of the temporal lobes, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and cingulum hippocampal part was compared among the three groups.There were statistically significant volume differences at the bilateral temporal lobe between the healthy subjects and high-risk group. Between the schizophrenic group and healthy subjects, statistically significant volume differences were detected at the bilateral temporal lobes and anterior cingulate cortex. The fractional anisotropy values of the SLF in the schizophrenic and high-risk groups were significantly lower than in the healthy subjects.Our findings indicate that some brain alterations may progress in patients at psychosis pre-onset, possibly because of disrupted developmental mechanisms, and these pathological changes may be predictive of functional outcome.",

    "abstract": "Objective The underlying biology of bipolar disorder and the mechanisms by which effective medications induce their therapeutic effects are not clear. Appropriate use of animal models are essential to further understand biological mechanisms of disease and treatment, and further understanding the therapeutic mechanism of mood stabilisers requires that clinically relevant administration will be effective in animal models. The clinical regimens for mood-stabilising drugs include chronic oral administration; however, much of the work with animal models includes acute administration via injection. An effective chronic and oral administration of the prototypic mood stabiliser lithium was already established and the present study was designed to do the same for the mood stabiliser carbamazepine. Methods Mice were treated for 3 weeks with carbamazepine in food. ICR mice were treated with 0.25%, 0.5% and 0.75%, and C57bl/6 mice with 0.5% and 0.75%, carbamazepine in food (w/w, namely, 2.5, 5.0 or 7.5 g/kg food). Mice were then tested for spontaneous activity, forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. Results Oral carbamazepine administration resulted in dose-dependent blood levels reaching 3.65 μg/ml at the highest dose. In ICR mice, carbamazepine at the 0.5% dose had no effect on spontaneous activity, but significantly reduced immobility in the TST by 27% and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity by 28%. In C57bl/6 mice, carbamazepine at the 0.75% dose reduced immobility time in the FST by 26%. Conclusions These results demonstrate a behaviourally effective oral and chronic regimen for carbamazepine with mood stabilising-like activity in a standard model for mania-like behaviour and two standard models for depression-like behaviour.",

Depression is associated with lower circulating endothelial progenitor cells and increased inflammatory markers. Objective: To test the hypothesis that depression status in subjects without cardiovascular diseases (CVD) or diabetes is associated with depletion of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and impaired endothelial function. Method: Thirty depressive persons with the first episode of depression (case group) diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and 30 healthy people (control group) were investigated. The depression status was estimated using Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression from which the criteria of depression are determined to be &gt;21 score. EPCs labeled with CD34-ECD, CD133-phycoerythrin and kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibodies were counted by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of patients and control subjects. Mononuclear cells that were positive for CD34/KDR, CD133/KDR and CD34/CD133/KDR within the lymphocyte population were characterised as different phenotypes of EPCs. Results: There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between patients and healthy individuals (all p &gt; 0.05). However, patients with depression had significantly lower levels of circulating CD34 + CD133 + KDR + EPCs (132.20 ± 17.27 vs. 225.93 ± 9.88, p = 0.000) and endothelial colony-forming units (26.40 ± 3.79 vs. 36.60 ± 2.88, p = 0.000) than that of healthy subjects. Furthermore, CD34 + CD133 + KDR + EPCs had a negative correlation with tumour necrosis factor- α (Spearman's ρ = 0.433, p = 0.000) and interleukin-6 (Spearman's ρ = 0.441, p = 0.032). Conclusion: Our result shows that depression was associated with lower levels of circulating EPCs, which may contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.",

Objective: Delirium is a life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by disturbances in consciousness, attention, cognition and perception. Antipsychotics are considered the drugs of choice in managing the symptoms of delirium. Paliperidone is a benzisoxazole derivative and the principal active metabolite of risperidone. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of paliperidone for the treatment of delirium. Methods: A prospective open-label study of paliperidone for delirium treatment was performed with 6-day follow-up. Fifteen patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for delirium and had a score of 13 on the Delirium Rating Scale were recruited. The starting dose was 3 mg once a day and the dose was adjusted depending on the status of delirium. Daily assessments of the severity of delirium were evaluated using Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Results: The mean daily maintenance dose of paliperidone was 3.75 ± 1.06. The MDAS scores before and after treatment (day 7) were 23.60 ± 6.31 and 11.33 ± 5.45 ( t = 6.78, p &lt; 0.001), respectively. The intensity of delirium showed a statistically significant reduction in MDAS scores from the first day of treatment. No serious adverse effects were observed, and none of the patients discontinued paliperidone because of adverse effects. Conclusions: This study shows that low-dose paliperidone is effective in reducing behavioural disturbances and symptoms in delirium and is well tolerated in delirious patients. This trial is an open-label study with a small sample size, and further controlled studies will be necessary.",

Schizophrenic patients performed worse than patients with unipolar depression in only two of the administered tests. Differences in cognitive performance between the groups are not as general as often assumed. Therefore, during the acute phase of illness, a diagnostic classification on the grounds of the patients' neurocognitive performance has to be done with caution.",

To further assess the role of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1Ra) in schizophrenia, we examined a functional multiallelic polymorphism localised in intron 2 of this receptor gene associated with an altered level of IL1Ra.In the present case-control study, we have analysed the (86 bp) n polymorphism of the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) gene (RS 1794068) by polymerase chain reaction genotyping in 259 patients with schizophrenia and 178 healthy controls from the Tunisian population.We showed that the frequencies of the IL1RN*2/2 genotype and allele 2 were higher in the patient group compared with the control group, and the difference was statistically significant [13.5% vs. 5.6%, p = 10-3, odds ratio (OR) = 3.2% and 32.8% vs. 21.9%, p = 3 × 10-4, OR = 1.76, respectively).

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Melancholia Scale (MES) consists of the psychic core items of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D6) (depressed mood, interests, psychic anxiety, general somatic, guilt feelings, and psychomotor retardation) and the neuropsychiatric items of the Cronholm-Ottossen Depression Scale. Patients resistant to anti-depressant medication (therapy-resistant depression) have participated in our trials with non-pharmacological augmentation. On the basis of these trials, we have evaluated to what extent the neuropsychiatric subscale of the MES (concentration difficulties, fatigability, emotional introversion, sleep problems, and decreased verbal communication) is a measure of severity of apathia when compared with the HAM-D6 subscale of the MES. METHODS: We have focused on rating sessions at baseline (week 0) and after 2 and 4 weeks of therapy in four clinical trials on therapy-resistant depression with the following augmentations: electroconvulsive therapy, bright light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation or pulsed electromagnetic fields, and wake therapy. The item response theory model constructed by Mokken has been used as the psychometric validation of unidimensionality. For the numerical evaluation of transferability, we have tested item ranks across the rating weeks. RESULTS: In the Mokken analysis, the coefficient of homogeneity was above 0.40 for both the HAM-D subscale and the apathia subscale at week 4. The numerical transferability across the weeks was statistically significant (p < 0.05) for both subscales. CONCLUSION: The apathia subscale is a unidimensional scale with acceptable transferability for the measurement of treatment-resistant symptoms, analogue to the psychic core subscale (HAM-D6).",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) are thought to be implicated in a variety of neuronal processes, including cell growth, resilience to noxious stimuli and synaptic plasticity. A Val to Met substitution at codon 66 in the BDNF protein has been associated with a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. The ApoE4 allele is considered a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but its effects on young adults are less clear. We sought to investigate the effects of those two polymorphisms on hemispheric and lateral ventricular volumes of young healthy adults.Hemispheric and lateral ventricular volumes of 144 healthy individuals, aged 19-35 years, were measured using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging and data were correlated with BDNF and ApoE genotypes.There were no correlations between BDNF or ApoE genotype and hemispheric or lateral ventricular volumes.These findings indicate that it is unlikely that either the BDNF Val66Met or ApoE polymorphisms exert any significant effect on hemispheric or lateral ventricular volume. However, confounding epistatic genetic effects as well as relative insensitivity of the volumetric methods used cannot be ruled out. Further imaging analyses are warranted to better define any genetic influence of the BDNF Val6Met and ApoE polymorphism on brain structure of young healthy adults.",

Recent research points towards sortilin as a potential biomarker for depression, and the aim of the current study was to investigate the serum sortilin level in response to antidepressant treatment. METHODS: The study included 56 depressed individuals of which 41 responded to treatment. Depression scores and serum levels of sortilin were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 13. RESULTS: The depression score and response to treatment were not predicted by the sortilin level. Likewise, we observed no significant change in serum sortilin levels following 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, no association between the serum sortilin level and depression score was observed. CONCLUSION: The results do not point towards sortilin as a state-dependent biomarker.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A restricted Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS-6) with the six schizophrenia specific items from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) has been investigated. These six items from the PANSS have recently been found to have both clinical validity and 'unidimensionality' in measuring the severity of schizophrenic states. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical validity of the BPRS-6. The secondary objective was to evaluate the 'unidimensionality' of the BPRS-6 by an 'item response theory' model. METHODS: The BPRS-6 was scored independently by two psychiatrists and two psychologists while viewing six open-ended videotaped interviews in patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of schizophrenia. The interviews were conducted by Heinz E. Lehmann, an experienced psychiatrist. They were focused on the psychopathology that contributed most to the 'severity' of the patient's clinical state. RESULTS: The BPRS-6 with three positive symptoms (delusions, conceptual disorganisation, hallucinations) and three negative symptoms (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poverty of speech) was found to be clinically valid and captured the variables that contribute most to the severity of schizophrenia. The BPRS-6 was also found to have acceptable 'unidimensionality' (coefficient of homogeneity 0.45) and inter-rater reliability (inter-class-coefficient 0.81). CONCLUSION: The BPRS-6 was found to capture the information that translates into the severity of schizophrenia. It has also acceptable psychometric validity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often precedes Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD), and in a high proportion of individuals affected by MCI, there are already neuropathological processes ongoing that become more evident when patients progress to AD. Accordingly, there is a need for reliable biomarkers to distinguish between normal aging and incipient AD. Recent research suggests that, in addition to established biomarkers such as CSF Aß42, total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau, resting state connectivity established by functional magnetic resonance imaging might also be a feasible biomarker for prodromal stages of AD. In order to explore this possibility, we investigated resting state functional connectivity as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiles in patients with MCI ( n = 30; age 66.43 ± 7.06 years) and cognitively healthy controls ( n = 38; age 66.89 ± 7.12 years). CSF Aß42, total tau and hyperphosphorylated tau concentrations were correlated with measures of cognitive performance (immediate and delayed recall, global cognition, processing speed). Moreover, MCI-related alterations in intrinsic functional connectivity within the default mode network were investigated using functional resting state MRI. As expected, MCI patients showed decreased CSF Aß42 and increased total tau concentrations. These alterations were associated with cognitive performance. However, there were no differences between MCI patients and cognitively healthy controls regarding intrinsic functional connectivity. In conclusion, our results indicate that CSF protein profiles seem to be more closely related to cognitive decline than alterations in resting state activity. Thus, resting state connectivity might not be a reliable biomarker for early stages of AD.",

The effects of galangin were compared with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil, and typical and atypical antipsychotics haloperidol and olanzapine, respectively.Galangin (50,100 mg/kg) enhanced apomorphine-induced PPI disruption similar to donepezil, haloperidol, and olanzapine (p < 0.05). This effect was not altered in the combination of galangin with the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine (1 mg/kg), the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (0.05 mg/kg), or the serotonin-1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (1 mg/kg) (p > 0.05).

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive validity of the apathy subsyndrome in patients with therapy-resistant depression in the dose-remission study with transcranial pulsating electromagnetic fields (T-PEMF). METHODS: The apathy subsyndrome consists of the symptoms of fatigue, concentration and memory problems, lack of interests, difficulties in making decisions, and sleep problems. We evaluated 65 patients with therapy-resistant depression. In total, 34 of these patients received placebo T-PEMF in the afternoon and active T-PEMF in the morning, that is, one daily dose. The remaining 31 patients received active T-PEMF twice daily. Duration of treatment was 8 weeks in both groups. The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) and the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholia Scale (MES) were used to measure remission. We also focused on the Diagnostic Apathia Scale, which is based on a mixture of items from the MINI and the HAM-D17/MES. RESULTS: In patients without apathy, the remission rate after T-PEMF was 83.9% versus 58.8% in patients with apathy (p≤0.05). In patients without apathy receiving one active dose daily 94.4% remitted versus 50% for patients with apathy (p≤0.05). In patients without apathy who received two active doses 69.9% remitted versus 66.7% for patients with apathy (p≤0.05). CONCLUSION: Taking the baseline diagnosis of the apathy syndrome into consideration, we found that in patients without apathy one daily dose of T-PEMF is sufficient, but in patients with apathy two daily doses are necessary. Including the apathy syndrome as predictor in future studies would seem to be clinically relevant.",

    "abstract": "Background Dipyrone is one of the most commonly used non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic drug. Its anti-nociceptive and hypothermic effects have long been suspected to be centrally mediated. The involvement of the most recently discovered opioid peptide, nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), and its receptor (NOP) in pain transmission is controversial. It appears to be pro-nociceptive when administered supra-spinally, but exerts anti-nociceptive effects when injected spinally or systemically. Objective Investigation of the role of the N/OFQ system in paracetamol-induced anti-nociception and hypothermia led us to determine its role in the anti-nociceptive and hypothermic effects of dipyrone. Material and Methods Hot-plate and tail-flick tests were used to assess nociception, and a rectal thermometer was used to measure rectal temperature in mice. Results Mice injected with dipyrone (150, 300, 600 mg/kg, i.p.) displayed dose-related anti-nociception and hypothermia. The NOP receptor antagonist JTC-801 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), at a dose that exerted no effect when used alone, alleviated dipyrone-induced anti-nociception but did not reverse dipyrone-induced hypothermia. Conclusion We conclude that NOP receptors participate in the anti-nociceptive, but not in the hypothermic, effects of dipyrone.",

Accumulating data suggests that neuroleptics affect peptidergic signalling in various brain structures.

Methods We assessed NPS and NPSR mRNA levels in brains of rats treated with haloperidol using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results Chronic haloperidol treatment (4 weeks) led to a striking upregulation of NPS and NPSR expression in the rat brainstem. Conversely, the NPSR mRNA expression was decreased in the hippocampus and striatum. Conclusions This stark increase of NPS in response to haloperidol treatment supports the hypothesis that this neuropeptide is involved in the dopamine-dependent anxiolytic actions of neuroleptics and possibly also in the pathophysiology of mental disorders. Furthermore, our findings underline the complex nature of potential interactions between dopamine receptors and brain peptidergic pathways, which has potential clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Cocaine is a highly addictive psychostimulant that affects synaptic activity with structural and functional adaptations of neurons. The transmembrane synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) of pre-synaptic vesicles is commonly used to measure synaptic density, as a novel approach to the detection of synaptic changes. We do not know if a single dose of cocaine suffices to affect pre-synaptic SV2A density, especially during adolescence when synapses undergo intense maturation. Here, we explored potential changes of pre-synaptic SV2A density in target brain areas associated with the cocaine-induced boost of dopaminergic neurotransmission, specifically testing if the effects would last after the return of dopamine levels to baseline. Methods: We administered cocaine (20 mg/kg i.p.) or saline to rats in early adolescence, tested their activity levels and removed the brains 1 hour and 7 days after injection. To evaluate immediate and lasting effects, we did autoradiography with [ 3 H]UCB-J, a specific tracer for SV2A, in medial prefrontal cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and dorsal and ventral areas of hippocampus. We also measured the striatal binding of [ 3 H]GBR-12935 to test cocaine’s occupancy of the dopamine transporter at both times of study. Results: We found a significant increase of [ 3 H]UCB-J binding in the dorsal and ventral sections of hippocampus 7 days after the cocaine administration compared to saline-injected rats, but no differences 1 hour after the injection. The [ 3 H]GBR-12935 binding remained unchanged at both times. Conclusion: Cocaine provoked lasting changes of hippocampal synaptic SV2A density after a single exposure during adolescence",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Cocaine-use disorder (CUD) has been associated with early life adversity and activated cellular immune responses. Women are most vulnerable to complications from chronic substance disorders, generally presenting an intense feeling of abstinence and consuming significant drug amounts. Here, we investigated neutrophil functional activities in CUD, including the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and related intracellular signalling. We also investigated the role of early life stress in inflammatory profiles. Methods: Blood samples, clinical data, and history of childhood abuse or neglect were collected at the onset of detoxification treatment of 41 female individuals with CUD and 31 healthy controls (HCs). Plasma cytokines, neutrophil phagocytosis, NETs, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and phosphorylated protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)s were assessed by flow cytometry. Results: CUD subjects had higher scores of childhood trauma than controls. Increased plasma cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-10), neutrophil phagocytosis, and production of NETs were reported in CUD subjects as compared to HC. Neutrophils of CUD subjects also produced high levels of intracellular ROS and had more activated Akt and MAPKs (p38/ERK), which are essential signalling pathways involved in cell survival and NETs production. Childhood trauma scores were significantly associated with neutrophil activation and peripheral inflammation. Conclusion: Our study reinforces that smoked cocaine and early life stress activate neutrophils in an inflammatory environment.",

Methods: We recruited 97 UK-based adults aged 18–25 years with a recent history of self-harm, measuring baseline suggestibility (Resistance to Peer Influence; RPI) and perceived ability to control urges to self-harm (using an adapted item from the Self-Efficacy to Resist Suicidal Action scale; SEASA) before and after two self-harm vignettes featuring named peers from the participant’s social network (to simulate exposure to peer non-suicidal self-harm) and after a wash-out exposure. We used paired t -tests to compare mean SEASA scores pre- and post-exposure, and linear regression to test for an association between RPI and change in SEASA scores pre- and post-exposure. Results: Perceived ability to control urges to self-harm was significantly reduced following exposure to peer self-harm ( t (96) = 4.02, p &lt; 0.001, mean difference = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.31, 0.91), but was not significantly different from baseline after exposure to a wash-out. We found no association between suggestibility and change in urges to self-harm after exposure to peer self-harm. Conclusion: Our findings support social influences on self-harm in a sample of young adults, regardless of their individual degree of suggestibility.",

    "abstract": "Cytokines (e.g. various interleukins and subfamily members, tumor necrosis factors, interferons, chemokines and growth factors) act in the brain as immunoregulators and neuromodulators. Over a decade ago, the integrative article 'Immunoregulators in the Nervous System' (Neurosci Biobehav Rev 1991; 15: 185-215) provided a comprehensive framework of pivotal issues on cytokines and the nervous system that recently have been extensively studied. Cytokine profiles in the brain, including cytokine generation and action, have been studied in multiple models associated with neuropathophysiological conditions. These include: (1) acute conditions and disorders such as stroke (cerebral ischemia or infarction and intracranial hemorrhage), traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and acute neuropathies; (2) chronic neurodegenerative disorders and chronic conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy and chronic neuropathies; (3) brain infections, including bacterial meningitis and encephalitis; (4) brain tumors; (5) neuroimmunological disorders per se, such as multiple sclerosis; (5) psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression; (6) neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations associated with non- central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as peripheral cancer, liver, kidney and metabolic compromise, and peripheral infectious and inflammatory conditions; and (7) cytokine immunotherapy, which can be accompanied by neuropsychiatric manifestations when administered either via peripheral or brain routes. Cytokine profiles have also been studied in multiple animal models challenged with inflammatory, infectious, chemical, malignant and stressor insults. Essentially data show that cytokines play a pivotal role in multiple neuropathophysiological processes associated with different types of disorders and insults. Cytokine expression and action in the brain shows a different profile across conditions, but some similarities exist. Under a defined temporal sequence, cytokine involvement in neuroprotection or the induction of a deleterious pathophysiological cascade and in resolution/healing is proposed depending on the type of cytokine. In the brain, functional interactions among cytokines, balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and functional interactions with neurotransmitters and neuropeptides play a pivotal role in the overall cytokine profile, pattern of neuropathophysiological cascades, and quality and magnitude of neuropsychiatric manifestations. In this brief review various selected cytokine-related issues with relevance to the brain are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Mood disorders are related to considerable morbidity and mortality, and although there is little doubt that they are brain-based disorders, their neural correlates still remain elusive. A neuro-anatomic model of mood regulation comprising the prefrontal cortex, amygdala-hippocampus complex, thalamus, basal ganglia, and connections among these areas has been proposed.We reviewed the evidence for regional brain abnormalities in bipolar disorder, and attempted to integrate available findings into a comprehensive pathophysiological model of illness.A computerized Medline Ovid search was conducted for the period 1966-2002, and complemented by a manual search of bibliographical references from recent reviews. Articles meeting specified criteria were included.Hyperintense lesions in cortical and subcortical regions are the most consistently reported and widely studied structural abnormalities. Smaller prefrontal cortical volume is a common finding in bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. Enlarged amygdala (in bipolar disorder) and smaller hippocampus (in unipolar depression) have been reported by several groups. Decreased volumes (in unipolar depression) and increased or unaltered volumes (in bipolar disorder) of striatal structures have been reported.Bipolar and unipolar mood disorders are associated with detectable structural brain abnormalities. The histopathology underlying such anatomical changes remains to be elucidated. To reach more definitive conclusions about neuroanatomical changes that take place during the course of mood disorders, prospective longitudinal studies are needed. Also, integration with functional imaging is necessary in order to elucidate the relevance of identified structural abnormalities.",

These psychiatric symptoms are identical to those of levodopa-induced psychosis, although these symptoms appeared before medication with anti-Parkinson drugs. The hypersensitivity of the dopamine receptor in the meso-limbic dopaminergic system has been presumed in levodopa-induced psychosis. We previously showed disturbance of the nigro-amygdaloid dopaminergic connections in DLB brains on pathological studies. Hypoperfusion or glucose hypometabolism in the occipital lobe has been demonstrated in DLB patients using SPECT or PET. The amygdala has reciprocal connections with the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. From these findings, it is supposed that the disturbance of the nigro-amygdaloid connections induces hypersensitivity of the dopamine receptor in the amygdala, causing psychiatric symptoms with dysfunction of the visuo-amygdaloid connections.",

Objective: To review the data on switching and atypical antipsychotics. Methods: A literature search was initially conducted using the key words followed by a search of relevant articles including conference abstracts; relevant pharmaceutical companies were also contacted. Results: Clinical trial data are limited in terms of parameters measured, and case reports describe specific problems. Few studies are based on real world populations of psychiatric patients over the long-term. Careful patient and drug selections matched to a carefully supervised and appropriate cross titration based upon the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of all of the drugs involved is important to avoid potential complications such as re-emergence or worsening of psychosis and withdrawal, rebound, and emergent phenomena including new or uncovered side-effects. Psychoeducation and involvement of patients and caregivers in the process are also necessary for a successful switch. Conclusion: Despite the prevalence of switching in real world clinical practice, there is a paucity of data to guide clinicians with respect to effective and safe strategies. There are no criteria defining a successful switch. With the increasing range and formulations of atypical antipsychotics available, there is a rationale for their early use to avoid the practical problems associated with switching from conventional antipsychotics as well as the opportunity to maintain patients on an optimal atypical antipsychotic monotherapy.",

This is also associated with an increased number of suicide risk factors. Objective: The current study examined the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of a number of alcohol-dependent patients who attempted suicide. Methods: We studied a consecutive series of 377 alcohol-dependent patients in our in-patient clinics. Their alcohol-use histories were assessed through semistructured interviews. The Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were administered to all patients. Serum total cholesterol levels, mean corpuscular volume, the liver enzymes gamma glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were routinely measured. In the statistical analyses, Student's t -test and chi-squared tests were applied. Results: Of the 377 alcohol-dependent patients, 89 (23.6%) had histories of attempted suicide. Thirty-four (42.5%) of the 80 female alcohol-dependent patients and 55 (18.5%) of the 297 male alcohol-dependent patients had attempted suicide; this gender difference was statistically significant (χ 2 = 27.7, P &lt; 0.001). A greater proportion of the suicide attempters than of the non-attempters met the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV criteria for another psychiatric disorder (60.6%, n = 54, vs. 40.6%, n = 117; χ 2 = 14.8; df = 6; P &lt; 0.05).

Conclusion: These results suggest that suicide attempts in alcohol-dependent patients are associated with more profound biopsychosocial pathology and decreased serum cholesterol levels.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To critically examine the relationship between evolutionary and developmental influences on human neocortex and the properties of the conscious mind it creates. Methods: Using PubMed searches and the bibliographies of several monographs, we selected 50 key works, which offer empirical support for a novel understanding of the organization of the neocortex. Results: The cognitive gulf between humans and our closest primate relatives has usually been taken as evidence that our brains evolved crucial new mechanisms somehow conferring advanced capacities, particularly in association areas of the neocortex. In this overview of neocortical development and comparative brain morphometry, we propose an alternative view: that an increase in neocortical size, alone, could account for novel and powerful cognitive capabilities. Other than humans’ very large brain in relation to the body weight, the morphometric relations between neocortex and all other brain regions show remarkably consistent exponential ratios across the range of primate species, including humans. For an increase in neocortical size to produce new abilities, the developmental mechanisms of neocortex would need to be able to generate an interarchy of functionally diverse cortical domains in the absence of explicit specification, and in this respect, the mammalian neocortex is unique: its relationship to the rest of the nervous system is unusually plastic, allowing great changes in cortical organization to occur in relatively short periods of evolution. The fact that even advanced abilities like self-recognition have arisen in species from different mammalian orders suggests that expansion of the neocortex quite naturally generates new levels of cognitive sophistication. Our cognitive and behavioural sophistication may, therefore, be attributable to these intrinsic mechanisms’ ability to generate complex interarchies when the neocortex reaches a sufficient size. Conclusion: Our analysis offers a parsimonious explanation for key properties of the human mind based on evolutionary influences and developmental processes. This view is perhaps surprising in its simplicity, but offers a fresh perspective on the evolutionary basis of mental complexity.",

The aim of the present study was to test these hypotheses using plasma norepinephrine (NE) as a noradrenergic parameter, and recall of the prerecency part of neutral valence word lists as a measure of effortful retrieval.Area under the curve (AUC) of morning, midday and afternoon plasma CORT and plasma NE concentrations was related to two measures of recall performance, ie summated recall scores of the prerecency and recency parts of three word lists, and to the stage of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR).Partial correlation between each hormone AUC value and prerecency recall performance, controlling for the effect of the other hormone, showed opposite relations between recall and either plasma CORT or NE. Similar stronger correlations were found with the CDR score.Plasma CORT and NE are oppositely related with effortful retrieval and the stage of progression in AD.",

This study examined whether highs lasting minutes or hours differed from longer highs in terms of clinical features and symptom severity. It also examined whether duration of highs predicted bipolar disorder being diagnosed.A total of 518 subjects with significant episodes of depression and 'highs' completed a web-based self-report questionnaire. Those who reported their longest highs lasting minutes or hours were compared with those who reported longer durations of highs on a range of clinical variables and measures of symptom severity.Subjects whose highs lasted minutes or hours reported clinical features and severity of symptoms similar to those whose highs lasted 3-7 days. However, the odds of being diagnosed with bipolar disorder for those with highs lasting 3-7 days were almost three times higher than for those whose highs lasted minutes or hours.The 4-day DSM-IV minimum-duration criteria for hypomania may lead to failure to diagnose subjects with brief highs who have true bipolar disorder and thus should be reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "There are considerable data on the possible association between streptococcal infection and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), particularly the relation between Sydenham's chorea (SC) and OCD. However, neuropsychiatric sequelae related to streptococcal infection are mainly reported in children. In this preliminary study, we examined prevalence of OCD in a group of adult subjects with established rheumatic heart disease (RHD). We hypothesized that the rate of OCD would be higher than the known general population rates.One hundred adult subjects with RHD were evaluated for OCD and other comorbid psychiatric disorders using well-known psychiatric assessment tools. A qualified psychiatrist conducted the assessments. The diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV criteria.The rate of clinical OCD and subclinical OCD was 10% and 3%, respectively (n = 13), a rate much higher than the 1-3% rate reported in general population. Of the 13 subjects, only three had a history of SC (23%).OCD could be a long-term sequel in adults with a history of rheumatic fever in childhood, even in the absence of frank chorea. The findings call for systematic research in this little explored area.",

Melancholic symptoms as assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and outcomes with and without electroconvulsive therapy on an in-patient mood disorders unit.We investigated whether 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HamD24)-based melancholia ratings correlated with treatment outcome, with special focus on whether electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was used in depressed patients treated on an in-patient mood disorders unit.We analysed the data on ECT- versus non-ECT-treated patients' outcomes relative to melancholia subscale scores. Two HamD24-based melancholia rating scale scores were computed for 201 depressed in-patients at admission and discharge. Baseline melancholia ratings were analysed to see if they correlated with improvement in total HamD24 scores. We also tested to see if the melancholia subscales followed unimodal or bimodal distributions.Melancholic symptoms as assessed by one of the HamD24-based subscales directly correlated with overall improvement. Although ECT treatment was associated with greater improvement than was noted in non-ECT-treated patients, severity of melancholia ratings did not affect this relationship. Finally, both melancholia subscale scores followed approximately unimodal distributions.HamD24-based methods to assess severity of melancholic symptoms have limited clinical utility on an in-patient mood disorders unit in general, and for predicting ECT response in particular. Furthermore, these methods do not seem to identify bimodal populations of depressed patients (i.e. melancholic vs. non-melancholic).",

We measured the number of correct and incorrect choices. We also assessed the number and the distribution of fixations, the scanning time in specific regions of interest (ROIs) and the head movements during the encoding of the stimuli. The distributions of fixations and scanning time in definite ROIs during the discrimination of the correct pattern from the foils were also measured.Patients recognised fewer correct patterns than controls. Correct trials in patients were characterised by a specific exploration of the central part of the stimulus during its presentation, whereas this feature was absent in incorrect trials. However, the scanning time and the numbers of fixations and head movements during encoding were similar in both groups and unrelated to recognition accuracy. In both groups, correct trials were associated with a selective exploration of the correct pattern amongst the six possibilities during recognition. Furthermore, patients gave more attention to incorrect patterns with a leftmost element identical to that of the correct response and also those approximating its global structure.Patients showed a VSWM deficit independent of oculomotor dysfunctions and head movements during encoding. Patients' correct trials were related to specific scanning during encoding and discrimination phases. Analysis of these patterns suggests that patients try to compensate for reduced VSWM ability by using specific encoding strategies.",

We investigated the correlations between serum levels of lipid peroxidation markers and those in brain samples in different stress models. Methods Animals ( n = 96) were divided equally into eight groups: a control group and groups treated with vitamin E (Vit E); exposed to immobilisation stress; exposed to immobilisation stress and treated with Vit E; exposed to cold stress; exposed to cold stress and treated with Vit E; exposed to both immobilisation and cold stress; and a final group exposed to both immobilisation and cold stress and treated with Vit E. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) in brain samples and levels of TBARS, corticosterone, conjugated dienes (CD), lipids, and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity in serum were analysed. Results Serum corticosterone ( p &lt; 0.001), CD ( p &lt; 0.05), lipid ( p &lt; 0.05) levels, and brain TBARS ( p &lt; 0.05) levels were significantly higher in all stress groups than in controls, and the elevated levels were reversed in the Vit E-treated stress groups ( p &lt; 0.05). Serum PON1 activity was not different among the groups ( p &gt; 0.05). Serum TBARS levels increased significantly in all stress groups ( p &lt; 0.05), but this elevation was only reversed in the group exposed to both immobilisation and cold stress and treated with Vit E ( p &lt; 0.001).

Describe clinical problems in treating a patient with psychotic symptoms during pregnancy by presenting a case report, and review the current evidence on antipsychotic drugs during pregnancy. The review consists of a non-systematic clinical review of current data on treatment with antipsychotics during pregnancy. The case, a 27 year old female initially diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a rape and emotionally unstable personality disorder, illustrates some of the common challenges a clinician meets. The patient initially discontinues all treatment as she is unsure if the drugs could have a teratogenic effect and is changed to a treatment that is regarded as safe during pregnancy. The current data supports treatment with chlorpromazine although there is a risk of side effects, e.g. extrapyramidal symptoms and hypotension, but also treatment with olanzapine and risperidone. If the patient is currently treated with clozapine, this treatment should be continued, due to clozapines unique efficacy profile. Blood monitoring for six months after birth is recommended when the newborn has been exposed to clozapine treatment. Current evidence on treatment with antipsychotics during pregnancy is sparse, but not treating is associated with increased risks compared to treatment.",

Impact of neuropsychiatry screening in neurological in-patients: comparison with routine clinical practice Background: It is now well recognised that the rate of psychiatric comorbidity is high in patients with neurological disorders. Psychiatric comorbidity has a significant impact on quality of life and often goes undetected in routine clinical practice. Objectives: To compare the rate of detection of psychiatric illness in routine clinical practice with the prevalence of mental illness established using a dedicated screening programme at a regional neuroscience centre and to assess if the screening programme had any enduring impact on routine clinical practice after its completion. Methods: Consecutive admissions to a neurology ward in the 3-month period before ( n = 160) and after ( n = 158) a dedicated neuropsychiatric screening programme was carried out were identified. Case notes were then reviewed to establish if symptoms of mental illness were identified by the treating neurologists and if patients were referred for neuropsychiatric assessment. Rates of detection of neuropsychiatric problems and rates of referral for treatment were compared with those identified during the screening programme. Results: In routine clinical practice, over two 3-month study periods, psychiatric symptoms were identified in 23.7% of patients and only 10.6% received neuropsychiatric interventions. This is much lower as compared with rates identified (51.3%) and treated (51.3%) during dedicated screening. Detection of mood symptoms decreased from 14.7% pre-screening to 3.8% in the post-screening period. Conclusion: Rate of detection and treatment of neuropsychiatric problems remain low in neurology in-patients in routine clinical practice. Neuropsychiatric screening is effective but does not have sustained effect once it stops. Hence we suggest that active ongoing screening should be incorporated into routine practice.",

    "abstract": "Comorbid personality pathologies may affect the outcome of patients with major depression (MD). The dopamine transporter gene DAT1 (SLC6A3) has been suggested to play a role in both depression and specific personality traits. The aim of this study was to assess five polymorphisms of the DAT1 gene (rs2550948, rs2975226, rs6347, rs27072, and 3'-VNTR) to determine whether this gene influences personality traits in patients with MD or its subgroups.The DAT1 polymorphisms were analysed in 463 unrelated Han Chinese MD patients. The personality traits, novelty seeking (NS), and harm avoidance (HA), were examined using the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. The patients were also divided into four clinical subgroups on the basis of differences in their sex (male or female) and age at disease onset (early or late).There was no association between the DAT1 gene and either NS or HA in the total MD sample or in the sex-based subgroups. However, early-onset MD patients with the G/G genotype of rs2550948 and the T/T genotype of rs2975226 had lower NS scores than did patients with the other genotypes (p corrected = 0.05 for rs2550948 and p corrected = 0.005 for rs2975226).Our study suggests that DAT1 promoter variants possibly influence specific personality traits in the early-onset subgroup of depressed patients in the Han Chinese population. Further prospective cohort studies are required to verify our preliminary finding and to confirm the effects of personality susceptibility on long-term disease outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Objective Behavioural symptoms are common in moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are improved by memantine with the most pronounced effect on agitation/aggression. Dextromethorphan in combination with quinidine is the only drug approved by US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) on the basis of efficacy in patients with multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of memantine on PBA in patients with AD. Methods In a prospective, double-blind, case-control study to assess PBA with pathological laughter and crying scale patients were administered memantine (final dose of 20 mg daily) or citalopram (20 mg once daily), each for 10 weeks. The number of episodes of involuntary emotional expression, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Overt Aggression Scale-Modified (OAS-M) total scores were also recorded. Furthermore, the platelet serotonin (5-HT) concentration was measured. Results Although memantine had beneficial effects on PBA, it also had a crucial impact on behavioural symptoms, especially aggression and agitation (to an average of 3.5 times higher end-point scores on OAS-M and increase of NPI total scores for an average of 114% of initial value). Therefore, the study was prematurely stopped. In addition, we had evidenced a drop of platelet 5-HT concentration (to an average of 73% of initial value). Conclusion Surprisingly, our research showed the opposite action of memantine on neuropsychiatric symptoms as expected. In a limited number of AD patients with PBA, memantine had a beneficial effect on involuntary emotional expression, but it potentiated agitation/aggression, irritability and caused a crucial drop of the platelet 5-HT concentration.",

Recent hypotheses suggest that changes in neurogenesis and plasticity may underlie the aetiology of depression. The hippocampus is affected by depression and shows neuronal remodelling during adulthood. Objective: The present study on the adult rat hippocampus, was to evaluate the dose-related effects of chronic venlafaxine on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (pCREB). Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a variety of chronic unpredictable stressors (CUSs) to establish a depression model. Rats were treated for either 14 or 28 days with venlafaxine (5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). The hippocampal expression of pCREB and BDNF mRNA and protein was assessed by using immunohistochemistry, western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Rats subjected to CUS procedure consumed less sucrose solution compared with non-stressed rats. The CUS influenced exploratory activity resulting in a reduction of the motility counts. Chronic low dose (5 mg/kg, 14 and 28 days), but not high dose (10 mg/kg, 14 and 28 days) of venlafaxine treatment increased the expression of pCREB and BDNF mRNA and protein in the CUS rat hippocampus. Conclusion: Neuronal plasticity-associated proteins such as pCREB and BDNF play an important role both in stress-related depression and in antidepressant effect.",

    "abstract": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been widely used in the treatment of most anxiety disorders. In this study, to clarify the mechanism of the anxiolytic effect, we investigated the mechanism underlying the effect of the SSRI citalopram on rat contextual conditioned fear stress (CFS), an animal model of anxiety.Rats individually received footshocks in a shock chamber. More than 1 day later, they were given citalopram and/or dl-p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), various subtype-selective serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists: the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635, the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL 100907, the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB 242084, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron, the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist GR 125487, the 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB 258585 or the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB 269970. After drug administration, freezing behaviour, which was used as an index of anxiety, was analysed in the same shock chamber without shocks.Citalopram dose dependently reduced conditioned freezing behaviour. The anxiolytic-like effect of citalopram was prevented completely by pretreatment with the 5-HT-depleting agent PCPA, but not by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635. Furthermore, none of the subtype-selective 5-HT receptor antagonists significantly affected conditioned freezing or affected the anxiolytic-like effect of citalopram.The anxiolytic-like effect of citalopram in contextual CFS model depends on 5-HT availability. In addition, contextual CFS model is suggested to be completely different from conventional anxiety models in neural mechanism or manners of serotonergic involvement. However, further studies are needed to identify the pharmacological mechanisms responsible for the anxiolytic-like effect of citalopram.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoietin (EPO) has been suggested to improve metabolism and also cognition, but human studies are scarce. This randomised controlled trial aimed to investigate whether EPO treatment influences body composition and fat and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting glucose, and whether these changes would be associated with previous observed cognitive benefits of EPO. METHOD: In total, 84 non-obese patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression or bipolar disorder in remission were randomised to 8 weekly EPO (40,000 IU) or saline (NaCl 0.9%) infusions in a double-blind, parallel-group design. Patients underwent dual X-ray absorptiometry scans at baseline and week 14 (6 weeks after treatment completion). Cognitive measures were assessed and fasting levels of cholesterol, lipoprotein fractions, triacylglycerides, glucose and HbA1c were obtained at baseline, week 9 and follow-up week 14. RESULTS: In total, 79 patients had complete pre- and post-treatment data (EPO: N=40, saline: N=39). EPO had no cumulative effect on body composition and markers of fat metabolism. The EPO-treated group exhibited significantly lower HbA1c levels after 8 weeks treatment [F(1, 80)=8.51, p=0.005], however, 6 weeks after treatment termination a significantly higher fasting glucose levels [F(1, 79)=5.85, p=0.02] and HbA1c levels [F(1, 79)=5.85, p=0.02] were seen. The latter increase in HbA1c was further significantly correlated with a better cognitive outcome on verbal memory (r=0.25, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: Repeated EPO infusions had no cumulative effect on body composition in this cohort of patients with affective disorders, however, EPO modulated HbA1c and fasting glucose and this was associated with patients' improvement of verbal memory.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives NMDA antagonists and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors induce antidepressant-like effects and may represent treatment options for depression. The behavioural effects of NMDA antagonists seem to depend on Tyrosine kinase B receptor (TrkB) activation by BDNF and on mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, it is unknown whether similar mechanisms are involved in the behavioural effects of NOS inhibitors. Therefore, this work aimed at determining the role of TrkB and mTOR signalling in the prelimbic area of the ventral mPFC (vmPFC-PL) in the antidepressant-like effect of NOS inhibitors. Methods Pharmacological treatment with LY235959 or ketamine (NMDA antagonists), NPA or 7-NI (NOS inhibitors), BDNF, K252a (Trk antagonist) and rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) injected systemically or into vmPFC-PL followed by behavioural assessment. Results We found that bilateral injection of BDNF into the vmPFC-PL induced an antidepressant-like effect, which was blocked by pretreatment with K252a and rapamycin. Microinjection of LY 235959 into the vmPFC-PL induced antidepressant-like effect that was suppressed by local rapamycin but not by K252a pretreatment. Microinjection of NPA induced an antidepressant-like effect insensitive to both K252a and rapamycin. Similarly, the antidepressant-like effects of a systemic injection of ketamine or 7-NI were not affected by blockade of mTOR or Trk receptors in the vmPFC-PL. Conclusion Our data support the hypothesis that NMDA blockade induces an antidepressant-like effect that requires mTOR but not Trk signalling into the vmPFC-PL. The antidepressant-like effect induced by local NOS inhibition is independent on both Trk and mTOR signalling in the vmPFC-PL.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To explore whether and how group cognitive-behavioural therapy (GCBT) plus medication differs from medication alone for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods: Hundred and seventy patients were randomly assigned to the GCBT plus duloxetine ( n =89) or duloxetine group ( n =81). The primary outcomes were Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) response and remission rates. The explorative secondary measures included score reductions from baseline in the HAMA total, psychic, and somatic anxiety subscales (HAMA-PA, HAMA-SA), the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Severity Subscale of Clinical Global Impression Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning, and the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 4-week, 8-week, and 3-month follow-up. Results: At 4 weeks, HAMA response (GCBT group 57.0% vs. control group 24.4%, p =0.000, Cohen’s d= 0.90) and remission rates (GCBT group 21.5% vs. control group 6.2%, p =0.004; d =0.51), and most secondary outcomes (all p &lt;0.05, d =0.36−0.77) showed that the combined therapy was superior. At 8 weeks, all the primary and secondary significant differences found at 4 weeks were maintained with smaller effect sizes ( p &lt;0.05, d= 0.32−0.48). At 3-month follow-up, the combined therapy was only significantly superior in the HAMA total ( p &lt;0.045, d =0.43) and HAMA-PA score reductions ( p &lt;0.001, d =0.77). Logistic regression showed superiority of the combined therapy for HAMA response rates [odds ratio (OR)=2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02−4.42, p =0.04] and remission rates (OR=2.80, 95% CI 1.27−6.16, p =0.01). Conclusions: Compared with duloxetine alone, GCBT plus duloxetine showed significant treatment response for GAD over a shorter period of time, particularly for psychic anxiety symptoms, which may suggest that GCBT was effective in changing cognitive style.",

    "abstract": "Obesity represents a tremendous global health problem. Studies over the past decade have suggested that food addiction (FA), that is, physical cravings for certain foods - high in fat/sugar - and addiction-like overeating of these types of food, is a likely contributor to the obesity epidemic. While FA has been studied extensively, there are some significant gaps in the literature that need to be addressed: (I) Most estimates of the prevalence of FA are based on nonprobability sampling, which significantly limits the representativeness of the prevalence estimates. (II) Although addiction disorders are prevalent among individuals with mental disorders, large studies of FA among patients with clinically diagnosed mental disorders are lacking. (III) Most addiction disorders are heritable, but the familial transmission of FA remains virtually unknown. (IV) Due to a relative lack of longitudinal studies, little is known about the risk factors for and outcomes of FA. To close these gaps in the literature, we designed the Food Addiction Denmark (FADK) Project. The FADK study is a nationwide survey with retrospective and prospective register-based elements. Four randomly sampled cohorts were invited to participate in the survey: 5000 adults and 3750 adolescents from the general population and 5000 adults and 3529 adolescents with a mental disorder. The FADK questionnaire includes the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 and rating scales measuring psychopathology. Data from Danish health and socio-economic registers will be linked to all invitees. We expect that the FADK Project will contribute significantly to our understanding of FA.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The past decade has seen a surge of reports and investigations into cases of autoimmune-mediated encephalitis. The increasing recognition of these disorders is especially of relevance to the fields of neurology and psychiatry. Autoimmune encephalitis involves antibodies against synaptic receptors, neuronal cell surface proteins and intracellular targets. These disorders feature prominent symptoms of cognitive impairment and behavioural changes, often associated with the presence of seizures. Early in the clinical course, autoimmune encephalitis may manifest as psychiatric symptoms of psychosis and involve psychiatry as an initial point of contact. Although commonly associated with malignancy, these disorders can present in the absence of an inciting neoplasm. The identification of autoimmune encephalitis is of clinical importance as a large proportion of individuals experience a response to immunotherapy. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge on n -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptor-associated encephalitis and limbic encephalitis, the latter predominantly involving antibodies against the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor and leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) protein. In addition, we briefly describe anti-dopamine D2 receptor encephalitis. A summary of the literature will focus on common clinical presentations and course, diagnostic approaches and response to treatment. Since a substantial proportion of patients with autoimmune encephalitis exhibit symptoms of psychosis, the relevance of this disorder to theories of psychosis and schizophrenia will also be discussed.",

The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on NMDAR-related amino acids remains unknown. We aim to investigate the effects of rTMS on NMDAR-related amino acids in serum of post-stroke patients. Methods: Ninety-five consecutive post-stroke patients with upper limb hemiparesis were recruited. In 27 patients, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score was 10 or higher. Twelve depressed patients underwent rehabilitation in combination with rTMS and 15 non-depressed patients underwent rehabilitation only without rTMS for 14 days. 1 Hz rTMS was applied to the primary motor area in the non-lesional hemisphere. BDI was conducted before and after treatment. Serum glutamine, glutamate, glycine, l -serine, and d -serine levels were measured before and after treatment. Results: There were no differences between depressed patients and non-depressed patients in clinical characteristics, levels of the five amino acids in serum, and the ratio of amino acids. However, in 27 depressed patients, there was a significant correlation between levels of glutamate in serum and BDI ( ρ = 0.428, p = 0.026). BDI decreased significantly in depressed patients after treatment with or without rTMS. d -serine decreased in the rehabilitation with rTMS group, but increased in the rehabilitation without rTMS group. l -serine increased in the rehabilitation with rTMS group, but decreased in the rehabilitation without rTMS group. Conclusion: The results suggest that rTMS can modulate NMDAR-related amino acids in blood, producing beneficial effects.",

One complexity that warrants consideration is the male-specific impacts of the pandemic within adolescence. Methods: A review of the relevant literature. Results: Matters of social distancing, virtual education, and substance use may impact adolescent men in fashions that raise their suicide risk more significantly relative to adolescent women. Social distancing may impact adolescents’ friendships and generate a regression back to the nuclear family; qualities of male adolescents’ friendships and of masculinity suggest that these impacts may be more severe in adolescent men and may directly raise suicide risk. Virtual schooling yields educational and social setbacks; losses of team sports, male mentors, and the implications of diminished educational advancement may more adversely affect adolescent men and raise risk. Substance use has increased in the pandemic, particularly amongst adolescent men. There are direct associations with suicide risk as well as indirectly through increased parental conflict and punishment. Conclusion: As adolescent men die by suicide at significantly elevated rates relative to adolescent women, a male-specific consideration of these impacts is indicated to address adolescent suicide in our current era. Recommendations are made for integrating these considerations into updated adolescent suicide risk assessment and prevention efforts.",

In view of the dysregulated NPY system in depression, we also studied NPY in young and old FSL to explore the temporal trajectory of depressive-like–ageing interaction. Sirt1 , Sirt2 and Npy mRNA were determined using qRT-PCR in prefrontal cortex (PFC) from young and old FSL and FRL, and in hippocampi from young FSL and FRL. PFC : Sirt1 expression was decreased in FSL ( p = 0.001). An interaction between age and genotype was found ( p = 0.032); young FSL had lower Sirt1 with respect to both age ( p = 0.026) and genotype ( p = 0.001). Sirt2 was lower in FSL ( p = 0.003). Npy mRNA was downregulated in FSL ( p = 0.001) but did not differ between the young and old rat groups. Hippocampus: Sirt1 was reduced in young FSL compared to young FRL ( p = 0.005). There was no difference in Sirt2 between FSL and FRL. Npy levels were decreased in hippocampus of young FSL compared to young FRL ( p = 0.003). Effects of ageing could not be investigated due to loss of samples. To conclude, i this is the first demonstration that SIRT1 and SIRT2 are changed in brain of FSL, a rat model of depression; ii the changes are age-dependent; iii sirtuins are potential targets for treatment of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore effects of adjunctive minocycline treatment on inflammatory and neurogenesis markers in major depressive disorder (MDD). Serum samples were collected from a randomised, placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial of minocycline (200 mg/day, added to treatment as usual) for adults (n = 71) experiencing MDD to determine changes in interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). General Estimate Equation modelling explored moderation effects of baseline markers and exploratory analyses investigated associations between markers and clinical outcomes. There was no difference between adjunctive minocycline or placebo groups at baseline or week 12 in the levels of IL-6 (week 12; placebo 2.06 ± 1.35 pg/ml; minocycline 1.77 ± 0.79 pg/ml; p = 0.317), LBP (week 12; placebo 3.74 ± 0.95 µg/ml; minocycline 3.93 ± 1.33 µg/ml; p = 0.525) or BDNF (week 12; placebo 24.28 ± 6.69 ng/ml; minocycline 26.56 ± 5.45 ng/ml; p = 0.161). Higher IL-6 levels at baseline were a predictor of greater clinical improvement. Exploratory analyses suggested that the change in IL-6 levels were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms (HAMA; p = 0.021) and quality of life (Q-LES-Q-SF; p = 0.023) scale scores. No other clinical outcomes were shown to have this mediation effect, nor did the other markers (LBP or BDNF) moderate clinical outcomes. There were no overall changes in IL-6, LBP or BDNF following adjunctive minocycline treatment. Exploratory analyses suggest a potential role of IL-6 on mediating anxiety symptoms with MDD. Future trials may consider enrichment of recruitment by identifying several markers or a panel of factors to better represent an inflammatory phenotype in MDD with larger sample size.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, many case reports and case series dealt with new-onset psychotic disorders in patients either infected with SARS-CoV-2 or thematically linked to the pandemic, but without an infection. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive collection of these reports to illustrate the nature of these psychoses. Methods: We conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, using search terms regarding first-episode psychotic disorders in the context of corona. Results: 96 case reports or case series covering 146 patients (62 without and 84 with SARS-CoV-2 infection) were found. Compared to patients without infection, patients with infection showed significantly more often visual hallucinations (28.6% vs 8.1%), confusion (36.9% vs 11.3%), an acute onset of illness (88.5% vs 59.6%) and less often depression (13.1% vs 35.5%) and a delusional content related to the pandemic (29.5% vs 78.3%). Both groups had an equally favourable outcome with a duration of psychosis ≤2 weeks in half and full remission in two-thirds of patients. In patients with infection, signs of inflammation were reported in 78.3% and increased CRP in 58.6%. While reports on patients with infection are continuously published, no report about patients without infection was found after July 2020. Conclusion: Cases without infection were considered reactive and originated all from the first wave of the corona pandemic. In cases with infection, inflammation was considered as the main pathogenetic factor but was not found in all patients. Diagnosis was impeded by the overlap of psychosis with delirium.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has prolonged asymptomatic or mild symptomatic periods. Given that there is an increase in treatment options and that early intervention could modify the disease course, it is desirable to devise biological indices that may differentiate AD and nonAD at mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage.Based on two well-acknowledged observations of background slowing (attenuation in alpha power and enhancement in theta and delta powers) and early involvement of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, a neural hub of default-mode network), this study devised novel neural markers, namely, spectral ratios of alpha1 to delta and alpha1 to theta in the PCC.We analysed 46 MCI patients, with 22 ADMCI and 24 nonADMCI who were matched in age, education, and global cognitive capability. Concordant with the prediction, the regional spectral ratios were lower in the ADMCI group, suggesting its clinical application potential.Previous research has verified that neural markers derived from clinical electroencephalography may be informative in differentiating AD from other neurological conditions. We believe that the spectral ratios in the neural hubs that show early pathological changes can enrich the instrumental assessment of brain dysfunctions at the MCI (or pre-clinical) stage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Paediatric bipolar disorder – bipolar disorder occurring in prepubertal children – is a diagnosis subject to considerable controversy. Whilst historically considered to be very rare, proponents since the 1990s have argued that mania can present differently in children and, as such, is much more common than previously thought. Such proposals raise questions about the validity of proposed phenotypes and potential risks of iatrogenic harm. Methods: I critically examine the construct of paediatric bipolar disorder using Robins and Guze’s (1970, American Journal of Psychiatry 126 , 983–987) influential criteria for the validity of a psychiatric diagnosis. I review, in turn, evidence relating to its clinical description, delimitation from other conditions, follow-up studies, family studies, laboratory studies, and treatment response. Results: Across domains, existing research highlights significant challenges establishing the diagnosis. This includes significant heterogeneity in operationalising criteria for children; variable or poor inter-rater reliability; difficulty distinguishing paediatric bipolar disorder from other conditions; large differences in rates of diagnosis between the United States of America and other countries; limited evidence of continuity with adult forms; and a lack of evidence for proposed paediatric phenotypes in children at genetic high-risk of the condition. Laboratory and treatment studies are limited, but also do not provide support for the construct. Conclusions: Evidence for the more widespread existence of paediatric bipolar disorder and its various proposed phenotypes remains weak. The ongoing popularity of the diagnosis, most evident in America, may reflect social pressures and broader limitations in psychiatric nosology. The uncertainty around the diagnosis highlights the need for careful longitudinal assessment of children potentially affected.",

Methodology: Patients with first-episode schizophrenia ( n = 21) in remission ( n = 35) or with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) ( n = 35) and 36 healthy controls were evaluated for retinal thickness. Results: Patients with psychotic illnesses had significantly lower sub-foveal choroidal thickness (effect size 0.84–0.86), when compared to the healthy controls. When patients with first-episode schizophrenia were compared with patients with TRS, TRS patients had significant lower sub-foveal choroidal thickness (left eye) when the various confounders (such as age, gender, duration of treatment, smoking, current medications, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, HbA1c, presence or absence of metabolic syndrome) were taken into account. When the patients with TRS were compared with healthy controls, initially significant differences were observed for the macular volume (left and right) and the ganglion cell thickness (right eye) but these differences disappeared after controlling for the various covariates. Conclusions: Compared to healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia, psychotic illnesses have thinning of the retina, especially in the sub-foveal choroidal thickness.",

Twenty-three healthy subjects matched by age, gender and season acted as the control group. Psychopathology was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Serum s100b levels were determined at 12:00 and 24:00 h with an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit.Patients had significant higher serum s100b levels at admission and discharge (12:00 h) than the group of healthy subjects. At admission and discharge, s100b serum levels at 24 h had decreased compared to the 24:00 h s100b levels of the healthy subjects. At 3MAHD patients and healthy subjects had similar levels of serum s100b protein. Positive and negative PANSS scores decreased significantly between admission and discharge. Positive and negative PANSS scores decreased between discharge and 3MAHD, but these changes had no statistical significance.Our study confirms that the acute inflammatory response produced in acutely relapsed patients is reversed after 3 month of hospital discharge. The variations of serum s100b concentrations when the patients suffer from an acute relapse may be a useful predictor of disease evolution.",

    "abstract": "Activity of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons, the major noradrenergic cell-body group in the brain whose axons give rise to approximately 70% of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, is believed to play an important role in attention/vigilance, cognitive functions and behavioral disorders, particularly depression. Results described here show that in the rat, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a bacterial endotoxin) causes long-lasting changes in electrophysiological activity of LC neurons that are mediated by interleukin-1 (IL-1) acting locally in the LC region. First, it was found that IL-1, when microinjected into the LC region or stimulated/expressed in that brain region, increased activity of LC neurons. The only exception to this was that a very low dose of microinjected IL-1 (5 pg) decreased LC activity, which could be blocked by an antagonist to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), thus suggesting that the decrease was due to IL-1 stimulation of CRH release. All of these effects could be blocked by injection and/or infusion of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) specifically into the LC region. Next, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a low dose of LPS(10 µg/kg or 100 ng/kg) was also found to increase LC activity. The excitation of LC produced by 10 µg/kg i.p. LPS increased progressively for at least 1 week, with LC neurons firing at more than twice their normal rate at 1 week after the i.p. LPS injection. Alteration of LC activity lasted for 3 weeks after a single i.p. injection of 10 µg/kg LPS. The effects of i.p. LPS on LC activity at any time after i.p. injection could be blocked by a brief microinfusion of IL-1RA into the LC region, thereby indicating that changes in LC activity seen after the i.p. LPS were caused by IL-1 acting in the LC region. Finally, i.p. injection of peptidoglycan, representing gram-positive bacteria, and polyinsinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I):(C)], representing viral infection, also caused increases in LC activity, and the effects of peptidoglycan [but not those of poly(I):(C)] were blocked by microinfusion of IL-1RA into LC. These findings suggest that bacterial infections can give rise to prolonged changes in brain activity through cytokine action in brain.",

The free radical metabolism, glycoconjugate metabolism and RBC membrane composition were also assessed.Membrane Na+-K+ ATPase activity and serum magnesium levels were decreased while HMG-CoA reductase activity and serum digoxin levels were increased in CFS. There were increased levels of tryptophan catabolites - nicotine, strychnine, quinolinic acid and serotonin - and decreased levels of tyrosine catabolites -dopamine, norepinephrine and morphine - in CFS. There was an increase in dolichol levels, carbohydrate residues of glycoproteins, glycolipids, total/individual glycosaminoglycans (GAG) fractions and lysosomal enzymes in CFS. Reduced levels of ubiquinone, reduced glutathione and free radical scavenging enzymes as well as increased lipid peroxidation products and nitric oxide were noticed in CFS. The biochemical patterns in CFS correlated with those obtained in right hemispheric dominance.The role of hypothalamic digoxin and neurotransmitter-induced immune activation, altered glycoconjugate metabolism and resultant defective viral antigen presentation, NMDA excitotoxicity and cognitive and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CFS is stressed.

The atypical compound opipramol is very often used to treat SD and GAD in clinical practice in Germany. However, state-of-the-art controlled clinical trials have not yet been performed.Two clinical trials were performed with the aim of confirming the efficacy and tolerability of opipramol in SD and GAD.Both trials were performed as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies. While the GAD trial was a three-arm study with opipramol (200 mg/day) vs. placebo and alprazolam (2 mg/day) for 28 days, the SD trial was a placebo-controlled two-arm study with a treatment duration of 42 days. Each group consisted of about 100 patients.Significant differences (alpha = 0.05) were found for the primary efficacy criteria (HAMA total score in GAD, HAMA somatic subscore in SD) and most of the secondary criteria in favor of the active drug therapies. Considerable differences between the psychopathology of SD and GAD were detected.The well-tolerated anxiolytic opipramol is the first psychotropic drug with proven efficacy in somatoform disorders with effects on symptoms of somatization, anxiety, and depression.

    "abstract": "A novel theory on the pathophysiology of depression would be expected to resolve a contradiction between therapeutic time lag and monoamine hypothesis. On the basis of the fact that a subgroup of depression appears during or after stress, we exposed rats to a long-term (2 weeks) forced walking stress and produced depression-model rats in one group and spontaneous recovery rats in another. The density of axon terminals of the locus coeruleus (LC) neurons in the frontal cortex stained by dopamine β-hydroxylase antiserum was lower in the depression-model rats than in the spontaneous recovery rats and in the control rats without stress. The density was higher in the model rats daily treated with imipramine than in those treated with saline. Morphological projection (MP) index (a percentage of horseradish peroxidase-positive LC cells in total number of LC cells) and electrophysiological projection index (a percentage of LC neurons activated antidromically by electrical stimulation of the cerebral cortex) were lower in the depression-model rats than in the recovery and control rats. MP index was higher in the imipramine-treated rats than that in the saline-treated rats. Electron microscopic examination of the LC disclosed such degenerative changes as low-dense areas without structure, aggregation of intracellular organs, destroyed membranes around the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), a decreased number of deformed subsurface cisterns, glia invaginated into the LC neurons and prominent appearance of microglia containing increased number of lipofustin or lysosome in the model rats, but not in the spontaneous recovery rats. These findings suggest that the terminals and cell bodies of the LC noradrenergic neurons degenerate in the stress-induced depression-model rats and regenerate in the imipramine-treated model rats. This degenerative change may possibly contribute to the decrease in synthesis and metabolism of noradrenaline (NA), the slowing of axonal flow, the accumulation of NA in the neurons, the decrease in discharge rate of LC neurons without stress and the increase in release of NA in response to an additional stress. It may also explain the therapeutic time lag that is required to repair the noradrenergic neurons.",

However, it is not clear whether such alterations are factors that predispose young people to use, and so are also present in recreational users, or are a consequence of chronic exposure to substances and/or comorbid psychopathology. Objective: To investigate relationships between key brain structures and parameters of alcohol and cannabis use, in otherwise healthy male recreational users. Method: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure hippocampal, amygdala, whole-brain and intracranial cavity (ICC) volumes in 22 young men with a history of both alcohol and cannabis use. Results: Linear regression analyses with hippocampal, amygdala and whole-brain volumes as the dependent variables and age and ICC as covariates were performed. Findings showed that use of cannabis and alcohol at an earlier age were independently predictive of larger amygdala volumes, whereas longer duration of cannabis use was predictive of smaller hippocampal volumes. Conclusions: Our findings offer preliminary support for a relationship between patterns of substance use and regional brain volumes in recreational users. It is speculative, but possible that this relationship is an evidence of a neurobiological vulnerability to drug-taking behaviour.",

Methods: A total of 63 stroke patients were included in this study. Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire was used to determine the dominant affective temperament (depressive, hyperthymic, cyclothymic, irritable or anxious). The disability level was measured with the Barthel index (BI). Results: Depressive temperament (17.5%) and anxious temperament (12.7%) were the most common dominant affective temperaments. The frequencies of irritable, cyclothymic and hyperthymic temperaments were 4.8, 3.2 and 0%, respectively. The mean BI score was 78.1 ± 18.3 in patients with depressive temperament and 67.4 ± 28.4 in patients without depressive temperament ( p = 0.403). The mean BI score was 78.1 ± 15.3 in patients with anxious temperament and 68.0 ± 28.3 in patients without anxious temperament ( p = 0.541). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that BI score was not associated with affective temperament changes. Conclusion: The results of the current study suggest that depressive and anxious temperaments are the most common affective temperaments and that there appears to be no association between disability level and dominant affective temperament in stroke survivors.",

Objective: In this study, it was examined whether the inclination to (drastically) change the appearance is related to (pre)psychotic symptoms. Methods: By means of a questionnaire, the frequency and nature of changing the appearance was studied among a sample of healthy volunteers ( n = 38) and psychiatric patients ( n = 61). The psychiatric group consisted of 1) patients with schizophrenia ( n = 22), 2) patients with a borderline personality disorder ( n = 20) and 3) patients with a depressive disorder ( n = 19). Results: In accordance with previous findings, self-reports of drastic changes of appearance were associated with scores on various schizotypy scales. Psychiatric patients reported more changes of appearance, compared with healthy volunteers. Patients with schizophrenia reported most changes, followed by the group of patients with borderline personality disordered. Conclusions: Perhaps, drastic changes of the appearance are a visible expression of the loss of ego boundaries and/or of the sense of reality.",

Brief neuropsychological profiles in psychosis: a pilot study using the Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS).This pilot study examines the utility of a novel, standardised brief neuropsychological assessment tool (the ARCS, Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen) in a different clinical setting to that in which it was initially developed. We hypothesised that the ARCS would be feasible to administer to individuals with a psychotic illness and that it would detect cognitive deficits similar to those identified by an established instrument (the RBANS, Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status).Twenty-five people with psychosis (mean age = 43.72, SD = 9.78) and 25 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited from the Newcastle community (NSW, Australia). The ARCS and RBANS were completed about 1 week apart in a counterbalanced order.The ARCS was well received, performed satisfactorily and both the ARCS and RBANS were sensitive to deficits typically associated with psychosis (e.g. memory and attention). After controlling for memory deficits, the largest disparity between the psychosis and control groups was on the ARCS fluency domain [p < 0.001, partial Eta-squared (η p 2) = 0.21].The ARCS uses audio administration (approximately 34 min) to reduce clinician time (to 3-5 min for scoring) and appears to be a useful brief assessment tool for examining the cognitive deficits associated with psychosis. However, the potential clinical utility of the ARCS needs to be investigated further in larger samples drawn from a wider variety of specialist and non-specialist settings.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Studies exploring relation of visual memory to white matter are extensively lacking. The Rey Visual Design Learning Test (RVDLT) is an elementary motion, colour and word independent visual memory test. It avoids a significant contribution from as many additional higher order visual brain functions as possible to visual performance, such as three-dimensional, colour, motion or word-dependent brain operations. Based on previous results, we hypothesised that test performance would be related with white matter of dorsal hippocampal commissure, corpus callosum, posterior cingulate, superior longitudinal fascicle and internal capsule. Methods: In 14 healthy subjects, we measured intervoxel coherence (IC) by diffusion tensor imaging as an indication of connectivity and visual memory performance measured by the RVDLT. IC considers the orientation of the adjacent voxels and has a better signal-to-noise ratio than the commonly used fractional anisotropy index. Results: Using voxelwise linear regression analyses of the IC values, we found a significant and direct relationship between 11 clusters and visual memory test performance. The fact that memory performance correlated with white matter structure in left and right dorsal hippocampal commissure, left and right posterior cingulate, right callosal splenium, left and right superior longitudinal fascicle, right medial orbitofrontal region, left anterior cingulate, and left and right anterior limb of internal capsule emphasises our hypothesis. Conclusion: Our observations in healthy subjects suggest that individual differences in brain function related to the performance of a task of higher cognitive demands might partially be associated with structural variation of white matter regions.",

Interpretation of brain-derived proteins in CSF uses absolute concentrations (in contrast to CSF/serum quotients for blood-derived proteins) and must discriminate between different sources: Neuronal or glial proteins like NSE, or tau protein are evaluated using their absolute concentrations in CSF for maximal sensitivity without reference to QAlb. The leptomeningeal proteins like beta trace or cystatin C are evaluated as absolute concentrations with reference to QAlb. As application examples we review the group of dementive and psychiatric diseases. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, Lewy-body disease and frontotemporal dementia are the major causes of neurodegenerative memory impairment and dementia. Combined analysis of Tau-Protein and Beta Amyloid 1-42 in CSF represent the classic approach, meanwhile extended with further surrogate markers. In 15% of psychiatric patients with schizophrenic or affective disorders an inflammatory process could be detected which points to a brain-organic involvement. In 24% of these patients with a psychiatric disease a moderately increased albumin quotient was observed as the only unexplained pathological sign. In psychiatric diseases it has to be regarded as a serious deficit not to make at least once a CSF analysis in the patients which could modify the diagnosis (in 6%).",

A well-known polymorphism encoding the substitution of leucine to proline in the signal peptide sequence of NPY (Leu7Pro variation) was previously found to protect against depression. Our study aimed at replicating this association in a large Danish population with major depression. Method: Leu7Pro was studied in a sample of depressed patients and ethnically matched controls, as well as psychiatric disease controls with schizophrenia. Possible functional consequences of Leu7Pro were explored in vitro. Results: In contrast to previous studies, Pro7 appeared to be a risk allele for depression, being significantly more frequent in the depression sample (5.5%, n = 593; p = 0.009; odds ratio, OR: 1.46) as compared to ethnically matched controls (3.8%, n = 2912), while schizophrenia patients (4.1%, n = 503) did not differ. In vitro, the Pro7 substitution appeared to be associated with reduced levels of NPY without affecting its mRNA level. Conclusion: The Leu7Pro variation may increase the risk of major depression, possibly by affecting the biosynthesis of NPY. Pernille",

    "abstract": "Introduction and aims Dependence on ethanol increases the risk of depression in patients and leads to a damage and deficiencies of brain function, which manifest in cognitive functions impairment. Aripiprazole (ARI) is an atypical antipsychotic drug, which has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognitive function. Results of many studies show that, for ARI's antidepressant effect to manifest itself, it is necessary to use a combined therapy with a drug from the group of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The aim of this paper was to assess the antidepressant and impact of ARI on spatial memory in alcohol-preferring rats (EtNPRs). Design and methods In our study, we used Porsolt's forced swimming test (antidepressant effect) and Morris water maze test. The tests have been conducted upon administration of ARI (6 mg/kg i.p.), fluoxetine (FLX; 5 mg/kg p.o.) and combined administration of both drugs in alcohol-dependent rats. Results The results of behavioural tests carried out have shown a lack of antidepressant and procognitive effects of either ARI or FLX in EtPRs after acute and chronic treatment. Combined administration of both drugs would lead to spatial memory deterioration in the study animals. Discussion and conclusions Our results suggest that ARI applied in the experiment had no antidepressant effect and failed to improve spatial memory in study rats. Potential antidepressant and procognitive properties of this drug resulting from its mechanism of action encourage attempts (design) of further research aimed at developing a dose, which will show such effects in alcohol-preferring animals.",

Then, we performed this investigation to analyse whether mitochondria isolated from frontal cortex and hippocampus of vitamin A-treated rats are more sensitive to a challenge with amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides 1-40 or 1-42.Adult Wistar rats received vitamin A at 1000-9000 IU/kg/day orally for 28 days. Then, mitochondria were isolated and the challenge with Aβ peptides 1-40 or 1-42 (at 0.2 or 0.1 μM, respectively) for 10 min was carried out before mitochondrial electron transfer chain enzyme activity, superoxide anion radical (O2 -•) production and 3-nitrotyrosine content quantification.Mitochondria obtained from vitamin A-treated rats are more sensitive to Aβ peptides 1-40 or 1-42 than mitochondria isolated from the control group, as decreased mitochondrial complex enzyme activity and increased O2 -• production and 3-nitrotyrosine content were observed in incubated mitochondria isolated from vitamin A-treated rats.These data suggest that oral intake of vitamin A at clinical doses increases the susceptibility of mitochondria to a neurotoxic agent even at low concentrations.",

The rats received injections once a day for 14 days; control rats received an equivalent volume of saline. Twelve hours after the last administration, the rats were killed by decapitation and brain was rapidly removed and kept on an ice plate. The activities of the enzymes were measured in different brain areas.We observed that the activities of citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase, mithocondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II-III and IV and CK were not altered after chronic administration of bupropion. However, SDH activity was increased in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum. In the hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum the activity of complex II was increased after chronic administration of bupropion.Our results demonstrated that bupropion increased some enzymes of brain energy metabolism. These findings are in accordance with other studies which showed that some antidepressants may improve energy metabolism. The present results reinforce the hypothesis that antidepressants modulate brain energy metabolism.",

Secondarily, we wanted to compare these data to findings in a sample of schizophrenia patients.The healthy subjects acted as their own controls in an open-within-subject design. Motor activity was recorded with an actigraph worn for 24 h in the drug-free, and steady-state memantine conditions, respectively. Motor activity levels for 1-min intervals were analysed by means of both linear and nonlinear methods. The schizophrenia patients were monitored only once, without memantine manipulation.The root mean square successive differences (RMSSD) and the RMSSD/SD ratio were increased by memantine, and memantine was also associated with lower autocorrelation (lag 1) but in recordings from the right arm only. These movement patterns partly corresponded to those found in a sample of drug-treated schizophrenia patients. Total activity level, standard deviation (SD) and sample entropy were not significantly different in the memantine versus drug-free condition.The findings suggest a role for the NMDA receptor in the regulation of motor activity in healthy individuals as memantine increased the variability in the motor recordings and the alterations between adjacent motor recordings. It is suggested that the findings may be relevant to the role played by glutamate and the NMDA receptor functioning to the motor disturbances in schizophrenia.",

The concept of QoL is included in and expands the definition of health given by the WHO (World Health Organization) and comprises complete physical, mental, and social well-being. It expresses the degree of satisfaction in various areas as a result of the opportunities that arise during one's lifetime despite the restrictions and impediments that life itself puts forth. The last decade has exponentially increased the number of studies on QoL, although they are still limited. Methods We performed a literature review on the QoL scales used in patients with neurological disorders. Results Recent studies have shown the importance of QoL assessment because standard treatments do not assess the treatment impact felt by the patient. In fact, by understanding the impact of treatment on survival and QoL, one can make a clearer interpretation of the health of the patient. Conclusion This review has adopted an innovative holistic methodological approach, which allowed a global evaluation of the comfort reported by the patients. The scales applied in this study allowed to choose the most suitable therapeutic strategies and programme individual therapeutic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The ability to reflect rationally on one's own anomalous experiences and to recognise that their conclusions are incorrect is called as cognitive insight. It influences the delusion proneness of patients with schizophrenia. Structured instruments to assess cognitive insight have not been validated in any Indian languages so far. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the validity and factor structure of Tamil version of Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS-T). Methods: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients with schizophrenia completed BCIS-T. We assessed their clinical insight with the reference standard, Schedule for Assessment of Insight-Expanded version (SAI-E). An independent psychiatrist evaluated their psychopathology using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: BCIS-T was internally consistent with Cronbach's α 0.67 and Guttman's split-half coefficient as 0.63. BCIS-T composite index documented convergent validity with SAI-E total score ( ρ = 0.38; p &lt; 0.001) and discriminant validity with BPRS ( ρ = −0.02; p = 0.85). Factor analysis showed a four-factor structure, namely self-certainty, self-reflectiveness, openness to external feedback and infallibility of self-reflection. BCIS-T composite index had significant linear relationship with clinical insight and treatment compliance on multivariate analyses ( p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Our findings support the validity of BCIS-T to assess cognitive insight of the patients with schizophrenia. We suggest addressing the intricacies of cognitive insight beyond the traditional two-dimensional models in cross-cultural settings.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of schizophrenia mainly results from variations in clinical expressions of the disease, such as age at onset, gender differences in onset of illness, symptoms and response to antipsychotic treatment. Enhanced sensitisation of dopamine pathways in males, having consistently an earlier onset, might be implicated as disease modifiers for schizophrenia in males.In this study, we performed a case (n = 87)-control (n = 100) association study between the DBH5'-ins/del and DBH-444g/a polymorphisms of the DBH gene and also compared the level of psychotic symptoms between patients with different DBH genotypes/haplotypes with respect to antipsychotic therapeutic response and gender difference.No significant differences between allele and genotype and haplotype frequencies at either groups (p < 0.05). When the age is considered in patient group, a significant difference was observed between patients with ID genotype and with II genotype (p = 0.018). Patients with ID genotype have been diagnosed as schizophrenics in early ages when compared to II genotype carriers. We also found a significant difference between II and ID genotype (p = 0.007) when the gender had taken into account, showing that the ID genotype carriers had an early onset to schizophrenia.This association was more significant in male schizophrenia patients than females. Thus, this finding may constitute a novel biological support for the prior finding that onset of schizophrenia varies with gender. The results also showed that critical genetic vulnerability may be associated with the presence or absence of the ID genotype of DBH5'-ins/del.",

This drug causes psychostimulant effects because of its pharmacological profile similar to amphetamine, acting like a monoamine reuptake inhibitor. However, the mechanisms underlying the action of mazindol are still not clearly understood. Methods Swiss mice received a single acute administration of mazindol (0.25, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, ip) or saline. After 2 h, the animals were killed by decapitation; the brain was removed and used for the evaluation of activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, Krebs cycle enzymes and creatine kinase. Results Acute administration of mazindol decreased complex I activity only in the hippocampus. Complex IV activity was increased in the cerebellum (2.5 mg/kg) and cerebral cortex (0.25 mg/kg). Citrate synthase activity was increased in the cerebellum (1.25 mg/kg) and cerebral cortex (1.25 mg/kg), and creatine kinase activity was increased in the cerebellum (1.25 mg/kg). Conclusion We suggest that the inhibition of complex I in the hippocampus only and activation of complex IV, citrate synthase and creatine kinase occurs because of a stimulus effect of mazindol in the central nervous system, which causes a direct impairment on energy metabolism.",

On the other hand, complex IV activity was inhibited by clozapine, olanzapine and aripriprazole. CK activity was increased by clozapine at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml in prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus and posterior cortex of rats. Moreover, olanzapine and aripiprazole did not affect CK activity.In this context, if the hypothesis that metabolism impairment is involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders is correct and these results also occur in vivo, we suggest that olanzapine may reverse a possible diminution of metabolism.",

METHODS: Using the Longitudinal Expert Assessment of All Data approach the patients were classified in four groups: A: patients who achieved remission; B: patients with doubtful effect; C: patients with no effect; and D: patients who were hard-to-assess. RESULTS: In group A, comprising 27 patients, 13 had relapsed; they obtained a clear remission after a repeated course of T-PEMF augmentation. In group D, comprising 16 patients, we identified misdiagnostic factors both concerning the event of remission after the previous T-PEMF augmentation and concerning the aetiology (psychosocial stressors and co-morbid conditions). Compared with the other groups, the group D patients had a smaller number of previous episodes (p=0.09) and a longer duration of the current episode (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: T-PEMF has an effect among patients who relapsed after remission with the first series of T-PEMF. Treatment-resistant depression is a condition that has a high degree of multivariate problems. Misuse of alcohol or drugs, severe somatic disorders and other psychosocial problems may need other kinds of treatment before T-PEMF augmentation.",

Neurophysiological investigations have an important role within neuropsychiatry services, with video-electroencephalography (EEG) telemetry being the gold standard investigation for the differential diagnosis between epileptic seizures and non-epileptic attacks. This article reviews existing evidence on best practices for neurophysiology investigations, with focus on safety measures for video-EEG telemetry. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review using the PubMed database in order to identify the scientific literature on the best practices when using neurophysiological investigations in patients with suspected epileptic seizures or non-epileptic attacks. Results Specific measures need to be implemented for video-EEG telemetry to be safely and effectively carried out by neuropsychiatry services. A confirmed diagnosis of non-epileptic attack disorder following video-EEG telemetry carried out within neuropsychiatry units has the inherent advantage of allowing diagnosis communication and implementation of treatment strategies in a timely fashion, potentially improving clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness significantly. Conclusion The identified recommendations set the stage for the development of standardised guidelines to enable neuropsychiatry services to implement streamlined and evidence-based care pathways.",

ARS modifies basal activities in cortico-limbic regions of rats and induces changes in the correlations observed between these regions. The interactions between plasma and cortico-limbic activities will be also evaluated.Enkephalinase (AlaAP and LeuAP) and oxytocinase (P-LeuAP) activities were fluorometrically determined in plasma of control and stressed rats using aminoacyl-β-naphthylamides (aaNNap), AlaNNap and LeuNNap as substrates.No differences in enzymatic activities were observed between control and stressed animals in plasma. In contrast, highly significant positive and negative correlations between plasma and cortico-limbic regions were demonstrated in controls. Stress conditions significantly alter the pattern of these correlations.The present results clearly support a connection between plasma and brain involving certain neuropeptidase activities that change under stress conditions.",

Genome-wide association studies have found that the rs1635, rs11038167, and rs10489202 polymorphisms are associated with SZ in Han Chinese. However, results of validation studies are inconsistent. This study aimed to test the association between the NKAPL rs1635, TSPAN18 rs11038167, and MPC2 rs10489202 polymorphisms and SZ in a Chinese population. Methods This study contained 700 unrelated SZ patients (300 Zhuang and 400 Han) and 700 gender- and age-matched controls (300 Zhuang and 400 Han). The polymorphisms in TSPAN18 (rs11038167), NKAPL (rs1635), and MPC2 (rs10489202) were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY method. Statistical analyses were performed with PLINK program and SPSS l6.0 for Windows. STATA11.1 was used for meta-analysis. Results No statistically significant difference was found in different allele and genotype frequencies of rs1635, rs11038167, and rs10489202 between SZ cases and controls of Zhuang and Han ethnicities and the total samples (all p &gt;0.05). Further meta-analysis suggested that single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10489202 was significantly associated with SZ in a Han Chinese population ( p OR =0.002). Conclusions Our case–control study failed to validate the significant association of NKAPL rs1635, TSPAN18 rs11038167, and MPC2 rs10489202 polymorphisms with SZ susceptibility in the southern Zhuang or Han Chinese population. However, meta-analysis showed a significant association between MPC2 variant rs10489202 and SZ susceptibility in Han Chinese.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for psychiatric diseases. Recently, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be related to body mass index (BMI). In this study, we investigated the association of BMI-related SNPs with psychiatric diseases and one of their endophenotypes, memory performance, in a Japanese population.The subjects were 1624 patients with one of three psychiatric diseases (799 patients with major depressive disorder, 594 with schizophrenia, and 231 with bipolar disorder) and 1189 healthy controls. Memory performance was assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised (WMS-R). Genomic DNA was prepared from venous blood and used to genotype 23 BMI-related SNPs using the TaqMan 5'-exonuclease allelic discrimination assay. We then analysed the relationships between the SNPs and psychiatric disease and various subscales of the WMS-R.Three SNPs (rs11142387, rs12597579, and rs6548238) showed significant differences in the genotype or allele frequency between patients with any psychiatric diseases and controls. Furthermore, six SNPs (rs11142387, rs12597579, rs2815752, rs2074356, rs4776970, and rs2287019) showed significant differences in at least one subscale of the WMS-R depending on the genotypes of the healthy controls. Interestingly, rs11142387 near the Kruppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) was significantly associated with psychiatric disease and poor memory function.We identified three and six BMI-related SNPs associated with psychiatric disease and memory performance, respectively. In particular, carrying the A allele of rs11142387 near KLF9 was found to be associated with psychiatric disease and poor memory performance, which warrants further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin is one of the neurotransmitters implicated in normal personality. Many psychobiological models of personality include some dimensions related to serotonin. For instance, the harm avoidance dimension of the biosocial model developed by Cloninger is related to serotonergic activity. Higher scores on the harm avoidance dimension should theoretically reflect increased serotonergic activity. However, correlation studies related serotonin activity to harm avoidance dimension have not yielded consistent findings. These controversial results are probably related to the complexity of the neurotransmitter systems, and the different assessment techniques used in these studies. Finally, recent genetic studies have examined the association between personality dimensions and serotonergic receptor polymorphisms with mixed results. Serotonin is not only related to some dimensions of normal personality. Several psychopathological disorders are associated with serotonergic dysfunction. More particularly, borderline personality disorder (BPD) can be defined by many of the symptoms associated with serotonergic dysregulation, including affective lability, suicidal behaviours, impulsivity and loss of impulse control. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of selective serotonin re-uptake drugs in treating the depressive and impulsive symptoms of patients with BPD. Moreover, some challenge studies have reported a lower serotonergic activity in BPD. Because these challenges are not specific, we have assessed the serotonergic activity in BPD with the flesinoxan challenge. Preliminary results showed that the prolactine responses to flesinoxan were significantly lower in BPD patients compared to those observed in controls.",

Methods: The authors have assessed 14 items relevant to depressive symptomatology from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III (SCID) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) in 180 depressed in-patients. Results: Melancholia was significantly more prominent in older depressed patients (≥ 55 years), whereas minor depression (i.e. adjustment disorder with depressed mood and dysthymic disorder) in younger (&lt; 55 years) depressed subjects. Older depressed subjects exhibited significantly more anorexia/weight loss, non-reactivity, depressed mood, loss of interest, early morning awakening, loss of energy, somatic anxiety, loss of insight, psychotic symptoms and retardation than younger depressed people. Male depressed subjects showed significantly more loss of interest, suicidal ideation and agitation than their female counterparts. Psychomotor disorders, a distinct quality of mood and early morning awakening were characteristics of older depressed males, while diurnal variation occurred more frequently in older depressed females. Conclusion: It is concluded that increasing age in unipolar depression may be accompanied by an increase in severity of illness, increased frequency of some melancholic symptoms, particularly in men and a higher frequency of major depression in women and of melancholia in men.",

In addition, plasma levels of amino acids were measured. Results: In a subgroup of patients suffering from atypical psychoses, this biochemical challenge resulted in the reappearance of psychedelic symptoms in particular. Furthermore, significantly lower plasma concentrations of serine were found. In vitro experiments revealed a disturbance in the one-carbon metabolism.

    "abstract": "Depression is a frequent comorbid disorder of many inflammatory diseases and it is suggested that brain inflammatory processes have a pathogenic role in mood dysregulation. Several immunocompromised patients have been treated with cytokines and long-term treatments have resulted in a variety of neuropsychiatric side-effects. The objective of the study was to present evidence for an association between the induction of neuropsychiatric side-effects during treatment with interferon-α (IFN-α) and changes in serotonergic and immunological parameters. Moreover, the use of IFN-α-induced depression as a paradigm for research into the pathophysiology of depressive disorders in general will be discussed. This literature review focused on the relationships between tryptophan, serotonin, cytokines and depression associated with interferon treatment. Immunotherapy with IFN-α influences several immunological and serotonergic parameters, and induces in most patients neurovegetative, somatic and depressive symptoms. Literature findings indicate that the development of depressive symptoms in patients undergoing cytokine therapy are secondary to cytokine induction and could be mediated by a reduced availability of tryptophan to the brain, resulting ultimately in decreased serotonergic activity. Changes in the metabolism of tryptophan and consequently of serotonin may play a role in the pathophysiology of interferon-induced depression. Studies on interferon-induced neuropsychiatric side-effects may be a promising research paradigm and shed light on the role of immunological and serotonergic factors in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders in general. However, first the appropriate symptomatology of the interferon-induced depressive states has to be documented.",

Prevalence rates of patients with cardiovascular (e.g. 12.2%) and musculoskeletal (21.5%) diseases do not indicate an increased prevalence of somatoform disorders compared with the general population (18.2%).The results confirm that patients with chronic somatic diseases have increased prevalence rates of mental disorders. However, these increased prevalence rates go primarily back to affective and anxiety disorders and not to somatoform disorders. The diagnostic criteria for somatoform disorders and the question algorithm of the M-CIDI are probably responsible for potential underestimation of somatoform disorders in patients with chronic somatic diseases.",

Subjects underwent four assessments (baseline, pre-, post-treatment, 12-month follow-up), each comprising several self-rated questionnaires on gastrointestinal, somatoform, depressive, hypochondriacal and anxious symptoms, and health locus of control, as well as a diagnostic interview of functional gastrointestinal and mental disorders at the baseline assessment. Treatment effects were controlled by subjects' waiting list period before treatment.Gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as comorbid psychopathology scores, decreased significantly during treatment and remained unchanged during the follow-up period, whereas no relevant changes were found in health locus of control. Largest effect sizes were found for gastrointestinal symptoms, which decreased by 30-50% of their initial number.The group treatment investigated was effective and particularly successful with respect to functional gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the mechanisms of treatment outcome remain indistinct. Further studies comparing different setting conditions directly are required to clarify the question of whether group treatment is significantly superior or inferior to individual therapy.",

There was no effect of comorbid MDD, but there was a significant effect of BPD and a significant interaction between the diagnosis of MDD and BPD on executive tasks (trail making and Stroop). Thus, compared with subjects without BPD, subjects with BPD performed significantly worse on tests of executive function, while the group with both comorbidities performed even worse.There appears to be an additive effect of BPD and MDD resulting in impaired executive neuropsychological function.

Results: The pattern of activations indicated two distinct, but partially overlapping, networks. Predominantly, frontal activations were seen for the target stimuli that did elicit an OR, including the orbitofrontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as activations in the anterior thalamus and cerebellum.

While both patients' tendency to be hyperactive was positively related to their weight preoccupation and negative emotions, in only one patient, the urge to move turned out to be significantly related to (the absence of) positive emotions.ESM can be useful to test whether general theories of psychopathology apply to specific patients, and it may be conceived as an individually tailored approach to self-monitoring.

By the end of the treatment, the score of CGI-I decreased 24.8% ( P &lt; 0.0001). Percentage of patient improving (CGI &lt; 4 points) was 47.5%. The most common non-serious adverse events were constipation, nervousness, anxiety and insomnia. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the combined treatment of reboxetine and venlafaxine, in venlafaxine-resistant patients, may be an effective and well-tolerated strategy.",

To clarify the longitudinal morphological and white matter changes, volume data and normalised diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were compared between the first and follow-up studies using a paired t-test.Focal cortical volume loss was observed in the left prefrontal lobe and anterior cingulate on volumetric study. In addition, DTI metrics changed significantly at the bilateral posterior superior temporal lobes, left insula, genu of the corpus callosum and anterior cingulate.There are ongoing changes in the brains of schizophrenic patients during the course of the illness. Discrepancies between volume data and DTI metrics may indicate that the pattern of progressive brain changes varies according to brain region.",

Methods: Subjects were 23 patients with schizophrenia and 23 controls. Psychopathology was rated in patients with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at baseline and after 4-week and after 8-week treatments with quetiapine. Auditory stimuli for event-related potentials consisted of 100 ms/1000 Hz standards, intermixed with 100 ms/1500 Hz frequency deviants and 250 ms/ 1000 Hz duration deviants. A stimulus onset asynchrony of each was 300 ms. Electroencephalograph was recorded at Fz. BESA 5.1.8 was used to perform data analysis. MMN waveforms were obtained by subtracting waveforms elicited by standards from those elicited by frequency- or duration-deviant stimuli. Results: Quetiapine decreased all PANSS scores. Patients showed smaller mean amplitudes of frequency and duration MMN at baseline than did controls. A repeated measure analysis of variance with sessions (i.e. baseline and 4- and 8-week treatments) and MMN type (frequency versus duration) as within-subject factors revealed no significant MMN type or MMN type × session main effect for MMN amplitudes (for MMN type: F = 0.704, df = 1, p = 0.403; for MMN type × session: F = 0.299, df = 2, p = 0.796). Session main effect was significant ( F = 3.576, df = 2, p = 0.031). Least square difference tests showed significant differences between MMN amplitudes at 8 weeks and those at both baseline ( p = 0.025) and 4 weeks ( p = 0.020). MMN amplitudes at 8 weeks were higher than those at baseline. Conclusions: Quetiapine improved the amplitudes of MMN after the 8-week treatment. MMN offers objective evidence that treatment with the quetiapine may ameliorate preattentive deficits in schizophrenia.",

Using functional relevance and observed fold change as selection criteria, the expression changes in a subset of these genes were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.Of this subset, only two genes, cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) and hairy and enhancer of split 6 (Hes6), showed robust and consistent changes in expression. Both genes were downregulated by paroxetine, and both have been previously implicated in neurogenesis. Further investigation of these two genes may provide new insight into the mechanism of action of antidepressants.",

The main hypothesis tested if the use of biofeedback improves depression levels compared to the control group. Methods: A randomised clinical trial. The final sample was composed of 36 participants (18 in the experimental group, receiving 6 training, once a week, with biofeedback; and 18 in the control group, who received conventional treatment in the service).Outcome measures were assessed in two stages: pre-test and post-test. The research used the following instruments: demographic survey data, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0.0 and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The factors and variables were presented in terms of descriptive and inferential statistics. Fisher’s exact test ( p &lt; 0.05) was used to verify the existence of an association between the counting variables. The multinomial logistic regression model was adopted, and the Logit link function was used, as the software RStudio version 3.6.2. Results: The factors that remained in the final model were group, sex, partner, atypical antidepressant, benzodiazepines, mood stabiliser, antiepileptic and antihistamine, according to the levels of depression based on the BDI. The group that did not receive biofeedback intervention had 16 times more chances of increasing the depression levels compared to participants in the experimental group. Conclusion: The use of biofeedback reduces depression, thus, representing a complementary alternative for the treatment of moderate and severe depression, and dysthymia.",

The depressive disorder has a neuroendocrinological component, co-influencing the MetS, while MetS is characterised by increased cytokine levels, which are known to cause a depressed mood. This study aimed to establish biological subtypes of the depressive disorder based on researched clinical, laboratory, and anthropometric variables.We performed a cross-sectional study on a sample of 293 subjects (145 suffering from a depressive disorder and 148 healthy controls). Results were analysed with multivariate statistical methods as well as with cluster and discriminant analysis. In order to classify depressive disorder on the grounds of laboratory, anthropometric, and clinical parameters, we performed cluster analysis, which resulted in three clusters.The first cluster is characterised by low platelet serotonin, high cortisol levels, high blood glucose levels, high triglycerides levels, high Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, high waist circumference, high C-Reactive Protein values, and a high number of previous depressive episodes, was named Combined (Metabolic) depression. The inflammatory depression cluster is defined with average platelet serotonin values, normal cortisol, and all other parameter levels, except for increased IL-6 levels. The serotoninergic depression cluster is characterised by markedly low platelet serotonin, and all other parameters are within the normal range.From a biological point of view, depressive disorder is not uniform, and as such, these findings suggest potential clinically useful and generalisable biological subtypes of depressive disorder.",

The contribution of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is mainly unclear in this context. Methods: Therefore, two patients with psychosis and anti-MOG antibodies – detected in fixed cell-based and live cell-based assays – are presented. Results: Patient 1 suffered from late-onset psychosis with singular white matter lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intermittent electroencephalography (EEG) slowing. Patient 2 suffered from a chronic paranoid–hallucinatory disorder with intermittent confusional states, non-specific white matter alterations on MRI, a disorganised alpha rhythm on EEG, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein. Both patients had anti-MOG antibody titres of 1 : 320 in serum (reference &lt; 1 : 20). Conclusions: The arguments for and against a causal role for anti-MOG antibodies are discussed. The antibodies could be relevant, but due to moderate titres, they may have caused a rather ‘subtle clinical picture’ consisting of psychosis instead of ‘classical’ MOG encephalomyelitis.",

The current study sets out to evaluate if the finding of lower brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in schizophrenia patients could be confirmed in an independent cohort and to investigate if the BDNF levels can be altered with different treatment modalities such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and/or antipsychotic pharmacotherapy (PT). Methods: A total of 54 male patients with schizophrenia and 35 healthy controls were included in the study. Schizophrenia patients were subdivided into two groups as the ones who underwent ECT + PT and only PT. Clinical and sociodemographic data questionnaire, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and blood sample collection for BDNF assessment were applied to all patients (on first and last days of admissions) and healthy participants (on the day of the interview). Then, clinical parameters and blood sample outcomes were statistically analysed. Results: Mean BDNF levels of healthy individuals were significantly higher than mean pre- and post-treatment BDNF levels in both PT only and ECT + PT groups. While serum BDNF levels did not increase after ECT + PT, there was a trend level increase in the PT only group. There was no significant correlation between the changes in serum BDNF levels with total PANSS scores in either group after treatment. Conclusions: We could confirm previously suggested data of lower serum BDNF levels in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy population but we could not find significant increase in serum BDNF levels with ECT + PT or only PT as some previous studies suggested.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chronic pain is a debilitating medical condition affecting a significant percentage of the population worldwide. Considerable evidence suggests that pain is an independent risk factor for suicide and inadequately managing pain has been identified as a risk for suicidal behaviour. Additionally, medications used to treat pain may also contribute to suicidal behaviour. Extensive research on pain highlights deficiencies in the clinical management on pain with more gaps in care when patients have pain in combination with mental illness and suicidal behaviour. Providing trainees additional knowledge and equipping them with relevant tools to screen and manage chronic pain efficiently is a potential strategy to mitigate suicide risk. Also, trainees need to be educated on how to screen for suicidality in individuals with pain and apply suicide prevention interventions. This paper will emphasise the necessity to improve education about pain, its close relationship with suicide and effective suicide screening as well as management strategies for medical providers. With additional research, it is the hope that novel treatment modalities will be developed to treat pain to improve the quality of life of individuals suffering from this condition and to decrease suicide risk in this patient population.",

In this regard, the pineal gland, involved in circadian rhythm processes as a key neuroendocrine organ which mainly synthesises and secretes melatonin, has never been studied before in this population. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the parenchyma pineal volume and its relation to sleep hours, sleep quality index and melatonin level at night. A total of 50 participants, 30 women with FM and 20 healthy control women underwent cranial magnetic resonance imaging. The total pineal volume, cyst pineal volume and parenchyma pineal volume were manually calculated in cubic millimetres. Also, the total pineal volume was estimated using Hasehawa method. Parenchyma pineal volume was significantly correlated with sleep hours ( p -value = 0.041) and nocturnal melatonin level ( p -value = 0.027). Moreover, there was also a non-significant correlation between parenchyma pineal volume and sleep quality index ( p -value = 0.055). Furthermore, a mean parenchyma pineal volume of 102.00 (41.46) mm³ was observed, with a prevalence of 29.60% cyst in FM group. This is the first study that has reported pineal gland volumes, cyst prevalence and correlative relationships between parenchyma pineal volume and sleep hours and melatonin levels in women with FM.",

    "abstract": "Background: Several studies have investigated the association of FKBP5 gene polymorphisms with mood disorders, but findings are not always consistent. The aim of our study was to assess the association of FKBP5 gene polymorphisms with mood disorders using a meta-analysis. Methods: Data were collected from the following electronic databases: PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang, with the last report up to March 2010. Meta-analysis was performed in a fixed/random effect model. Results: We identified six studies using search, and one study was excluded because of unavailable data. One study contained data on two different ethnicities and we treated them independently. Thus, six separate studies (2655 cases and 3593 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed for three FKBP5 gene polymorphisms (rs1360780, rs3800373 and rs4713916) in overall and Caucasian populations. We did not detect any association of FKBP5 gene rs1360780 and rs3800373 polymorphisms with mood disorders ( p &gt; 0.05). However, a significant association of FKBP5 gene rs4713916 polymorphism with mood disorders was found, and the heterozygous individual (GA genotype) was more susceptible to mood disorders in comparison to homozygous analogues (GG or AA genotype) [overall: GA vs. GG: OR (odds ratio) = 1.20, 95% CI (confidence interval) = 1.03–1.40, p = 0.02; GA vs. AA: OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.09–1.90, p = 0.009; Caucasian: GA vs. GG: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04–1.44, p = 0.01; GA vs. AA: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.09–1.89, p = 0.01]. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that mood disorders are associated with FKBP5 gene rs4713916 polymorphism, but not with rs1360780 and rs3800373.",

HTR2A gene polymorphisms and Inward and Outward Personal Meaning Organisations. Objective: Caregiver behaviours and emotional expressions may induce development of two basic categories of constructing identity and of regulating cognitive and emotional processes: an Inward or an Outward Personal Meaning Organisation (PMO). Inwards read environmental signals through their internal activations. Their emotions are more distinct, and reciprocity is more based on physical distance (protection, loneliness). Outwards read internal activations through the environment. Their emotions are more blurred, and reciprocity is more based on a semantic sight of relations (approval, rules). It has recently been shown that PMO development may also have physiological and genetic bases. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, Inward and Outward subjects showed different amygdala activation patterns and an association with the SLC6A4 serotonin transporter gene 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. Methods: In this work, 149 healthy subjects were examined with respect to Inward and Outward PMOs. We explored the association with 10 serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected by bioinformatics methods. Results: An intronic SNP (rs55948462) was found to be significantly associated with an Inward and an Outward PMOs development. However, after statistical adjustments, these results did not remain significant. Conclusion: We did not find associations between considered SNPs and Inward/Outward PMOs. However, the role of HTR2A polymorphisms was not considered in this study and that of the other serotonin-related genes should be valued.",

Responses from eight sites in each subject were divided into four quadrants (superior and inferior temporal quadrants, and superior and inferior nasal quadrants). In each quadrant, two response waves were grouped and averaged, and the latency and amplitude of main waveforms that appeared near 100 ms were evaluated. Results: The peak latency was about 7–9 ms prolonged and the amplitude was reduced by about 2–5 nV/deg 2 in the schizophrenic patient group compared to those in the normal subject group, and significant differences were noted in both parameters in all quadrants. Conclusion: In schizophrenic patients under treatment with psychotropic agents, prolongation of the latency and amplitude reduction were noted in mfVEPs even though no abnormality was detected on the conventional perimetry.",

As the amygdala plays a critical role in coping with stress, we evaluated whether the left or right amygdala was involved in aggressive or escape behaviour in six patients undergoing awake surgery for temporal lobe brain tumours.Brain tumours were located in the left temporal lobe in cases 1-3 and in the right temporal lobe in cases 4-6. In cases 1, 2, 4 and 5, the tumours invaded the amygdala.In case 1, the patient showed aggressive behaviour before partial removal of the left amygdala during awake surgery; just after partial removal of left amygdala, the patient was calm and cooperative. In case 2, the patient showed aggressive behaviour when the tumour near the left amygdala was removed. In case 3, the patient showed aggressive behaviour when awakening during awake surgery. In case 4, the patient showed escape behaviour when removal of the tumour near the right amygdala was initiated. In cases 5 and 6, patients showed escape behaviour upon awakening and upon initiation of tumour removal from the temporal lobe.In conclusion, these results suggest that left or right temporal lesions might induce aggressive or escape behaviour during awake surgery, respectively, and that the amygdala on the respective side may play a role in these behaviours.",

This study aimed to identify subgroups of patients with psychotic disorders across diagnostic boundaries that show a specific symptom profile or response to treatment with antipsychotics, by measuring serum levels of BDNF and S100B. Methods The study sample consisted of 58 patients with DSM-IV psychotic disorders. Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History (CASH), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression scale for severity and improvement (CGI-S/CGI-I) were applied at baseline and after 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. At both time points, serum levels of BDNF and S100B were measured and compared with a matched control sample. Results Baseline BDNF and S100B levels were significantly lower in patients as compared with controls and did not change significantly during treatment. Dividing the patient sample according to baseline biochemical parameters (low and high 25% and middle 50%), no differences in symptom profiles or outcome were found with respect to BDNF. However, the subgroups with low and high S100B levels had higher PANSS scores than the middle subgroup. In addition, the high subgroup still showed significantly more negative symptoms after treatment, whereas the low subgroup showed more positive symptoms compared with the other subgroups. Conclusion Serum levels of BDNF and S100B are lowered in patients with psychotic disorders across diagnostic boundaries. The differences between high and low S100B subgroups suggest a relationship between S100B, symptom dimensions and treatment response, irrespective of diagnostic categories.",

Objective: Several studies have suggested that cytokine alterations could be related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF- β 1) is believed to be an important factor in regulation of inflammatory responses and to have anti-inflammatory effects. TGF- β 1 also has trophic effects on dopaminergic neurons. We tested the hypothesis TGF- β 1 is associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Methods: The polymorphisms at codon 10 (T869C) and codon 25 (G915C) of TGF- β 1 were analysed in 99 schizophrenia patients and 130 normal controls. At baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment, clinical symptoms were evaluated on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results: None of the subjects were polymorphic at codon 25. However, the C allele at codon 10 was more frequent in schizophrenia ( p = 0.05). Although schizophrenia group showed a higher tendency of allele frequency in the subjects with C allele ( p = 0.05), the allelic difference did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons ( p = 0.1). PANSS scores showed no significant correlation with genotypes. The genotype distribution was not significantly different between responders and non-responders. However, the C allele was more frequent among responders ( p = 0.03). Conclusion: These results suggest that the TGF- β 1 polymorphism is associated with therapeutic response to antipsychotics. However, further studies with larger numbers of subjects are needed to confirm the effect of TGF- β 1 in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Objective This study investigated the influence of ageing – in particular the decrease of gonadal hormone levels during the ageing process – on the memory and the levels of DNA damage in the hippocampus of female rats. Methods Three groups of female Wistar rats were investigated: Group I consisted of non-ovariectomised, adult animals (6 months old); Group II consisted of non-ovariectomised, aged animals (18 months old); and Group III consisted of ovariectomised, aged animals (18 months old). The memory of the animals in these groups was examined via novel object recognition and inhibitory avoidance tests. The hippocampus tissue samples of all animals were obtained via biopsy and used to quantify the DNA damage using a Comet Assay. Results According to our findings, the process of ageing results in a change during the behavioural tests. To prevent genotoxic damage to the hippocampus caused by the ageing process, lowered hormone levels seem to be part of a protective biochemical mechanism in the body of rats. Animals that were previously submitted to an ovariectomy adapted better to these lower levels of hormones. Conclusion Our results indicate that ovariectomy can provide beneficial long-term effects on the memory. However, this could be specific to the kind of memory examined, as the aversive memory deficits caused by ageing were not affected by ovariectomy.",

We evaluated the role of background constitutional affect of rats by studying the separation and reunion responses of infants from low and high positive affect genetic lines (i.e., differentially selected for High and Low 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs). Methods Infants from Low and High 50 kHz USV breeding lines were isolated from mothers and exposed to either social (familiar or unfamiliar bedding) or neutral (clean bedding) odour cues between two short isolation periods, and tested in homeothermic and hypothermic ambient temperatures. Negative affect was estimated by monitoring separation distress calls (35–45 kHz USVs). Results Low Line pups called at higher rates than High Line, and their rates were stable regardless of odour cue. In contrast, High Line pups increased vocalisations during the second compared with the first isolation periods and during exposure to both familiar and unfamiliar odour cues, but not to neutral odour. Furthermore, the greatest increase in USV emission was seen in the second isolation period following exposure to the unfamiliar odour. However, both lines showed comparable elevated distress USVs to the thermal stressor. Conclusion High Line animals, selected for a positive affective phenotype (50 kHz USVs), exhibited reduced separation anxiety responses in infancy, making this a promising animal model for the role of constitutional affective states in emotional responsivity and potential resilience against emotional disorders.",

We investigated structural abnormalities associated with autistic-like traits in patients with schizophrenia by voxel-based morphometry.Patients with schizophrenia and healthy subjects were evaluated by the adult version of the social responsiveness scale (SRS-A), which is sensitive to autistic traits and symptoms even under subthreshold conditions, and magnetic resonance imaging.There were significant decreases in the anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral hippocampi, cerebellums, and right insula of patients with schizophrenia, compared with healthy subjects. We found significant negative correlations of the social communication and interaction (SCI) score, a subscale of SRS-A, with grey matter volume in the left posterior superior temporal region of schizophrenia patients. When subscales of SCI were examined separately in schizophrenic patients, negative correlations were observed between the social cognition score and the volumes of the left posterior superior temporal region, and between social motivation and the posterior cingulate cortex.We found significant negative correlation between the SCI score and the grey matter volume in the left posterior superior temporal region of schizophrenia patients. This area was the region affected in previous studies of autistic spectrum disorders. Further, this area was associated with the theory of mind. Schizophrenia patients not necessarily show the impairment of SCI, nor this correlated region was not always the point with schizophrenia-specific change.

However, several non-neoplastic conditions, including acute and chronic inflammation and other inflammation-related conditions, are characterised by increased CEA concentrations. Bipolar disorder (BD) ranks seventh among the worldwide burden of non-fatal diseases. Inflammatory biomarkers have been considered as one of the main key pillars of a multifactorial approach for prediction of BD in an at-risk population. BP is accompanied by activation of inflammatory, cell-mediated and negative immunoregulatory cytokines.We measured the levels of CEA in serum samples from 44 individuals with euthymic BP out-patients and 45 healthy controls. Patients were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria. CEA was measured by an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.The mean serum CEA concentration was 2.36±1.52 and 1.77±0.98 µg/l in patients and controls, respectively. CEA levels were significantly increased in euthymic BP patients when compared with controls (p=0.031).This study suggests that CEA is increased in BD and supports a role for immune activation in the core pathological mechanisms of BP. CEA levels may be a secondary marker for diagnosing BP.",

We hypothesised that AUTS2 might be associated with the development of alcohol dependence. Therefore, in this exploratory study, we compared the genotype and allele frequencies of the polymorphisms rs6943555 and rs9886351 in the AUTS2 gene between patients with alcohol dependence and healthy control subjects living in a Japanese provincial prefecture. We also examined whether or not the haplotypes consisting of these polymorphisms are related to alcohol dependence.The subjects of this study consisted of 64 patients with alcohol dependence and 75 unrelated healthy people. The AUTS2 genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method.No significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of the polymorphisms AUTS2 rs6943555 and rs9886351 were found between alcohol dependence and control subjects. On the other hand, the frequencies of the AUTS2 haplotypes were significantly different between them, and the rs6943555 and rs9886351 A-A haplotype was associated with alcohol dependence (p=0.0187).This suggests that the rs6943555 and rs9886351 A-A haplotype might affect the vulnerability to alcohol dependence pathogenesis.

    "abstract": "Objective We investigated how different levels of prenatal exposure to testosterone influence physiological reactions to dyadic interactions, hypothesising that higher levels of prenatal testosterone are linked to greater physiological responses. Method Autonomic nervous system responses to dyadic interactions focussed on social or physical norms were measured. Physiological assessment of excitability (heart rate, facial temperature) and a behavioural assessment (Likert items judgements) were run on 25 neurotypical participants who had distinct testosterone exposure levels in utero . In utero exposure to testosterone was assessed measuring 2D : 4D (ratio between the lengths of the index and the ring fingers). Results Higher testosterone exposure participants showed greater physiological arousal: a greater heart rate decrease, independent from scenario type ( p &lt;0.05), and opposite facial temperature changes in response to social (increase) (vs.) physical scenarios (decrease) were found (Left-cheek: p &lt;0.05; Right-cheek: p &lt;0.05). Conclusion These findings suggest a long-term influence of prenatal environment on adults’ physiological responses during social situations.",

The stimulation paradigm consisted of the following cycle: rest, encoding of a string of two-syllable words, rest, and retrieval of the previously encoded words with the first consonant omitted.During the implicit retrieval task with emotionally neutral words, no distinct brain activity was observed in either the patients with OCD or healthy controls. On the other hand, during the retrieval task with unpleasant words, the patients with OCD showed predominant activity in the superior/middle temporal pole, medial superior frontal gyrus, and orbitofrontal cortex (uncorrected p<0.001, extent threshold: 30 voxels), whereas the healthy controls did not show any distinct regions of activation.This study revealed the differential brain activation patterns between patients with OCD and healthy controls during implicit memory tasks with unpleasant words. Our results suggest that the impact of negative emotion on implicit memory task may be associated with the symptomatology of OCD. This finding may be helpful for understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie implicit memory retrieval, particularly the interaction between emotion and cognition, in patients with OCD.",

    "abstract": "There is currently little consensus as to how burnout is best defined and measured, and whether the syndrome should be afforded clinical status. The latter issue would be advanced by determining whether burnout is a singular dimensional construct varying only by severity (and with some level of severity perhaps indicating clinical status), or whether a categorical model is superior, presumably reflecting differing 'sub-clinical' versus 'clinical' or 'burning out' vs 'burnt out' sub-groups. This study sought to determine whether self-diagnosed burnout was best modelled dimensionally or categorically.We recently developed a new measure of burnout which includes symptoms of exhaustion, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, insularity, and other psychological symptoms. Mixture modelling was utilised to determine if scores from 622 participants on the measure were best modelled dimensionally or categorically.A categorical model was supported, with the suggestion of a sub-syndromal class and, after excluding such putative members of that class, two other classes. Analyses indicated that the latter bimodal pattern was not likely related to current working status or differences in depression symptomatology between participants, but reflected subsets of participants with and without a previous diagnosis of a mental health condition.Findings indicated that sub-categories of self-identified burnout experienced by the lay population may exist. A previous diagnosis of a mental illness from a mental health professional, and therefore potentially a psychological vulnerability factor, was the most likely determinant of the bimodal data, a finding which has theoretical implications relating to how best to model burnout.",

The current study hypothesised that aspects of interoceptive awareness would mediate the effect of a yoga intervention on PTSD symptoms.We used data from our recently completed randomised controlled trial of a 16-week holistic yoga programme for veterans and civilians diagnosed with PTSD (n = 141) that offered weekly 90-minute sessions. We conducted a mediation analysis using interoceptive awareness and other variables that were associated with PTSD symptom reduction at mid-treatment and treatment end.Although measures of anxiety, interoceptive awareness, and spirituality were identified in individual mediator models, they were no longer found to be significant mediators when examined jointly in multiple mediator models. When examining the multiple mediator models, the strongest mediator of the yoga intervention on PTSD symptoms was mental well-being at mid-treatment and stigma at the treatment end. The total effect of yoga on CAPS and PCL at the treatment end mediated by stigma was 37.1% (-1.81/-4.88) and 33.6% (-1.91/-5.68), respectively.Investigation of mental well-being and mental illness stigma as potential mediators is warranted in future studies of yoga as a treatment for PTSD as they may prove to be important foci for yoga interventions.",

Associations of common gene variants with behaviour have been described as subject to birth cohort effects, especially if the behaviour is socially motivated. This study aimed to examine the association of NPY rs16147 and rs5574 with personality traits in highly representative samples of two birth cohorts of young adults, the samples having been formed during a period of rapid societal transition. Methods: Both birth cohorts (original n = 1238) of the Estonian Children Personality Behaviour and Health Study (ECPBHS) self-reported personality traits of the five-factor model at 25 years of age. Results: A significant interaction effect of the NPY rs16147 and rs5574 and birth cohort on Agreeableness was found. The T/T genotype of NPY rs16147 resulted in low Agreeableness in the older cohort (born 1983) and in high Agreeableness in the younger cohort (born 1989). The C/C genotype of NPY rs5574 was associated with higher Agreeableness in the younger but not in the older cohort. In the NPY rs16147 T/T homozygotes, the deviations from average in Agreeableness within the birth cohort were dependent on the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism. Conclusions: The association between the NPY gene variants and a personality domain reflecting social desirability is subject to change qualitatively in times of rapid societal changes, serving as an example of the relationship between the plasticity genes and environment. The underlying mechanism may involve the development of the serotonergic system.",

Viewing suicide as a state rather than a lifetime event provided new perspectives on suicide research. Objective: This study aimed to verify and complement SAs biomarkers of MDD with a recent SA sample. Methods: This study included 189 participants (60 healthy controls; 47 MDD patients with non-suicide (MDD-NSs), 40 MDD patients with suicide ideation (MDD-SIs) and 42 MDD patients with SA (MDD-SAs)). MDD patients with an acute SA time was determined to be within 1 week since the last SA. SUICIDALITY Part in MINI was applied to evaluate suicidality. Absolute powers in 14 frequency bands were extracted from subject’s resting-state electroencephalography data and compared within four groups. The relationship among suicidality, the number of SA and powers in significant frequency bands were investigated. Results: MDD-SIs had increased powers in delta, theta, alpha and beta band on the right frontocentral channels compared to MDD-NSs, while MDD-SAs had decreased powers in delta, beta and gamma bands on widely the right frontocentral and parietooccipital channels compared to MDD-SIs. Beta 1 power was the lowest in MDD-SAs and was modulated by the number of SA. The correlation between suicidality and beta 1 power was negative in MDD-SAs and positive in MDD-SIs. Conclusion: Reduced beta 1 (12–15 Hz) power could be essential in promoting suicidal behaviour in MDD. Research on recent SA samples contributes to a better understanding of suicide mechanisms and preventing suicidal behaviour in MDD.",

Alterations in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) have been considered in several recent ECT studies. We therefore found it worthwhile to perform a systematic review of the literature to examine if electrically induced seizures affect the permeability of the BBB. Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase were searched 16 November 2022. Studies with a direct measurement of BBB permeability in animals treated with modified electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) and in humans treated with ECT were included. Synthesis of results was narrative due to the low number of studies and differences in study designs. Results: Four animal and two human (31 participants) studies were included. In animals, two studies found increased BBB permeability to some smaller molecules after modified ECS, while the two other studies found marginally increased or unchanged permeability to albumin after treatment. In contrast, the human studies did not find increased BBB permeability to smaller molecules or albumin after ECT. Conclusion: Animal but not human studies support increased BBB permeability to some smaller molecules after electrically induced seizures. However, this conclusion is confined by the low number of studies and the lack of studies applying state-of-the-art methods. More studies using modern approaches to measuring of BBB permeability are warranted. Funding and Registration: The study was founded by Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of Denmark (grant number 61151-05) and was registered on PROSPERO before data extraction was initiated (CRD42022331385).",

Methods: Male and female Flinders sensitive line rats born to a dam that exercised during gestation, or not, were either maternally separated between PND02 and 16 and weaned on PND17 or not. Half of these animals then underwent a fourteen-day low-intensity exercise regimen from PND22. Baseline depressive-like behaviour was assessed on PND21 and then reassessed on PND36, whereafter hippocampal monoamine levels, redox state markers and metabolic markers relevant to mitochondrial function were measured. Results: Pre-pubertal exercise was identified as the largest contributing factor to the observed effects, where it decreased immobility time in the FST by 6%, increased time spent in the open arms of the EPM by 9%. Hippocampal serotonin and norepinephrine levels were also increased by 35% and 26%, respectively, whilst nicotinic acid was significantly decreased. Conclusion: These findings suggest that pre-pubertal low-intensity exercise induces beneficial biological alterations that could translate into antidepressant behaviour in genetically susceptible individuals.",

This paper will concentrate on the periictal disorders. These include the ictally driven psychoses, such as complex partial seizure status and absence status. There will then be a discussion of the postictal psychoses. It will be noted how these form a constant clinical picture, which sometimes goes unrecognized. The phenomenology may be typically paranoid or schizophrenia-like, andpatients often present in a setting of clear consciousness. The fascinating phenomenon of the lucid interval will be noted. Following this there will be some discussions on the management of these disorders. The rest of the paper will discuss the phenomenon of forced normalization, first discovered by Landolt. This often remains unrecognised, but is of interest to both neurology and psychiatry. Essentially this is about patients who, following suppression of seizures, develop an acute psychotic state or some other kind of behavior disorder. With the return of the seizures the behavior disorder resolves. Various theories in relationship to this condition will be noted, and the fascinating paradox that in psychiatry we give a seizure to resolve a psychosis, whereas in epileptology suppression of seizures can lead to a psychosis will be presented.",

    "abstract": "Early life environmental factors have been associated with altered predisposition to a variety of pathologies. A considerable literature examines pre- and postnatal factors associated with increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic (i.e. insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia) and psychiatric disease, and the importance of hormonal programming. The brain is exquisitely sensitive to environmental inputs during development and the stress responsiveness of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis has been shown to be both up- and down-regulated by early life exposure to limited nutrition, stress, altered maternal behaviors, synthetic steroids and inflammation. It has been suggested that peri-natal programming of HPA axis regulation might therefore contribute to metabolic and psychiatric disease etiology. In addition, glucocorticoids play modulatory roles regulating many aspects of immune function, notably controlling both acute and chronic inflammatory responses. Neuroendocrine–immune communication is bidirectional, and therefore it is expected that environmental factors altering HPA regulation have implications for stress effects on immune function and predisposition to inflammation. The impact of pre- and postnatal factors altering immune function, stress responsivity and predisposition to inflammatory disease are reviewed. It is also examined whether the early ‘immune environment’ might similarly influence predisposition to disease and alter neuroendocrine function. Evidence indicating a role for early life inflammation and infection as an important factor programming the neuroendocrine–immune axis and altering predisposition to disease is considered.",

Often, depression is regarded as a consequence of life events, including disabling diseases. The question addressed here is whether activation of the inflammatory response system (IRS) can cause depression. Epidemiological studies suggest that depression can be precipitated by bacterial or viral infections. In depressed patients, peripheral markers of the IRS are often increased. There is some evidence that some forms of depression are caused by a viral infection of the limbic system. More consistent are the observations that depression in diseases with active cerebral inflammatory processes (e.g. multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease) may concur. Direct evidence of a relation between depression and inflammation was found in post-mortem brain material of patients with a vascular depression. In both inflammatory brain diseases and in depression, a state-dependent increased hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis activity is seen. Animals studies have shown that intact cerebral serotonin systems are required for the activation of the IRS following an endotoxin challenge and that long-term treatment with antidepressants may change such a response. Gender differences between the prevalence of depression and inflammatory diseases are similar, as more females are affected. We hypothesize that cerebral or peripheral activation of the IRS may contribute to the course of some antidepressant treatment-resistant depressions. Clinical trials combining antidepressants and drugs that reduce the activation of the IRS may provide evidence for such proposed depression subtypes.",

Combined pharmacological and psychological treatment approaches have evolved empirically drawing upon standard treatments with emphasis on psychosocial approaches to substance misuse for psychotic disorders and pharmacological approaches for mood disorders. Advances in the biology of both disorders have started to inform their psychopharmacology. The specific role of atypical antipscychotics is highlighted. Further studies of the biology of comorbidity will impact the use of effective pharmaceuticals such as clozapine with dual effects on schizophrenia and substance misuse.",

    "abstract": "One of the most popular approaches in cognitive neuroscience has been to study the normal adult human brain. However, there are likely to be limits to the knowledge that can be obtained from such studies. If we assume that no single approach can ever provide us with knowledge of causative processes whereby the mind emerges from the brain, then we need to consider how to combine more disparate approaches. I aim to illustrate here how the parallel study of brain phylogeny, ontogeny and dysfunction may bring us towards an integrative understanding of fundamental aspects of cognitive neuroscience.A review of published literature in these research areas was carried out and representative articles selected.Comparative approaches, utilizing the extraordinary behavioural abilities as well as the structural and functional variants that evolution has thrown up across diverse groups of species, can inform the core neural systems that may be necessary and sufficient to support specific cognitive processes. Similarly, detailed studies of human brain development, focusing on structural and functional maturation correlated with temporal mapping of cognitive processes as they come 'on-line', may provide unique mechanistic insights. Finally, the study of brain dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression, may have the beneficial side-effect of greatly enhancing our understanding of healthy brain function.Each approach has its own epistemological advantages and disadvantages, but combined they may lead to more sophisticated, and empirically testable, models. In this review, I outline evidence for their utility, illustrate the approaches using specific examples and suggest how new advances in fields such as genomics, neurophysiology and neuroimaging may provide unprecedented opportunities in cognitive neuroscience.",

Methods The study population consisted of 98 Finnish individuals with MDD. They were assessed by the 107-item Temperament and Character Inventory temperament questionnaire (version IX) and the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). In general linear univariate models (GLM) for novelty seeking (NS) or reward dependence (RD) change age, gender, MADRS score change and BDNF and NRG1 genotypes were used as explaining explanatory variables. Results Mean comparisons between corresponding temperament dimensions and genotypes showed significant differences between NS change and BDNF rs61888800 T-carrying status (mean difference: GG 0.30, GT/TT 2.47, p =0.022, t -test) and between RD change and NRG1 rs3924999 A-carrying status (mean difference: GG 1.21, GA/AA −0.33, p =0.003). In GLM models for NS change the significant predictors comprised BDNF rs61888800 T-carrying status, age and MADRS score change (model 1), and additionally NRG1 rs6994992 T-carrying status (model 2). For RD change the predictors included NRG1 rs3924999 A-carrying status, age and MADRS score change (model 1) and additionally gender (model 2). Conclusion According to the current results both BDNF and NRG1 are associated with temperament traits during depression. These results warrant further studies regarding the impact of this association on depression recovery.",

This study aimed to further test the validity, scalability and responsiveness of the PDAS in older adults using independent ratings on the Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity (CGI-S) and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) as references.Methods Ratings were performed at admission and discharge at two old age psychiatric wards in Flanders, Belgium. In total, 62 older adults (mean age: 74.3 years) with psychotic depression were included. The PDAS was rated by trained nurses using the semi-structured PDAS interview. Senior psychiatrists scored the participants on the CGI-S. Psychologists or experienced nurses rated participants on the MADRS. Clinical validity was assessed by correlating the PDAS total scores with CGI-S ratings and MADRS total scores. Mokken analysis was performed to assess the scalability of the PDAS. Responsiveness was assessed by comparing the proportion of participants in remission (PDAS total score <8 at study baseline and endpoint).Results The Spearman correlation coefficients were 0.76 and 0.79 for the PDAS versus CGI-S and PDAS versus MADRS, respectively. The Mokken analysis yielded a Loevinger coefficient of 0.46, which is indicative of scalability. At admission, no participants met the PDAS remission criterion. At discharge, 54% (95% confidence interval: 47%-60%) of the patients met this criterion.Conclusion The PDAS appears to be a clinically valid, scalable and responsive measure of the severity of psychotic depression in older adults.",

Patients with SZ made more resolution errors than HC and exhibited a greater N400 congruity effect in ambiguous conditions than BD. In BD, the opposite N400 congruity effect was observed in ambiguous conditions.Results indicated differences in semantic processing between BD and SZ. Further studies with larger populations are needed in order to develop neurophysiological markers of these disorders.In ambiguous conditions, patients with SZ exhibited a greater N400 difference between congruent and incongruent conditions than patients with BD.In ambiguous conditions, patients with SZ exhibited greater N400 amplitude in incongruent conditions than in congruent ones, whereas patients with BD exhibited the opposite N400 congruity effect.Ambiguity resolution results suggest that patients with SZ have difficulty considering the context, while patients with BD overactivate the dominant meaning of homophones and have difficulty inhibiting it.",

The frequencies of CAMDs in 164 patients with schizophrenia were compared to those in 156 age- and sex-matched controls. Results: Severe fatigue, seizures, constipation and diabetes were significantly more frequent in patients with schizophrenia than in control subjects and apparently not related to pharmacological treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective and rationale: Animal models are critical for the study of mental disorders and their treatments but are repeatedly criticized for problems with validity and reproducibility. One approach to enhance validity and reproducibility of models is to use test batteries rather than single tests. Yet, a question regarding batteries is whether one can expect a consistent individual behavioural phenotype in mice across tests that can be presumed to be part of the same construct. This study was designed to explore the relationship between the behaviours of mice across tests in some variations of test batteries for depression- and anxiety-like behaviours. Methods: Female and male healthy, intact, and untreated mice from the ICR and black Swiss strains were used in four separate experiments. With some variations, mice were exposed to a battery of behavioural tests representing affective- and anxiety-like behaviours. Data were analysed for differences between sexes and for correlations between behaviours within and across the tests in the battery. Results: No differences were found between the sexes. With very few exceptions, we found correlations within tests (when one test has more than one measure or is repeated) but not across different tests within the battery. Conclusions: The results cast some doubt on the utility of behavioural test batteries to represent different facets of emotional behaviour in healthy intact outbred mice, without any interventions or treatments. Additional studies are designed to explore whether stronger relationship between the tests will appear after manipulations or drug treatments.",

Methods: This study involved secondary analysis of a placebo-controlled randomised trial ( n = 163).

Results: In the NAC-treated group, no difference was observed in serum IL-6 and TAC levels after 16 weeks of treatment with NAC or CT. However, results from a moderator analysis showed that in the CT group, lower IL-6 levels at baseline was a significant moderator of MADRS χ 2 (df) = 4.90, p = 0.027) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I, χ 2 (df) = 6.28 p = 0.012). In addition, IL-6 was a non-specific but significant predictor of functioning (based on the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS)), indicating that individuals with higher IL-6 levels at baseline had a greater improvement on SOFAS regardless of their treatment ( p = 0.023). Conclusion: Participants with lower IL-6 levels at baseline had a better response to the adjunctive treatment with the mitochondrial-enhancing agents in terms of improvements in MADRS and CGI-I outcomes.",

Multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the association of baseline characteristics (age, sex, socio-economic status, educational status, duration, and severity of illness) with improvement in cognition (i.e. attention and face memory) following YT. Factors associated with acceptability were identified by comparing baseline demographic variables between screened and enrolled participants as well as completers versus non-completers.Enrolled participants were younger than screened persons who declined participation (t = 2.952, p = 0.003). No other characteristics were associated with study enrollment or completion. Regarding efficacy, schooling duration was nominally associated with greater and sustained cognitive improvement on a measure of facial memory. No other baseline characteristics were associated with efficacy of YT in the open trial, the RCT, or the combined samples (n = 148).YT is acceptable even among younger individuals with SZ. It also enhances specific cognitive functions, regardless of individual differences in selected psychosocial characteristics. Thus, yoga could be incorporated as adjunctive therapy for patients with SZ. Importantly, our results suggest cognitive dysfunction is remediable in persons with SZ across the age spectrum.",

Our objective was to determine if a standardised commercial ginseng extract, G115®, could reduce the signs of behavioural despair commonly observed in animal models of depression either alone or in combination with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (N = 51) were divided into four groups: vehicle control, G115® ginseng root extract, fluoxetine and fluoxetine plus G115®. Rats were trained to voluntarily consume treatments twice daily for 14 days and were then tested in an open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swim test (FST). Post-mortem hippocampal and prefrontal cortex tissue was analysed for expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) by western blot. Results: One-way Analysis of Variance revealed no significant group differences in the OF or plus-maze performance on any variable examined. In the FST, fluoxetine significantly reduced immobility time and increased latency to immobility. The effects of fluoxetine were further significantly potentiated by co-administration of G115®. Post-mortem tissue analysis revealed significant group differences in BDNF expression in the left hippocampus and left prefrontal cortex without any accompanying changes in TrkB expression. Conclusions: We conclude that oral G115® significantly potentiates the antidepressant-like effect of fluoxetine in the FST in the absence of potentially confounding effects on locomotion and anxiety.",

Results: We included 18 persons (11 with severe VI, 3 with light perception and 4 with no light perception) who met screening criteria for sSAD/SAD in a single-arm, assessor-blinded trial of 6 weeks light therapy. In the 12 persons who completed the 6 weeks of treatment, the post-treatment depression score was reduced (p < 0.001), and subjective wellbeing (p = 0.01) and sleep quality were improved (p = 0.03). In 6/12 participants (50%), the post-treatment depression score was below the cut-off set for remission. In four participants with VI, side effects (glare or transiently altered visual function) led to dropout or exclusion. Conclusion: Light therapy was associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms in persons with severe VI/blindness. Eye safety remains a concern in persons with residual sight.",

The aim of the current study was to investigate whether returning to online classes, even not presential, during the social isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic, affected the mental health of university students.Forty students (10 men and 30 women) (age, 22.3 ± 3.8 years; body mass, 62.5 ± 17.8 kg; height, 165.6 ± 8.7 cm) from undergraduate health courses participated in the study. The students answered a self-administered questionnaire designed to gather personal and quarantine information as well as information about the frequency of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms. The questionnaire was answered before and after the return to online classes.There was a significantly lower frequency of depression symptoms after the return to online classes (Z = -2.27; p = 0.02). However, there was no difference in anxiety symptoms before and after returning to online classes (Z = -0.51; p = 0.61).Return to online classes positively impacted the mental health (decrease of frequency of depression symptoms) of university students. Future studies are needed to observe whether the changes observed after returning to school are maintained over time.",

    "abstract": "Objective: In this retrospective study, we tested the hypothesis that patients with epilepsy (PWE) with moderate to major depression have more severe memory deficits than PWE with mild depression or no depression. Methods: Hundred and thirty-nine patients with chronic epilepsy were studied with the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and a neuropsychological-screening battery the day after admission on a specialised ward for PWE. For this study the data from the Memo-test for verbal memory and from the Benton-test for non-verbal memory were taken into account. For testing of the hypothesis of independence of memory deficits and grade of depression we performed a statistical analysis. Results: Eighty-three patients (59.7%) had a pathological score in the SDS, but only 36 (25.9%) scored in the range of a moderate to major depression. When all 83 patients with a pathological score in the SDS were taken into account, these patients did not differ on any cognitive measure from those without pathological score in SDS. The only significant association in our study was found between pathological results in immediate verbal recall and a score in the SDS for moderate to major depression ( p = 0.038). Conclusion: Minor depressive symptoms may be a response to chronic illness without any impact on cognitive functioning. Nevertheless, a verbal memory deficit associated with major depression was observed in our study even in the presence of many confounding factors. This may be a hint for an association of severe depressive symptoms with left temporal dysfunction in PWE.",

Obstructive sleep apnoea and schizophrenia: a primer for psychiatrists Objective: The main objective of this review is to improve psychiatric clinician awareness of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and its potential consequences in patients with schizophrenia. This article will also discuss the diagnosis and treatment options for OSA while considering the significant role psychiatrists can play in facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of OSA. Data sources: Ovid, Medline and PsychInfo databases were searched for articles between 1960 and 2010. Search terms used were Sleep apnoea or apnoea and schizophrenia or psychosis . The number of articles retrieved was 38. Articles were carefully reviewed for any data pertinent to OSA in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusions: OSA is a common disorder that is frequently unrecognised. As a chronic breathing condition, OSA is associated with adverse health outcomes and high mortality. OSA may co-occur with schizophrenia or evolve over time, especially with weight gain. The diagnosis should be considered whenever a patient presents with risk factors or clinical manifestations that are highly suggestive of OSA. Those who report snoring, daytime sleepiness and are obese or have a large neck circumference should be considered for an OSA diagnosis. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of OSA can reduce daytime sleepiness, improve cardiovascular and other medical conditions, as well as reduce mortality. Psychiatrists can play very important role in suspecting OSA in their patients and making the initial referral. Furthermore, behavioural management, especially promoting weight loss and smoking cessation, are effective components of OSA treatment that psychiatrists are positioned to facilitate with their patients.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 1% in most of the populations studied. SCZ is multifactorial with the contribution of multiple susceptibility genes that could act in conjunction with epigenetic processes and environmental factors. There is some evidence supporting the association between genetic variants in dysbindin (DTNBP1) gene and SCZ in populations. In this study, we investigated the association between polymorphisms P1635 and P1655 in dysbindin gene with SCZ.Totally, 115 unrelated patients with SCZ and 117 unrelated healthy volunteers were studied. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood. Genotyping was done with the PCR-RFLP method. The allele and genotype associations were analysed with X 2 test. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct p values for multiple comparisons.The results showed no significant difference between patients and controls in allelic frequencies or genotypic distributions of SNP P1635 (p = 0.809), but a significant difference between the case and control groups for SNP P1655 (p = 0.009) was found. We could also find a significant positive association between A-C haplotype and SCZ (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.18-2.42; p = 0.004, p c = 0.02) and a protective effect for A-G haplotype (p = 0.003, OR = 0.57, 95% CI 1.18-2.42; p = 0.003, p c = 0.02).This study may provide further support for the association between SNP polymorphisms in DTNBP1 and SCZ in the Iranian population. Studies with more markers and subjects for various populations will be necessary to understand the genetic contribution of the gene to the development of SCZ.",

Clinical Case: We describe a case of a 28-year-old man with refractory schizophrenia that developed palilalia with 300 mg of clozapine. In the patient evaluation we found unspecific alterations in the electroencephalogram, with normal blood tests and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Palilalia disappeared with lowering doses of clozapine. Discussion: The appearance of palilalia induced by clozapine is a rare pharmacologic side-effect which physicians should be familiarised with when evaluating this symptom presentation.",

Moreover, it is also often administered for short-term treatment of persistent aggression in people with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's dementia. A possible association between risperidone and venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been described. We intended to verify the dimension of the problem in our hospital setting. Methods: We considered all consecutive patients hospitalised in our Internal Medicine Department from January 2004 to December 2010, who were treated with risperidone and presented pulmonary embolism (PE). Results: Four cases of patients, apparently free from the well-known major risk factors for VTE (i.e. cancer, prolonged immobilisation, acute cardiac and respiratory failure, infections), who presented PE associated with risperidone therapy, were reported in details. Conclusions: A review of the available literature, discussing the possible different pathogenic reasons for this increased risk of VTE, is provided.",

Methods: One hundred and forty-eight stroke patients were evaluated. The presence of depression was compared with those of 100 healthy controls without stroke, from the same region. Depression was accepted as present or not present after history and clinical evaluation according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV. Socio-demographic variables, other stroke risk factors and the time of diagnosis of depression (how many year or month they got depression) were recorded. Results: Gender and mean age of patients and controls were similar in comparison. Depression was diagnosed in 27 patients and 24 controls ( p &gt; 0.05). The time period passed after diagnosis of depression was longer in stroke patients in comparison to controls ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The risk of stroke should be considered in elderly with long-term depression.

Subsequently, a number of multidimensional alternatives have been proposed based on statistical procedures or theoretical considerations. At the same time, the study of the neurobiological underpinnings of personality and personality disorders has created a better understanding of etiological and pathogenetic processes responsible for these chronic disorders. The findings of these studies corroborate some of the major findings of statistical studies regarding the nature of the frequent comorbidity of axis II disorders.

However, acute mood changes, such as the antidepressive effect of sleep deprivation, diurnal variations of mood and their interrelationship, are commonly put forward as evidence of the importance of circadian dysregulations in affective disorders. The purpose of the present study is to obtain more insight in the mechanisms underlying these mood changes. The results will be discussed in the context of a recently postulated non-chronobiological explanation. Earlier studies have suggested that the relationship between diurnal variation of mood and the response to total sleep deprivation (TSD) is clear and unambiguous: improvement of mood during the day prior to TSD (a positive diurnal variation) is followed by a positive response (mood improvement) to TSD, while no improvement or deterioration of mood during the day prior to TSD (a negative diurnal variation) may result in no, or even a negative, TSD response (for references see Van den Hoofdakker). However, these conclusions were based on the results from cross-sectional studies, comparing single TSD effects across individuals. Comparison of sleep deprivation effects within individuals, however, revealed that the course of mood during the day prior to TSD is irrelevant for the TSD response. Accordingly, a favourable response to TSD appeared to be related to the patient's propensity to show diurnal mood variations per se , irrespective of their direction.",

The underlying mechanism of alcoholism associated with anxiety has rarely been examined using experimental methodologies. The present study in healthy volunteers tested whether alcohol consumption reduces anxiety associated with a panic-challenge procedure (35% CO2 challenge).The study design was placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized. Eight healthy volunteers were enrolled; all subjects had an alcohol and a placebo oral intake according to a crossover design. After each consumption the subjects underwent the 35% CO2 challenge and a series of anxiety symptom assessments.After the alcohol intake, the subjects presented a significant reduction in the anxiety state associated with the challenge procedure. The Panic Symptom List score is significantly lower after alcohol intake (P = 0.032), as compared with the placebo, and the Visual Analogue Anxiety Scale shows a trend to be lower after alcohol intake (P = 0.111).Moderate doses of alcohol acutely decrease the response to a 35% CO2 challenge in healthy volunteers. These results lend support to the pharmacological anxiolytic effect of alcohol and suggest that this property may reinforce the drinking behaviour among those with high levels of anxiety.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between immune cells, neurotransmitters and the neuroendocrinological systems plays a role in affective disorders, especially depression. Although panic disorder (PD) shares a lot of features with depression, it is clearly a distinct disorder. Reports on immunological parameters in PD don't provide a clear picture of the immunological status of PD patients. This can partly be attributed to methodological differences between studies and small patient groups.The present study aims to assemble all studies on immunological parameters in PD in order to combine all available data to gain a broader perspective on this matter.PubMed was searched for studies describing immunological parameters in PD patients without comorbid disorders or medication use. All studies had to include a healthy control group and the outcome measures had to be shared by at least one other study.Fourteen articles were found. Although the T-lymphocytic branch and the innate immune system were normal, the B-lymphocytic branch showed some differences between PD patients and healthy controls. B-cell counts were increased in PD patients, which was underlined by increased human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR counts and increased immunoglobulin A levels. However, B-cell activity following mitogen stimulation was normal.PD patients show increased B-cell numbers. The finding that B-cell activity is not increased can possibly be attributed to functional exhaustion of these cells. The meaning of this finding remains unclear, although it may be potentially important in affective disorders as the same has been found in depression.",

    "abstract": "Comorbid personality disorders have been shown to be a prominent factor affecting symptom severity and course in bipolar disorder (BD) patients. Bipolar patients with personality disorder had more relapses, poorer prognosis and worse treatment response than those without an axis II diagnosis.We evaluated the prevalence rate of comorbid personality disorder in 74 bipolar I disorder cases who were in remission and tried to elucidate the possible relationship between comorbid axis II disorders and prognosis, severity and treatment features of BD cases.Diagnosis of all personality disorder comorbidities was evaluated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Axis-II Disorders (SCID-II), while the general psychopathology level was assessed using the Symptom Check List (SCL-90-R). A questionnaire for acquiring sociodemographic and clinical variables was also used.Sixty-two per cent of bipolar I patients in this sample had at least one comorbid axis II disorder. The most common comorbid cluster of personality disorder was cluster C (48.6%), followed by cluster A (25.7%) and cluster B (20.3%) personality disorders. Assessment of demographic and clinical variables revealed that bipolar patients with comorbid personality disorder were mainly female, had multiple affective episodes, and had attempted suicide more often than patients without personality disorder.The results of this study suggest that comorbid personality disorder might alter the course of BD and result in a poorer prognosis and more severe psychopathology. Further prospective controlled studies minimizing the bias of interviewers and other confounding factors would help us to understand the pure impact of personality disorder on the course of BD, its prognosis and response to treatment.",

Six months later, spasticity, extrapyramidal rigidity and dysarthria were added to the picture. Eventually, the patient became mute and wheel-chair bound. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was consistent with iron depositions in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Conclusions: In this case, the combination of clinical and MRI findings was consistent with Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome.

    "abstract": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and validated technique used to treat various psychiatric conditions. It triggers an artificially-induced seizure. This seizure is defined using several parameters such as the amount of energy, duration, frequency, pulse width and intensity. Efficacy and adverse events depend on the amount of energy delivered. Due to technical control, the amount of energy delivered by our unit's ECT device was limited to 614 mC, 60% of the maximum possible output of the device. We wondered if lowering the dose would lead to better seizure quality among maintenance ECT patients. We assessed seizure quality based on the EEG, using a validated tool created by MacPherson. Two evaluators independently rated the seizures. Pre- and post-control scores were compared using Student's t-test for paired samples. We analysed data from 15 patients. Mean age was 65 years old. Twelve had depressive disorder, two had schizophrenia and one had schizo-affective disorder. Mean duration of seizure before control was 41.1 s [95% confidence interval (95CI)=26.1, 51.1]. The mean MacPherson's score was 20.3 (95CI=16.2, 24.4). After control, the mean MacPherson's score was 28.2 (23.1, 33.3), showing a significant difference with the pre-control dataset (p=0.032; t=-2.4; df=14). Specifically, peak mid-ictal amplitude increased from 6.9 (95CI=5.1, 8.7) to 10.0 (95CI=7.2, 12.8). Other sub-scores remained unchanged. Lowering the energy delivered led to an overall increase of seizure quality among our sample. This highlights the necessity and utility of retitration during ECT maintenance, possibly leading to better management of our patients.",

The aim of the present study was to explore the possible effect of an SSRI in situations of unconditioned or limited conditioned fear. Methods Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered a single dose of an SSRI, escitalopram, before acquisition or expression of context conditioned fear, where noise bursts were used as the unconditioned stimulus. Freezing was assessed as a measure of unconditioned fear (=the acute response to noise bursts) or conditioned fear (=the response to the context), respectively. Results Noise bursts elicited an acute increase in freezing but no robust conditioned response 7 days after exposure. Administration of escitalopram before testing exacerbated the freezing response during presentation of the unconditioned stimulus and also unmasked a conditioned response; in contrast, administration of escitalopram prior to acquisition did not influence the conditioned response. Conclusion The data suggest that freezing in rats exposed to a stimulus inducing relatively mild fear may be enhanced by acute pretreatment with an SSRI regardless of whether the freezing displayed by the animals is an acute unconditioned response to the stimulus in question or a conditioned response to the same stimulus.",

Linear regression models assessed the association of psychological distress with serum CRP, adjusting for possible confounding factors.The analytic sample comprised n = 3944 individuals (mean age = 40 and sex = 36% males).

We examined correlations of GSH levels with age, age at onset of illness, duration of illness, and clinical symptoms.We found a negative correlation between GSH levels and age at onset (r = -0.46, p = 0.015), and a trend-level positive relationship between GSH and duration of illness (r = 0.34, p = 0.076).Our findings are consistent with a possible compensatory upregulation of the AODS with longer duration of illness and suggest that the AODS may play a role in schizophrenia.",

This problem is especially relevant in the field of brain diseases and translational neuropsychiatry.Methods:Here, we discuss if the 3R concept could be part of the translational crisis.Results:The focus has been on the 2nd R, which is to reduce the variation between the experimental animals, so that the number of animals per study can be reduced. However, the risk of obtaining false results has also increased. We, therefore, recommend that researchers use a broader perspective as also suggest by Russell and Burch whom founded the 3Rs when considering the 3R concept, which involves the translational aspects described in detail in their 3R book from 1959.Conclusion:This may together with systematic reviews and well-designed and well-performed animal studies and accurate reporting of the results, indeed contribute to solving the translational crisis in preclinical research.",

    "abstract": "We have often observed dementia symptoms or severe neurocognitive decline in the long-term course of schizophrenia. While there are epidemiological reports that patients with schizophrenia are at an increased risk of developing dementia, there are also neuropathological reports that the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in schizophrenia is similar to that in normal controls. It is difficult to distinguish, based solely on the clinical symptoms, whether the remarkable dementia symptoms and cognitive decline seen in elderly schizophrenia are due to the course of the disease itself or a concomitant neurocognitive disease. Neuropathological observation is needed for discrimination.We conducted a neuropathological search on three cases of schizophrenia that developed cognitive decline or dementia symptoms after a long illness course of schizophrenia. The clinical symptoms of total disease course were confirmed retrospectively in the medical record. We have evaluated neuropathological diagnosis based on not only Hematoxylin-Eosin and Klüver-Barrera staining specimens but also immunohistochemical stained specimens including tau, β-amyloid, pTDP-43 and α-synuclein protein throughout clinicopathological conference with multiple neuropathologists and psychiatrists.The three cases showed no significant pathological findings or preclinical degenerative findings, and poor findings consistent with symptoms of dementia were noted.Although the biological background of dementia symptoms in elderly schizophrenic patients is still unclear, regarding the brain capacity/cognitive reserve ability, preclinical neurodegeneration changes in combination with certain brain vulnerabilities due to schizophrenia itself are thought to induce dementia syndrome and severe cognitive decline.",

Objective: Our aim was to establish whether the presence or absence of fully functioning cytochrome P450 2D6, 2C19 and 2C9 genetic alleles was associated with suicide in patients receiving venlafaxine treatment. Method: Authorisation from the NSW State Coroner to perform post-mortem genetic testing was obtained for 11 samples from deceased persons who committed suicide during treatment with venlafaxine (VENADR study). Results: All patients, but one, have at least one copy of the loss-of-function, altered or decreased cytochrome P450 enzyme activity allele. Four patients' results reveal loss-of-function genotypes, while all others were found to have diminished enzyme activity polymorphisms. Seven patients had multiple altered function polymorphisms, which included CYP2D6, CYP2C19 or CYP2C9. Conclusion: Our preliminary limited data show that neurotoxicity development, which manifests as suicide while on venlafaxine treatment, probably correlates with a higher prevalence of gene copies of altered functioning cytochrome P450 genetic polymorphisms.",

Methods: We scored and interpreted the Rorschach protocols of eight carefully diagnosed PLOSL patients according to Exner's Comprehensive System. The structural variables in the Rorschach are organised around the seven dimensions of personality functioning that they assess: coping style and resources, organising information, perceiving events, forming concepts and ideas, handling of emotions, self-perception and interpersonal perception. Results: As a group PLOSL patients had many personality liabilities when contrasted with typical avoidant non-patient adults. A majority of patients showed an avoidant coping style (Lambda &gt; 0.99), low productivity and poor verbal output in the low number of responses and few Blends. Also, they showed limited available resources to cope with problem-solving test. Problems in organising information efficiently, and perceiving events realistically as well as signs of disturbed thinking and concept formation were observed in many patients. Handling of emotions was characterised by avoidance of emotional stimuli but at the same time poor affect modulation. Capacities to view themselves and others were thoroughly limited. Conclusions: PLOSL tends to have repercussions throughout the personality functioning. In line with clinical findings and later neuroradiological and neuropathological examinations the Rorschach revealed personality features typical for frontal type of dementia.",

In addition, the functioning of the four WM components was compared among dependents of various types of drugs.In total, 128 chronic drug dependents participated in this study. Their average age was 38.48 years, and they were classified into four drug-dependence groups. Chronic drug dependents were compared with a 36-participant control group that had a mean age of 37.6 years. A WM test battery that comprised eight tests and that assessed each of four WM components was administered to each participant.Compared with the control group, all four groups of drug dependents had significantly poorer test performance on all of the WM tasks. Among the four groups of drug users, the polydrug group had the poorest performance scores on each of the eight tasks, and the performance scores of the marijuana group were the least affected. Finally, the forward digit span task and the logical memory tasks were less sensitive than other tasks when differentiating between marijuana users and the normal participants.The four components of WM are impaired among chronic drug dependents. These results have implications for the development of tools, classification methods and therapeutic strategies for drug dependents.",

A case of aripiprazole-induced TD successfully treated with another atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine, is described and discussed in line with the recent literature. Results: TD showed rapid improvement with discontinuation of aripiprazole and initiation of quetiapine. Conclusion: Further studies are needed to ascertain the differential effects and side effects of second-generation antipsychotics in terms of TD.",

Medical, neurologic and psychiatric histories, physical examination findings, results of laboratory, imaging and neurophysiologic investigations and treatment response with medications and ECT were recorded. Results: Twenty patients (83%) showed a positive response to treatment with ECT. None had worsening of depression after the ECT or experienced exacerbation of post-stroke neurological deficits. Three patients suffered from minor complications of ECT (prolonged confusion or short-term memory problems). Conclusions: This review supports the use of ECT after a stroke with appropriate clinical observation. The treatment was well tolerated and the majority obtained clinical benefit.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The role of neurological proteins in the development of bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) remains elusive now. The current study aims to explore the potential genetic correlations of plasma neurological proteins with BD and SCZ. Methods: By using the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of BD and SCZ (including 41,917 BD cases, 11,260 SCZ cases, and 396,091 controls) derived from the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium website (PGC) and a recently released GWAS of neurological proteins (including 750 individuals), we performed a linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analysis to detect the potential genetic correlations between the two common psychiatric disorders and each of the 92 neurological proteins. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis was then applied to assess the bidirectional causal relationship between the neurological proteins identified by LDSC, BD and SCZ. Results: LDSC analysis identified one neurological protein, NEP , which shows suggestive genetic correlation signals for both BD (coefficient = −0.165, p value = 0.035) and SCZ (coefficient = −0.235, p value = 0.020). However, those association did not remain significant after strict Bonferroni correction. Two sample MR analysis found that there was an association between genetically predicted level of NEP protein, BD (odd ratio [OR] = 0.87, p value = 1.61 × 10 −6 ) and SCZ (OR = 0.90, p value = 4.04 × 10 −6 ). However, in the opposite direction, there is no genetically predicted association between BD, SCZ, and NEP protein level. Conclusion: This study provided novel clues for understanding the genetic effects of neurological proteins on BD and SCZ.",

Previous studies suggest high test-retest reliability of PPI and potential correlation with working memory (WM). Here, we aimed to validate and extend the test-retest reliability of PPI in healthy humans and its correlation with WM performance.We applied an acoustic startle PPI paradigm with four different prepulse intensities (64, 68, 72 and 76 dB) and two different WM tasks [n-back, change detection task (CDT)] in a group of 26 healthy adults (final sample size n = 23). To assess test-retest reliability, we performed all tests on two separate days ~27 days (range: 21-32 days) apart.We were able to confirm high test-retest reliability of the PPI with a mean intraclass correlation (ICC) of > 0.80 and significant positive correlation of PPI with n-back but not with CDT performance. Detailed analysis showed that PPI across all prepulse intensities significantly correlated with both the 2-back and 0-back conditions, suggesting regulation by cross-conditional processes (e.g. attention). However, when removing the 0-back component from the 2-back data, we found a specific and significant correlation with WM for the 76-dB PPI condition.With the present study, we were able to confirm the high test-retest reliability of the PPI in humans and could validate and expand on its correlation with WM performance.",

Methods: Haloperidol was administered either sub-chronically via the intraperitoneal (IP) route or chronically via the intramuscular (IM) route to six experimental groups only or in combination with CBD. VCM and oxidative stress parameters were assessed at different time points after the last dose of medication. Results: Oral CBD (5 mg/kg) attenuated the VCM produced by sub-chronic administration of haloperidol (5 mg/kg) but had minimal effects on the VCM produced by chronic administration of haloperidol (50 mg/kg). In both sub-chronic and chronic haloperidol groups, there were significant changes in brain antioxidant parameters compared with CBD only and the control groups. The sub-chronic haloperidol-only group had lower glutathione activity compared with sub-chronic haloperidol before CBD and the control groups; also, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl activities were increased in the sub-chronic (IP) haloperidol only group compared with the CBD only and control groups. Nitric oxide activity was increased in sub-chronic haloperidol-only group compared to the other groups; however, the chronic haloperidol group had increased malondialdehyde activity compared to the other groups. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that CBD ameliorated VCM in the sub-chronic haloperidol group before CBD, but marginally in the chronic haloperidol group before CBD. There was increased antioxidant activity in the sub-chronic group compared to the chronic group.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Despite mounting evidence demonstrates circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs) quantitative changes in depression, no study has investigated cEPC functions in major depressive disorder (MDD). We investigated the role of cEPC adhesive and apoptotic functions in MDD. Methods: We recruited 68 patients with MDD and 56 healthy controls (HCs). The depression symptoms, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, subjective cognitive dysfunction, quality of life, and functional disability were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale (DSSS), Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), respectively. Working memory and executive function were assessed using a 2-back task and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Inflammatory marker (soluble interleukin-6 receptor, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-1), cEPC adhesive, and apoptotic levels were measured using in vitro assays. Results: The MDD patients showed significantly lower cEPC adhesive levels than the HCs, and this difference in adhesive function remained statistically significant even after adjusting for inflammatory marker levels. The cEPC adhesion levels were in inverse correlations with commission and omission errors in 2-back task, the percent perseverative response and percent perseverative errors in WCST, and the DSSS and SDS scores, but in positive correlations with SF-12 physical and mental component scores. cEPC apoptotic levels did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusion: The findings indicate that cEPC adhesive function is diminished in MDD and impacts various aspects of cognitive and psychosocial functions associated with the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Sialorrhea is a common and uncomfortable adverse effect of clozapine, and its severity varies between patients. The aim of the study was to select broadly genes related to the regulation of salivation and study associations between sialorrhea and dry mouth and polymorphisms in the selected genes. Methods: The study population consists of 237 clozapine-treated patients, of which 172 were genotyped. Associations between sialorrhea and dry mouth with age, sex, BMI, smoking, clozapine dose, clozapine and norclozapine serum levels, and other comedication were studied. Genetic associations were analyzed with linear and logistic regression models explaining sialorrhea and dry mouth with each SNP added separately to the model as coefficients. Results: Clozapine dose, clozapine or norclozapine concentration and their ratio were not associated with sialorrhea or dryness of mouth. Valproate use ( p = 0.013) and use of other antipsychotics ( p = 0.015) combined with clozapine were associated with excessive salivation. No associations were found between studied polymorphisms and sialorrhea. In analyses explaining dry mouth with logistic regression with age and sex as coefficients, two proxy-SNPs were associated with dry mouth: epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (ERBB4) rs3942465 (adjusted p = 0.025) and tachykinin receptor 1 (TACR1) rs58933792 (adjusted p = 0.029). Conclusion: Use of valproate or antipsychotic polypharmacy may increase the risk of sialorrhea. Genetic variations in ERBB4 and TACR1 might contribute to experienced dryness of mouth among patients treated with clozapine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Some observational studies have unexpectedly reported the association of cholesterol metabolism with mental and psychological disorders, but a firm conclusion has not been drawn. The aim of this study was to further investigate the effects of peripheral cholesterol traits and cholesterol-lowering therapy on depression and schizophrenia using a Mendelian randomisation approach. Methods: Instrumental variables meeting the correlation, independence and exclusivity assumptions were extracted from one genome-wide association study for predicting total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and nonHDL cholesterol. Instrumental variables for total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were also adopted to predict statin use (a type of cholesterol-lowering drug); these instrumental variables should not only satisfy the above assumptions but also be close to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR, the target gene of statins) on the chromosome. Three methods (including inverse variance weighted) were used to conduct causal inference of the above exposures with depression and schizophrenia. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess horizontal pleiotropy. Results: Higher levels of peripheral nonHDL cholesterol were nominally associated with a decreased risk of depression ( P = 0.039), and higher levels of HMGCR-mediated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were nominally related to a decreased risk of depression ( P = 0.013 and P = 0.028, respectively). Moreover, these cholesterol traits cannot affect the risk of schizophrenia. Sensitivity analysis did not reveal any horizontal pleiotropy. Conclusion: The study provided some interesting, but less sufficient, evidence that nonHDL cholesterol may have a protective effect on depression, and lowering cholesterol using statins might increase the risk of the disease.",

Methods: The study group was composed of twenty patients with OCD and twenty healthy controls. NAA, CHO, and CRE values in the hippocampal region using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) were measured. Participants’ defense styles were ascertained by administering the Defense Style Questionnaire-40. Results: The patient group’s NAA levels were considerably lower than the control group’s on both sides of the hippocampus. The levels of CHO and CRE did not significantly differ between the two groups. The following statistically significant correlations were discovered: in the comparison group, there were negative correlations between the scores of mature defense styles and the right and left CHO levels, as well as between the immature defense mechanism scores and the right NAA levels in both the patient and control groups. In the patient group, there were also negative correlations between the left NAA values and the scores of mature defense styles. Conclusion: OCD patients have lower levels of NAA in the hippocampus.

We administered test of variables of attention (TOVA; visual mode) to 44 participants with various neuropsychiatric diagnoses before and after 12 sessions of tACS treatment. Alternating currents at 2.0 mA were delivered to the electrode positions F4 and P4, following the 10–20 EEG convention, for 20 mins in each session. We observed significant improvement across 3 indices of the TOVA, including reduction of variability in reaction time ( p = 0.0002), increase in d-Prime (separability of targets and non-targets; p = 0.0157), and decrease in commission error rate ( p = 0.0116). The mean RT and omission error rate largely remained unchanged. Artificial injection of tACS at 40 Hz over right FP network may improve attention function, especially in the domains of consistency in performance, target/non-target discrimination, and inhibitory control.",

A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from inception to November 2023. Observational studies estimating the prevalence of these disorders in DM1 or DM2 were included. A meta-analysis of the prevalence of these disorders and an association study with disease onset by prevalence ratio meta-analysis were performed. Thirty-eight studies were included. In DM1, the prevalence of ASD was 14%, with congenital onset being 79% more common than juvenile onset, while the prevalence of ADHD was 21%, with no difference between congenital and juvenile onset, and the prevalence of depression and anxiety were 14% and 16%. Depression was more common in the adult onset. Finally, the prevalence of depression in DM2 was 16%. A higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders is observed in individuals with DM1 and DM2 than in the general population. Therefore, actively screening for congenital and juvenile neurodevelopmental disorders in DM1 and emotional disorders in DM1 and DM2 may improve the quality of life of those affected.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Psychotic disorders are characterized by abnormalities in the synchronization of neuronal responses. A 40 Hz gamma band deficit during auditory steady-state response (ASSR) measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) is a robust observation in psychosis and is associated with symptoms and functional deficits. However, the majority of ASSR studies focus on specific electrode sites, while whole scalp analysis using all channels, and the association with clinical symptoms, are rare. Methods: In this study, we use whole-scalp 40 Hz ASSR EEG measurements—power and phase locking factor—to establish deficits in early-stage psychosis (ESP) subjects, classify ESP status using an ensemble of machine learning techniques, identify correlates with principal components obtained from clinical/demographic/functioning variables, and correlate functional outcome after a short-term follow-up. Results: We identified significant spatially-distributed group level differences for power and phase locking. The performance of different machine learning techniques and interpretation of the extracted feature importance indicate that phase locking has a more predictive and parsimonious pattern than power. Phase locking is also associated with principal components composed of measures of cognitive processes. Short-term functional outcome is associated with baseline 40 Hz ASSR signals from the FCz and other channels in both phase locking and power. Conclusion: This whole scalp EEG study provides additional evidence to link deficits in 40 Hz ASSRs with cognition and functioning in ESP, and corroborates with prior studies of phase locking from a subset of EEG channels. Confirming 40 Hz ASSR deficits serves as a candidate phenotype to identify circuit dysfunctions and a biomarker for clinical outcomes in psychosis.",

This research aimed to investigate how azelaic acid (AzA), a natural dicarboxylic acid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, affects aluminium chloride (AlCl 3 )-induced behavioural changes and biochemical alterations in the hippocampus of rats. Methods: Thirty-two male Wistar rats divided into four groups received distilled water, AzA 50 mg/kg, AlCl 3 100 mg/kg and AzA plus AlCl 3 , respectively, by oral gavage for 6 weeks. Behavioural changes were evaluated using open-field maze, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition (NOR), passive avoidance task, and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. Also, malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonyl protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were examined. Results: AzA significantly affected AlCl 3 -provoked anxiety-like behaviours and learning and memory impairments. It also reduced the toxic effect of AlCl 3 on MDA, carbonyl protein, TNF-α, IL-1β, NF-κB and GSK-3β status; however, its beneficial effects on AlCl 3 -induced changes of CHOP, BDNF and AChE activity were not significant. Conclusion: These findings disclosed that AzA could improve behavioural and cognitive function and almost limit the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation caused by AlCl 3 .",

In order to study this, we used a model for chronic immune activation, the myocardial infarction, and intravenous injections with the pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α). The incentive for this study is the observation that myocardial infarction is accompanied by behavioural and neuronal abnormalities. The effects of myocardial infarction on the brain and its functioning are widespread. In order to examine the mechanism through which this interaction occurs, a group of rats underwent an experimentally induced myocardial infarction whereafter immunohistochemistry was performed on slices of the brain. This experiment revealed regional serum protein extravasation, pointing to leakage of the blood-brain barrier. This process occurred in certain cortical, subcortical and hindbrain areas in discrete patches. The leakage was co-localized with the expression of the immune activation marker ICAM-1. A second group of rats was therefore injected with TNF-α, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine, to assess the involvement of the immune system in the effects shown. This procedure rendered the same results. It is concluded that myocardial infarction may interfere with the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and possibly with brain functioning through activation of the immune system. The relevance for pathophysiological processes is discussed.",

In- and outpatients with a depressive disorder or schizophrenia participated, and scores on the WRS were compared with those on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and retardation items of the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale (CPRS).The internal consistency was good (Cronbach alpha = 0.86), interrater reliability was sufficient to good, the correlation between the sumscores of both raters was r = 0.84, n = 23, p <0.01 and the kappa's were between 0.23 and 0.80. Convergent and divergent validity showed in comparing the correlation between the sum scores on the WRS and the CPRS retardation items (r = 0.91, n = 25, p < 0.01 ) with the correlation between the sumscores on the WRS and the MADRS (r = 0.40, n = 25, p = 0.1). The decrease of the sum scores on the WRS after two weeks of treatment with antide-pressants predicted remission after six weeks. A subgroup of the patients who were not in remission after six weeks, showed a predominance of retardation signs over mood disturbances. The same clinical picture was seen in a group of patients with a chronic disorder.De Widlöcher Retardation Rating Scale in this Dutch translation is a usefull instrument to measure psychomotor retardation. The connection between remaining retardation symptoms and longterm prognosis deserves further investigation.",

Recently, focus has shifted towards the use of atypical antipsychotics. This paper reviews the advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of antipsychotics in bipolar disorder.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were selected for review. A few review articles were also cited.Typical antipsychotics, at least some of them, are powerful antimanics, beneficial for severe agitation in particular. However, in the long term treatment, typical antipsychics may precipitate depression. Among the atypical antipsychotics, both risperidone and olanzapine are clearly antimanic alternatives, although olanzapine is the best studied. Clozapine seems to be useful when other treatments fail to work.Antipsychotics are beneficial for some clinical presentations of mania. To minimize side effets, atypical agents should be preferred before typical agents, unless parenteral administration is needed. Despite the lack of RCTs, antipsychotics also seem to be useful as adjunctive agents in the treatment of psychotic bipolar depression. For the long term treatment of bipolar disorder, typical antipsychotics should be used only under certain circumstances. The place of atypical antipsychotics in the long term treatment of bipolar disorder remains to be studied.",

The present study explored whether deviations in skin conductance activity are associated with severity of schizophrenic symptoms. For this purpose, Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs) to discrete stimuli (80 dB noises) and Skin Conductance Levels (SCLs) of 37 schizophrenic patients and 31 healthy volunteers were recorded. In accordance with previous studies, schizophrenic patients were found to be hyporesponsive compared to healthy controls. More specifically, almost half of the patients (46%) did not react with any SCR to the first 3 stimuli, whereas only 10% of the control group exhibited such a non-responding. Accordingly, the mean amplitude of the first 3 SCRs – as measured in u Siemens – was found to be significantly lower in patients compared to controls. As well, mean SCL was found to be (marginally) elevated in the patient group. This was especially the case for patients who did exhibit SCRs. In the patient group, a negative correlation was found between amplitude of SCRs and symptom severity. This association was mainly carried by a significant correlation between positive symptoms and reduced SCRs. The clinical relevance of these findings is discussed in detail.",

The most common manifestations are interictal dysphoric disorder (IDD) and depression. There is a lack of randomized control trials (RCTs) concerning effectiveness and side-effects of antidepressants in epilepsy patients.Treatment implications of the concept of IDD and other interictal disorders are an optimized dosage of anti-epileptics in combination with antidepressants.

Systematic research involving the DSM-IV categories of generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and agoraphobia and depression is not yet available. Prevalence and treatment of interictal anxiety disorders and depressive disorder in epilepsy should be the subject of further research, in order to enable development of evidence-based treatment guidelines for these disorders in epilepsy patients.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship of recent life events to specific kinds of depression using published studies and the author's own work. An overall effect of life events on depression has been found consistently and is moderate in degree. In suicide attempts there are stronger and more immediate effects than in depression. Life events precede both non-melancholic and melancholic depressions. It is only in recurrent depressions that life events are less common with melancholic pictures. Life events influence bipolar disorder as well as unipolar. Mania may be preceded by life events, particularly those involving social rhythm disruption, but it is harder to rule out events which are consequences of insidious development of illness. There are strong effects of life events and social support in postpartum depressions but in postpartum psychoses these effects are absent. Events precede depression comorbid with other disorders as well as pure depression. The course of depression is also influenced by life stress with less remission where negative events occur after onset and better outcome where earlier adverse events are neutralized. Relapse is related to immediately preceding life events. However, where depressions are both severe and recurrent life stress effects weaken and as the number of episodes increases preceding life events lessen. These findings suggest that some kinds of depression are more related to psychosocial causation and some are more biological in origin.",

The polymorphism in 5-HTR2A (102T/C, -1438 A/G) was identified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The results suggest that 5-HTR2A (102T/C, -1438G/A) polymorphism might not be associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia or mood disorders, and it might not be a risk factor contributing to alcohol dependency. We found that the 102T/C polymorphism was in linkage disequilibrium with the -1438G/A polymorphism in psychosis (mood disorder, schizophrenia, and alcohol dependence) and in health controls. Further studies are needed to determine whether or not the novel serotonin receptor (5-HTR) polymorphism reflects the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, mood disorders, and alcohol dependence.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of the literature pertaining to the psychiatric sequelae of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Methods: A structured search of the EMBASE, PsychINFO and MEDLINE databases was performed on articles published since the first use of STN DBS in 1993 for PD until March 2007. Non-human studies were excluded, along with studies reporting on unilateral DBS and studies reporting on the use of STN DBS for indications other than idiopathic PD. Ninety-seven articles were selected for inclusion in the review. Results: Patients with advanced PD have a high rate of psychiatric morbidity. STN DBS has been shown to be an effective treatment for the control of motor symptoms in advanced PD. Neurobehavioural side-effects are, however, relatively common following STN DBS. Side-effects include impaired executive function and verbal fluency, depression, hypomania, apathy, postoperative delirium, anxiety disorders and psychotic symptoms, especially hallucinations. The alteration in dopaminergic medication following surgery as well as the direct effect of STN stimulation both appear to contribute to the short-term and long-term postoperative psychiatric complications. Methodological issues that limit the applicability of the current literature in this field are highlighted. Conclusions: STN DBS is an effective treatment for the motor symptoms of advanced PD. However, further research is needed to assess the extent to which STN DBS contributes to or exacerbates psychiatric morbidity over and above that associated with advanced PD. Careful neuropsychiatric evaluation and monitoring are required in this patient group.",

These results may be susceptible to type II error but a similar testing schedule in the individual studies allows data to be pooled in a larger analysis.Data from two separate double-blind placebo-controlled studies of the effects of ATD on cognitive function in the elderly were combined. In one study, a low dose and in the other a high dose of amino acids was used. In a repeated measures analysis of variance, the effects of ATD and the interaction of this with the other factors (age, gender and dose) on cognitive measures was examined.Data from 31 healthy subjects aged between 60 and 81 years were analysed. There were no main effects of ATD or consistent interactions between ATD and age, gender or dose. There were significant interactions between ATD, gender and dose. When tryptophan depleted, females having the higher dose drink had reduced scores on Digit span and immediate recall on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.The enlarged data set did not confirm an overall effect of ATD on working memory or on delayed word recall but does suggest an effect of ATD on encoding or registration in the subgroup of females receiving a higher strength drink.",

Methods: A total of 2767 randomly selected subjects from the Ansan Geriatric Study were questioned on their knowledge of putative risk factors for AD. Their answers were compared with their sociodemographic data and other variables. Results: The most common stated risk factor was being older (59.6%), followed by head trauma (33.6%) and cerebrovascular disease (30.4%). However, a substandard education, which is a known risk factor, was considered significant by only 9.5% of the subjects. Predictors for a worse knowledge of the risk factors for AD were being older, a lower level of education, lower economic status and the attitude that dementia is not curable. Conclusion: This study revealed that misunderstanding about AD is more prevalent in older subjects and those with a lower level of education, and so public health education on the basic concepts of AD should be targeted at this population.",

The properties of the single neuron that would need to be measured and the techniques available to obtain the data are described. The concept of a fixed neuronal identity may be impeding progress and should be replaced with the concept of dynamically assigned neuron identity.Modern data collection techniques make it possible to obtain data at the single-neuron level on the complete nervous systems of simple organisms. Present models based on this data do not provide an integrated explanation of behaviour.

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: The gut–brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication that occurs between the intestinal tract and central nervous system (CNS). Through a series of neural, immune, endocrine, and metabolic signalling pathways, commensal microbiota are able to influence CNS development and neurological function. Alterations in gut microbiota have been implicated in various neuropathologies. The purpose of this review is to evaluate and summarise existing literature assessing the role of specific bacterial taxa on the development of neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative pathologies of childhood. We will also discuss microbiota-based therapies dietary interventions and their efficacy. Methods and analysis: We will search PubMed, Cochrane Library, and OVID electronic databases for articles published between January 1980 and February 2021. A search method involving two rounds of reviewing the literature using a three-step method in each round will be performed. Two researchers will be selected, and screen titles and abstracts independently. The full text of selected articles will be assessed against inclusion criteria. Data will be extracted and evaluated using the appropriate Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. Ethics and dissemination: Findings from this study will be shared across relevant paediatric neurology and gastroenterology societies and submitted for peer review. This study did not require institutional ethics approval.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Previous studies have examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the in-vivo concentrations of neuro-metabolites assessed through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in neurological and psychiatry disorders. This review aims to systematically evaluate the data on the effect of tDCS on MRS findings and thereby attempt to understand the potential mechanism of tDCS on neuro-metabolites. Methods: The relevant literature was obtained through PubMed and cross-reference (search till June 2020). Thirty-four studies were reviewed, of which 22 reported results from healthy controls and 12 were from patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Results: The evidence converges to highlight that tDCS modulates the neuro-metabolite levels at the site of stimulation, which, in turn, translates into alterations in the behavioural outcome. It also shows that the baseline level of these neuro-metabolites can, to a certain extent, predict the outcome after tDCS. However, even though tDCS has shown promising effects in alleviating symptoms of various psychiatric disorders, there are limited studies that have reported the effect of tDCS on neuro-metabolite levels. Conclusions: There is a compelling need for more systematic studies examining patients with psychiatric/neurological disorders with larger samples and harmonised tDCS protocols. More studies will potentially help us to understand the tDCS mechanism of action pertinent to neuro-metabolite levels modulation. Further, studies should be conducted in psychiatric patients to understand the neurological changes in this population and potentially unravel the neuro-metabolite × tDCS interaction effect that can be translated into individualised treatment.",

However, in psychiatric patients, only sporadic investigation on immunochemistry has been performed and information about immunofunction derived by investigation of immunocompetent cells in the CSF is not available to date. Here we present an interdisciplinary work of neurologists, psychiatrists and hemato-immunologists focusing on the immunology of psychiatric and neurological disorders. In a first study including 63 patients with therapy resistant affective and schizophrenic spectrum disorders we applied conventional, validated neurological CSF investigation such as analysis of albumin, IgG, IgA, IgM, oligoclonal IgG and specific antibodies, cell count and interpreted the data by Reibergrams. In a second study, we applied the highly sensitive and specific multicolour flowcytometry of paired samples of CSF and peripheral blood cells to characterize the immunostatus of psychiatric and neurological patients. We demonstrate that flowcytometry technology constitutes an appropriate method to investigate subsets of lymphocytes even with low CSF cell numbers, and therefore as a promising diagnostic tool for routine purposes in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, knowledge of the frequencies of T cell subsets such as the T regulatory cell type might open new avenues to models of psychiatric and neurological diseases as well as diagnostic and monitoring implications.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most efficient treatments for major depression. Electroconvulsive seizures (ECS), the animal model of ECT, is widely used to study both mechanisms of action and adverse effects of ECT. As the treatment itself serves as an instant anaesthetic and anaesthetic agents may affect memory functions and behaviour, ECS is traditionally administered without muscle relaxation and anaesthesia. A major problem of unmodified ECS, which has only been addressed peripherally in the literature, is that some animals sustain spinal fractures and subsequent hind leg paralysis (paraplegia). This phenomenon leads to a higher degree of suffering and these animals need to be excluded from the studies. To reach sufficient statistical power, the group sizes are therefore often increased and this may lead to a pre-selected study group in risk of skewing the results. Moreover, the study design of the experiments do not comply with the 3R principles, which advocate for both refinement and reduction of animal experiments. The objective of this study is to systematically evaluate injuries caused by ECS. Methods: We summarise the incidence of spinal fractures from 24 studies conducted during 2009-2015 in six different rat strains and report preliminary findings on scapular fractures following auricular ECS. Results: In total, 12.8% of all tested animals suffered from spinal fractures and we find an increase in spinal fracture incidence over time. Furthermore, X-ray analyses revealed that some animals displayed scapular fractures. Conclusion: We discuss consequences of and possible explanations for ECS-induced fractures. Modifications of the method are highly warranted and we furthermore suggest that all animals are thoroughly examined for discrete fractures.",

Depression in the elderly is frequently undetected or inadequately treated. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacotherapy of elderly patients with depression by comparing the patterns of prescribing psychotropic drugs (psychotropics) of psychiatrists and non-psychiatrists. Methods A random sampling of 5% of inpatients from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database in Taiwan from 2001 to 2003 was selected. In all, 1058 (0.9%) inpatients aged 65 and older with a diagnosis of any depressive disorder were included. The psychotropic prescribing pattern and the dosages used were analysed and compared. Physician specialties were based on the record of NHI database. Non-psychiatrists were defined by physicians other than psychiatry. Results A total of 88% of elderly depressed inpatients had two or more comorbid physical illnesses. The most commonly prescribed psychotropics were: antidepressants (71.4%), anxiolytics (62.6%) and hypnotics (51.4%). Psychiatrists had a higher rate of prescribing psychotropics, except anxiolytics, than non-psychiatrists. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were commonly prescribed, non-psychiatrists preferred the use of tricyclic antidepressants and moclobemide. Trazodone was the most preferred antidepressant, but was generally used in low dosages. Conclusion Psychiatrists generally utilised higher dosages of newer antidepressants than non-psychiatrists. Differences in the prescribing pattern of psychotropics existed between physician specialties. Further investigations are warranted to determine how the selection and dosing of drugs influence the outcome of depression on the elderly.",

We propose the Short Neurological Evaluation Scale (S-NES) for use in busy clinical settings, and in research.Using confirmatory factor analyses, we identified 12 items of neurological examination showing significant overlap with previously reported theoretical and empirical categories of neurological soft signs (NSS) in schizophrenia. This provided justification for the development of a shorter version of the NES based on the empirically identified NSS. In the present study, we relied on existing data to present an initial validation of the S-NES against the referent standard 26-item NES. We determined sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios. Posterior-test probability was estimated using a Bayesian nomogram plot.Using data derived from 84 unmedicated or minimally treated patients with first-episode schizophrenia, 12 empirically determined items of neurological examinations showed high agreement with the 26 items in the standard NES battery (sensitivity=96.3%, specificity=100%, and posterior-test probability=100%).Within limitations of validity estimates derived from existing data, the present results suggest that the design of the S-NES based on empirically identified 12 items of neurological examination is a logical step. If successful, the S-NES will be useful for rapid screening of NSS in busy clinical settings, and also in research.",

It is surprising that a virus that affects airways can trigger neurological manifestations. The aim of this study was to create and apply specific questionnaires/evaluations for post-COVID-19 patients to profile any neurofunctional sequelae.Epidemiological and psychomotor aspects as well as the intensity of cognitive, memory, attention, and concentration impairment were assessed. A total of 184 subjects post-COVID-19 and a control group (n = 30) were evaluated.The most prevalent blood types in the COVID-19 group were the same as those from control group and in Brazilian population (no influence). Loss of smell/taste and headache were the most common reported symptoms. Talking about psychomotor and neurofunctional aspects, COVID-19 induced marked impairments in the tests: fine motor development (diadochokinesis, puppets, fan, and knead paper); balance (immobility, static balance, feet in line, and persistence); episodic memory after distractors; verbal fluency; and clock, compared to the control group data. There was also marked increase of synkinesis. Therefore, COVID-19 induced impairments in psychomotor assessments and in different cognitive aspects of the Mini-Mental State Examination. These results are more surprising considering that most participants did not report pre-existing disease and did not require hospitalisation.COVID-19 induced psychomotor, neurofunctional, and memory impairments, including in young and healthy subjects. The present study revealed neurological impairments, which should be considered in the development of rehabilitation protocols for patients affected by COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Child development is strongly influenced by maternal characteristics. Maternal sensitivity, as well as risks to and outcomes of sensitive maternal style, are well studied in industrialised western contexts, but it is unclear if this is the case for other contexts. Sub-Saharan Africa has been subjected to and continues to negotiate socio-economic and psychological sequelae of colonial and race-based politics: exploring the nature and outcomes of early caregiver input in such challenging conditions is imperative. This scoping review thus aims to 1) evaluate the nature and extent of quantified observational assessments of dyadic interactions, with a focus on maternal sensitivity, in Sub-Saharan Africa and 2) ascertain which risk and outcome factors have been examined in relation to maternal sensitivity. Study quality and cross-cultural appropriateness will also be considered. The search using expanded search terms yielded 20 papers –four characterizing maternal sensitivity or style, eight examining maternal sensitivity in relation to risks and outcomes, and eight intervention studies examining efforts to improve maternal sensitivity. Most research was conducted in South Africa – only seven studies were conducted in four other countries. Researchers used a wide array of coding schemes, mostly developed in the west. Ten studies made some adaptations to measures. Language issues and cultural considerations were often not explicitly addressed. Taken together, very limited research on this important topic exists. For the work that does exist, questions around westernized assumptions, language, and appropriateness of measures remain. Substantially more research, informed by both culturally flexible conceptualizations and methodological rigour, is required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common dementia. Advancing our limited understanding of its molecular pathogenesis is essential for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DLB. DLB is an α-synucleinopathy, and small extracellular vesicles (SEV) from people with DLB can transmit α-synuclein oligomerisation between cells. Post-mortem DLB brains and serum SEV from those with DLB share common miRNA signatures, and their functional implications are uncertain. Hence, we aimed to investigate potential targets of DLB-associated SEV miRNA and to analyse their functional implications. Methods: We identified potential targets of six previously reported differentially expressed miRNA genes in serum SEV of people with DLB ( MIR26A1 , MIR320C2 , MIR320D2 , MIR548BA , MIR556 , and MIR4722 ) using miRBase and miRDB databases. We analysed functional implications of these targets using EnrichR gene set enrichment analysis and analysed their protein interactions using Reactome pathway analysis. Results: These SEV miRNA may regulate 4278 genes that were significantly enriched among the genes involved in neuronal development, cell-to-cell communication, vesicle-mediated transport, apoptosis, regulation of cell cycle, post-translational protein modifications, and autophagy lysosomal pathway, after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction at 5%. The miRNA target genes and their protein interactions were significantly associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders and with multiple signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and cytokine signalling pathways. Conclusion: Our findings provide in-silico evidence that potential targets of DLB-associated SEV miRNAs may contribute to Lewy pathology by transcriptional regulation. Experimental validation of these dysfunctional pathways is warranted and could lead to novel therapeutic avenues for DLB.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The corpus callosum (CC) is a brain structure with a high heritability and potential role in psychiatric disorders. However, the genetic architecture of the CC and the genetic link with psychiatric disorders remain largely unclear. We investigated the genetic architectures of the volume of the CC and its subregions and the genetic overlap with psychiatric disorders. Methods: We applied multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) to genetic and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 40,894 individuals from the UK Biobank, aiming to boost genetic discovery and to assess the pleiotropic effects across volumes of the five subregions of the CC (posterior, mid-posterior, central, mid-anterior and anterior) obtained by FreeSurfer 7.1. Multivariate GWAS was run combining all subregions, co-varying for relevant variables. Gene-set enrichment analyses were performed using MAGMA. Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was used to determine Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of total CC volume and volumes of its subregions as well as their genetic correlations with relevant psychiatric traits. Results: We identified 70 independent loci with distributed effects across the five subregions of the CC ( p &lt; 5 × 10 −8 ). Additionally, we identified 33 significant loci in the anterior subregion, 23 in the mid-anterior, 29 in the central, 7 in the mid-posterior and 56 in the posterior subregion. Gene-set analysis revealed 156 significant genes contributing to volume of the CC subregions ( p &lt; 2.6 × 10 −6 ). LDSC estimated the heritability of CC to ( h 2 SNP = 0.38, SE = 0.03) and subregions ranging from 0.22 (SE = 0.02) to 0.37 (SE = 0.03). We found significant genetic correlations of total CC volume with bipolar disorder (BD, r g = −0.09, SE = 0.03; p = 5.9 × 10 −3 ) and drinks consumed per week ( r g = −0.09, SE = 0.02; p = 4.8 × 10 −4 ), and volume of the mid-anterior subregion with BD ( r g = −0.12, SE = 0.02; p = 2.5 × 10 −4 ), major depressive disorder (MDD) ( r g = −0.12, SE = 0.04; p = 3.6 × 10 −3 ), drinks consumed per week ( r g = −0.13, SE = 0.04; p = 1.8 × 10 −3 ) and cannabis use ( r g = −0.09, SE = 0.03; p = 8.4 × 10 −3 ). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the CC has a polygenic architecture implicating multiple genes and show that CC subregion volumes are heritable. We found that distinct genetic factors are involved in the development of anterior and posterior subregions, consistent with their divergent functional specialisation. Significant genetic correlation between volumes of the CC and BD, drinks per week, MDD and cannabis consumption subregion volumes with psychiatric traits is noteworthy and deserving of further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Summary Although the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) is the most frequently used rating scale for quantifying depressive states, it has been criticized for its reliability and its usability in clinical practice. This criticism is less applying to the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Goal of the present study is to investigate the reliability and validity, and clinical relationship between the HRSD and the MADRS. For 60 out-patients with diagnosed depression (DSM IV296.2x, 296.3x, 300.40 and 311.00), the HRSD and MADRS were scored at baseline and 6 weeks later by an independent rater according to a structured interview. Also the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) was assessed by a psychiatrist. Satisfying agreement was found between the totalscores (r= .75, p&gt;.000 en r=.92, p&gt;.000 respectively, at baseline and 6 weeks later). Furthermore agreement was found between the items of both scales, and these agree with the clinical impression. The reliability of the MADRS is more stable than the reliability of the HRSD (α = .6367 and α =.8900 vs α = .2193 and α = .8362 at baseline and at endpoint respectively). Considering the ease of scoring both scales in one interview and the widely international use of the HRSD, scoring both the HRSD and the MADRS to measure the severity of a depression seems to be an acceptabel covenant.",

Interferon can cause (severe) neuropsychiatric side effects. These side effects are discussed. Adequate management of these side effects is important, as is close collaboration between the oncologist and the psychiatrist. The cornerstone of management is patient education: this prevents interruption of therapy by patients who were not warned for neuropsychiatric side effects. Furthermore, patients should report in case of rapidly arising mood disorders. Interferon-alfa induced mood disorder is reported to be treatable. Three case descriptions illustrate this, but also illustrate some limits to successful treatment.",

Antipsychotic drugs exert varying effects on sleep, and the effects of atypical agents may differ from those of conventional neuroleptics.To review the literature on the effects of atypical medication on subjective and objective sleep quality in patients with schizophrenia.A non-systematic literature review of Medline was performed in August 2003 searching the period from January 1985 to August 2003 for studies of the effects of atypical antipsychotics on sleep.We found published studies of clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone, but none on quetiapine or ziprasidone. Studies with clozapine showed that it increased total sleep time, sleep efficiency, stage-2 non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep density, and decreased stage-4 sleep, slow wave sleep (SWS) and stage-1 sleep. Single-dose studies with olanzapine have shown that it increases SWS, sleep continuity, total sleeping time, subjective sleep quality, and delta sleep. Long-term studies with risperidone have shown improvements in total sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep continuity, SWS, and stage-2 sleep, and reductions in sleep latency, number of awakenings, and proportion of time awake. These benefits were paralleled by improvements in subjective sleep assessment and psychopathology, and psychosocial functioning.The evidence presented in this review suggests that atypical antipsychotics exert favorable effects on sleep profile compared with conventional agents, including improvement of subjective sleep quality and modification of specific sleep stages known to be associated with better clinical outcome.",

In KS patients, there was no difference in latency of P300, but the amplitude was reduced when compared with the control group. Cognitive dysfunction in patients with hypogonadotropism is related to androgen hormone levels.

    "abstract": "Functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD) sonography provides a high temporal resolution measure of blood flow and has over the years proved to be a valuable tool in the clinical evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disorders. More recently, due to advances in physics and computing, it has become possible to derive indices of cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA) as well as cerebrovascular pressure reactivity (CR), using non-invasive techniques. These indices provide a dynamic representation of the brain's regulatory blood flow mechanisms not only in pathological states but also in health. However, whilst the temporal resolution of these regulatory indices is very good, spatially, the localization of brain regions remains very poor, thus limiting its brain mapping capacity. Functional MRI, on the contrary, is a brain-imaging technique that operates on similar blood flow principles; however, unlike fTCD, it provides high spatial resolution. Because both fTCD and fMRI determine blood flow-dependant imaging parameters, the coupling of fTCD with fMRI may provide greater insight into brain function by virtue of the combined enhanced temporal and spatial resolution that each technique affords. This review summarizes the fTCD technique with particular emphasis on the CA and CR indices and their relationship in traumatic brain injury as well as in health.",

With the synchronisation status of networks to represent epilepsy, then, adding pulse to stimulations to 10% of neurons to simulate the VNS, we obtain the desynchronisation status of networks (representing antiepileptic effects). The simulations show that synchronisation evolves into desynchronisation in the HH neural networks when a part (10%) of neurons are stimulated with a pulse current signal. The network desynchronisation appears to be sensitive to the stimulation parameters. For the case of the same stimulation intensity, weakly coupled networks reach desynchronisation more easily than strongly coupled networks. The network desynchronisation reduced by short-stimulation interval is more distinct than that of induced by long stimulation interval. We find that there exist the optimal stimulation interval and optimal stimulation intensity when the other stimulation parameters remain certain.",

Subjects were administered the Wechsler Memory Scale, Third Edition and discrepancy scores between immediate and delayed subtests/indices were used to explore possible differences between groups in pattern of impairment.Significant differences were found between groups on age/education and these variables were related to several outcome measures. Gender was not related to diagnostic group and there were no gender differences on study variables. There were differences between the SSD subjects on several variables, with the schizoaffective subjects performing worse despite equivalence on global cognitive function, living status and chronicity. Seven one-way between-subjects ANCOVAs compared groups on discrepancy scores. RESULTS failed to suggest differences between groups on immediate-delayed memory discrepancy scores (p > 0.05). Subsequent analyses revealed differences in percentage retention scores between SSD and FTD on the faces subtest (p = 0.040), with SSD retaining greater information over time.RESULTS failed to show distinctions between groups on pattern of memory impairment when using discrepancy comparisons. However, an analysis examining percentage retention scores revealed better maintenance of non-contextual visual information over time in SSD. Findings may suggest deficits in immediate encoding rather than memory decay for some types of memory ability among geriatric SSD. Our failure to document group differences when using discrepancy comparisons may be attributable to relative similarity in pattern between groups or the limited sensitivity of this technique.",

To date, no studies have examined the possible role of immune activation in the aetiology of these disturbances. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between markers of immune activation and measures of emotional and somatic dysfunction among patients with symptomatic genital herpes. Methods: Twenty-two patients with documented genital herpes were assessed when herpetic lesions were present and when they were not. Each assessment included a clinical examination, self-reported symptom measures as well as a blood and urine collection. Markers of immune activation [neopterin and interleukin (IL)-6] in serum and urine were quantified by enzyme-linked immunoassay. These measures were also obtained from a group of healthy control subjects. Results: Urine, but not serum, levels of neopterin and IL-6 correlated significantly with measures of reported psychological distress and fatigue. These associations were not confined to periods of overt clinical lesions. Conclusions: HSV-related neuropsychiatric morbidity correlates selectively with regional, but not systemic, measures of immune activation. We hypothesise that communication between the local inflammatory site in the pelvis and the brain occurs through autonomic afferent pathways.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: After MRI studies suggested the efficacy of ethyl-EPA in reducing the progressive brain atrophy in Huntington disease (HD), trials were conducted to test its efficacy as a treatment for HD. Trials that continued for 6 months did not find any significant improvement, urging discontinuation of the drug. However, trials that continued for 12 months indicated improvement of motor functions in these patients. Methods: We searched 12 electronic databases to find randomised clinical trials relevant to our inclusion criteria. After screening, only five papers were included. Continuous and binary variables were analysed to compute the pooled mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR), respectively. Quality effect model meta-analysis was used as a post hoc analysis for studies at 12 months. Findings: Meta-analysis indicated that ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has no significant effect on any scale of HD at 6 months. At 12 months, two studies suggested significant improvements of the Total Motor Score and Total Motor Score–4 in both fixed and quality effect models [MD = −2.720, 95% CI (−4.76, –.68), p = 0.009; MD = −2.225, 95% CI (−3.842, −0.607), p = 0.007], respectively. Maximal chorea score showed significant results [MD = −1.013, 95% CI (−1.793, −0.233), p = 0.011] in only fixed-effect model, while no improvement was detected for Stroop colour naming test or symbol digit modality. Conclusion: Meta-analysis indicated a significant improvement of motor scores only after 12 months. These results should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies had assessed the efficacy of ethyl-EPA after 12 months with one of them having a 6-month open-label phase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Peripheral gene expression of several molecular pathways has been studied in major depressive disorder (MDD) with promising results. We sought to investigate some of these genes in a treatment-free Latino sample of Mexican descent. Material and Methods: The sample consisted of 50 MDD treatment-free cases and 50 sex and age-matched controls. Gene expression of candidate genes of neuroplasticity ( BDNF, p11 , and VGF ), inflammation ( IL1A, IL1B, IL4, IL6, IL7, IL8, IL10, MIF , and TNFA ), the canonical Wnt signaling pathway ( TCF7L2, APC , and GSK3B ), and mTOR, was compared in cases and controls. RNA was obtained from blood samples. We used bivariate analyses to compare subjects versus control mean mRNA quantification of target genes and lineal regression modelling to test for effects of age and body mass index on gene expression. Results: Most subjects were female (66%) with a mean age of 26.7 (SD 7.9) years. Only GSK3B was differentially expressed between cases and controls at a statistically significant level ( p = 0.048). TCF7L-2 showed the highest number of correlations with MDD-related traits, yet these were modest in size. Discussion: GSK3B encodes a moderator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. It has a role in neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, depression, and other psychiatric phenotypes. We found that adding population diversity has the potential to elicit distinct peripheral gene expression markers in MDD and MDD-related traits. However, our results should only be considered as hypothesis-generating research that merits further replication in larger cohorts of similar ancestry.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We evaluated processing-speed and shift-cost measures in adults with depression or ADHD and monitored the effects of treatment. We hypothesized that cognitive-speed and shift-cost measures might differentiate diagnostic groups. METHODS: Colour, form, and colour-form stimuli were used to measured naming times. The shift cost (s) were calculated as colour-form naming time minus the sum of colour and form naming times. Measurements were done at baseline and endpoint for 42 adults with depression and 42 with ADHD without depression. Patients with depression were treated with Transcranial Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields and patients with ADHD with methylphenidate IR. RESULTS: During depression treatment, reductions in naming times were recorded weekly. One-way ANOVA indicated statistical between-group differences with effect sizes in the medium range for form and colour-form. In both groups, naming times were longer before than after treatment. For the ADHD group, shift costs exceeded the average-normal range at baseline but were in the average-normal range after stabilization with stimulant medication. For the depression group, shift costs were in the average-normal range at baseline and after treatment. Baseline colour-form naming times predicted reductions in naming times for both groups with the largest effect size and index of forecasting efficiency for the ADHD group. CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive-processing speed (colour-form) and shift-cost measures before treatment proved most sensitive in differentiating patients with depression and ADHD. Reductions in naming times for the depression group were suggested to reflect improved psycho-motor skills rather than improved cognitive control.",

The present pilot study was carried out to investigate if right prefrontal low-frequency rTMS as an add-on to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) accelerates the anti-depressant effect and reduces cognitive side effects. Methods: In this randomised, controlled, double-blind study, thirty-five patients with major depression were allocated to ECTþplacebo or ECTþlow-frequency right prefrontal rTMS. The severity of depression was evaluated during the course using the Hamilton scale for depression (the 17-item as well as the 6-item scale) and the major depression inventory (MDI). Furthermore, neuropsychological assessment of cognitive function was carried out. Results: The study revealed no significant difference between the two groups for any of the outcomes, but with a visible trend to lower scores for MDI after treatment in the placebo group. The negative impact of ECT on neurocognitive functions was short-lived, and scores on logical memory were significantly improved compared to baseline 4 weeks after last treatment. The ECT-rTMS group revealed generally less impairment of cognitive functions than the ECT-placebo group. Conclusion: The addition of low-frequency rTMS as an add-on to ECT treatment did not result in an accelerated response. On the contrary, the results suggest that low-frequency rTMS could inhibit the anti-depressant effect of ECT.",

This study aimed to investigate cytokines in patients undergoing treatment for anxiety disorders and whether the level of cytokines moderated the treatment outcome. Thirty-seven patients with comorbid and treatment-resistant anxiety disorders were investigated using multilevel modelling. Serum cytokine levels were measured three times: pretreatment, in the middle of treatment, and at the end of treatment. Anxiety and metacognitions were measured weekly throughout treatment by self-report. The levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist did not change during therapy or were not related to the level of anxiety. Metacognitive beliefs predicted anxiety, but the relationship between metacognitions and anxiety was not moderated by cytokines. Limitations of the study include that the patients were not fasting at blood sampling, and we did not assess body mass index, which may affect cytokine levels. The lack of significance for cytokines as a predictor or moderator may be due to a lack of power for testing moderation hypotheses, a problem associated with many psychotherapy studies. Cytokines did not predict the outcome in the treatment of comorbid anxiety disorders in our sample. Furthermore, cytokines did not moderate the relationship between metacognitions and anxiety.",

The authors systematically searched for studies addressing vitamin D and addiction and develop a hypothesis which can direct future research of the possible mechanistic role of vitamin D in the process of addiction. Methods: Systematic review of the literature found in PubMed and EMBASE followed by narrative review combined with clinical experiences leading to hypotheses for future research. Results: Only five articles were identified about a role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology of addiction. Their results are in line with a possible influence of vitamin D in dopaminergic transmission. The cerebral vitamin D status depends on the functionality of genetic variants of vitamin D receptor and other involved genes. Routine serum calcidiol levels may not adequately reflect cerebral vitamin D status. Uncertainty exists regarding appropriate calcidiol blood levels and proper dosages for affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Conclusions: The putative pathophysiological role of vitamin D in substance abuse has been insufficiently studied which calls to more studies how to measure cerebral vitamin D status in clinical practice. Research is indicated whether vitamin D supplementation should use higher dosages and aim to reach higher calcidiol serum levels. Measuring dopaminergic functioning within the prefrontal cortex as reflected by neuropsychological tests selected as suitable could be a appropriate proxy for the cerebral vitamin D status when studying the pharmacogenomics of this functionality in patients.",

In this study, we evaluated the disease-related changes in regional structural connectivity derived from gray matter magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Methods: The subjects were 73 patients with BD and 80 healthy volunteers who underwent 3-Tesla MRI. Network metrics, such as the small world properties, were computed. We also performed rendering of the network metric images such as the degree, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient, on individual brain image. Then, we estimated the differences between them, and evaluate the relationships between the clinical symptoms and the network metrics in the patients with BD. Results: BD patients showed a lower clustering coefficient in the right parietal region and left occipital region, compared with healthy subjects. A weak negative correlation between Young mania rating scale and clustering coefficient was found in left anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions: We found differences in gray matter structural connectivity between BD patients and healthy subjects by a similarity-based approach. These points may provide objective biological information as an adjunct to the clinical diagnosis of BD.",

Objective: Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between adiposity and bipolar disorder, although data are derived predominantly from patient samples and use indirect methods of assessing adiposity. This study investigated the association between bipolar disorder and several indices of adiposity, including body fat mass as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), in a community-based sample. Methods: In this study, 21 women with bipolar disorder and 523 healthy controls were drawn from an age-stratified, random, community-based sample of women (20–93 years) participating in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Bipolar disorder was diagnosed utilising a semi-structured clinical interview. Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist and hip circumference) were taken and fat mass was determined from whole body DXA scans (Lunar DPX-L). Results Those with bipolar disorder tended to have greater adiposity. Age-adjusted mean (95% CI) values for bipolar versus controls according to adiposity indices were weight 75.6 (68.9–82.3) versus 72.6 (71.3–74.0) kg, waist circumference 89.8 (84.1–95.6) versus 87.3 (86.1–88.5) cm, waist:hip ratio 0.85 (0.82–0.87) versus 0.84 (0.83–0.84), body mass index 27.6 (25.1–30.1) versus 27.5 (27.0–28.0) kg/m 2 , fat mass 31.4 (26.5–36.3) versus 28.6 (27.5–29.5) kg and %body fat 40.4 (36.9–43.9) versus 38.0 (37.3–38.7)%; all p &gt; 0.05. Further adjustment for height, smoking, alcohol, psychotropic medication, energy intake or physical activity did not influence these patterns. Conclusion Although a pattern suggestive of greater adiposity among those with bipolar disorder was observed, no significant differences were detected. We cannot exclude the possibility of a type II error. Further research with a larger sample may produce more conclusive results.",

Results One of the major goals of the SCNP was the standardization of clinical trials with psychotropic drugs. In 1969, the SCNP established a Committee for Clinical Investigations (UKU) with the representation of clinical investigators and the drug industry; moreover, during the 1970s and ’80s, the UKU initiated clinical trialsand contributed to the methodology of clinical investigations with psychotropic drugs. With the decrease in governmental funding and increasing influence of the US Food and Drug Administration on themethodology of clinical investigations around the world in the 1990s, the UKU was dissolved. The changes had a detrimental effect on the developments on the methodology of clinical investigations, and the lack of clinical feedback led to an impasse in psychotropic drug development with some pharmaceutical companies abandoning research in the central nervous system area. Conclusion It is suggested that a revival of UKU to provide a platform for dialogue among government, industry, and academia could help break the impasse.",

Objective: Accumulating evidence has suggested a pathophysiological role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in major depressive disorder (MDD). The present study evaluated serum levels of BDNF and explored whether Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism is correlated with changes in circulating BDNF levels in patients with MDD and control subjects. Methods: Subjects were 76 patients with MDD and 50 controls. Diagnosis of MDD was determined by the use of a structured clinical interview according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-IV (DSM-IV) criteria. The concentrations of BDNF were measured by using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism was examined by the polymerase chain reaction technique. Results: Serum BDNF was significantly lower in MDD patients than in normal control subjects ( p &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences either in allele or genotype in the Val66Met polymorphism between the MDD and control groups. Moreover, genotype did not significantly correlate with the BDNF serum levels in the MDD or control groups. Conclusions: Our study suggests that there is a decrease in serum BDNF levels in untreated MDD patients. However, serum BDNF levels were not associated with the Val66Met polymorphism.",

Here, we presented a case in which TD was suppressed, but not cured, by long-term aripiprazole treatment. Case This 74-year-old male patient had bipolar I disorder and had developed TD many times after several antipsychotic treatments. The lowest chlorpromazine dose equivalent among the previous antipsychotic treatments was 25 mg/day of quetiapine. His TD always improved immediately after the dosage was shifted to aripiprazole. However, his insomnia or other psychiatric symptoms worsened the first three times when the treatment was shifted to aripiprazole, making the transition a failure. Before the fourth attempt of aripiprazole transition, the patient was in a euthymic state but again developed TD under olanzapine 10 mg/day treatment. During the fourth attempt of aripiprazole transition, his TD had remained in complete remission for more than 1 year after the dosage shifted to 10 mg/day of aripiprazole. He developed TD again when we tapered the aripiprazole dose to 5 mg/day, but his TD remitted when we restored his aripiprazole dose to 10 mg/day. Conclusion Aripiprazole could be an effective drug in elderly bipolar patients with antipsychotic-induced TD while the patients are in a euthymic state. However, aripiprazole may only suppress TD rather than cure it.",

Objective: Electroconvulsive therapy is used efficacious treatment for a variety of complicated psychiatric disorders and evidences have indicated that energy metabolism impairment may be involved in pathophysiology and treatment of mood disorders. This work was performed to determine creatine kinase and mitochondrial respiratory chain activities at different times after the maintenance electroconvulsive shock (ECS). Methods: Male Wistar rats received a protocol mimicking therapeutic of maintenance or simulated ECS (sham) and were subsequently sacrificed immediately after, 48 h and 7 days after the last maintenance ECS. We measured creatine kinase and mitochondrial respiratory chain activities in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and striatum. Results: Our results showed that maintenance ECS alter respiratory chain complexes and creatine kinase activities in the rat brain, but these effects were related to brain area and time after the ECS, in which the animal were killed. Conclusion: Finally, these findings further support the hypothesis that alteration on the energy metabolism could be involved in the therapeutic or adverse effects of ECS.",

    "abstract": "Objective Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are common psychotic disorders, which show some overlaps in genetic aetiology. Researchers have conducted a number of studies to investigate the relationship between SCZ and the 1354C/T genetic polymorphism of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A–1354C/T), as well as the associations between BD and the HTR2A–1354C/T polymorphism. However, the results were conflicting. To provide a more robust estimate about the effects of the HTR2A–1354C/T polymorphism on the risk of these two psychotic disorders, we performed this meta-analysis. Methods We used the pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to investigate the relationships between SCZ and the 1354C/T polymorphism of HTR2A, as well as the associations between BD and HTR2A–1354C/T. Publication bias was tested by Begg's test and inverted funnel plot, and heterogeneity was checked by Cochran's Q statistic and the inconsistency index ( I 2 ). Results Eight studies were concerned with SCZ, analysing a cumulative total of 2953 cases and 3153 controls; six papers studied BD, using a total of 923 cases and 928 controls. There was no significant association found between HTR2A–1354C/T and SCZ in the overall population (T allele vs. C allele, OR = 1.035, 95% CI 0.912–1.175, p = 0.596) or in the subgroups Caucasian population and Asian population. Moreover, there was no significant association between the HTR2A–1354C/T polymorphism and BD in the overall population (T allele vs. C allele, OR = 1.038, 95% CI = 0.607–1.772, p = 0.892). Conclusion On the basis of these results, the HTR2A–1354C/T polymorphism is unlikely to be a risk factor for SCZ and BD.",

Subjects: An extensive neuropsychological battery of tests was applied to a total of 79 subjects, 33 of whom were diagnosed with PD. Measures: RC scores were based on a combination of years of education, a measure of occupational attainment, and an estimate of premorbid intelligence. Results: As regards the specific disturbances found in the clinical group subjects, a lower performance in memory, attention, visuospatial, visuoconstructive, and perceptive skills was seen. With respect to our second objective, our results showed that patients diagnosed with PD who had a high RC reached a higher neuropsychological level of performance than those subjects with a low reserve. Conclusions: Early neuropsychological impairments in PD are most evident in individuals with lower RC. As has been found in other neurological disorders, individuals with greater RC may be less sensitive to the initial clinical effects of the underlying neuropathological process.",

It started from the original description by Kahlbaum and was revived by modern factor analytical studies, that identified the catatonic dimension in about 10% of newly admitted patients. Objective: Over a period of 2 years, four patients with an acute episodic psychosis and prominent catatonic symptoms were examined. Methods: A clinical description is given of the psychopathology and classification is performed according to the various diagnostic instruments. Results: All patients showed a circular fluctuation of their psychoses, with motor symptoms ranging from the excited to the inhibited pole within one episode. Their clinical pictures also comprised mood swings and anxieties as well as hallucinatory and delusional experiences, whereas the course of disease was characterized by complete recovery without residual symptoms. Conclusions: The significance of catatonic symptoms is not recognized in the current taxonomies despite the fact that this has major pharmacological treatment implications.",

Methods: Studies are reported using psychophysiological or functional neuroimaging methodology. Results: The psychophysiological study did not indicate a general emotional hyperresponsiveness in BPD. Low autonomic arousal seemed to reflect dissociative states in borderline subjects experiencing intense emotions. In the functional magnetic resonance imaging study enhanced amygdala activation was found in BPD, and it is suggested to reflect the intense and slowly subsiding emotions commonly observed in response to even low-level stressors.

Studies on animals and humans suggest that vasopressin improves the cognitive function, and positive effects of desmopressin on memory and learning have been reported. This research was performed for evaluation of the effects of desmopressin in the prevention of memory impairment following ECT.This randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial with placebo administration was performed on 50 patients with psychiatric disorders who were candidates for ECT. Subjects in the case group received 60 µm of intranasal desmopressin daily (in three doses of 20 µm). For the control group 0.9% saline solution was administered in the same way. Memory function was evaluated using Wechsler's Memory Scale three times a week (the first time before the start of ECT and the second and third times after the third and sixth sessions, respectively). Results were analyzed by t-test and Paired t-test.The mean age of patients was 29 years (range 20-40). During the course of ECT, patients in the control group demonstrated a meaningful decrease in memory scores (from a base score of 80.15-75.45 in the second test and 72.60 in the third test). Despite this, a meaningful increase in memory scores was observed during the treatment with desmopressin in the case group (from a base score of 73.27-75.70 and 79.13 in the second and the third tests, respectively). There was a meaningful difference between the two groups (P < 0.0001).This study confirms the protective effect of desmopressin against memory impairment. The results confirm that memory impairment is a common side-effect of ECT and suggest that desmopressin may prevent ECT-induced memory impairment by its effects on memory and the learning process.",

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of serotonin depletion on acquisition, consolidation, and expression of conditioned fear. Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to foot shocks as unconditioned stimulus and assessed with respect to freezing behaviour when re-subjected to context. Serotonin depletion was achieved by administration of a serotonin synthesis inhibitor, para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) (300 mg/kg daily × 3), (i) throughout the period from (and including) acquisition to (and including) expression, (ii) during acquisition but not expression, (iii) after acquisition only, and (iv) during expression only. Results: The time spent freezing was significantly reduced in animals that were serotonin-depleted during the entire period from (and including) acquisition to (and including) expression, as well as in those being serotonin-depleted during either acquisition only or expression only. In contrast, PCPA administrated immediately after acquisition, that is during memory consolidation, did not impact the expression of conditioned fear. Conclusion: Intact serotonergic neurotransmission is important for both acquisition and expression of context-conditioned fear.",

The aim of the current study was to evaluate ToM and EP in adolescents with MDD, as compared to healthy controls (HCs). In addition, we aimed to assess the association between impairment in ToM and EP, depressive symptom severity, and long-term outcome in the MDD group.We compared the performance of 14 adolescents with MDD and 25 HC in the Facial Expression Recognition Task (FERT) and the Interpersonal Perception Task. We followed up with the MDD group 2 years later to assess the level of their depressive symptoms using the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R).No differences were found between adolescents with MDD and HC in the ToM and FERT tasks. Also, within the MDD group, there was no association between the severity of depressive symptoms and task performance. In the MDD group, there was a significant correlation between lower levels of accuracy in the FERT during the index depressive episode and lower CDRS-R scores on follow-up 2 years later (r2 = 0.35, p = 0.021).EP impairments in adolescents with MDD might predict worse long-term outcome. Further research is needed to verify our findings and to assess for a possible neurobiological underpinning for the state and trait impairments in EP in adolescents with MDD.",

SPD is associated with significant disability and many psychiatric comorbidities. Several studies have shown that SPD and schizotypal traits are associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour. Suicide prevention interventions in individuals with SPD are impeded because (1) SPD is frequently not diagnosed; (2) SPD is difficult to treat; and (3) there are no guidelines for suicide screening or suicide prevention interventions in individuals with SPD. Suicide prevention in persons with SPD consists of (1) diagnosing SPD; (2) providing appropriate treatment for SPD; and (3) providing suicide screening and suicide prevention. Interventions aiming at reduction of depressive symptoms, improvement of self-esteem, and interpersonal skills may be effective at reducing suicide risk amongst individuals with SPD. Studies of suicidality in persons with SPD are needed and may be an important area of suicide research. It is to be hoped that future studies of the pathophysiology of suicidality in individuals with SPD will help to develop strategies for suicide screening and suicide prevention interventions in persons with SPD and improve suicide prevention in this challenging patient population.",

    "abstract": "Smoking is highly prevalent in the psychiatric population, and hospital admittance usually results in partial or complete smoking cessation. Tobacco use is known to affect the metabolism of certain psychoactive drugs, but whether smoking influences the plasma concentration of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) remains unclear. This article investigates the possible effect of smoking on the plasma concentration of TCAs. A systematic review of the literature available on PubMed and EMBASE as of October 2020 was carried out using PRISMA guidelines. Studies reporting plasma concentrations of any TCA in both a smoking and a non-smoking group were included and compared. Ten eligible studies were identified and included. In the eight studies investigating the effect of smoking on amitriptyline and/or nortriptyline, five studies found no significant effect. Two studies investigating the effect of smoking on imipramine found a significant effect, and one study investigating the effect of smoking on doxepin found no significant effect. The majority of studies included in this review were influenced by small study populations and other methodical issues. The effect of smoking on the plasma concentration of TCAs is still not entirely clear. There is a possibility that smoking affects the distribution of TCA metabolites, but this is probably not of clinical importance.",

Quetiapine was administered at 200, 400, 600, then 800 mg/day on the first 4 days, with flexible dosing (400-800 mg/day) subsequently. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patient dropouts because of adverse drug reactions during the first 7 days. Secondary safety assessments included incidences of adverse drug reactions and significant changes in vital signs. Efficacy assessments included Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Clinical Global Impressions Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score changes from day 1 to day 21.Twenty patients (69%) completed the study. No patients withdrew as a result of drug-related adverse events (AEs) during the first 7 days. Twenty-three patients reported 58 adverse events, and most of the adverse events were mild or moderate. No clinically relevant abnormalities in vital signs were reported. Mean YMRS and CGI-S scores decreased significantly from baseline to day 21 (p < 0.001). Response and remission rates were 78 and 70%, respectively, at the end of the study.Rapid dose escalation of quetiapine to 800 mg/day over 4 days was well tolerated and effective in reducing symptoms within 5 days in acutely ill bipolar I patients with a manic episode.",

    "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder long hypothesised to be an autoimmune disease. Complement-mediated immune mechanisms have not been investigated in detail in narcolepsy. Our aim was to establish the significance of classical pathway activation in narcolepsy.Sera of 42 narcolepsy patients and 26 healthy controls were screened with ELISA to determine the levels of C1q, C3a, C4d and complement component 4 binding protein (C4BP). A home-made ELISA method was developed to detect antibodies to C4BP-alpha (anti-C4BPA). The correlation between complement levels and clinical findings was examined.C1q levels were significantly higher in narcolepsy patients while C4d and C4BP levels were significantly lower compared to healthy controls. C3a levels were comparable among patients and controls. Eleven narcolepsy patients showed serum anti-C4BPA levels. Total rapid eye movements (REM) time, sleep onset latency, REM sleep latency, sleep activity, percentage of wakefulness after sleep onset and Epworth sleepiness scale scores were correlated with levels of different complement factors.Complement-mediated immune mechanisms might partake in narcolepsy pathogenesis. The precise role of autoantibodies on complement level alterations needs to be investigated. Levels of complement factors and degradation products may potentially be utilised as biomarkers to predict the clinical severity of narcolepsy.",

Working with animals comes with great responsibility to achieve reliable and reproducible results of highest scientific quality. In a simple step-by-step fashion, we highlight some common issues that may occur along the path to conducting behavioural animal experimentations and posit some solutions and grounds to ensure the excellence of work done in this research area while aspiring to improve conditions for laboratory animals. It entails topics of study design, animal and experimenter welfare, experimental considerations and frequentist biostatistics. At the end, we direct to some guidelines and manuals that may prove valuable to researchers in this field. Our ten simple tips and traps are meant for students who are learning about important concepts for the first time; graduates whose statistics training all too often has neglected the concept of power in experimental design; and researches who would like a light-hearted refresher on these topics. With this perspective, we hope that you will avoid falling into traps and find answers to what you always wanted to know about conducting behavioural animal experimentation.",

We evaluated the reported psychometric properties, as well as the methodological quality of the psychometric evaluations, using COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) guidelines.Fifty-eight studies reported measurement properties of the ASEBA forms. Most studies came from Southern (n = 29, 50%) or East African (n = 25, 43%) countries. Forty-nine studies (84%) used translated versions of the tool, but details regarding the translation process, if available, were often sparse. Most studies (n = 47, 81%) only reported internal consistency (using coefficient alpha) for one or more subscale. The methodological quality of the psychometric evaluations ranged from 'very good' to 'inadequate' across all measurement properties, except for internal consistency.There is limited good quality psychometric evidence available for the ASEBA forms in sub-Saharan Africa. We recommend (i) implementing a standardised procedure for conducting and reporting translation processes and (ii) conducting more comprehensive psychometric evaluations of the translated versions of the tools.",

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blockade of Mas was performed by acute intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of its selective antagonist, A779.No statistical difference in immobility time was observed between MrgD KO and WT male animals subjected to FST and TST. However, acute icv injection of A779 significantly increased the immobility time of MrgD KO male mice subjected to FST and TST, suggesting the involvement of Mas in preventing depressive-like behaviour. Indeed, Mas KO male animals showed increased immobility time in FST and TST, evidencing a depressive-like behaviour in these animals, in addition to a reduction in BDNF levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. No changes in BDNF levels were observed in MrgD KO male animals.Our data showed that Mas plays an important role in the neurobiology of depression probably by modulating BDNF expression. On the contrary, lack of MrgD did not alter depressive-like behaviour, which was supported by the lack of alterations in BDNF levels.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The cingulate gyrus is implicated in the neurobiology of addiction, such as chronic cocaine consumption. Early-life stress (ELS) is an important moderator of cocaine use disorder (CUD). Therefore, we investigated the effect of CUD on cingulate cortical thickness and tested whether a history of ELS could influence the effects of CUD. Methods: Participants aged 18 to 50 years (78 with CUD due to crack cocaine consumption and 53 healthy controls) underwent MRI and the cingulate thickness (rostral anterior, caudal anterior, posterior, and isthmus regions) was analyzed. The clinical assessment comprised the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Addiction Severity Index. Group comparisons adjusting by sex, age, and education were performed. Mediation models were generated where lifetime cocaine use, CTQ score, and cortical thickness corresponded to the independent variable, intermediary variable, and outcome, respectively. Results: Group comparisons revealed significant differences in six out of eight cingulate cortices, showing lower thickness in the CUD group. Furthermore, years of regular cocaine use was the variable most associated with cingulate thickness. Negative correlations were found between CTQ scores and the isthmus cingulate (right hemisphere), as well as with the rostral anterior cingulate (left hemisphere). In the mediation analysis, we observed a significant negative direct effect of lifetime cocaine use on the isthmus cingulate and an indirect effect of cocaine use mediated by CTQ score. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a history of ELS could aggravate the negative effects of chronic cocaine use on the cingulate gyrus, particularly in the right isthmus cingulate cortex.",

Objective: This paper considers methods, instruments and strategies for assessing BPD as described within the frame of the DSM-IV classification. Conclusions: Following the general diagnostic approach introduced by Van Praag in biological psychiatry, a two-tier diagnostic strategy for the descriptive diagnostic assessment of BPD is recommended. Axis one results in a DSM-IV Axis II categorical diagnosis, whereas axis two refers to a symptomatological, dimensional or functional approach, in which the psychological dysfunctions of the nosological syndrome are depicted. Moreover, in a clinical context a basic aim of the diagnostic evaluation is to obtain therapeutically valid information that leads to a constructive conceptual framework, to a case formulation in which therapeutic interventions are understood, selected and implemented. This framework should be based on a biopsychosocial theoretical model and its application in the clinical context involves feedback to the patient, in which the descriptive evaluation is integrated with etiological; and pathogenic elements using an idiographic approach. This therapeutically orientated diagnostic strategy is illustrated by the use of the ADP-IV (Assessment of DSM-IV personality disorders) questionnaire within a cognitive behavioral orientation.",

Objective: This paper gives an overview of the pathophysiology, symptomatology and treatment of the schizophrenia-like psychosis of epilepsy. Use of the term ‘interictal chronic psychosis’ is suggested, to conform to current DSM-IV classification of schizophrenia. Methods: Literature review supplemented by clinical experience. There is a lack of randomized control trials (RCTs) concerning effectiveness and side-effects of neuroleptics in epilepsy patients. Results: Hypotheses concerning the pathophysiology of the interictal chronic psychosis are discussed. The concept of forced normalization and alternative psychosis is based on case descriptions, and was not substantiated by systematic research. The kindling hypothesis seems promising, but was never confirmed in humans. A third theory, supported by some studies, suggests that inhibitory cerebral mechanisms enhance psychotic symptoms in epilepsy patients. Treatment strategies are based on case studies and open studies by lack of RCTs. Treatment should consider the optimalization of the dosage of antiepileptics in combination with one or two antidepressants, mood stabilizers and/or atypical neuroleptics. Surgery plays no significant role in the treatment of treatment-refractive epilepsy with interictal chronic psychotic symptoms. Conclusion: There is a prominent role of antidepressant or double antidepressant treatment strategies in patients with epilepsy and interictal chronic psychosis compared with treatment guidelines of chronic psychotic patients in general psychiatry.",

Results: None of the compounds has been proven effective in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. Valproate has been found an effective drug in acute mania, while in continuation treatment after acute mania it proved to be save, i.e. not causing switches into depression. Lamotrigine is the only anticonvulsant with proven efficacy in acute bipolar depression. So far gabapentin has not been found effective. Conclusion: For the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, lithium is still the treatment of choice. Carbamazepine and valproate are good alternatives, especially for patients not responding to lithium or not tolerating it. Lamotrigine may be a good alternative in bipolar depression.",

This research strongly suggests that pediatric mania may not be rare but that it may be difficult to diagnose. Since children with mania are likely to become adults with bipolar disorder, the recognition and characterization of childhood-onset mania may help identify a meaningful developmental subtype of bipolar disorder worthy of further investigation. The major difficulties that complicate the diagnosis of pediatric mania include: - its pattern of comorbidity may be unique by adult standards, especially its overlap with ADHD, aggression and conduct disorder; - its overlap with substance use disorders; - its association with trauma and adversity; - its response to treatment is atypical by adult standards. These issues will be reviewed in the presentation.",

The acute phase study, with a duration of 6-8 weeks, aimed at developing effect sizes (ES) for lithium, divalproex sodium, and carbamazepine, in the acute phase treatment of Bipolar I or II children and adolescents during a mixed or manic episode. During the acute-phase of treatment, 42 outpatients with a mean age of 11.4 yr.

The primary efficacy measures were the weekly CGI Improvement scores and the Young Mania Rating Scale. Using a ≥ 50% change from baseline to exit in the Y-MRS scores to define response, the effect size for divalproex sodium was 1.63,1.06 for lithium, and 1.00 for carbamazepine. Using this same response measure with the intent-to-treat sample, the response rates were: sodium divalproex 53%; lithium 38%; and carbamazepine 38% (x 2=0.85, 2 d.f., p=0.60).

In a next step, five potential disease-specific markers were individually added to this model to see whether the strength and predictive power of the model would improve.The multivariate model of five risk factors for depression in the general population was not a good model to predict depression in AD. In this multivariate approach, only 'a history of depression' was an independent marker for depression. The only disease-specific variable that improved the logistic model was 'disability due to AD'. An interaction between these two markers became apparent.Of the established risk factors for depression in the general population, only 'a history of depression' was found to be an independent marker for depression in AD. 'Disability due to AD' was the only disease-related marker for depression in AD, although this marker cannot be considered specific for AD. The importance of controlling for general risk factors for depression in the search for disease-specific markers for depression in AD is stressed.",

    "abstract": "Peduncular hallucinosis is a rare stroke-related phenomenon that may occur in cases of ischemic lesions localized in the cerebral peduncles, the pons, the upper midbrain or the thalamus and is mostly characterized by transient visual hallucinations.We report the case of an insufficiently treated hypertensive patient who presented with constantly elevated blood pressure values and persistent visual hallucinations, which ceased a few hours later after medically achieved blood pressure normalization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a symmetric paramedian ischemic lesion of the upper pons, which seems to be the cause of this case of peduncular hallucinosis.Although uncommon, this entity needs to be differential diagnostically considered in cases of transient visual hallucinations in persons with known vascular risk profile. MRI can be a useful diagnostic tool.",

The aim of the authors was to present examples of this syndrome and review the current understanding of its neurobiological basis.We describe three cases of persons experiencing musical hallucinosis in the context of hearing deficits with varying degrees of associated central nervous system abnormalities.Putative neurobiological mechanisms, in particular those involving de-afferentation of a complex auditory recognition system by complete or partial deafness, are discussed in the light of current information from the literature.Musical hallucinosis can be experienced in those patients with hearing impairment and is phenomenologically distinct for hallucinations described in psychiatric disorders.",

Method: D2 receptor function was assessed in 24 patients with major depression before and 16 patients after 16 weeks of treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) using a challenge with a selective D2 antagonist, sulpiride. Four hundred milligrams of sulpiride was administered orally on two test days and response was measured by the change in prolactin levels and changes in self-rating scale measures of mood, anxiety and pleasure. Results: The prolactin response to sulpiride (as measured by the maximum prolactin level) was significantly increased after CBT ( z = −2.792, p = 0.005). Sulpiride resulted in an improvement on mood ratings on both test days, but after CBT, this effect was significantly diminished as measured by the Profile of Mood States score ( t = −2.27, p = 0.038). Conclusions: After 16 weeks of CBT, we detected an enhanced prolactin response to sulpiride, suggesting an increased sensitivity of D2 receptor functioning.",

This review focuses on cognitive disorders in elderly hypertensive patients.Relevant papers were identified by searches in PubMed from 1946 until February 2007 using the keywords 'cerebral blood flow autoregulation', 'vascular cognitive disorders', 'neuroimaging in hypertension', 'antihypertensive treatment' and 'neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia'.Excessive blood pressure lowering in patients with long-standing hypertension may increase the risk of cerebral hypoperfusion, white matter lesions and consequent cognitive decline. White matter lesions have been found in the majority of patients with long-standing hypertension. They correlate with vascular cognitive disorders, particularly impairments of attention and executive function, while memory is relatively preserved. Cerebral small vessel disease in elderly patients should be taken into account when antihypertensive treatment is considered. Renin-angiotensin blockade, some calcium channel blockers and statins are thought to possess neuroprotective action.For prevention of cerebral hypoperfusion in elderly hypertensives blood pressure lowering should be cautiously controlled. The increased risk of white matter lesions is an indication for early neuroprotection. The combination of renin-angiotensin blockade or calcium channel blockers with statins may become a promising preventive strategy against cognitive decline in elderly hypertensives. Cerebral white matter protection is a future challenge.",

The aim of this study was to search for somatic factors that discriminate between patients with and without a family history of schizophrenia and between their relatives.Ninety-five schizophrenia patients were structurally interviewed about mental and physical health and alcohol and substance use in themselves and their families. Besides this, complementary information was obtained from the patients' case records. Patients with (41%) and without (59%) a family history were then compared.The main differences were found in the patients' relatives. Fewer patients with a family history, compared with patients without a family history, had relatives with cancer (p = 0.002). Conversely, there was a tendency towards that more patients with a family history, compared with patients without a family history, had relatives with cardiac infarction (p = 0.05).The genetic risk associated with schizophrenia seems to cosegregate into a factor(s) that protects against cancer and possibly also increases the risk for cardiac infarction.",

Methods: In this paper, we report baseline measures of red cell folate that were collected during a randomized trial of 107 patients with major depression. Red cell folate levels were examined for association with percentage improvement in depressive symptoms during treatment with fluoxetine or nortriptyline. The influences of possible confounding factors were assessed. Results: The low red cell folate group (defined in relation to the median) had a significantly poorer response to nortriptyline. This effect of red cell folate levels was not present in those treated with fluoxetine. No relationships were found between red cell folate levels and possible confounding factors of age, nutritional status, alcohol history, depression subtype, depression severity and chronicity of depression. Conclusion: Response to nortriptyline was affected by red cell folate status. It may, therefore, be beneficial to consider folate augmentation in patients with major depression, particularly if treated with nortriptyline.",

Oxidative stress could potentially be mechanistically involved in both the therapeutic effects and side effects of ECT. We measured sensitive markers of systemic and central nervous system (CNS) oxidative stress on DNA and RNA (urinary 8-oxodG/8-oxoGuo, cerebrospinal fluid 8-oxoGuo, and brain oxoguanine glycosylase mRNA expression) in male rats subjected to electroconvulsive stimulations (ECS), an animal model of ECT. Due to the previous observations that link hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis activity and age to DNA/RNA damage from oxidation, groups of young and middle-aged male animals were included, and markers of HPA-axis activity were measured. ECS induced weight loss, increased corticosterone (only in middle-aged animals), and decreased cerebral glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression, while largely leaving the markers of systemic and CNS DNA/RNA damage from oxidation unaltered. These results suggest that ECS is not associated with any lasting effects on oxidative stress on nucleic acids neither in young nor middle-aged rats.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common, serious, but under-recognised problem in multiple sclerosis (MS). The primary objective of this study was to assess whether a rapid visual analogue screening tool for depression could operate as a quick and reliable screening method for depression, in patients with MS.Patients attending a regional MS outpatient clinic completed the Emotional Thermometer 7 tool (ET7), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression Subscale (HADS-D) and the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) to establish a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of Major Depression. Full ET7, briefer subset ET4 version and depression and distress thermometers alone were compared with HADS-D and MDI. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated to compare the performance of all the screening tools.In total, 190 patients were included. ET4 performed well as a 'rule-out' screening step (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.72, NPV 0.98, PPV 0.32). ET4 performance was comparable to HADS-D (sensitivity 0.96, specificity 0.77, NPV 0.99, PPV 0.37) without need for clinician scoring. The briefer ET4 performed as well as the full ET7.ET are quick, sensitive and useful screening tools for depression in this MS population, to be complemented by further questioning or more detailed psychiatric assessment where indicated. Given that ET4 and ET7 perform equally well, we recommend the use of ET4 as it is briefer. It has the potential to be widely implemented across busy neurology clinics to assist in depression screening in this under diagnosed group.",

However, blood-brain barrier permeability for most new molecular entities is unknown, requiring central delivery. Thus, we performed a dose-finding study for chronic intracerebroventricular (icv) delivery of clozapine in mice.Specifically, we implanted wild-type C57BL/6J mice with osmotic minipumps (Alzet) delivering clozapine at a rate of 0.15 µl/h at different concentrations (0, 3.5, 7 and 14 mg/ml, i.e. 0, 12.5, 25 and 50 µg/day). Mice were tested weekly in a modified SHIRPA paradigm, for locomotor activity in the open field and for prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) for a period of 3 weeks.None of the clozapine concentrations caused neurological deficits or evident gross behavioural alterations in the SHIRPA paradigm. In male mice, clozapine had no significant effect on locomotor activity or PPI of the ASR. In female mice, the 7 and 14 mg/ml dose of clozapine significantly affected both open field activity and PPI, while 3.5 mg/ml of clozapine increased PPI but had no effects on locomotor activity.Our findings indicate that 7 mg/ml may be the optimal dose for chronic icv delivery of clozapine in mice, allowing comparison to screen for novel antipsychotic compounds.",

Methods: A total of 353 soldiers answered the following questionnaires: the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the medical outcomes study SF-36 questionnaire, the Baecke questionnaire to assess the level of habitual physical activity (HPA) and the socioeconomic (SE) status questionnaire. Participants were classified according to their desire to pursue a military career. Results: Accordingly, 246 participants were allocated to a volunteer group (VG) and 107 to a non-volunteer group (NVG). According to the BDI data for both groups, 66.5% of the soldiers showed at least mild depressive symptoms. Additionally, the STAI data revealed that 27.8% and 8.4% of the soldiers showed high scores on state anxiety and trait anxiety, respectively. The POMS scores were higher in the NVG compared to the VG (Δ%=+263%, p &lt;0.0001).

    "abstract": "Objective: We showed previously that glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK-3 β ) levels are significantly elevated in the hippocampi of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the exact cause of this elevation and its function are unknown. Recent animal studies have suggested a mechanism involving the N-methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) NR2B–GSK-3 β loop. Methods: To investigate the existence of an NR2B–GSK-3 β loop in the hippocampi of patients with MDD, we examined the expression of NR2B. We also attempted to identify markers that correlate with NR2B levels in the hippocampus, using the Stanley Neuropathology Consortium Integrative Database (SNCID). The SNCID is a web-based tool used to integrate Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) data sets. Results: We found that hippocampal levels of NR2B and DLGAP1 mRNA were higher in the MDD group ( n = 8) than in unaffected controls ( n = 12) ( p &lt; 0.05). NR2B expression levels were correlated with the expression levels of NR2A, NR1, DLGAP1, GSK-3 β and nitric oxide synthase 1, as well as with the number of calretinin-immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus in all subjects in the SNC ( n = 42, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The results of our study show the possible involvement of excessive activation of the NR2B–GSK-3 β loop in the overexpression of GSK-3 β in the hippocampi of patients with MDD.",

Na + ,K + -ATPase activity is increased in rats subjected to chronic administration of ketamine. Objective: Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder. Symptoms of schizophrenia can be divided into positive, negative and cognitive, and the physiopathology is still been unknown. Na + ,K + -ATPase is a protein in its role as a maintainer of fluid balance in all mammals and alterations in this enzyme could cause brain abnormalities. The aim of our study was to investigate the activity of this enzyme in rats submitted to chronic administration of ketamine. Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to sub-anaesthetic doses of the 25 mg/kg ketamine by seven consecutive days and the Na + ,K + -ATPase activity was analysed in prefrontal and hippocampus of rats. Results: We observed an increase in Na + ,K + -ATPase activity in prefrontal cortex administration of 25 mg/kg ketamine. However, ketamine has no effect in hippocampus. Conclusion: This evidence indicates that the alteration in Na + ,K + -ATPase may be related with glutamatergic system and consequently could be related to the development of schizophrenia.",

Objective We have ascertained 11 consanguineous families multiplex for IDs in order to identify new loci for autosomal recessive genes for non-syndromic ID, or to aid pinpointing mutations in known causative gene/loci. Methodology Microarray genotyping (Affymatrix 250K) was performed to identify homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) in all affected families. Results Analysis of genotypes revealed 45 potential HBD regions across the families, although these may be rationalised down to 39. Two families share an overlapping HBD region on 7q11.21. In one family, X-linkage also looks plausible, and a new ID gene near the centromere may be a likely cause. In one family, no HBD region was found, and thus we exclude autosomal recessive mutation as the likely cause in this family. Copy-number variation (CNV) was also performed and revealed no CNVs, homozygous or heterozygous, segregating with the phenotype. Conclusion The homozygous loci identified in this study might harbour candidate genes for ID in these studied families. Therefore, we are proceeding with next-generation sequencing analysis of the families, using whole-exome approaches, and anticipate that this will identify the causative gene/mutation within the identified HBD regions for many of the families studied here.",

The present study aims to investigate the brain mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in an animal model of mania induced by ouabain.Adult male Wistar rats received a single intracerebroventricular administration of ouabain (10-3 and 10-2 M) or vehicle. Locomotor activity was measured using the open field test. Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity was measured in the brain of rats 1 h and 7 days after ouabain administration.Our results showed that spontaneous locomotion was increased 1 h and 7 days after ouabain administration. Complexes I, III and IV activities were increased in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum immediately after the administration of ouabain, at the concentration of 10-3 and 10-2 M. Moreover, complex II activity was increased only in the prefrontal cortex at the concentration of 10-2 M. On the other hand, no significant alterations were observed in complex I activity 7 days after ouabain administration. However, an increase in complexes II, III and IV activities was observed only in the prefrontal cortex at the concentration of 10-2 M.Our findings suggest an increase in the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain in this model of mania. A possible explanation is that these findings occur as a rebound effect trying to compensate for a decrease of ATP deprivation in BD. The present findings suggest that this model may present good face validity and a limitation in construct validity.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat, a genetic model of depression, presents with corticolimbic changes in basal acetylcholine (ACh) levels and NO/cGMP signalling. Methods: Basal levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and both basal and l -arginine-stimulated nitric oxide synthase (NOS) formation of l -citrulline were analysed in hippocampus and frontal cortex in FSL and control Flinders resistant line (FRL) rats by fluorometric and electrochemical high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. In addition, ACh and cGMP levels were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Results: Significantly elevated frontal cortical but reduced hippocampal ACh levels were observed in FSL versus FRL rats. Basal cGMP levels were significantly reduced in the frontal cortex, but not hippocampus, of FSL rats without changes in NOx and l -citrulline, suggesting that the reduction of cGMP follows through an NOS-independent mechanism. Conclusions: These data confirm a bidirectional change in ACh in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the FSL rat, as well as provide evidence for a frontal cortical ACh-cGMP interaction in the depressive-like behaviour of the FSL rat.",

In patients with schizophrenia, risperidone reduces positive symptoms at least equally effective as haloperidol, however, risperidone has a reduced propensity for the induction of extrapyramidal symptoms. In addition, available evidence indicates that risperidone may be an effective treatment for negative symptoms. The optimum daily dose range is between 4 and 8 mgfor most patients. In this review article, risperidone is compared with some other (classical and atypical) neuroleptics. In addition, the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of risperidone are reviewed.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptides are endogenous substances present in nerve cells and involved in nervous system functions. Neuropeptides are synthetized in large precursor proteins and several are formed in the same precursor. Neuropeptides affect learning and memory processes, social, sexual and maternal behavior, pain and addiction, body temperature, food and water intake e.a. In addition, neuropeptides possess trophic influences on the nervous system, neuroleptic-like andpsychostimulant-like activities. Disturbances in classical neurotransmitter activity as found in Parkinson's disease, psychoses, and dementia, may also be caused by disturbances in neuropeptide activity. In fact, alterations in the concentration of a number of neuropeptides in schizophrenia, depression, and dementia have been found. Much work has been done during the last decade on the influence of neuropeptides in schizophrenia, autism, depression, and in various disorders associated with memory disturbances. These studies concern neuropeptides related to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), vasopressin- and endorphin-type neuropeptides, thyrotropic releasing hormone (TRH), and the C-terminal part of oxytocin Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (PLG). Several of these exert positive effects but in not more than 25% the response is clinically relevant. This may have to do with the severity of the disease and its chronicity. The modest effects may also be caused by the poor bioavailability of peptides and insufficient pharmacotherapeutic experience regarding dose, and duration of treatment.",

Een van de factoren die daaraan bijdraagt, is het voorkomen van een genetisch bepaalde oxidatieve capaciteit van verschillende isozymen welke deel uitmaken van het cytochroom P450. Voor het oxidatief metabolisme van geneesmiddelen zijn de P450 isozymen CYP2D6 (het enzym dat de meeste antidepressiva, antipsychotica, enkele anti-arrhythmica en codeïne oxideert), de CYP2C familie, de CYP3A familie en de CYP1A familie van belong. Van de isozymen CYP2D6 en CYP2C19 is ondubbelzinnig aangetoond dat er genetisch bepaalde verschillen in metabole capaciteit bestaan. Een frequentieverdeling van de metabole capaciteit in een populatie toont dan een bimodaal beeld met een onderverdeling in trage en snelle metaboliseerders met consequenties voor de individueel benodigde dosering. De capaciteit van de P450 isozymen is in het algemeen beperkt en de qffiniteil van substraat voor de isozymen is groot. Er bestaat derhalve een grate kans op interacties.

Conclusions: These favorable results suggest that larger controlled trials of risperidone should be performed in autistic or mentally retarded patients with behavioral disturbances.",

In recent studies earlier onset of anorexia nervosa was associated with higher recovery rates and a lower mortality, although even in adolescent patients anorexia nervosa takes a prolonged course. A chronic eating disorder bears a high risk of other comorbid psychiatric or personality disorders. The most prevalent disturbances were anxiety and affective disorders and anxious-fearful-obsessive personality disorders, respectively. Patients who substantially overcame their eating disorder did not differ from normal controls in respect to psychosocial functioning, e.g. family relationships, partnership and occupational status. These results should encourage us to treat the eating disorder vigorously.",

    "abstract": "The pteridine tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor in the biosynthesis of dopamine, (nor)epinephrine, serotonin and nitric oxide (NO). Furthermore, BH4 has a direct influence on release mechanisms of these neurotransmitters and on serotonin receptor binding activity immunology . The synthesis of BH4 is stimulated by interferon-gamma and hence there is a close relationship with the immune system HPA-axis . In animal experiments it was also found that the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis influences the pteridine metabolism. In clinical studies, so far, no evidence has been found for this relationship diseases . A congenital biopterin deficiency results in atypical phenylketonuria with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. In several neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, decreased levels of BH4 are found depression . Since 1984 there have been reports on decreased biopterin and increased neopterin levels in urine and plasma of depressed patients. Conflicting results have also been found, however, due probably to methodological problems therapy . Until now, oral administration of BH4 to depressed patients has been performed by two investigators, which resulted in mainly temporal clinical improvement discussion . Understanding of biochemical mechanisms in which pteridines are involved may contribute to our knowledge of the pathogenesis and treatment of affective disorders. This paper aims to provide an overview of the relevant literature and warrant for further research on this intriguing compound.",

    "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a complex syndrome with a psychiatric comorbidity of 70-80%. A psychiatric interview is necessary in order to exclude psychiatric illness and to identify psychiatric comorbidity. Studies have demonstrated that in general medical practice and in the non-psychiatric specialist practice, physicians tend to underdiagnose psychopathology in patients with CFS. There are many questions unanswered about the treatment of CFS Aim: Typical issues for the psychiatric practice are reviewed: psychiatric comorbidity, dysregulation of the PHA-axis and the treatment of CFS.Depression, somatization, sleeping disorders and anxiety disorders are the most important psychopathological symptoms found in CFS patients. CFS should not be regarded as a masked (somatoform) depression. Although the results from neuroendocrinological studies assessing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) are inconsistent, they suggest that there is a subgroup of CFS patients suffering from a discrete dysregulation of the HPA-axis resulting in basal hypocortisolaemia. These findings, however, do not reveal a causal relationship. Antidepressants do not seem to have a positive influence on the symptom of fatigue, but appear to be beneficial in alleviating the symptoms of depression and social functioning. Cognitive behaviour therapy and graded exercise show a significant improvement on fatigue and other symptoms and are the only treatments available for CFS patients.",

In a rural, circumscribed catchment area, 'all' patients with BP were identified and assessed. On preliminary analysis, morbid risk [MR] for BP over the area as a whole was 5.0 ± 0.6/1000. The distribution of MR for BP over geographical subregions showed no significant deviation from a statistical model for random occurrences in space by place at birth, in contrast to schizophrenia [SZ], and varied only modestly among males by place at onset. These results imply different etiological factors acting in BP in comparison with SZ, particularly with regard to the role of early versus later life events. In preliminary analyses of psychotic and cognitive features, current severity of positive symptoms was predicted in BP only by increasing dominance of the left hand; negative symptoms by duration of illness and current anticholinergic exposure; poorer general and frontal cognitive function by older age at onset of illness, increasing duration of illness, and current anticholinergic exposure. The finding on handedness suggests disturbance of cerebral asymmetry associated with positive symptoms in BP, while both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment may involve progressive processes. Further analysis of this epidemiologically complete population, including systematic comparisons of BP with schizoaffective disorder and SZ, continues.",

In the past years, clozapine has proven its effectiveness in this area and has been included in the treatment protocols and guidelines. Because of the risk of agranulocytosis with this compound and the intensive laboratory controls to be done, several studies have been performed with the new antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine as alternative treatments. A review of the literature suggests that both drugs are as effective as the classic antipsychotics for therapy-resistant patients. A switch to risperidone or olanzapine possibly would be a alternative for those patients who have favourable effects on a low dose of clozapine. Furthermore the new antipsychotics have less side effects and ameliorating effects on negative and cognitive symptoms, so contributing to overall improvement in chronic schizophrenic disorders. However, in case of persistent positive symptopathology, clozapine remains the golden standard. The new antipsychotics should be included in treatment protocols before clozapine.",

Recent literature offers some fine examples of studies demonstrating that alters differ in their physiological profile. On the basis of this type of evidence, some authors have concluded that alters are more than just metaphors.Drawing upon an experimental example, we argue that such a line of reasoning is highly problematic.Our example demonstrates that normal subjects are perfectly able to simulate alters such that these alters are accompanied by different physiological profiles. This is especially true for subjects scoring high on fantasy proneness.Psychobiological research on DID should include normal controls, preferably controls who are fantasy prone. Unless such a strategy is adopted, psychobiological research on alter activity will not be very informative.",

Methods: A patient not taking clozapine tested positive for clozapine three times in two different samples. This false positive was discovered by chance, because of an administrative error made in the first analytic test request. Results: The analysis of the first sample with a more specific method [HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)] showed that no clozapine was present. Conclusions: It is important to acknowledge that depending on the method employed, a false positive should not be ruled out as a possibility. Moreover, and even more worryingly, it should also be taken into account that clozapine serum levels could be tested erroneously high if the unknown interference is present and the HPLC-UV method is used. Although the interfering compound could not be identified, the possibility of a cross-reaction when analysing serum clozapine levels with the HPLC-UV method warrants urgent attention.",

Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced using the modified intraluminal thread method and maintained for 2, 3 or 4 h. The ischaemia-reperfusion group received reperfusion immediately after ischaemia-reperfusion. The NBP group received intraperitoneal injection of NBP immediately after ischaemia, followed by reperfusion. The sham operation group received only injection of physiological saline. The cerebral infarction volume and neurological deficit were analysed, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in brain tissues was visualised by immunohistochemistry.NBP treatment caused a significant decrease in both infarction volume and neurological deficit compared with the ischaemia-reperfusion group at corresponding time points in each (p < 0.05). In the NBP group, the infarction volume and neurological deficit did not change with different ischaemia times. The expression of VEGF was significantly decreased in the ischaemia-reperfusion group compared with the sham group (p < 0.01), while this change was partly prevented in the NBP group (p < 0.01). The expression of VEGF in brain tissue in both the NBP and ischaemia-reperfusion groups gradually decreased when the ischaemic period was prolonged.NBP treatment has a protective effect against cerebral ischaemia; this possible mechanism maybe related to the VEGF expression and may extend the reperfusion window for subsequent salvage of cerebral ischaemia by reperfusion.",

This practice has been reinforced by published criteria for CT scanning in psychiatric patients suggesting that cranial CT should be used as a screening tool to exclude intracranial pathology in all patients with a first presentation of schizophrenia or first psychotic episode. Objectives: This study reviews the performance of these criteria. Method: This consisted of a 3-year retrospective case-note audit, using published criteria, of all male in-patients with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia who had a cranial CT during the review period. Results: The efficacy of the published criteria is not supported. In addition, non-specific abnormalities on cranial CT are related to duration of illness and not age in this sample. Conclusions: There is a need to establish new and clinically meaningful approaches for the use of cranial CT and similar technologies in clinical psychiatry. Cranial CT performs poorly as a universal screening tool in this population. The decision to use such imaging techniques should be made on a case-by-case basis using all available clinical evidence.",

Specifically, we explored whether BDD patients exhibit greater deficits in cognitive inhibition when lexical targets are threatening than when they are non-threatening.Surprisingly, BDD patients exhibited deficits in cognitive inhibition only for non-threatening but not for threatening information.Although BDD patients often describe their negative thoughts about their appearance as distressing, they may experience them as valid and thus may not try to control them.",

    "abstract": "Tolerability, safety and effectiveness of quetiapine in an in-patient group with a relapse of schizophrenia and the possible role of plasma amino acid concentrations, 5-HT parameters and HVA in the prediction of response to treatment were investigated in an open-label baseline-controlled trial of 14 weeks in 21 hospitalized schizophrenic patients. Responders were defined as those patients who exhibit at least a 40% reduction of BPRS total scores. Secondary efficacy measures were the PANSS, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-severity scale and the MADRS. Extrapyramidal side-effects were evaluated with the AIMS. Other side-effects were monitored at regular intervals. Amino acids and the derived tryptophan and tyrosine ratios, as well as monoaminergic parameters, were assessed in plasma at baseline and at weeks 3, 6 and 14.Treatment with quetiapine resulted in the predefined treatment effect in 10 out of the 17 patients who completed at least 4 weeks of treatment. Effect in responders was observed on all efficacy parameters, including lower MADRS scores. No extrapyramidal side-effects emerged. Clinical and biochemical parameters did not predict response to treatment.This study demonstrates the moderate antipsychotic efficacy of quetiapine on preferentially positive symptoms in a group of relatively young schizophrenics. Some observed changes in biochemical parameters are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Identification of candidate genes for schizophrenia may be more successful than genome screens as the latter have not found consistent linkages.To assist in the gene search, a model of schizophrenia based on resistance to infectious diseases, rather than susceptibility, is proposed. The theory blends the geography of schizophrenia with the assumption that genes that cause schizophrenia likely evolved and persist from selection pressure. The theory includes the notion that schizophrenia enhances biological survival at the cost of psychological and social functioning.To demonstrate the utility of using this model, the Medline literature was searched for resistance genes, mostly identified in mice.Based on homologous locations in the human genome, these resistance genes are shown to be located in human chromosome regions linked significantly, in at least one genome screen, with schizophrenia or some physiologically related function or condition associated with schizophrenia.The infectious disease resistance theory of schizophrenia is offered as a viable model for understanding the origins of schizophrenia. The theory also allows for the inclusion of persistent infections, seasonal variability and translational pathophysiology to contribute to the etiology of schizophrenia.",

The mean age of women from study group was 18.22 years (SD ± 3.13 years) and from control group was 31.71 years (SD ± 8.22).Gene polymorphisms were studied with the use of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. TNF-α gene polymorphism consists of G/A substitution in -308 promoter region. IntPLA2 gene polymorphism is related to intron 1, in which restrictive region is found and recognized by BanI enzyme.We did not obtain statistically significant differences in the frequency of genotypes and alleles of -308G/A TNF-α polymorphism between the study and control groups (genotypes: P = 0.106, alleles: P = 0.076). We did analogous analysis in the restrictive and bulimic subgroups. We did not observe statistically relevant differences in the frequency of genotypes (P = 0.700) and alleles (P = 0.305). We did not obtain statistically relevant difference in the frequency of genotypes and alleles of intPLA2 gene between the study group and controls (genotypes: P = 0.300, alleles: P = 0.331). We did analogous analysis in both subgroups of AN. We did not observe statistically relevant differences in the frequency of genotypes (P = 0.344) and alleles (P = 0.230).There was no statistically relevant trend for the association between TNF-α polymorphism and AN. We did not find association between studied polymorphism of intPLA2 gene and risk of AN.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among intravenous drug users, and because of the long latent period, HCV liver disease is set to increase. Objectives: We sought to examine practice guidelines regarding treatment of HCV in drug users and to review the evidence for current practices. Methods: A structured search of the Pubmed database, websites of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and national and international expert groups and opinion of independent experts in the field. Results and Conclusions: All those infected with HCV need to be assessed to ascertain whether they have active ongoing viral replication and the extent of liver damage. HCV-infected individuals should be educated about the modes of transmission and means of reducing the risk of infecting others. They should also be advised to avoid cofactors (especially alcohol) that accelerate the progression of liver disease. Specific treatment with antivirals can cause viral clearance and prevent the progression of liver disease. Therapy is effective in those on opiate-replacement treatments and also in motivated individuals who continue to use intravenous drugs. The decision whether to treat drug users should be made jointly by specialists in the management of viral hepatitis and addiction on a case-by-case basis. Current combination drug regimens are expensive but are claimed to be cost-effective, and are certainly much less costly than managing end-stage liver disease. In addition to satisfactory sustained viral response rates, other benefits such as a beneficial effect on drug habit, self-esteem and rehabilitation have been reported. Encouraging suitable drug users to take-up and comply with treatment seems to be more easily achieved in supportive drug dependency unit settings (rather than the more formal surroundings of a hospital clinic).",

    "abstract": "Background: The protein product of INSIG2 is involved in cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism and homeostasis. Variation at rs7566605 near the gene INSIG2 has been associated with increased BMI. Objective: To evaluate the effect of rs7566605/ INSIG2 genotype on the ability of valproate-treated bipolar patients (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 ) to lose weight using carnitine supplementation during a 26-week lifestyle intervention study. Design: Forty-eight bipolar patients with clinically significant treatment emergent weight gain were genotyped at the rs7566605 SNP. Participants were randomised to l -carnitine (15 mg/kg/day) or placebo for 26 weeks in conjunction with a moderately energy restricted, low-fat diet. Weight and body fat percent were measured fortnightly. Waist circumference measurements and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were used to assess changes in body composition. Obesity-related biomarkers were measured at baseline and 26 weeks. Results: There was a significant interaction between rs7566605/ INSIG2 genetic status and treatment with carnitine or placebo. Carnitine had no significant effect on body composition measures in G allele homozygous patients who lost between 0.97 and 2.23 kg of fat. However C allele carriers on average gained 2.28 kg when given a placebo. Carnitine supplementation in this group enabled average weight loss of 2.22 kg of fat ( p = 0.01). Approximately half of this mass was in the vital truncal compartment ( p = 0.002). Bioinformatic analysis detected that the SNP lies in a highly conserved 336 bp sequence which potentially affects INSIG2 gene expression. Conclusions: C-carriers at rs7566605, possibly regulating the homeostasis gene INSIG2 , lost significantly less weight in this lifestyle intervention study. This effect was reversed by carnitine supplementation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: The occurrence of urogenital dysfunction as an isolated early symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) is rare, but the prevalence thereof becomes high with progression of disease. Lower urinary tract dysfunction may add to the cause of death (particularly through urinary infections), but both urinary and sexual dysfunction significantly affect quality of life of patients. Both storage and evacuation of urine may be affected by MS, and ultimatively the functional diagnosis can only be made by urodynamic testing. As upper urinary tract affection is, however, rare (and can be prevented by timely ultrasound imaging), a first stage diagnostics in the MS center by the neurologist and specialized nurse is appropriate. History, urine tests and post void residual urine determination (preferably by ultrasound) should provide necessary data for treatment of infections, and also symptomatic management of frequency, urgency and incontinence by bladder training, anticholinergics, and intermittent self catheterization (as indicated); the referral to urologist may be reserved for patients who fail first line treatment. Treatment in the late stages of MS is as yet little researched, but eventually a suprapubic catheter is the preferred method of bladder emptying. Sexual dysfunction should be actively sought in MS patients (in men erectile and ejaculation dysfunction, in women deficient lubrication and genital hyper- or hyposensitivity are frequent). Clinical examination contributes little to clarification of neurogenic sexual dysfunction, but defines the extent of other deficits due to MS, which may be relevant for sexual counseling (spasticity, sensory loss). Sildenafil has been demonstrated to be effective in treatment of men, but not in women. Other management options exist, and the doctor and nurse in the MS center should be proactive in providing first line counseling and management.",

However, despite the fact that therapeutic options for MS have significantly been widened over the past decade there is still tremendous activity in the search for new treatment options for MS. One important development in the field is reflected by the substantial number of promising results for oral therapies. Various phase III clinical trials are currently being initiated or are already underway evaluating the efficacy of a variety of orally administered agents, including cladribine, teriflunomide, laquinimod, fingolimod and fumaric acid. It is hoped that these oral therapies for MS further broaden our armament for MS therapy.",

A long standing view that Th1 cells are critical for early inflammatory development of lesions is challenging by recent findings that Th1 helper cells with Th17 phenotype are even more important. A complex autoimmunity of MS is further complicated with evidence that CD8 cells, regulatory T cells, clonal expansion of B cells, cells of myelin lineage, antibodies and complement, as well as process intrinsic to central nervous system contribute to the tissue destruction. Although there are a lot of evidences about inflammatory phase of MS, far less is known about mechanisms involved in degenerative phase of disease. It is not known weather quantitative, or qualitative differences in inflammatory response contributes to destruction of the tissue, or as it was shown experimentally demyelination may sometimes occur independent of T cells. Understanding of immunopathogenesis of MS especially regarding various stages of disease is necessary for clinicians in choosing optimal therapy of MS in individual patients. Influences of immunomodulatory treatment on various stages of MS immuno-pathogenesis are presented.",

    "abstract": "Objective Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is regularly used to treat patients with severe major depression, but the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects remain uncertain. Electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS) regulates diverse neurotransmitter systems and induces anticonvulsant effects, properties implicated in mediating therapeutic effects of ECT. Somatostatin (SST) is a candidate for mediating these effects because it is upregulated by ECS and exerts seizure-suppressant effects. However, little is known about how ECS might affect the SST receptor system. The present study examined effects of single and repeated ECS on the synthesis of SST receptors (SSTR1–4) and SST, and SST receptor binding ([ 125 I]LTT-SST 28 ) in mouse hippocampal regions and piriform/parietal cortices. Results A complex pattern of plastic changes was observed. In the dentate gyrus, SST and SSTR1 expression and the number of hilar SST immunoreactive cells were significantly increased at 1 week after repeated ECS while SSTR2 expression was downregulated by single ECS, and SSTR3 mRNA and SST binding were elevated 24 h after repeated ECS. In hippocampal CA1 and parietal/piriform cortices, we found elevated SST mRNA levels 1 week after repeated ECS and elevated SST binding after single ECS and 24 h after repeated ECS. In hippocampal CA3, repeated ECS increased SST expression 1 week after and SST binding 24 h after. In the parietal cortex, SSTR2 mRNA expression was downregulated after single ECS while SSTR4 mRNA expression was upregulated 24 h after repeated ECS. Conclusion Considering the known anticonvulsant effects of SST, it is likely that these ECS-induced neuroplastic changes in the SST system could participate in modulating neuronal excitability and potentially contribute to therapeutic effects of ECT.",

    "abstract": "In addition to their role as signaling molecules of the immune system, cytokines may participate in central neurotransmission. Variations of the central and/or peripheral levels of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-β (IL-1β), impact on neuroendocrine processes as well as central neurotransmitter activity. To a considerable extent, these effects are reminiscent of those elicited by psychogenic stressors. The current review describes recent findings consistent with a role for these cytokines in the neurochemical and behavioral manifestations of clinical depression, as well as the cellular death associated with cerebral ischemia. Moreover, the increasing use of cytokines in the immunotherapeutic treatment of various autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and cancers prompted us to consider the potential role of central processes in subserving the mood-related side-effects elicited by these treatments. Finally, a single administration of TNF-α has been shown to elicit a time-dependent sensitization effect, wherein the behavioral and neurochemical responses elicited by later cytokine treatment are greatly enhanced. Thus, particular attention was devoted to the possibility that elevated levels of TNF-α, through either exogenous (e.g. immunotherapy) or endogenous (e.g. brain damage or stressors) means may sensitize neurotransmitter or second messenger pathways important for the pathology. Given the time-dependent nature of cytokine sensitization effects, the schedule of cytokine administration during immunotherapy, or the timing of cytokine up-regulation in response to traumatic or stressful events may favor the development of sensitized central processes, which may influence clinical outcome.",

The IQ showed a relation with attention, memory, speed of information processing and some aspects of executive functioning. However, when IQ scores were corrected for processing speed, they were no longer below average.These findings are important in considering the value of intelligence levels in schizophrenia. IQ scores should be judged in combination with cognitive functioning and school career to assess a patients capabilities in society. Cognitive functions and other variables might have a considerable influence on IQ scores. This rises the question of whether the low IQ scores are a primary or secondary deficit. Schizophrenia patients may have normal IQs, but could be less capable of making an IQ-test.",

Case: A 38-year-old woman suffered from a ruptured arteriovenous malformation in the left temporal lobe. One and a half years later, the patient experienced her first generalized convulsion. EEG showed small spikes in the posterior of the left temporal lobe, which was observed during the hyperventilation and posthyperventilation stages. Because the location of the spikes correlated with the site of the lesion as observed from radiographic findings, she was diagnosed with lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. Drug treatment resulted in no further convulsive episodes and the patient has since returned to work. Conclusion: EEG recordings during hyperventilation should be regarded as an effective technique in analyzing epilepsy because of its ease and cost-effectiveness compared with other methods such as single-photon emission computed tomography.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Previous studies have suggested that somatoform disorders (SFD) might be associated with changes in the function of the central and autonomic nervous systems. The aim of this study was to examine the possible immunological differences between SFD and healthy controls. Methods: Twenty-four patients with SFD and 13 healthy individuals completed the psychological questionnaires to assess symptom reporting [Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R)] and to diagnose for SFD [Screening for Somatoform Symptoms scale (SOMS-scale)]. Participants also provided a blood sample taken in the morning, which was analysed with an automated cell counter to determine the number of leucocytes per μl and with flow cytometry to determine lymphocyte subsets. Results: With the exception of a higher T4/T8 ratio in the patient group, which was mainly because of lower CD8 counts, there were no significant differences in the absolute number of lymphocytes (subsets) between patients with SFD and healthy subjects. A positive correlation between B-lymphocyte subsets (CD19+CD22+, CD19+CD5+, CD19+CD3−) to all scales of the SCL-90-R, except somatisation, were found in SFD. Additionally, a positive correlation was found in SFD between CD14+CD16+ monocytes and somatisation (0.573) on the SCL-90-R scale. Conclusion: These data indicate that patients with SFD have an enhanced humoral immunity as shown by increased B-cell numbers and furthermore an elevated T4/T8 ratio because of lower CD8 suppressor cells. Further studies will be required to determine whether these alterations in lymphocyte subsets are directly involved in the pathophysiology of SFD.",

The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between autistic-like traits (ALTs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NFKB1 (encoding a subunit of the NF-κB protein complex) and NF-κB inhibitor-like protein 1 (NFKBIL1).The study was conducted in a cohort from the general population: The Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS, n = 12 319, 9-12 years old). The subjects were assessed by the Autism-Tics, ADHD, and Other Comorbidities Inventory. Five SNPs within the two genes were genotyped (NFKBIL1: rs2857605, rs2239707, rs2230365 and rs2071592; NFKB1: rs4648022).We found significant associations for two SNPs in NFKBIL1: rs2239707 showed a significant distribution of genotype frequencies in the case-control analysis both for all individuals combined and in boys only, and rs2230365 was significantly associated with the ALTs-module language impairment in boys only. Furthermore, we found nominal association in the case-control study for rs2230365, replicating earlier association between this SNP and ASD in an independent genome-wide association study.The shown associations between polymorphisms in NFKBIL1 and ALTs are supporting an influence of the immune system on neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Although the assessment of expression of serotonin-related genes in experimental animals has become a common strategy to shed light on variations in brain serotonergic function, it remains largely unknown to what extent the manipulation of serotonin levels causes detectable changes in gene expression. We therefore chose to investigate how sub-acute depletion or elevation of brain serotonin influences the expression of a number of serotonin-related genes in six brain areas. Methods: Male Wistar rats were administered a serotonin synthesis inhibitor, para -chlorophenylalanine ( p -CPA), or a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine, for 3 days and then sacrificed. The expression of a number of serotonin-related genes in the raphe nuclei, hypothalamus, amygdala, striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was investigated using real-time quantitative PCR (rt-qPCR). Results: While most of the studied genes were uninfluenced by paroxetine treatment, we could observe a robust downregulation of tryptophan hydroxylase-2 in the brain region where the serotonergic cell bodies reside, that is, the raphe nuclei. p -CPA induced a significant increase in the expression of Htr1b and Htr2a in amygdala and of Htr2c in the striatum and a marked reduction in the expression of Htr6 in prefrontal cortex; it also enhanced the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( Bdnf ) in raphe and hippocampus. Conclusion: With some notable exceptions, the expression of most of the studied genes is left unchanged by short-term modulation of extracellular levels of serotonin.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: In view of the neuroprotective characteristic of cannabidiol (CBD) and its beneficial action on aversive memory in non-diabetic animals, we aimed to investigate in animals with experimentally induced type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) whether CBD treatment would be able to impair the contextual fear memory consolidation, its generalisation and whether the effect would be lasting. We also investigated the CBD effect on anxiety-like responses. Methods: After T1DM induction, animals received single or more prolonged treatment with CBD and were submitted to the contextual fear conditioning test. As expression of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-Associated (Arc) protein is necessary for memory consolidation, we evaluated its expression in the dorsal hippocampus (DH). For evaluating anxiety-related responses, animals were submitted to the elevated plus maze test (EPMT), in which the time and number of entries in the open arms were used as anxiety index. Results: A single injection of CBD impaired the contextual fear memory consolidation and its generalisation, which was evaluated by exposing the animal in a neutral context. This single injection was able to reduce the elevated expression of Arc in the DH from these animals. Interestingly, more prolonged treatment with CBD also impaired the persistence of context-conditioned fear memory and induced an anxiolytic-like effect, as the treated group spent more time in the open arms of the EPMT. Conclusion: CBD interferes with contextual fear memory and the dosage regimen of treatment seems to be important. Moreover, we cannot rule out the involvement of emotional aspects in these processes related to fear memory.",

Static impedances are measured prior to stimulation using high-frequency electrical alternating pulses, dynamic impedances during passage of the stimulation current. Static impedance can partially be influenced by skin preparation techniques. Earlier studies showed a correlation between dynamic and static impedance in bitemporal and right unilateral ECT.This study aims at assessing the correlation of dynamic and static impedance with patient characteristics and seizure quality criteria in bifrontal ECT.We performed a cross-sectional single-centre retrospective analysis of ECT treatments at the Psychiatric University Hospital Zurich between May 2012 and March 2020 and used linear mixed-effects regression models in 78 patients with a total of 1757 ECT sessions.Dynamic and static impedance were strongly correlated. Dynamic impedance was significantly correlated with age and higher in women. Energy set and factors positively (caffeine) and negatively (propofol) affecting seizure at the neuronal level were not associated with dynamic impedance. For secondary outcomes, dynamic impedance was significantly related to Maximum Sustained Power and Average Seizure Energy Index. Other seizure quality criteria showed no significant correlation with dynamic impedance.Aiming for low static impedance might reduce dynamic impedance, which is correlated with positive seizure quality parameters. Therefore, good skin preparation to achieve low static impedance is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There appear to be huge variations and aberrations in the reported data in COVID-19 2 years now into the pandemic. Conflicting data exist at almost every level and also in the reported epidemiological statistics across different regions. It is becoming clear that COVID-19 is a polymorphic inflammatory spectrum of diseases, and there is a wide range of inflammation-related pathology and symptoms in those infected with the virus. The host’s inflammatory response to COVID-19 appears to be determined by genetics, age, immune status, health status and stage of disease. The interplay of these factors may decide the magnitude, duration, types of pathology, symptoms and prognosis in the spectrum of COVID-19 disorders, and whether neuropsychiatric disorders continue to be significant. Early and successful management of inflammation reduces morbidity and mortality in all stages of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Prenatal stress is believed to increase the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression. Adverse genetic and environmental impacts during early development, such as glucocorticoid hyper-exposure, can lead to changes in the fetal brain, linked to mental illnesses developed in later life. Dysfunction in the GABAergic inhibitory system is associated with depressive disorders. However, the pathophysiology of GABAergic signalling is poorly understood in mood disorders. Here, we investigated GABAergic neurotransmission in the low birth weight (LBW) rat model of depression. Methods: Pregnant rats, exposed to dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid, during the last week of gestation, yielded LBW offspring showing anxiety-and depressive-like behaviour in adulthood. Patch-clamp recordings from dentate gyrus granule cells in brain slices were used to examine phasic and tonic GABAA receptor-mediated currents. The transcriptional levels of selected genes associated with synaptic vesicle proteins and GABAergic neurotransmission were investigated. Results: The frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) was similar in control and LBW rats. Using a paired-pulse protocol to stimulate GABAergic fibres impinging onto granule cells, we found indications of decreased probability of GABA release in LBW rats. However, tonic GABAergic currents and miniature IPSCs, reflecting quantal vesicle release, appeared normal. Additionally, we found elevated expression levels of two presynaptic proteins, Snap-25 and Scamp2, components of the vesicle release machinery. Conclusion: The results suggest that altered GABA release may be an essential feature in the depressive-like phenotype of LBW rats.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: In sub-Saharan Africa, there are no validated screening tools for delirium in older adults, despite the known vulnerability of older people to delirium and the associated adverse outcomes. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a brief smartphone-based assessment of arousal and attention (DelApp) in the identification of delirium amongst older adults admitted to the medical department of a tertiary referral hospital in Northern Tanzania. Method: Consecutive admissions were screened using the DelApp during a larger study of delirium prevalence and risk factors. All participants subsequently underwent detailed clinical assessment for delirium by a research doctor. Delirium and dementia were identified against DSM-5 criteria by consensus. Results: Complete data for 66 individuals were collected of whom 15 (22.7%) had delirium, 24.5% had dementia without delirium, and 10.6% had delirium superimposed on dementia. Sensitivity and specificity of the DelApp for delirium were 0.87 and 0.62, respectively (AUROC 0.77) and 0.88 and 0.73 (AUROC 0.85) for major cognitive impairment (dementia and delirium combined). Lower DelApp score was associated with age, significant visual impairment (&lt;6/60 acuity), illness severity, reduced arousal and DSM-5 delirium on univariable analysis, but on multivariable logistic regression only arousal remained significant. Conclusion: In this setting, the DelApp performed well in identifying delirium and major cognitive impairment but did not differentiate delirium and dementia. Performance is likely to have been affected by confounders including uncorrected visual impairment and reduced level of arousal without delirium. Negative predictive value was nevertheless high, indicating excellent ‘rule out’ value in this setting.",

    "abstract": "A range of neuropathological changes occur in the brains of individuals with adult Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC), a recessive disorder of cholesterol trafficking that results in accumulation of cholesterol and gangliosides in lysosomes, particularly in neurons. One of the most significant regions of grey matter loss occurs in the thalami, which abut the midline. What is not known is whether these are neurodevelopmental in origin well prior to symptomatic onset. We aimed to examine other markers of midline developmental anomalies in adults with NPC.We examined the size of adhesio interthalamica (AI) and cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) (if present) in nine individuals diagnosed with NPC and nine healthy comparison subjects, matched for age and gender, using a 3T magnetic resonance volumetric sequence and measured the length of the AI and CSP in mm.We found that 5/9 NPC patients and 0/9 controls had a missing AI. AI length was significantly shorter in the patient group. No subject in other group had a large CSP, and CSP length did not differ. Duration of illness showed a trend to a negative correlation with AI length in patients.Our findings suggest that adult NPC patients show some markers of early neurodevelopmental disturbance, matching findings seen in psychotic disorders. The differences in AI, but not CSP, suggest neurodevelopmental change may occur early in gestation rather than post-partum. The relationship with duration of illness suggests that there may be atrophy over time in these structures, consistent with prior analyses of grey matter regions in NPC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V (vanilloid), member 1 (TRPV1) mediates pain perception to thermal and chemical stimuli in peripheral neurons. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB 1 ), on the other hand, promotes analgesia in both the periphery and the brain. TRPV1 and CB 1 have also been implicated in learned fear, which involves the association of a previously neutral stimulus with an aversive event. In this review, we elaborate on the interplay between CB 1 receptors and TRPV1 channels in learned fear processing. Methods: We conducted a PubMed search for a narrative review on endocannabinoid and endovanilloid mechanisms on fear conditioning. Results: TRPV1 and CB 1 receptors are activated by a common endogenous agonist, arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide), Moreover, they are expressed in common neuroanatomical structures and recruit converging cellular pathways, acting in concert to modulate fear learning. However, evidence suggests that TRPV1 exerts a facilitatory role, whereas CB 1 restrains fear responses. Conclusion: TRPV1 and CB 1 seem to mediate protective and aversive roles of anandamide, respectively. However, more research is needed to achieve a better understanding of how these receptors interact to modulate fear learning.",

After a short introduction, it is demonstrated that epidemiological studies show that a common pathophysiological basis can be assumed. Briefly pheno-menological aspects are mentioned, whereafter the changes in the different neurotransmittersystems are discussed in greater detail. The ratio of dopaminergic and serotonergic activities in the basal ganglia constitute an important determinant for the severity of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Reduced serotonergic metabolism may be a compensatory mechanism for the reduced dopaminergic activity. At the same time, a reduced serotonergic activity can predispose to a depression. Lower activities in parts of the dopaminergic, serotonergic and noradrenergic systems may each be responsible for part of the affective symptomatology in depressed Parkinson patients.",

Zowel in de premorbide toestand als tijdens de acute episoden van stemmingsstoornissen komt onder deze conditie een verhoogde cortisolreactie voor. Een irreversibele lage GAHA-concentratie kan aan dit regulatietekort een bijdrage leveren. Verhoogde noradrenerge en vasopressinerge activiteiten kunnen in de overgang naar hogere DEX-CRH-reacties tijdens de acute episode een rol spelen. De dexamethason-suppressie-test verschilt van de DEX-CRH-test door de afwezigheid van een externe CRH-belasting en ‘early escape’ in deze test is op specifieke wijze geassocieerd met het melancholische subsyndroom. Dit suggereert dat een endogeen verhoogde CRH-activiteit bij de overgang naar deze subcategorie is betrokken. Verhoogde CRH-activiteit is aangetoond en toenames van noradrenerge activiteit en 5-HT 2a -receptoren en afnames van glucocorticoïd-receptor-functie, tryptofaan-concentratie en serotonine-afgifte kunnen een bijdrage leveren.

Image analysis reports regional uptake/uptake in homologous hemisphere. Results: Alcohol dependence is associated with diminished perfusion in the anterior, and middle frontal regions, and increased perfusion in the posterior temporal regions. Frontal hypoperfusion is related to alcohol withdrawal because it disappears with longer time between imaging, last intake and correlates with a composite index of cognitive impairment at the time. Temporal hyperperfusion persists for longer periods. Severe dependence correlates with both frontal, and temporal altered perfusion. Discussion: Alcohol withdrawal leads to redistribution of blood flow favouring the temporal, and more posterior regions of the cortex at the expense of frontal flow.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a common problem; when chronic and disabling, subjects can be categorized as having chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Whilst it is most likely a multifactorial condition of biopsychosocial origin, the nature of the pathophysiological component remains unclear. There has been a wealth of interest in the possible hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction in CFS, and whether such changes may mediate fatigue. On balance, there appears to be reduced cortisol output in a proportion of patients, together with heightened negative feedback and glucocorticoid receptor function. There is evidence for impaired adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol responses to a variety of challenges. However, there is no evidence for a specific or uniform dysfunction of the HPA axis. Evidence that these changes may be related to symptom production comes from randomized controlled trials of glucocorticoid replacement therapy, which have shown improvements in fatigue and disability. Given the many factors that may impinge on the HPA axis in CFS, such as inactivity, sleep disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, medication and ongoing stress, it seems likely that there is not a single or specific change to the HPA axis in CFS and that the observed HPA axis disturbances are of multifactorial etiology. This is further supported by a comparison of neuroendocrine findings in other conditions in which fatigue is prominent, showing both similarities and differences with the pattern in CFS.",

Two polymerase chain reaction protocols [one-tube reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and two-step RT-PCR] were used to assay BDV p24 and p40 transcripts.The p24 and p40 viral nucleic acid sequences were not detected in the PBMC RNAs from any of the race horses or jockeys.These data do not support an epidemiological association between BDV infection, race horses and humans.",

Objective Combined treatment with clorgyline, an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A inhibitor, and selegiline, an irreversible MAO-B inhibitor, reportedly increases extracellular serotonin levels in the raphe nuclei more than clorgyline does alone. However, the effects of combination of these MAO inhibitors on extracellular noradrenaline have not been reported. Methods Using in vivo microdialysis, we measured extracellular noradrenaline and serotonin levels after administration of clorgyline and/or selegiline in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats. Results Administration of clorgyline (10 mg/kg) significantly increased both extracellular serotonin and noradrenaline levels. Combined treatment using clorgyline (10 mg/kg) and selegiline (3 mg/kg) increased extracellular serotonin and noradrenaline levels more than each drug alone did. Conclusions These findings of this study suggest the augmented antidepressant action of the combination of MAO-A inhibition and MAO-B inhibition. The addition of a MAO-A inhibitor to selegiline or increasing dose of selegiline to achieve full MAO-A inhibition might be the promising strategy for the antidepressant treatment in partial responders or non-responders to selegiline.",

Low-dose clozapine monotherapy for recurring episodes of depression, hypersomnia and behavioural disturbances: a case report. Case Report: We present a 27-year-old woman who manifested recurrent episodes of hypersomnia, compulsive hyperphagia, hypersexuality, impulsive behaviours, irritability and depressive mood since the age of 13 after a viral febrile infection. She had 3–4 episodes/year lasting from a few days to 2–3 weeks which were managed with various psychotropics. During her last episode, she was admitted because of persistent behavioural disturbances. Brain 99m-Tc-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography scans showed bilateral mesiotemporal and thalamic hypoperfusion, more significant in the right hemisphere. While hospitalised, she developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome following haloperidol administration. She was discharged on clozapine 100 mg/day. Over the following 30 months, she remained symptom free on clozapine 50–100 mg/day. Discussion: Differential diagnosis included either an atypical recurrent mood disorder with hypersomnia and behavioural disturbances or Kleine–Levin syndrome. Conclusion: Low-dose clozapine monotherapy may worth being further investigated for the management of recurring episodes of depression, hypersomnia and behavioural disturbances.",

Methods Young male Wistar rats were administered MPD (1, 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg) once a day or an intraperitoneal injection of saline for 28 days (chronic treatment) or for 1 day (acute treatment). Two hours after the last administration the animals were decapitated and their striatum was dissected. Results In this work, we show that continued treatment with MPD is capable of modifying the levels of phosphorylation of proteins JNK1/2 (c-Jun amino-terminal kinases 1 and 2) and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2). Whereas the level of phosphorylation of protein ERK increased significantly, that of proteins JNK1/2 diminished. Conclusion The alteration in the level of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases can be a molecular mechanism through which MPD exerts its therapeutic effect.",

In addition, the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) proteins in the gastric mucosa were measured by Western blotting.We found that the gastric epithelial cells were ruptured and the gastric pits were widened in rats with depression. The amount of mucous granules was also reduced in the surface mucous cells. Moreover, parietal cells became active, and the secretory canaliculi were magnified. Expression of HSP70 and FGF2 was reduced in the gastric mucosa.These findings suggested that gastric symptoms in rats with depressive-like behaviour were caused by the injury of the gastric mucosa, AQ1 and HSP70 and FGF2 may be key molecules in the pathogenesis.",

It is usually idiopathic. Its clinical manifestations vary from asymptomatic individuals to neuropsychiatric abnormalities, movement disorders, cerebellar symptoms and cognitive impairments. Methods : Five cases of BSPDC – all of which include psychiatric symptoms and speech problems – from two families are documented in this article. Conclusion : The most important diagnostic marker is the demonstration of symmetrical intracranial calcifications. Computerised tomography of the brain is the most frequently used radiologic method to diagnose BSPDC.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the relationship of oestrogen receptor (ER) status to the severity of depressive symptoms and quality of life (QOL) impairment in breast cancer patients.Seventy-seven breast cancer patients with comorbid depression were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) for depression, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B). ER status was determined using immunohistochemical analysis.The ER-positive group (n = 31) showed significantly higher scores compared with the ER-negative group (n = 46) on HAMD total (p = 0.04) and somatic anxiety factor (p = 0.004) scores as well as CGI-S score (p = 0.03). As for QOL measured with the FACT-B, a significantly higher score was found on the Functional Well-Being (FWB) subscale in the ER-positive group (p = 0.001). The relationships were further analysed using generalised linear models (GLM), after controlling for the influence of the current anti-oestrogen treatment. The analysis revealed that ER status was still significantly related to the FWB subscale score of the FACT-B (p = 0.04). However, the HAMD and CGI-S scores were no longer significantly related to ER status after the influence of anti-oestrogen treatment was controlled for.These results suggest that ER status, which is a well-known biological prognostic factor in breast cancer, may be related to the severity of certain aspects of depressive symptoms or QOL impairment, implying a role of the ER in affective and behavioural regulation. However, anti-oestrogen treatments significantly influence these relationships.",

The brain is highly dependent on ATP, and the cell energy is obtained through oxidative phosphorylation, a process which requires the action of various respiratory enzyme complexes and creatine kinase (CK) as an effective buffering system of cellular ATP levels in tissues that consume high energy.Evaluate the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, II, III, IV and CK activity in hippocampus and cortex of the Wistar rat submitted to meningitis by Klebsiella pneumoniae.Adult Wistar rats received either 10 µl of sterile saline as a placebo or an equivalent volume of K. pneumoniae suspension. The animals were killed in different times at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after meningitis induction. Another group was treated with antibiotic, starting at 16 h and continuing daily until their decapitation at 24 and 48 h after induction.In the hippocampus, the meningitis group without antibiotic treatment, the complex I was increased at 24 and 48 h, complex II was increased at 48 h, complex III was inhibited at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h and in complex IV all groups with or without antibiotic treatment were inhibited after meningitis induction, in the cortex there was no alteration. Discussion Although descriptive, our results show that antibiotic prevented in part the changes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The meningitis model could be a good research tool to study the biological mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the K. pneumoniae meningitis.",

Sleep deprivation studies had shown previously that sleepiness and alertness are co-determined by a process which keeps track of the history of sleep and wakefulness and the circadian pacemaker, which keeps track of time. During every day life and during sleep deprivation both processes change simultaneously and their relative contribution to alertness and sleep propensity cannot be assessed under these conditions.",

Upon total deprivation of sleep for one night, many patients experience an unexpected alleviation of their depression, which usually lasts until the subsequent sleep period. Attempts have been made to explain these changes of mood to result from induced changes in sleep physiological mechanisms. Such attempts can roughly be categorized in two classes. One class of hypotheses concerns proposed disturbances in circadian sleep control (i.e. the timing of sleep is inappropriately controlled), the other class concerns postulated disrupted homeostatic sleep control (i.e. the intensity of sleep is inappropriately controlled). For both types of theoretical approaches data have been published which are consistent with the hypotheses as well as data which are not.",

In the past, forensic toxicology was the most important part, but nowadays, at least in the Netherlands, the clinical, occupational and environmental toxicology have the centre of attention. The brain plays its own role in the clinical toxicology. There the intoxication can take place, it can be the basis of the peripheral symptoms of the intoxication or it can be the cause of the intoxication, e.g. at a suicidal attempt or the hospital addiction syndrome. The somatic treatment of an intoxicated patient includes in the first place the stabilization of the patient (cardio-vascular, ventilation and central effects); then the removal of the poison from the surroundings and out of the patient by different suitable methods and finally the symptomatic treatment, sometimes with antidotes. In the Netherlands, hardly any intoxication is fatal, when the patient arrives in the hospital in time, or euthanasia took place on purpose.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in stress research is when the glucocorticoid stress hormone (cortisol in man) stops being neuroprotective and becomes harmful to the brain with negative consequences for cognition and mood. To address this question Section 1 focuses on the action mechanism of glucocorticoids. These hormones act via high and low affinity nuclear receptors, which regulate gene transcription in a coordinate manner. The receptors are expressed abundantly in hippocampus, amygdala and frontal cortex involved in cognitive processes. In Section 2 hypercortisolism is considered a potential disease factor for about 50% of the patients suffering from major depression. Recent data show that these patients recover within a few days when excess cortisol action is blocked with high doses of an antiglucocorticoid. Section 3 concerns animal models with ‘depression-like’ features of hypercorticism generated by manipulation of gene X environment inputs. Using gene expression profiling technology in the hippocampal transcriptome of these animals we identified about 700 potential targets for antidepressants out of 30 000 detectable gene products. One of our models is based on early life programming of the stress system. Rats exposed as pups to maternal deprivation display at senescence an enhanced individual difference in cognitive performance. The maternally deprived senescent animals age either successfully or become senile, at the expense of the average performance of non-deprived controls. The essay is concluded with the notion that the new generation of antidepressants ameliorates specific psychic dysfunctions (e.g. cognitive performance) linked to aberrant stress hormone action in discrete brain regions.",

Aggression is not more frequent among epilepsy patients than in the general population, but if it does happen it is often more severe. There is a need for controlled treatment studies.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) considering the effectiveness and adverse effects of antidepressants and neuroleptics in epileptic patients with mental retardation are seriously needed. In the meantime, the Expert Consensus Guideline Series on Treatment of Psychiatric and Behavioural Problems in Mental Retardation is useful.

Evidence suggests that treatment with long-acting injectable antipsychotics reduces the impact of partial compliance and provides predictable release of medication, assuring continuous therapeutic coverage. Until recently, only conventional antipsychotic agents were available in long-acting formulations, thereby foregoing the advantages of the atypical class. Atypical agents which are given orally have been shown to provide long-term efficacy and tolerability benefits compared with conventional agents, but are limited by the need for daily administration. The most recent pharmacological strategy to achieve optimal maintenance treatment has been to combine the benefits of an atypical antipsychotic with delivery in a water-based long-acting formulation. The first antipsychotic to achieve this combination - long-acting risperidone - may thus represent an important advance in the optimization of long-term treatment outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Heroin has been prescribed in England for the treatment of heroin addiction for almost 100 years. For many years, England was almost the only country where this occurred, and the British system was consequently the subject of international curiosity. In spite of this long history, very little research has been carried out locally, and until recently, there were no guidelines as to best practice. In 1965, it was decided that only doctors with a Home Office license could prescribe heroin. Since that time, the proportion of opiate addicts treated with heroin has greatly diminished, as has the number of doctors willing to prescribe. One doctor in particular remained an enthusiastic proponent of heroin prescription. His claims impressed some Swiss clinicians, who proceeded to establish a multicentre trial in Switzerland. This was followed by a similar trial in the Netherlands. These trials apparently indicated that a proportion of treatment-resistant opiate addicts could respond well to heroin, although the researchers' conclusions have been disputed. The National Treatment Agency in England is now developing guidelines for good practice based on this new information and is planning to set up some pilot sites. It is likely that practise in England will remain somewhat different from continental practice, particularly with respect to long-term supervised injecting. It is unclear how much funding will be released to support heroin prescription. Without adequate funding, it is likely to disappear.",

Substantial modifications to the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) have resulted in more sensitive and reliable indicators of various aspects of memory functioning in the WMS-III, which enables generation of auditory, visual and working memory indices.The aim of the present study was to examine the memory profile of individuals with schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorder (n = 19), their unaffected first-degree family members (n = 11), and healthy controls (n = 9).The study involved neuropsychological testing, including the immediate and working memory subtests of the WMS-III, utilizing both auditory and visual domains. Symptom assessment was performed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), version 2.0. Two multivariate analyses of covariance (mancova) were conducted: (i) comparing patients, relatives and controls; and (ii) comparing relatives and controls only.The first analysis indicated that the patient group obtained significantly lower index scores than both relatives and controls on all three indices. The second analysis indicated that the performance of relatives was significantly lower than controls on the working memory index, although there were no significant differences on the auditory and visual immediate index scores.The differential impairment in working memory performance in clinically asymptomatic family members suggests that the WMS-III working memory index score may be a potential phenotypic marker of schizophrenia.",

A comparison of the symptomatic profile between two consecutive depressive episodes in patients with bipolar disorder type I.To compare the variability of patterns of depressive symptoms between two consecutive depressive episodes in patients with bipolar disorder type I.Review of prospectively collected data from 136 subjects of an out-patient bipolar unit from 1997 to 2007. Binomial statistics was used for the analysis of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)-31 items of the first and second episodes, and the correlation of the HDRS-31 item scores of both episodes was determined using the Spearman coefficient.Ten depressive symptoms showed a significant correlation between index and subsequent episodes: psychological anxiety, somatic anxiety, somatic symptoms, diurnal variation, paranoid symptoms, obsessive and compulsive symptoms, hypersomnia, loss of appetite and helplessness. Only four symptoms were stable in both statistical tests: paranoid symptoms, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, loss of appetite and hypersomnia.Paranoid and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, loss of appetite and hypersomnia tended to be found in successive episodes. However, the moderate correlations of the symptoms across two depressive recurrences suggested that clinical presentations in bipolar depression may not be predicted by symptom profiles presented in previous episodes.",

An adult female patient with ring chromosome 21: behavioural phenotype and results of high-resolution molecular characterisation.A female adult patient with mild to moderate mental retardation and minor dysmorphisms was referred for neuropsychiatric examination because of psychotic and autistic symptoms and impulsive behaviours.Standardized neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment as well as detailed somatic and neurological examination was performed. For genetic analysis, karyotyping, whole genome array analysis, and high-resolution detailed analysis of chromosome 21 were carried through.Karyotyping showed a de novo ring chromosome 21: 46,XX,der(21)r(21)(p11q22.3). High-resolution array analysis demonstrated a complex aberration consisting of an interstitial duplication in 21q21.1, an interstitial deletion in 21q22.2q22.3, an interstitial deletion in 21q22.3 and a terminal deletion of 21q22.3. Apart from mild dysmorphisms, visual and auditory impairments, and infertility, no somatic or neurological abnormalities were found. A formal psychiatric diagnosis could not be established. The behavioural problems and the supposed psychiatric symptoms could be related to her disharmonic social cognitive profile. The behaviour normalized after the patient returned to a stable and structured living environment.High-resolution micro-array analysis techniques are essential to substantiate the genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with r(21) and other genetic disorders. Moreover, the results of this study stress the importance of the recognition of alexithymia as a potential cause for behavioural problems and psychiatric symptoms in patients with mental retardation in general.",

That review should sensitize clinicians for their responsibility to provide individualized, optimally effective, gender-specific care to patients suffering from mental diseases in some special topics. It should be a short overview considering some important gender details illustrated in concern with the epidemiological background, the symptoms and general used psychiatric treatment strategies of some frequent psychiatric diagnoses.",

Freedom is graded, limited, based on nature, but not developed without good will. We perceive reliably freedom by self-consciousness and in other persons as long as we are sober. Freedom needs intelligence, but is more, it is a creative and moral virtue. The basis for freedom is phylogenesis and culture, in the individual learning and experimenting. Factors in the becoming of freedom are not only genes and environment but also self-discipline. But the creativity of free will is dangerous. Man therefore needs morale. Drives and feelings become humanized, cultural interests are developed. There is a humane nobility from long good will.",

This hypothesis states that there exists an episodic overactivity of noradrenergic systems in panic disorder. Experiments with yohimbine form the cornerstone of this theory, and additional supporting evidence is provided by challenge studies with isoproterenol and treatment studies with clonidine. These studies are critically reviewed and it is argued that based upon the studies with yohimbine one cannot conclude that there is a specific noradrenergic abnormality in panic disorder, since yohimbine also affects dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons in the brain. In an alternative theory on the relationship between noradrenaline and anxiety it is postulated that increases in anxiety, irrespective of the diagnostic category, are related to increases in locus coeruleus activity.",

In patients with Parkinsons' Disease, serotonergic activity is generally reduced, which is considered a compensating mechanism for the reduced dopaminergic activity. At the same time, reduction of serotonin activity may play a role in the expression of cognitive and affective symptoms. Functional intervention with serotonergic agents makes it possible to temporarily enhance or reduce the availability of serotonin in the brain. This will provide the opportunity to study motor, cognitive and affective symptoms in an integrated approach. This type of research has hardly been preformed in patients with Parkinson's Disease.",

    "abstract": "Summary In man a great interindividual variability exists in the oxidative capacity to metabolize drugs. A major factor contributing to this phenomenon is the genetically determined hydroxyla-tion-capacity of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The cytochrome P450 system comprises of several isozymes. For several isozymes (CYP2D6, CYP2C) a genetically based hydroxylation capacity has been demonstrated. A frequency distribution of the clearance shows a bimodal distribution with poor and extensive metabolizers. Applying standard dosing schemes of the drugs that are predominantly metabolised by these isozymes, a considerable number of patients will be intoxicated because of poor metabolism. In general, cytochrome P450 capacity is limited and substrate-affinity is high. Henceforth cytochrome P450 isozymes are likely targets for pharmacokinetic interactions.",

Twee open onderzoeken (één retrospectief en één prospectief) vinden geen effect op de motoriek.

Affective dysregulation has been recognized as a major riskfactor for cardiac death in patients with CAD. Therefore treatment of affective dysregulation is important from both the psychiatric and cardiac perspective. An evidence based treatment algorithm for affective disorders is as yet not available. In this paper a possible etiological model for the relationship between affective and cardiac dysregulation is proposed, based on the stress-diathesis model.",

Knowledge about the involvement of these enzymes and biotransformation processes is mandatory because of the individual variability in their metabolic capacity. Regular measurement of plasmaconcentrations of (psycho)pharmacological compounds is therefore essential. In addition, the potential value of pheno- and/or genotyping has to be investigated.",

Direct access to pathophysiological processes is fraught with difficulty. However, receptor-regulated second messenger-mediated calcium shifts are an accessible and practical method by which to examine changes in a clinical population. This is possible because platelets and neurons share some physiological features. The platelet intracellular calcium response to receptor stimulation has previously been used as a peripheral marker of psychiatric illness across a range of neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine and glutamate. This review considers the specificity and selectivity of this response and its use in psychotic and mood disorders.",

A range of neuropsychological abnormalities have also been documented in the biological asymptomatic relatives of patients with schizophrenia; however, recognition memory has not been one of them.This study was carried out in order to investigate: (i) verbal and facial recognition memory in terms of accuracy and false alarm rates; and (ii) contributions from the episodic and semantic memory systems to recognition memory, in the biological asymptomatic parents of a reported schizophrenic patient and a set of male and female psychotic controls.Gender differences failed to emerge between the psychotic controls on any of the recognition measures (discrimination accuracy, response bias, hit and false alarm rates, 'remember' and 'know' recognition memory decisions). However, there was evidence of recognition dysfunction in the female relative, and to a lesser extent, in the male. Both parent's recognition memory performance profiles were marked by a pathologically elevated false alarm rate, and an increased dependence 'remember' judgements, i.e. input from the episodic memory system, to drive recognition memory decisions.These findings are discussed in the context of models of episodic and semantic memory impairment in schizophrenia.",

Total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and free fatty acids were increased while HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were unaltered. The concentration of membrane hexose, fucose, cholesterol and phospholipids in the RBC membrane decreased significantly but the total RBC membrane GAG was unaltered.Epileptogenesis could be due to a dysfunctional isoprenoidal pathway and paroxysmal hypothalamic digoxin hypersecretion.",

Methods: SD and FSL rats were divided into pre-pubertal and pubertal groups, whereafter 14-day saline or SIL treatment was initiated. Pre-pubertal and pubertal rats were treated from postnatal day 21 (PND21) and PND35, respectively. The open field and forced swim tests (FST) were performed on PND60, followed by hippocampal BDNF level analysis 1 day later. Results: FSL rats displayed greater immobility in the FST compared to SD rats ( p &lt; 0.0001), which was reduced by SIL ( p &lt; 0.0001), regardless of treatment period. Hippocampal BDNF levels were unaltered by SIL in all treatment groups ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: Juvenile sub-chronic SIL treatment reduces the risk of depressive-like behaviour manifesting during young adulthood in genetically susceptible rats.",

There is, however, still a paucity of longitudinal studies with long follow-up times on levels of cytokines in such patients. The current study assesses patients with and without PTSD diagnosis 1 year after discharge from inpatient treatment.Patients in treatment for serious non-psychotic mental disorders were recruited at the beginning of their treatment stay at a psychiatric centre in Norway. Ninety patients submitted serum samples and filled out the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-90 Revised Global Severity Index (HSCL-90R GSI) questionnaire during their mainstay and at a follow-up stay 1 year after discharge. Of these patients, 33 were diagnosed with PTSD, 48 with anxiety, depression, or eating disorder, while 9 patients had missing data. The patients were diagnosed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).At the follow-up stay (T3), PTSD patients had higher levels of GSI scores than non-PTSD patients (p = 0.048). These levels were unchanged from the year before (T2) in both groups. The levels of circulating cytokines/chemokine did not differ between the PTSD and non-PTSD patients at T3. At T2, however, the PTSD and non-PTSD groups exhibited different levels of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) (p = 0.053), IL-1RA (p = 0.042), and TNF-α (p = 0.037), with the PTSD patients having the higher levels.Despite exhibiting different mental distress scores, the PTSD and non-PTSD patients did not differ regarding levels of circulating inflammatory markers at 1-year follow-up.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of mania in bipolar disorders needs to be more efficient, as the manic condition creates severe problems for the patient when it comes to work, finances, relationships and health. This proof-of-concept study examines to what extent casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) may reduce the precursors of dopamine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, in plasma, and therefore be a potential new intervention to treat acute manic episodes. METHOD: The study was designed as a double-blind randomised dose-response study of CGMP (with added leucine and tryptophan) in 15 healthy men, receiving 3 different doses of CGMP with an interval of at least 14 days. RESULTS: Administration of CGMP produced a dose-dependent depletion of plasma aromatic amino acids. The total area under the curve of plasma ratios of phenylalanine-tyrosine compared to the level of leucine-isoleucine-valine--tryptophan was CGMP (20 g): 3.648 [SE:0.3281]; CGMP (40 g): 2.368 [SE:0.1858]; and CGMP (60 g)1.887 [SE:0.2591]. A comparison of the groups showed a dose-dependent statistical difference, with a one-way ANOVA summary (Dunnett) F = 11.87, p = 0.0003, CGMP 20 g versus CGMP 40 g, p = 0.0042, CGMP 20 g versus CGMP 60 g, p = 0.0002. No significant side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrate CGMP is a well-tolerated and effective mixture, and that 60 g of CGMP produced the highest depletion of plasma aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine). The effect seems to be highest after 3-4 h. We therefore conclude that this dose should be the one considered for future studies involving CGMP in humans.",

In the past two decades, there has been a wealth of research examining how we recognise faces, detect emotional cues, interpret facial expressions and determine the affective salience of faces. The value of faces has been assessed across all ages from the intimacy of facial recognition and emotional cognition that occurs between mothers and their babies to the alienation and lack of recognition that can occur in neurodegenerative disorders in the elderly. For cognitive neuroscientists, faces are a rich resource, that at one level, are a simple and easily recognisable and definable stimulus, but at another form, a complex composite of many sophisticated processes, such as eye movements and smiling. By necessity, faces are readily recognised and the emotional significance of expressions is reliably and quickly evaluated despite their vast variety and the unique characteristics of each. Faces also appear to be able to impart the full spectrum of emotions, and in addition to being indicative of mood, have proven to be useful in inducing affective states and producing emotional valence. Hence, their use in cognitive neuroscience. An extension of this research is the examination of ‘self’ and the engagement of theory of mind. The latter topic is touched upon in this issue’s Pictures and Prose that examines mentalising or ‘thinking about thinking’(2). In relation to this theme, we also have a Comment on Cotard’s delusion in which the self is negated (3). In this spirit of self-determination, Acta Neuropsychiatrica continues a journey of self-realisation with its new face and new format. It has been assisted greatly in this regard by its sister Journal, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, as indeed have I, through mentorship from its editor Professor Povl Munk-Jorgensen. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to personally thank Povl for his generous support and that of his editorial office. In fact, the two editorial offices have developed close mutual contact and have agreed a mechanism, whereby articles that cannot be accommodated, in either journal, because of their respective mandates or page limitations, can with editorial discretion be considered if suitable for publication in the alternate journal. From an author’s perspective, this can expedite publication and avoids unnecessary delay. This, along with other issues, will be discussed at our forthcoming Advisory Board meeting, and I encourage you to submit any suggestions you may have for the board and myself to consider.",

However, the relationship between childhood and adult neuropsychological and brain structural findings has not been proven, and we do not know whether only some schizophrenics have a developmental origin, or whether patients differ only in the degree of developmental impairment that they show.",

Originally, in the mid-sixties it was hypothesized that depressive states may be associated with disorders in brain noradrenalin and/or serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) metabolism or function resulting in the socalled monoamine hypothesis of depression. Subsequent investigations revealed that altered 5-HT metabolism is not related to mood disorder per se, but to components of the depressive syndrome and more specifically to increased anxiety and/or signs of dysregulated aggression, including violent suicidal attempts. Concerning aggression and other types of disruptive or impulsive behavior, research on their neurobiological determinants has been focussed mainly on indicators of central 5-HT function.",

Since Kraepelin symptom variation has been recognized to have both biological and environmental roots. If investigated systematically, such variations in illness experience will yield new subtypes that will provide greater insight into the onset, course and vulnerability of mental disorders. Studies ranging from population surveys to the laboratory have demonstrated that psychopathology is not randomly distributed in a population, nor is it constantly present in the lives of individuals. At both the population and the person levels, psychopathology varies with time and place. At the population level, illness processes localize in risk groups, who often reside in specific neighbourhoods or social settings. The individual experience of psychopathology also fluctuates with time, place and culture. This variability requires methods for case detection and treatment planning that take this into account.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that brain serotonin neurotransmission may mediate the actions of lithium carbonate. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) reduces brain serotonin and allows the study of this neurotransmitter in patient groups. Serotonin modulates electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, which is abnormal in bipolar disorder, and EEG abnormalities persist in euthymic bipolar patients. The EEG may therefore be a sensitive marker of 5-HT function in bipolar disorder.This study examined the effects of ATD on mood, suicidal ideation and EEG activity in bipolar patients who were symptomatically stable on lithium.19 subjects satisfying DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder participated in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled random-order crossover study. Following acute tryptophan depletion (induced by a 100g amino acid drink following an overnight fast) symptoms were evaluated, quantitative power spectrum brain mapping and measurement of auditory evoked potentials were carried out.ATD produced a significant fall in the amplitude of N1P2 and P300 components of the auditory evoked potential, but no significant changes in the power spectrum. There was an 83% reduction in plasma tryptophan (p<0.05, paired t-test) after the depleting but not the control drink. No significant changes in mood or suicidally scores were recorded after ATD.ATD attenuates auditory evoked potentials in bipolar disorder but does not reverse lithium's effects on mood and suicidally in bipolar disorder.",

This hypersensitivity is associated with persistent changes in the reactivity of neurons of the motivational (mesocorticolim-bic) system in the brain. Using an animal model for relapse, recent studies in our laboratory show that relapse to drug-seeking behavior (following extinction of intravenous cocaine or heroin self-administration) depends on the occurrence of sensitization. Accordingly, sensitization and conditioning seem to be more important for the persistence of drug and alcohol addiction then the occurrence of withdrawal phenomena. Biochemical research on the molecular and cellular basis of behavioral sensitization and behavioral studies on readjustment of stimulus responsiveness in rats, is of great importance for the development of an adequate pharmacotherapy of addiction.",

Until recently, idiopathic depression has generally been related to deficiencies of aminergic systems. In Alzheimer patients we found a strong decrease in the number of neurons in the locus coeruleus and brain noradrenaline concentrations, but in depressed Alzheimer patients we did not find an extra de crease. This is in agreement with the finding that there is no cell loss in the locus coeruleus in idiopathic depression. We did find, however, that the number of corticotropin-releasing hormone-, vasopressin- and oxytocin expressing neurons, the number of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons co-expressing vasopressin and the amount of corticotropin-releasing hormone -mRNA in idiopathic depression were strongly increased in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. This result supports the hypothesis on the pathogenetic involvement of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in depression and is of clinical relevance, since it may provide a theoretical rationale for antidepressive therapy with CRH antagonists.",

Departing from these approaches, a review of the most widely used instruments on depression is given, with a focus on the reliability and validity of the dimensional depression instruments, based on the findings of our research group. The importance of the differentiation between dimensional and categorical levels of measurement can also be recognised within the discussion on quantitative/dimensional versus qualitative/categorical taxonomic views on depression. The Integrated Threshold Model, which integrates both the quantitative and the qualitative view on the classification of depressive disorders, is considered. By way of conclusion, a diagnostic multi level/modality/method strategy is discussed and a specific test battery, which can be particularly useful within a research context, is presented.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Advances towards the understanding of the etiological mechanisms involved in mood disorders provide interesting yet diverse hypotheses and promising models. In this context, molecular genetics has now been widely incorporated into genetic epidemiological research in psychiatry. Affective disorders and, in particular, bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) have been examined in many molecular genetic studies which have covered a large part of the genome, specific hypotheses such as mutations have also been studied. Most recent studies indicate that several chromosomal regions may be involved in the aetiology of BPAD. Other studies have reported the presence of anticipation in BPAD. This phenomenon describes the increase in clinical severity and decrease in age of onset observed in successive generations. This mode of transmission correlates with the presence of specific mutations (Trinucleotide Repeat Sequences) and may represent a genetic factor involved in the transmission of the disorder. In parallel to these new developments in molecular genetics, the classical genetic epidemiology, represented by twin, adoption and family studies, provided additional evidence in favour of the genetic hypothesis in mood disorders. Moreover, these methods have been improved through models to test the gene-environment interactions. While significant advances have been made in this major field of research, it appears that integrative models, taking into account the interactions between biological (genetic) factors and social (psychosocial environment) variables offer the most reliable way to approach the complex mechanisms involved in the etiology and outcome of mood disorders.",

Methods: We performed a case-control study of TB patients and unmatched healthy controls, from a demographic surveillance site in Guinea-Bissau. Screening for CMD was performed once for controls and at inclusion and follow-up for TB patients. Kessler 10 (K-10) and a brief version of Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 (SCL-8d) were used as screening instruments. Results: 571 controls were interviewed and 416 interviews were performed for 215 TB cases. Estimated CMD prevalence at the time of diagnosis of TB was 33.6 % (SCL-8d) and 46.2 % (K-10), compared with 6.8 % (SCL-8d) and 6.7 % (K-10) among controls; adjusted OR 7.18 (95 % CI 4.07 to 12.67) and 14.52 (95 % CI 8.15 to 25.84), respectively. No significant difference in CMD prevalence rates was observed between TB patients, after 6 months of treatment, and controls. Conclusion: Psychological distress and common mental disorders were more prevalent among TB patients at the time of diagnosis compared with the background population, but after completion of TB treatment no increased prevalence of psychological distress was found.",

Methods: The psychiatric medical records of 46 patients having received iv ketamine on a psychiatric treatment indication between 2015 and 2018 were retrospectively examined. Analysis comparing the number and duration of hospital admissions before and after ketamine treatment as well as logistic regression analysis to investigate clinical predictors of effectiveness, were performed. To assess patients’ severity of depressed symptoms records were screened for MADRS-S scores. Results: No significant difference between pre- and posttreatment hospital days ( p = 0.170), or number of hospitalisations ( p = 0.740) were found. The response rate was 31% and remission rate 21%. None of the predictors showed statistical significance in the logistic model. Conclusion: Iv ketamine treatment showed effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms even with complex patients in a real-world clinical setting. However, this did not translate to a reduction in hospitalisation. Highlighting the multifaceted challenges posed when implementing iv ketamine treatment in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Empathy is a key factor to examine in development, because of its predictive associations with both aggression and successful prosocial behaviour. However, established measures of empathy for Low-to-Middle Income Countries, including South Africa, are lacking. In children, parent-report measures are key. However, a local study examining empathy and aggression (Malcolm-Smith et al ., 2015) found poor psychometric performance for a widely used parent-report measure of dispositional empathy, the Griffith Empathy Measure (GEM). We thus investigated which of two questionnaires measuring dispositional cognitive and affective empathy perform better in this context. Method: We contrasted internal consistency reliability of a simplified version of the GEM (SGEM; n = 160) and a parent-report version of the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE; n = 440) in a low-mid socio-economic status sample. Convergence between the measures and factor structure were also assessed. Results: The parent-report version of the QCAE performed well as a measure of child dispositional cognitive and affective empathy, with good reliability (overall α = 0.90 vs. SGEM α = .63), and confirmatory factor analysis supporting the two-factor structure. The SGEM’s reliability and failure to correlate with QCAE indicated poor psychometric performance. Conclusion: This is the first psychometric evaluation of the QCAE as a parent-report measure, and our results indicate that it should prove useful for future assessments of dispositional empathy in children across a variety of contexts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is a substantial use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) among both the general population and psychiatric patients, with only a minority of these users disclosing this information to their healthcare providers, including physicians and psychiatrists. This widespread use of CAM can impact positively or negatively on the clinical outcomes of psychiatric patients, and it is often done along with conventional medicines. Among CAM, phytotherapy has a major clinical relevance due to the introduction of potential adverse effects and drug interactions. Thus, the psychiatrist must learn about phytotherapy and stay up-to-date with solid scientific knowledge about phytotherapeutics/herbal medicines to ensure optimal outcomes for their patients. Furthermore, questions about herbal medicines should be routinely asked to psychiatric patients. Finally, scientifically sound research must be conducted on this subject.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To compare time to relapse in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) stabilised on antidepressant treatment (ADT) + brexpiprazole who were randomised to continued adjunctive brexpiprazole or brexpiprazole withdrawal (switch to placebo). Methods: This Phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, randomised withdrawal study enrolled adults with MDD and inadequate response to 2–3 ADTs. All patients started on adjunctive brexpiprazole 2–3 mg/day (Phase A, 6–8 weeks). Patients whose symptoms stabilised (Phase B, 12 weeks) were randomised 1:1 to adjunctive brexpiprazole or adjunctive placebo (Phase C, 26 weeks). The primary endpoint was time to relapse in Phase C. Depression rating scale score changes were secondary endpoints. Results: 1149 patients were enrolled and 489 patients were randomised (ADT + brexpiprazole n = 240; ADT + placebo n = 249). Median time to relapse was 63 days from randomisation in both treatment groups for patients who received ≥1 dose. Relapse criteria were met by 22.5% of patients (54/240) on ADT + brexpiprazole and 20.6% (51/248) on ADT + placebo (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.67; p = 0.51, log-rank test). Depression scale scores improved during Phases A–B and were maintained in Phase C. Mean weight increased by 2.2 kg in Phases A–B and stabilised in Phase C. Conclusion: Time to relapse was similar between continued adjunctive brexpiprazole and brexpiprazole withdrawal; in both groups, ∼80% of stabilised patients remained relapse free at their last visit. Adjunctive brexpiprazole therapy was generally well tolerated over up to 46 weeks, with minimal adverse effects following brexpiprazole withdrawal. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03538691.

Recent proposals suggest a down-prioritisation of causal inference and argue that prediction paves the road to ‘precision psychiatry’ (i.e., individualised treatment). In this perspective, we critically appraise these proposals. Methods: We outline strengths and weaknesses of causal inference and prediction frameworks and describe the link between clinical decision-making and counterfactual predictions (i.e., causality). We describe three key causal structures that, if not handled correctly, may cause erroneous interpretations, and three pitfalls in prediction research. Results: Prediction and causal inference are both needed in psychiatric research and their relative importance is context-dependent. When individualised treatment decisions are needed, causal inference is necessary. Conclusion: This perspective defends the importance of causal inference for precision psychiatry.",

The aim of our study was to study the associations between LEP and LEPR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and treatment response of depression. Associations between leptin levels and depression severity were also investigated. The data included 242 depressed patients in secondary psychiatric care. Symptoms of depression were assessed with the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Previously found LEP and LEPR SNPs associated with depression and other mood disorders were studied. Furthermore, all available LEP and LEPR SNPs were clumped using proxy SNPs to represent gene areas in r2 > 0.2 linkage disequilibrium and their association with treatment response was analysed with logistic regression. Two proxy SNPs of LEPR gene, rs12564738 and rs12029311, were associated with MADRS response at 6 weeks (p adjusted = 0.024, p adjusted = 0.024). SNPs from previous studies were not associated with MADRS response, but LEPR rs12145690 from a previous study was strongly associated with rs12564738 (r2 = 0.94). The positive association between leptin levels and MADRS score at baseline after adjusting with age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score, and smoking was found (p = 0.011). Our findings suggest that LEPR polymorphisms are associated with depression treatment response. We also found associations between leptin levels and depression independently of BMI. Further studies and meta-analyses are needed to confirm the significance of found SNPs and the role of leptin in depression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic crucial for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, characterised by its multi-receptor targeting, including serotonin (5-HT2A, 5-HT2C) and dopamine (D1, D2, D3, D4) receptors, among others. This broad mechanism is effective against positive symptoms of schizophrenia with a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. However, clozapine poses significant haematological risks, notably agranulocytosis, necessitating stringent blood monitoring protocols. Methods: This study examined haematological parameters in 157 patients on clozapine therapy, analysing the prevalence and clinical correlations of haematological abnormalities such as leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, and alterations in red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and mean platelet volume (MPV). Results: The findings revealed leucocytosis in 36.9% of patients, thrombocytosis in 8.9%, and elevated RDW in 23.6%. Notably, higher clozapine doses were associated with leucocytosis, though no significant correlations were found between clozapine dose, duration of use, and changes in RDW, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, or MPV. Conclusion: The study’s results underscore the necessity of regular haematological monitoring to mitigate the risks of clozapine therapy while leveraging its therapeutic benefits. Additionally, the study suggests personalised dosing strategies to balance efficacy and safety, particularly in managing clozapine-induced haematological changes.",

This is a cross-sectional study consisting of 45 individuals with schizophrenia who are in remission and 45 healthy individuals. The differences and relationships between categorical variables and serum protein levels of the patient and control groups were statistically analysed. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used for the diagnostic decision-making properties of serum protein levels to predict the presence of the disease. In comparison with the control group, the median levels of serum proteins galanin and alarin were statistically lower in the patient group, whereas METRNL and IMA levels were higher. Considering the predictive values of serum proteins in the diagnosis of the disease, it was observed that serum galanin, alarin, and IMA levels had a sensitivity and specificity higher than 80%, followed by METRNL with 73.3% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity. Our findings reveal galanin, alarin, meteorin-like protein, and IMA are important molecules with high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing schizophrenia. Furthermore, we think that further studies are needed to use them as reliable parameters in terms of clinical course, classification, and prognosis in explaining the etiopathogenesis of the disease.",

There is accumulating evidence that this therapeutic effect is not due to antidepressant effects. The results of the treatment-studies strongly suggests that 5-HT is involved in OCD. CSF-studies seem to confirm this. Possibly the therapeutic effect is related with adaptive changes of 5-HT receptors. There is evidence that in a subgroup of O CD-patients the dopaminergic system is involved.",

    "abstract": "It has been established that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) affects several aspects of immunoreactivity, e.g. production of proinflammatory cytokines. It has been shown that TRH enhances the therapeutic efficiency of classical tricyclic antidepressants. Proinflammatory cytokines may play a role in the etiology of depression, whereas the therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants may be related to their negative immunoregulatory effects.In order to verify the hypothesis that TRH-induced increase of therapeutic efficiency of classical tricyclic antidepressants results from synergistic inhibitory effects of these agents on the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, we determine the effect of imipramine or fluoxetine with and without TRH on the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) by stimulated human whole blood cells.Diluted whole blood of 17 volunteers was incubated with imipramine or fluoxetine (both in doses of 10-5 M) with or without TRH (in a dose of 10-5 M). The supernatants were collected 24 h later for the assay of TNF-α and after 72 h for the assays of IFN-γ and IL-10. The three cytokines were assayed by ELISA methods.A significant decrease in production of IFN-γ was observed in cells stimulated with mitogens and co-incubated with imipramine or fluoxetine and TRH. Under the same conditions, TRH alone did not change the production of these cytokines, whereas imipramine alone significantly decreases IFN-γ production, and fluoxetine alone significantly decreases IFN-γ and TNF-α production.Although a significant decrease in IFN-γ production was observed after joint application of TRH and antidepressants, our data did not support the above-mentioned hypothesis. Indeed, we did not observe synergistic inhibitory effects of these agents on the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.",

    "abstract": "Background/aims: The isoprenoid pathway produces three key metabolites: endogenous digoxin (membrane sodium-potassium ATPase inhibitor, immunomodulator and regulator of neurotransmitter/amino acid transport), dolichol (regulates N-glycosylation of proteins) and ubiquinone (free radical scavenger). The role of the isoprenoid pathway in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis in relation to hemispheric dominance was studied. Methods: The isoprenoid pathway-related cascade was assessed in patients with systemic sarcoidosis with pulmonary involvement. The pathway was also assessed in patients with right hemispheric, left hemispheric and bihemispheric dominance for comparison to find out the role of hemispheric dominance in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. Results: In patients with sarcoidosis there was elevated digoxin synthesis, increased dolichol and glycoconjugate levels and low ubiquinone and elevated free radical levels. There was also an increase in tryptophan catabolites and a reduction in tyrosine catabolites. There was an increase in the cholesterol:phospholipid ratio and a reduction in the glycoconjugate level of red blood cell (RBC) membrane in this group of patients. The same biochemical patterns were obtained in individuals with right hemispheric dominance. In individuals with left hemispheric dominance the patterns were reversed. Conclusions: Endogenous digoxin, by activating the calcineurin signal transduction pathway of T cells, can contribute to immune activation in sarcoidosis. An altered glycoconjugate metabolism can lead to the generation of endogenous self-glycoprotein antigens in the lung as well as other tissues. Increased free radical generation can also lead to immune activation. The role of a dysfunctional isoprenoid pathway and endogenous digoxin in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis in relation to right hemispheric chemical dominance is discussed. All the patients with sarcoidosis were right-handed/left hemispheric dominant according to the dichotic listening test, but their biochemical patterns were suggestive of right hemispheric chemical dominance. Hemispheric chemical dominance has no correlation with handedness or the dichotic listening test.",

    "abstract": "Double depression, the combination of major depression and dysthymia, is associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and increased health service utilization.To determine the prevalence of double depression, its associated morbidity and use of health services and antidepressants.A random and representative sample of the South Australian general population was interviewed. The mood module of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), the Short-Form Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36) and Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) instruments were administered, and data relating to health service utilization, antidepressant use and role functioning were collected.Double depression was present in 3.3% of the population. The use of health services was significantly higher in this group than those with no depression, or dysthymia or major depression alone. Only 15.2% had attended a community health service, 18.2% had seen a psychiatrist, 10.1% a psychologist, 16.2% a social worker and 9.1% any other counsellor in the last month. While 41.4% were currently taking an antidepressant, the average doses of the two most commonly prescribed antidepressants were below the maximum recommended doses, and the use of antidepressant augmentation strategies was also minimal.While double depression is associated with increased morbidity and use of health services, the optimum use of both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments is clearly lacking in this community sample.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to search for morphological and hemodynamic changes in hepatic and splanchnic vasculature in alcoholic patients without the signs of hepatic damage and subtyped by Cloninger classification by means of sonography, and compare the subtypes among themselves and with nonalcoholic healthy subjects.Thirty alcohol dependent patients and 30 healthy subjects with no alcohol problem or hepatic impairment were included in the study. Patients were subtyped by Cloninger classification and all patients were evaluated by gray-scale and spectral Doppler ultrasound. The diameter of the portal vein, portal venous velocity, peak systolic and end diastolic velocities of hepatic and superior mesenteric arteries were assessed. RI, PI and systolic/diastolic velocity ratios were also calculated.Portal vein diameter (PV diameter), portal vein cross sectional area (PV area), portal vein velocity (PV PSV), hepatic artery peak systolic velocity (HA PSV), hepatic artery end diastolic velocity (HA EDV), hepatic artery resistive index (HA RI), hepatic artery pulsatility index (HA PI), and systolic/diastolic velocity ratios (HA S/D), superior mesenteric artery peak systolic velocity (SMA PSV), superior mesenteric artery end diastolic velocity (SMA EDV), superior mesenteric artery resistive indices (SMA RI), pulsatility index (SMA PI), and systolic/diastolic velocity rates (SMA S/D) showed no significant difference among the groups (P > 0.01). Although there is no significant difference in PV PSV, HA PSV, SMA PSV, SMA EDV values between the groups, mean values of Type II alcoholics is greater than other groups. Portal vein cross-sectional area was greater in alcoholic patients (Type I, II and III) compared to the control group (P = 0.000). Portal vein velocity, hepatic artery peak systolic and end diastolic velocity, superior mesenteric artery peak systolic and end diastolic velocity were significantly greater in alcoholic patients than in the control group (P < 0.001). No statistical difference was detected between other parameters evaluated.In alcohol dependent patients, some hemodynamic and morphologic changes occur in hepatic and splanchnic circulation, even before the signs of hepatic damage develop, which can be detected by means of Doppler and gray-scale sonography. But as there is no significant difference between the Doppler ultrasonographic findings among alcoholics subtyped by a Cloninger classification, which is a clinical classification, it suggests that psychiatric classification doesn't show any correlation with biological parameters, and because of this Cloninger classification a psychiatric classification cannot be considered as a characteristic determinative factor in the prognosis of hepatic disorder due to alcohol use. However, higher values of Type II alcoholics can be attributed to the longer alcohol intake of this subtype.",

Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was based on General Health Questionnaire-12.Psychiatric morbidity was noted in almost 1/4 of women and 1/5 of men in Poland, with small differences between urban and rural population. Every 10th woman reported such complaints at the age up to 25 years and every second above 75 years of age. Divorced and widowed respondents, irrespective of gender, have psychiatric disorders more frequently than compared groups. Higher prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was noted in out of work and especially disabled persons. The higher the level of education, the lower the frequency of psychiatric morbidity was observed.Presented survey enabled to evaluate prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in Polish representative sample. Findings should trigger more extended epidemiological studies. The requirement for epidemiological investigations increases in reform-awaiting health care system in Poland, for at least one reason that the improvement of the quality of services is closely associated with a detailed recognition of the problem.",

Differences in the dimensions of cava longer than 6 mm associated with a neuropsychiatric impairment could be of possible clinical and forensic significance. Methods: We obtained 479 brains from autopsied persons (310 males and 169 females, aged 22–89 years) and observed that 110 brains (75 males and 35 females) had CSP, of which the length of CSP was equal to or longer than 6 mm on 69 (49 males and 20 females) of them. These cava were classified into four groups depending on the past medical histories of the autopsied person: five without neuropsychiatric history (asymptomatic CSP), 25 schizophrenic patients, 22 alcoholics, and 17 with a past head trauma (symptomatic CSP). Results: The linear parameters of CSP (i.e. length, width) of the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups were measured and were statistically analyzed. Analysis revealed that the cava in the group of schizophrenic patients were significantly longer and wider. Conclusions: Discriminant function analysis was used to derive a mathematical formula to classify CSP into one of the groups obtained based on width measurements of the cavum.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Increasing rates of caesarean sections has led to concerns about long-term effects on the offspring's health, and it has been hypothesised that caesarean section induced differences in the child's microbiota could potentially increase the risk of mental disorders. METHODS: Nationwide Danish cohort study of 2,196,687 births was conducted between 1980 and 2015, with 38.5 million observation-years. Exposure was 'Caesarean Section' and outcome was the child's risk of any mental disorder. Absolute and relative risks (RRs) were estimated using inverse probability weighting to adjust for age, calendar time and confounding variables while accounting for the competing risk of death. RESULTS: Caesarean section (n = 364,908, 16.6%), compared to vaginal birth, was associated with a small RR increase of 8% (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.13; n = 44,352) for the development of any in-patient psychiatric admission at age 36 for the offspring and with a small absolute risk difference of 0.47% (95% CI, 0.23-0.76). When looking at all in-patient, out-patient and emergency room psychiatric contacts among people born after 1995, the effect was diminished (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99-1.09; n = 15,211). The risk was comparable when comparing prelabour versus intrapartum caesarean section (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90-1.08) and acute versus planned caesarean section (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80-1.29). CONCLUSION: Birth by caesarean section was associated with only a very slightly increased risk of any in-patient psychiatric admission for the offspring and diminished even further when including all psychiatric contacts. The very small associations observed may be explained by unmeasured confounding and is unlikely to be of substantial clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Divergent thinking is a critical creative cognitive process. Its neural mechanisms have been well-studied through structural and functional imaging in healthy individuals but are less explored in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Because of the traditional link between creativity and BD, this study investigated the structural correlates of divergent thinking in patients with BD through surface-based morphometry. Methods: Fifty-nine patients diagnosed with BD I or BD II (35.3 ± 8.5 years) and 56 age- and sex-matched controls (33.9 ± 7.4 years) were recruited. The participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and an evaluation of divergent thinking by using the Chinese version of the Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA). FreeSurfer 7.0 was used to generate thickness and surface area maps for each participant. Brainwise regression of the association between cortical thickness or surface area and ATTA performance was conducted using general linear models. Results: Divergent thinking performance did not differ significantly between the patients with BD and the healthy controls. In these patients, total ATTA score was negatively correlated with cortical thickness in the right middle frontal gyrus, right occipital, and left precuneus but positively correlated with the surface area of the right superior frontal gyrus. By contrast, total ATTA scores and cortical thickness or surface area were not significantly correlated among the controls. Conclusion: The findings indicate that divergent thinking involves cerebral structures for executive control, mental imagery, and visual processing in patients with BD, and the right prefrontal cortex might be the most crucial of these structures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Combining different pharmaceuticals may be beneficial when treating disorders with complex neurobiology, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). The gut-brain peptides amylin and GLP-1 may be of potential interest as they individually reduce alcohol intake in rodents. While the combination of amylin receptor (AMYR) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have been found to decrease feeding and body weight in obese male rats synergistically, their combined impact on alcohol intake is unknown. Methods: Therefore, the effect of the combination of an AMYR (salmon calcitonin (sCT)) and a GLP-1R (dulaglutide) agonist on alcohol intake in rats of both sexes was explored in two separate alcohol-drinking experiments. The first alcohol-drinking experiment evaluated the potential of adding sCT to an ongoing dulaglutide treatment, whereas the second alcohol-drinking experiment examined the effect when adding sCT and dulaglutide simultaneously. Results: When adding sCT to an ongoing dulaglutide treatment, a reduction in alcohol intake was observed in both male and female rats. However, when combining sCT and dulaglutide simultaneously, an initial reduction in alcohol intake was observed in rats of both sexes, whereas tolerance towards treatment was observed. In both alcohol-drinking experiments, this treatment combination consistently decreased food consumption and body weight in males and females. While the treatment combination did not affect inflammatory mediators, the gene expression of AMYR or GLP-1R, it changed fat tissue morphology. Conclusions: Further investigation needs to be done on the combination of AMYR and GLP-1R agonists to assess their combined effects on alcohol intake.",

This may result in a gap between recently acquired scientific knowledge and its implementation in clinical practice. Since the start of the residency training in psychiatry in 1989 in the Vincent van Gogh Institute for Psychiatry, several research lines have been developed especially concerning dimensional diagnostic procedures, evaluation of treatment effects, stress and psychopathology, pharmacokinetics of psychotropic compounds and disordered impulse and aggression regulation. It is concluded that active participation in research projects by both psychiatrists and residents in psychiatry is increasingly mandatory due to social-economic en scientific developments. Despite several countervailing factors, the Vincent van Gogh Institute for Psychiatry has succeeded in the creation of a scientific orientation in the residency program resulting in a number of publications.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests involvement of prenatal factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The objective of the present study was to provide evidence for the hypothesis on schizophrenia that abnormal fetal brain development leads to impaired sensorimotor gating of acoustic startle stimuli. To this purpose, pregnant rats were treated with methylazoxymethanol acetate on one of four subsequent days of gestation, from E9 to E12. These procedures inhibit early stages of cortical proliferation in the foetuses, resulting in adult brain abnormalities that were mainly found in the entorhinal region. At the adult age, habituation andprepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle responses to acoustic stimuli were investigated. Our results show impaired habituation and PPI in rats treated at embryonic days 10 and 11. It is concluded that sensorimotor gating deficits can result from a developmental abnormality involving the entorhinal region, supporting the hypothesis that similar deficits, often observed in schizophrenic subjects, may be the result of entorhinal cortex dysfunction.",

To an important degree, genetic effects on behavior come about because they either influence the extent to which the individual is likely to be exposed to individual differences in environmental risk or they affect how susceptible the individual is to environmental adversities. The current inability to explain or predict which genetically predisposed individuals will finally become schizophrenic has forced us to confront our ignorance of the precise mechanism and mode of the transmission of this disorder. Zubin's proposal to view the schizophrenic as a vulnerable individual who develops a temporary episode only under certain provocations can help place the controversy in proper perspective. Vulnerability (predisposition, diathesis) to schizophrenia can be defined as the individual's characteristic treshold beyond which stressful events produce decompensation manifest in the clinically diagnosable symptom picture.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental issue in the neurobiology of adaptation disorders is how the hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis protect the brain from such disorders, and how in a different context these very same stress hormones may enhance vulnerability. This contribution focuses on the corticosteroids which exert through two distinct nuclear receptor types control over gene networks underlying stress system activity in brain. The mineralocorticoid receptor mediates the pro-active mode of corticosteroid action involved in maintenance of basal stress system activity. The glucocorticoid receptor mediates the reactive feedback mode aimed to facilitate recovery from stress-induced disturbance. The balance between these pro-active and reactive modes of control is thought to be of critical importance for homeostasis, and thus for control of hormone-responsive genes which enhance vulnerability to stress-related affective and neurodegenerative disorders.",

Daarover gaat dit artikel. De opzet van het artikel is als volgt. Eerst wordt de koppeling tussen hersenveranderingen en regressieperioden besproken. Dan wordt onze visie op de relatie tussen regressieperioden en ontwikkelingstransities of wel nieuwe vaardigheden toegelicht.

A number of lines of evidence supported this serotonergic hypothesis, not least the treatment studies which demonstrated clearly and consistently that anti-obsessional efficacy was a function of serotonin re-uptake inhibition. Studies of markers and biological probes provided further evidence: platelet studies, for example, linked reductions in 5-HT activity with clinical response, and treatment response was correlated with decreased 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels within the cerebrospinal fluid of OCD patients. Added to this was the evidence from the behavioral or physiological responses observed following serotonergic challenge with the serotonin agonists meta-chlorophenylpiperazine, a compound with high affinity for 5-HT1A-, 5-HT1D- and 5-HT2C-receptors.",

Consequently, the number of AD patients is increasing and thus far no effective therapies are available. Clinically the disease can be diagnosed with 90% reliability on the basis of neurological examination, neuropsychological testing and brain imaging techniques. A definite diagnosis, however, requires the post-mortem detection of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. The SPs are extracellular deposits mainly composed of amyloid P (Ap) surrounded by dystrophic neurites. NFT are intraneural inclusions of paired helical filaments composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Although age is the major risk factor for AD, population survey and family studies have provided substantial evidence that genetic factors are major contributors to the expression of AD.",

    "abstract": "Clozapine (Leponex®) has been shown to be therapeutically effective in patients resistant to long-term medication with classical antipsychotics. The mode of action of clozapine is not clear, but several cerebral receptors have been implicated, including the dopamine D2, D3 and D4 types, α-adrenergic, serotonin (type 2A) and glutamate (NMDA-type) receptors. Moreover, clozapine has anti-cholinergic and antihistaminergic potencies. Thusfar, receptor profiles are based virtually exclusively on in vitro binding assays. It appeared, that pharmacological and physiological stimuli activate particular gene expression, in vivo, so at cellular level the action of e.g. antipsychotics can now be traced. In this communication we present data on the in vivo profile of clozapine as revealed with Fos-protein expression. The immediate early gene c-fos is, as other members of the class of such genes, rapidly and transiently induced in the brain. The prototypic members of this class all encode nuclear proteins that regulate gene transcription. Recent studies have shown that the antipsychotics haloperidol (Haldol®) and clozapine, when given acutely, induce different patterns of Fos-like immunoreactivity in the forebrain of the rat. The most marked effects of haloperidol were found in the striatum, the nucleus accumbens and the lateral septum.",

Biological psychiatry and psychopharmacology originate from the discovery by chance of psycho-active compounds in the early fifties and have contributed to the scientification of psychiatry. The impact of biological psychiatry for the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, however, is limited as a result of its biased orientation on neurotransmitters and receptors. The neuropsychiatric paradigm integrates knowledge from several domains, such as functional neuroanatomy, genetics and endocrinology and opens new vistas for the involvement of neuronal circuits in the initiation and maintenance of behavioural disturbances. In addition, novel and more specific treatment modalities may emerge.",

Assumptions are made that nightmares occur more often in psychiatric patients than in the normal population and that they are accompanied by an elevated anxiety level in the daytime. From a psychophysiological point of view nightmares possibly are derailed attemps of problem solving, of overcoming frightening experiences. In this review the importance of nightmares as symptom in psychiatry is assessed. It appears that they are no indication of an elevated anxiety level in the day-time or of psychopathology in general, and they are no criterium for the diagnosis of schizophrenia either.",

Both this and with it the tendency to abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (tendency to low blood glucose nadir) predict the new violent and impulsive crimes under the influence of alcohol. Also peripheral measures such as platelet MAO, abnormal tryptophan/LNAA ratio in plasma, whole blood serotonin, blood platelet uptake of serotonin, platelet 3H-IMI dinging (Bmax), abnormal prolactin and Cortisol secretion in fenfluramine challenge, and possibly daily urinary free Cortisol secretion correlate with impulsive aggressive behavior.",

The neurotoxicity consisted succes-sivily of confusion, somnolence, agitation, extrapyramidal symptoms, cerebellair ataxia and EEG abnormalities. After 10 weeks memory impairmments were still present. At four months, memory function was restored. After five months, the patient was discharged without residual symptoms. The patient reported amnesia for the first six weeks of the syndrome.

    "abstract": "Objective This study investigated the ability of the Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS) to detect cognitive deficit in individuals with schizophrenia, relative to the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and explored the associations between the ARCS and functional outcomes. We hypothesised that the ARCS would be able to better discriminate between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls than the MMSE, and that ARCS performance would be correlated with measures of social and vocational functioning. Methods The participants were 19 community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 19 healthy controls recruited from the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB). Participants completed the ARCS, MMSE, and self-report measures of social and vocational functioning. Clinical and diagnostic data stored by the ASRB were also utilised. Results The schizophrenia group performed worse than the control group on the ARCS, with memory, t (36)=2.49, p =0.02, 95% CI [−1.84, −18.79] and fluency, t (36)=2.40, p =0.02, 95% CI [−1.87, −22.24] domains being the main discriminating measures. The RBANS also discriminated between the two groups, and ARCS and RBANS total scores were moderately to strongly correlated. There was no difference between the two groups on the MMSE after controlling for demographic variables. ARCS performance was associated with employment status [χ 2 (1)=7.16, p =0.007]. Conclusion The ARCS may be sensitive to the cognitive deficits in outpatients with schizophrenia and an indicator of functional outcomes in this population.",

We investigated the influence of drug exposure pattern on morphine-seeking behaviour following withdrawal. We also studied the role of the hippocampus in this process to confirm its involvement in drug relapse.Male Sprague-Dawley rats that were trained to self-administer morphine (1.0 mg/kg) using 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 h daily sessions underwent withdrawal in their home cages and were re-exposed to the operant chamber to evaluate morphine-seeking behaviour. During the relapse session, rats were intravenously injected with morphine (0.25 mg/kg) or saline before re-exposure to the chamber. In the second experiment, rats were administered a microinjection of saline or cobalt chloride (CoCl2, 1 mM), a synaptic blocker, into the CA1 of the hippocampus prior to the relapse test.In the first experiment, more morphine-seeking behaviour was observed in the 2 h group (animals trained to self-administer morphine during a 2 h daily session spread over 21 days) during the relapse session, despite all groups being exposed to similar amounts of morphine during the training period before withdrawal. In the second experiment, pretreatment with CoCl2 markedly reduced morphine-seeking behaviour in the 2 h group.The present findings suggest that the exposure pattern influences the degree of relapse and that control of memorisation is important for prevention of relapse.",

    "abstract": "Objective A prominent theory of depression focusses on neural plasticity and stress as central issues in seeking to develop a pattern of identifiable biological markers for the depressive disorders. Relative neglect, however, of clinical factors in that theory limits the uncovering of markers and opens to question their methodological approach. A conflicting theory, the ‘opposed neurobehavioral states’, based on dimensional analysis of monoamine neurotransmitter systems and behavioural factors is presented. This perspectives paper contrasts the two approaches viewing the biomarkers theory as premature at this point in the progress of depression research. Method Studies developed to support the biomarkers theory and the opposed neurobehavioral states theory are examined for their strengths and limitations in explaining the nature of the disorder and the actions of therapeutic drugs. Reference is made to reviews of the many studies on biomarkers and the recent work that supports the opposed neurobehavioral states theory. Discussion Main issue: the biomarkers theory sets important goals, but despite the many advances in the neural investigations of factors underlying depression, is still not successful in specifying markers. Thus, it is believed to be applying the wrong methodologic approach and premature in its claims. Perspective: the ‘opposed neurobehavioral’ theory is limited in its breadth of research. It applies, however, the dimensional approach to the clinical side of the problem, a methodological approach more likely to be effective in selecting the best clinical treatment and open to a more productive path to understanding of the nature of the disorder in future research.",

The mood state of 80 psychologically healthy subjects was assessed before and from 1/2 hour till 4 hours after surgery under anesthesia with either propofol or methohexitone. The mood was assessed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS). The propofol group was more elated from one hour until 4 hours after anesthesia (p&lt;0,01 )(factor 1). 1 hour after anesthesia the propofol group was continuously more composed than the methohexitone group (p&lt;0,01) (factor 4) and after two hours the propofol group was more agreeable (p&lt;0,05) (factor 2). Moreover, patients, who received propofol, were less tired (factor 3) and confused (factor 5).

    "abstract": "The TRH-test in depression: a review This paper reviews the literature on the thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)-test in depressive patients. The TRH-test appears to exhibit some use as an external validating criterion for the clinical diagnosis of major depression and, in particular melancholia versus minor depression once the clinical diagnosis depression is made. However, the clinical use of this test is hampered by the low sensitivity (±50%) and by the fact that abnormal tests occur in non-depressive states such as borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. The TRH-test may be used as a predictor for a positive response to biological therapies. In addition, the test has some value for the outcome of a depressive episode. The pathophysiology underpinning an abnormal TRH-test may be determined by noradrenergic (central and peripheric) or serotonergic (central) dysfunctions, thyroid hormone and cortisol hypersecretion, phenomena that are pertinent to severe depression. Recently, it has been established that an abnormal depression-linked TRH-test reflects lower basal thyroid secreting hormone (TSH) secretion. The determination of basal TSH may, in the future, replace TRH-testing.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY Alprazolam (a benzodiazepine in the group of the triazolo-benzodiazepines) is a potent drug for the treatment of panic disorder. This is possible due to four different interactions with neurotransmitter systems. First, it facilitates, as all diazepines, the inhibitory acitivity of gamma-amino-butyricacid (GABA). The chemical structure differs from the benzodiazepines by incorporation of the triazoloring. Due to this triazoloring, the drug has three additional modes of action. These modes of action inhibit the locus coeruleus which plays a role in the origin of panic disorder. A first specific action is a stimulation of the serotonergic system. Triazolobenzodiazepines are also α 2 -adrenoreceptor agonists. Both mechanisms are responsible for inhibition of the locus coeruleus. Triazolo-benzodiazepines inhibit the platelet-activating-factor (PAF). PAF stimulates the corticotropin-releasing-hormone (CRH). This hormone stimulates the locus coeruleus. CRH in patients with panic attacks is elevated. This could be a result of hyperactive metabolism of the right parahippocampal area, which is observed in patients with panic attacks. Triazolo-benzodiazepines decrease the activity of the locus coeruleus because of a low CRH-level due to inhibited PAF.",

It has been shown that for people with frontal lobe lesions, perseveration can be explained with a set-maintenance problem. Perseveration in Parkinson's disease can be explained with problems shifting from one set to another without cues (set-shifting). These disorders can be distinguished using a two-choice task and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, that is analysed in phases. Analogs of these tests can be used in animal research. By adding an animal part to the human research, more insight can be gained into the role of specific brain areas in set-maintenance and set-shifting.",

Objective: Psychiatric symptoms may occur in individuals at risk of Huntington's disease (HD) regardless of their genetic status. Psychopathological symptomatology is attributed to both genetic and environmental factors. In case of asymptomatic gene carriers, psychiatric symptoms may precede involuntary movements. Methods: We report the first case with abnormal gait and bradykinesia in preclinical adult HD. A 33-year-old woman blind to her mother's HD diagnosis and her own genetic status developed motor slowing and gait disturbance. The symptoms withdrew due to counselling and antidepressant medications. Subsequently, she was informed her own and her mother's genetic testing results, but 2-year follow-up did not reveal the onset of choreic movements, cognitive deterioration or depressive symptoms in the patient. Personality assessment (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) and neurological examination results are presented, accompanied by 2-year follow-up data. Follow-up examination included Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (motor, behaviour and function), Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and neuropsychological assessment (trail-making test, Stroop test, verbal fluency trials, symbol digit modalities test, digit span, serial seven subtraction, Hopkins verbal learning test and nine-hole peg test). Conclusion: Motor abnormalities in individuals at risk of HD may be of psychogenic origin. It is a matter of debate if this psychogenic reaction presented as hypokinetic syndrome may be a result of choreic movements of her mother (hyperkinetic syndrome) and depression or if this psychogenic reaction represents the preclinical psychiatric abnormalities in an asymptomatic gene carrier preceding the onset of the disease.",

    "abstract": "People attempt to change their lifestyle when obesity impairs their quality of life. The attempts often fail when multiple habits must be changed in unison. Here we explore relations among food addiction, the neurobiology of habits, and caloric restriction, when people seek to return to normal eating behaviour, with particular emphasis on the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Severely obese individuals have specific neurobiological characteristics in common with drug abusers, including low availability of dopamine receptors in the striatum, impaired neuronal responses to dopamine, and reduced activity in prefrontal regions of the cerebral cortex. The neurobiological characteristics suggest that obese people also have a pathological dependence in common with addicts, in the form of food addiction. Malnutrition and dieting both relate to binge eating, possibly as a compensation for a reduced cognitive reward condition. The combination of caloric restriction and food addiction imparts a high risk of relapse as a result of further reduction of dopaminergic neurotransmission and the subsequent loss of reward. As with drugs of abuse, ingestion of large quantities of sugar in circumstances of uncontrolled eating increases dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. This and other evidence suggests that abuse of food is a habit learned by means of mechanisms centred in the basal ganglia, with an increased risk of relapse in the presence of associative amplifiers. This risk is predicted by the relationship between dopamine receptor availability in the striatum and sensation-seeking in the form of an inverted U, suggested by recent findings, consistent with two opposite states of hypodopaminergic and hyperdopaminergic neuromodulation.",

Increase Na + ,K + -ATPase activity in the rat brain after meningitis induction by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Background : Pneumococcal meningitis is the most severe infection of the central nervous system with a mortality rate up to 20% and an adverse neurological result in up to 50% of survivors. A complicated series of interactions among the host immune response and oxidants seems to be responsible for meningitis associated brain dysfunctions. Na + ,K + -ATPase is an essential enzyme responsible for generating and maintaining the membrane potential necessary for neural excitability, however, the Na + ,K + -ATPase activity is altered in several illness; Objective : The aim of this study is to evaluate the Na + ,K + -ATPase activity in hippocampus and cortex of the rats submitted to pneumococcal meningitis. Methods : Animals received 10 µl sterile saline as a placebo or an equivalent volume of Streptococcus pneumoniae to the concentration of 5 × 10 9 cfu/ml and were killed at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after meningitis induction. The brain structures, hippocampus and cortex, were immediately isolated on dry ice and stored at −80°C to analyse Na + ,K + -ATPase activity. Results : In the hippocampus, we verified the increase of Na + ,K + -ATPase activity at 48, 72 and 96 h ( p &lt; 0.05) and in the cortex at 24 h ( p &lt; 0.05) after pneumococcal meningitis induction. Conclusion : The Na + ,K + -ATPase activity is under the control of a diversity of intracellular messengers that are able to modulate the function of the particular isozymes in a precise way. Furthermore, we verified that pneumococcal meningitis increased the Na + ,K + -ATPase activity in hippocampus and cortex; this increase can be correlated with a compensatory mechanism in illness pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Fas (CD95), commonly categorised as a death receptor due to its well-defined role in apoptosis, can paradoxically also promote neuroprotection. We have previously found that defects in Fas signalling render mice highly susceptible to neural degeneration in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Decreased activity of the ubiquitin proteasome system and accumulation of protein aggregates are implicated in PD pathogenesis. Here, we investigate the relationship between Fas and ubiquitin proteasomal activity in neuronal cells. We performed proteasome assays in neuroblastoma cells and in midbrain cultures of wild-type and Fas-deficient mice. Neuroblastoma cells upregulated proteasomal activity in response to an activating Fas antibody in vitro. Furthermore, neural tissue from Fas-deficient mice showed decreased proteasomal activity compared with the tissue from wild-type mice when exposed to a PD-inducing toxin in vivo. These findings suggest that mechanisms for Fas-mediated neuroprotection may include Fas-induced upregulation of proteasomal activity, and consequently less accumulation of toxic protein aggregates.",

Pharmacologic agents including psychotropic drug therapy may also play a role. Method: We present the case of a 53-year-old woman with bipolar affective disorder in whom antipsychotic agents were suspected of inducing sinus node dysfunction. Result: The combination of psychotropic agents including lithium, quetiapine and carbamazepine (first occasion) or escitalopram (second occasion) has been implicated as a cause for sinus node dysfunction. Conclusion: Patients with severe mental illness usually require long-term psychotropic drug therapy, often in combination. This may enhance efficacy but also involves an increased risk of adverse effects including cardiotoxicity.",

Increased neuronal cell number in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in schizophrenia.Recently, a reduction in efferent vagal regulation has been found in schizophrenic patients.Therefore, the brainstems of nine schizophrenic patients and nine normal controls were stereologically analysed. The number of neurons using the optical fractionator method and nuclear volumes applying the Cavalieri principle was estimated in Nissl stained sections of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV) and the hypoglossal nucleus.The neurons in the right DMNV were significantly increased in the schizophrenic group compared to normal controls (p = 0.047), while the volumes of the DMNV did not differ. In contrast, no such differences were found in the hypoglossal nucleus.Although this pilot study is limited by its small sample size, the analysis of the solitarius-ambiguus-vagus system in schizophrenic patients is an interesting target in schizophrenia research. The most reasonable background for increased neuron numbers in the DMNV could be a system-specific neurodevelopmental disturbance in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Glycine regulates glutamatergic neurotransmission, and several papers have reported the relationship between glycine and schizophrenia. The dysbindin-1 (DTNBP1: dystrobrevin-binding protein 1) gene is related to glutamatergic neurotransmission and has been found to be a strong candidate gene for schizophrenia. In this study, we clarified the relationship between dysbindin, glutamate, and glycine with in vivo microdialysis methods.We measured extracellular glycine and glutamate levels in the striatum of sandy (sdy) mice using in vivo microdialysis methods. Sdy mice express no dysbindin protein owing to a deletion in the dysbindin-1 gene. In addition, we measured changes in those amino acids after methamphetamine (METH) administration.The basal levels of extracellular glycine and glutamate in the striatum of sdy mice were elevated. These extracellular glutamate levels decreased gradually after METH administration and were not subsequently different from those of wild-type mice.These results suggest that dysbindin might modulate glycine and glutamate release in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: Electroencephalography has probably represented the first modern and scientifically sound attempt to functionally explore the in vivo activity of the human brain and it has, since ever, attracted attention of psychiatrists, from both the clinical and the research viewpoint. Probably due to the limitations implied by their traditional low spatial resolution, the use of psychophysiological techniques in psychiatry has been not continuous over the last century; however, the availability of newer EEG-based brain imaging techniques has recently renovated some interest (1)). Furthermore, recent theories proposed that psychopathology may result from the failure to integrate the activity of different areas involved in cognitive processes, rather than from the impairment of one or more brain areas (2)); within this view, a reliable brain imaging tool should be able to explore the dynamics of complex interactions among brain regions, with high sensitivity to the subtle deviation in complex processes that last fractions of seconds; psychophysiological techniques, indeed, offer the possibility to explore the functional correlates of major psychiatric illnesses, as well as to understand of the effects of psychotropic drugs on the central nervous system, with incomparable time resolution. Finally, the recent technical possibility to combine different brain imaging approaches has further fostered a renovated enthusiasm to ward the use of EEG-based techniques in psychiatry. This contribution will provide an historical overview of the EEG-based brain imaging techniques and an update on some recent advances concerning the use of such techniques within the psychiatric field. Finally, some examples of psychophysiological and ''multimodal'' imaging investigations in subjects with different psychiatric conditions will be provided.",

Especially his theory of resentment with its core thesis unconscious prejudices were influencing our behaviour was able to illuminate the complex structure of human will. Taking into account this horizon of psychiatric history of ideas the presentation wants to persecute the following three questions: 1) Why the postulate which Nietzsche was giving on cultural prejudices of our thoughts, feelings and acts was so provocative so that many of the classical thinkers of psychological understanding were taking it up according to the needs of their disciplines sociology, psychology, psychiatry and philosophy? 2) What were the results of this inspiring theory which could be especially seen in the works of Karl Jaspers and Kurt Schneider? In other words: What were the aspects in which they agreed in their reception of Nietzsche and what were the points in which the two psychiatrists of the school of Heidelberg differed in the way they took the theory of resentment into account for their psychological understanding? 3) What could be the actual significance of the historical fact that Nietzsche and in his footsteps Max Weber were taking deep influence on psychiatric thinking around 1900?",

    "abstract": "It is now generally agreed that healthy individuals are characterized by cognitive decline during the later decades of adult life. The acquisition of new information becomes less efficient, which, coupled with a diminished retention of this information for later use, results in substantially poorer memory performance. The ability to plan new activities, solve problems and make complex decisions, as well as cognitive flexibility is noticeably diminished. In addition, attentional processes appear to be invariably poorer in old subjects than in young subjects (for review). While it is quite clearly established that elderly subjects (i.e. after 65 years of age) show a deterioration of cognitive functioning, there is also evidence that this deterioration may start in middle age (40 years). There is large individual variance in age groups; for instance, some old individuals perform on many neurocognitive tests as well as young individuals do. Rowe and Kahn proposed in their influential article to discern between successful aging and usual aging. Successful aging would be due to the effect of chronological age, whereas additional factors would be responsible for usual aging. An important point is the nature of the borderland between usual cognitive aging and pathological conditions such as dementia. Various health-related factors are thought to be important in this respect. They may be a determinant for the transition between successful aging to normal aging and into the borderland with dementia. The Brain & Behavior Research Institute in Maastricht investigates the determinants of successful and pathological aging in a number of related and multidisciplinary projects. This paper describes some major findings of this research programme and gives a theory on the interaction of vulnerability factors and protective factors in their effect on cognitive aging.",

Olanzapine is a relatively new atypical antipsychotic drug with a dopamine antagonistic as well as a potent serotonine antagonistic effect.

This syndrome is characterized by pain of the neck, headache, forgetfulness, poor concentration, mental fatigue, and affective symptoms. The causes of the persistent symptoms are unknown. In all, the evidence that late-whiplash syndrome is a neurological disorder is flimsy. Current opinion holds that the acute basis is the painful injury of the neck. In the months following the accident, pain is the substrate on which psychological and social factors may act. Emotional symptoms such as lability of affect and disturbed mood, or posttraumatic stress disorders are common after whiplash. Although there is definitely a place for psychiatrists and psychologists in the treatment of late whiplash syndrome, these professionals are not involved in late whiplash disorder as much as they should be. Brief psychological treatment has proven to significantly reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. Optimal management must cover the treatment of pain, depression, anxiety, and fatigue; adequate psycho-education, stressing the good long-term outcome; and education of patients and relatives on possible cognitive symptoms.",

In that year, as a medical student, I was accepted as a research assistent by Prof. G.G.J. Rademaker, a neurophysiologist and at the time head of the Department of Neurology at the Academic Hospital in Leiden. The neurological research period was followed by a mycological one. Having received my MD degree and doing my military service, I was asked to carry out a study into the prevalence, prevention and treatment of mycological infections in military personel. For this reason I worked for more than 1, 5 years in Baarn at the section Medical Mycology of the Phytopathological Laboratory, an interacademic institution of the Universities of Amsterdam and Utrecht (1956-1958). Immediately after the military service I became a resident in psychiatry and started - together with the biochemist Prof. B. Leijnse - a research program into the biological determinants of depression. The period of psychiatric investigation lasted until this very day, albeit in different locations, i.e. Rotterdam, Groningen, Utrecht, New York and Maastricht respectively.",

    "abstract": "Summary The alterations in the inflammatory response system (IRS) appear to be quite different between OCD and anorexia nervosa and are also different from the changes observed in major depression. In anorexia nervosa, there is some evidence for increased production of monocytic cytokines, i.e. tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and decreased production of Th-1 like cytokines, i.e. IL-2 and IFNγ. In the same patients there are also signs of immunosuppression, e.g. lowered numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells and increased production of transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ). The increased production of monocytic cytokines may be the consequence of the hyponutritional status of those patients. The diminished production of the Th-1 like cytokines may be the consequence of at least four different factors: 1) the deficiency in nutritional factors; 2) neuroendocrine disorders, such as increased Cortisol production; 3) the increased TGFβ production; and 4) lower serum dipeptidyl peptidase activity. In OCD no consistent or specific alterations in the IRS are observed. There is no evidence that IRS activation may play a role in the pathophysiology of OCD and anorexia nervosa.",

Despite this, there are many reasons why MPU's should be a necessary part of any larger scale inpatient service of a general and teaching hospital. It is therefore even more remarkable that such units hardly exist in Europe and that only about twenty exist in the USA. Five main reasons why such units should be opened are: The increasing average age of the population of the Western World, with high co-morbidity and polypharmacy in the elderly and elderly elderly. An increase in the number of chronic physical diseases resulting in co-morbid psychiatric disorders. This increase in chronicity is the consequence of increasingly successful treatment of acute and potentially lethal diseases; for example, acute myocardial infarction and the subsequent development of chronic heart disease. The decreasing duration of hospital admission. On average the duration of stay in a general hospital in The Netherlands is now nine days. The number of day-treatments has doubled in the last decade. This situation means that it is not possible to observe the behavior of patients on a general medical ward or to carry out a psychiatric consultation. Inadequate medical evaluation of psychiatric patients. According to a recent survey by the Dutch Ministry of Health, the care given for physical disease to psychiatric patients in mental hospitals in The Netherlands needs much to be desired for. The psychiatric co-morbidity of somatic diseases is accompanied by a high consumption of medical facilities and high economic losses, unless adequately recognized and treated.",

    "abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs are effective in psychoses, whatever the etiology of the disorder. The positive symptoms tend to respond more readily. The need for developing new drugs arises from the refractoriness of the negative symptoms, the 10-25% of the patients that are treatment-resistant and the problems of short-, and long-term extrapyramidal side-effects. Thus far, six drugs, differing from the classical antipsychotics, have been licensedfor use: olanzepine, risperidone and quetiapine; the longest registration exists for sulpiride and clozapine while the most recent one is for amisulpride. This review starts with a brief introduction to symptomatology, and takes differences with the classical drugs in pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical aspects and side-effects into consideration. Clozapine, risperidone and sulpiride may be considered for clinical use in refractory patients; these three, olanzapine and amisulpride when extrapyramidal side-effects cause a clinical problem. Amisulpride and sulpiride have a dual therapeutic acion: On negative symptoms at low dose, on positive symptomen at high doses.",

Since syndrome specific psychiatric disorders can be established too, the term psychopathological phenotype seems to be appropriate.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research into the etiology of schizophrenia on a phenotypic level, i.e. studies of neuroanatomy, neuropathology, neurophysiology and other areas such as immunology have yielded only fragmentary results. A contribution of genetic factors, has been consistently shown, however, beginning with E. Kraepelin's pioneering studies at the turn of the century. Evidence has accumulated from family-, twin-, and adoption studies. Identical twins have a 48% risk of developing schizophrenia if one of them is affected. In contrast, a 17 % risk is reported for nonidentical twins. These rates are similar to other complex genetic disorders such as diabetes, hypertension and asthma. Advances in the genetic analysis of complex traits as well as progress in the Human Genome Project should provide a basis for uncovering the molecular causes of schizophrenic disorders and for investigating the neuropathology of this individually and socially devastating neuropsychiatrie disorder. There is no doubt, that discovery of the genetic variation associated with the illness would help in identifying specific targets for development of more effective, targeted treatments.",

    "abstract": "The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia, postulating that schizophrenia is characterized by increased dopamine function, has been the most influential theory on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. It has recently been revised based on the appreciation that the core symptoms of schizophrenia may not be the positive (psychotic) symptoms, but rather the negative symptoms and the cognitive deficits found in schizophrenic patients. This revision has prompted the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by both decreased prefrontal dopamine activity (causing deficit symptoms) and increased dopamine activity in mesolimbic dopamine neurons (causing positive symptoms). Notwithstanding this revision of a role for dopamine in schizophrenia, it has become increasingly evident that dysfunction of other monoaminergic systems may be as important in contributing to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Specifically, the putative role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in schizophrenia is gaining considerable attention. Several observations, such as the ability of the 5-HT antagonist, ritanserin, to alleviate schizophrenic symptoms and, when added to haloperidol (Haldol®), to decrease its extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), have stimulated studies into a role of 5-HT in schizophrenia. The finding that clozapine (Leponex®), clinically superior to conventional neuroleptics, is a weak DA 2 antagonist but a potent 5-HT 1c and 5-HT 2 antagonist has further stimulated 5-HT-related research in schizophrenia.",

Investigators in biological psychiatry have hardly ever taken a clear position in this discussion, whereas we believe it is important that the conclusions drawn from biological research are embedded in a theoretical framework related to the mind-brain problem. In this article the thesis is defended that the theory of neural darwinism represents a major step forward and may bridge previous distinctions between biological, clinical and social psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "A great number of epidemiological studies confirms that diabetes is an independent risk factor for stroke. Some studies cause doubt that atherosclerotic changes are heavier in diabetics than in general population. In our study we analysed prevalence and characteristics of cerebrovascular aherosclerotic disease in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. The study included 60 persons of both gender with confirmed diabetes mellitus type 2 . The control group consisted of 60 healthy subjects, similar age as persons with diabetes. The investigation included color dopler flow imaging (CDFI) of extracranial arteries and transcranial dopler (TCD) of intracranial cerebral arteries. The analysis of frequency of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular desease showed statistically significant more prevalence in the group of examinees compared to the control group. In the group of examinees we found statistically significant more patologic findings (p<0.01) on carotid arteries and arteries of the circle of Willis. Atherosclerotic changes were statistically significant more severe (p<0.05) in the group of examinees compared to control group. Among examinees we found stronger degree of carotid stenoses and other signs of cerebral macroangiopathy, as well as signs of cerebral microangiopathy. According to our results we concluded that diabetes mellitus laeds to earlier and faster development of the atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, influnces the cerebral hemodinamic and increases the risk of stroke.",

Methods: After a pilot study, we validated our scale on a sample of American heterosexual men, who answered our questionnaire on the internet through Amazon Mechanical Turk. We tested the reliability using internal consistency. The validity was examined by assessing content, face and construct validity by testing the association between our scale, the Experience in Close Relationships Scale and other instruments. Results: A total of 484 volunteers were included in the study. Cronbach's α for the scale was 0.83. Our scale was negatively correlated with attachment avoidance, r(482) = -0.36, p < 0.001) and Perceived Stress Scale, r(482) = -0.18, p < 0.001, and positively correlated with sexual satisfaction, r(482) = 0.18, p < 0.001. Conclusion: The MPAS is a reliable and valid tool to assess positive post-coital feelings in men.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia may be assessed by measuring within-individual variability (WIV) in performance across a range of cognitive tests. Previous studies have found increased WIV in people with schizophrenia, but no studies have been conducted in low- to middle-income countries where the different sociocultural context may affect WIV. We sought to address this gap by exploring the relationship between WIV and a range of clinical and demographic variables in a large study of people with schizophrenia and matched controls in South Africa. Methods: 544 people with schizophrenia and 861 matched controls completed an adapted version of The University of Pennsylvania Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (PennCNB). Demographic and clinical information was collected using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Diagnoses. Across-task WIV for performance speed and accuracy on the PennCNB was calculated. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the relationship between WIV and a diagnosis of schizophrenia in the whole sample, and WIV and selected demographic and clinical variables in people with schizophrenia. Results: Increased WIV of performance speed across cognitive tests was significantly associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. In people with schizophrenia, increased speed WIV was associated with older age, a lower level of education and a lower score on the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Increased accuracy WIV was significantly associated with a younger age in people with schizophrenia. Conclusions: Measurements of WIV of performance speed can add to the knowledge gained from studies of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia in resource-limited settings.",

GABA A - and BDZ receptors are coupled in a supramolecular GABA A -BDZ-ionophore receptor complex, each consisting of five acidic glycoprotein molecules called subunits. These subunits can be classified into five groups: α, β, γ, σ and ρ. Present evidence indicates the existence of multiple subtypes of these subunits. Multiple GABA A -BDZ receptors exist in the brain that show differential distribution and developmental patterns. These receptors differ from their subunit composition. The final functional properties of the receptor are determined by the different subunits constituting this receptor. Heterogeneity among α- subunits may determine the diversity of BDZ pharmacology in different regions of the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the use of non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) methods for the characterization and monitoring of the pathophysiology of experimental brain injury in laboratory animals as a function of time and treatment. The impact of MR in brain research is primarily due to its non-invasive nature, thereby enabling repeated measurements in long-term studies, and due to the type of information that it provides. MR imaging (MRI) enables the measurement of the morphology/anatomy as well as the functional status of tissues under in vivo conditions. Compared to other in vivo imaging modalities, MRI has a high spatial resolution and allows for a remarkable soft tissue differentiation. MR spectroscopy (MRS) provides information on the biochemical/metabolic status of tissues. MR methods which have proven valuable in animal studies, can be readily translated to the clinical situation where MR-based diagnosis and treatment planning play a rapidly increasing role. After a short introduction into the principles of MR, we will illustrate the remarkable versatility of MR in research on brain injury from recent animal studies. Examples will be mainly drawn from experiments on early injury in focai cerebral ischemia and from research on mechanical brain trauma and excitotoxic lesions. The article ends with a brief description of the perspectives of MR in neuropsychiatry.",

Psychological (and social) psychiatry is deemed to be a necessary supplement to biological psychiatry. This is one of the lessons made avalaible by Freud. In addition, there are other lessons to be taken from his work. From his view on the mind-body relationship a useful strategy for theory construction can be abstracted: specify the relevant (neuro)physiologiocal mechanims, specify the relevant mental mechanisms, look for that output of the neurophysiological mechanisms that can also serve as the input of the mental mechanisms, and conversely. Especially the third directive will be of use for adherents of the biopsychosocial model. We may also learn from Freud's mistakes. He rightly used his interactionistic but non-dualistic arguments for the vindication of a relatively autonomous psychological psychiatry. However, he wrongly delayed biological-psychiatric tasks to an indefinite future.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a neurobiological developmental disorder of basic neuro-integrative functions, resulting in failures of cognitive selfregulation. Neurophysiological and psychophysiological dysfunctions should be considered in connection with the ubiquitous cognitive dysfunctions. Schizophrenic patients have problems with the integration of information, resulting in deficits of perceptual organization, and in 'metacognitive' deficits of executive functions in the area of behavior and experience. The biological basis of these cognitive functions is in the frontal cortex, but the primary dysfunction seems to be a subcortical one. Negative symptoms can be understood as a secondary exhaustion mechanism, and partly as an adaptive process, corresponding with energetic deficits in information processing. Psychophysiological studies of regional cerebral blood flow, positron emission tomography, electrophysiological recordings and measures of eye tracking point to frontal dysfunction and hypoactivation in patients with negative symptoms. This agrees well with the results of cognitive studies. Psychophysiologists and cognitive psychologists are studying different aspects of the same systems disorder.",

Evidence from neuroradiological and neuropathological studies contribute little to the solution of this controversy, if dementia is considered as a clinical syndrome. From clinical descriptions it can be concluded that a sub-population of alcoholics suffers from a syndrome typified by psychologic disturbances other than amnesia alone. These patients fulfill the criteria for the syndromal diagnosis of ‘dementia’. The nosologic concept of ‘alcoholic dementia’ implies a direct neurotoxic effect of alcohol and it raises questions concerning pathogenetic mechanisms which can not be answered. The DSM-III-R category ‘dementia associated with alcoholism’ represents a solution for this controversy, because it gives a correct and complete (radically syndromal) clinical description without making assumptions on the relative contribution of multiple factors causing cognitive disturbances in alcoholics.",

Their effectiveness has been shown in numerous studies, although according to nowadays standards well designed studies (placebo-controlled, defined diagnostic groups, the use of standardized rating scales) with these compounds are relatively scarce. From the early 1980's the so called modern antidepressants have been introduced: the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the reversible selective monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors (RIMAs) and a variety of other compounds. All these drugs have been registered after their effectiveness had been shown in well designed, placebo-controlled studies. In defining the efficacy of antidepressants, registration authorities consider two aspects important: statistical evidence and clinical relevance.",

There is every reason to be optimistic over the future of biological psychiatry. The brain sciences are developing with astounding speed and the systematic attention for psychiatric-diagnosis and differential diagnosis renders biological psychiatry an unprecedented vitality. One should, however, not ignore some disquieting prospects. The following points of concern are discussed: the alarming shortage of young research psychiatrists; the deficiencies in the teaching of biological psychiatry; the hesitancy to utilize the fruits of brain and behavior research in clinical practice; the shortcomings in psychiatric diagnosing; nosological tunnel vision and, finally, the danger of overrating biological psychiatry with the inevitable disappointment reaction that will follow. The scientific maturation of psychiatry is contingent on a balanced development of its constituents.",

In principle, anamnestic information is sufficient to establish the clinical diagnosis, although neuro-physiological and biochemical data(CSF monoamine metabolites and HLA-typology) are sometimes needed to support the diagnostic procedure. Treatment of excessive daytime somnolence is still primarily based upon CNS stimulants, while treatment of cataplexy and related symptoms rests on antidepressants with a primarily serotonergic mode of action.",

People who become depressed frequently show enduring negative cognitions which predispose them to depression. In addition, interpersonal processes are supposed to contribute to the etiology and maintenance of depression. Depression-prone persons are presumed to display deficient or problematic social behaviours that elicit negative reactions in others, finally resulting in withdrawal by family and friends. About 60% of human communication is non-verbal. An ethological approach may therefore contribute to reveal behavioural and cognitive vulnerability factors for depression onset or persistence. Various studies support this presumption: High levels of patients' observed behaviour indicating involvement in the interaction between depressives and clinicians at admission are related with persistence of depression.",

Among university facilities LT is even more popular, with a percentage of 57%. Although the most frequently used treatment indication for LT is seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or its subsyndromal form (S-SAD) it is apparent that other forms of depression e.g. non-seasonal forms, either acute or chronic are also a target for this new treatment modality. There is a number of studies supporting the use of LT for SAD (for review), however there are just a few studies for non-seasonal depression or for the other treatment indications (for review).",

It is assumed that 60-65% of human communication is non-verbal.

In order to replicate the above findings, the present study investigates NKCA and negative life events in 11 normal and 35 unipolar (minor, simple major, melancholic) depressed subjects. NKCA has been determined by all subjects. They completed the Questionnaire on Recently Experienced Events with scores on number and impact factor of events related to a) illness, b) working conditions, c) social relationships, d) housing problems, e) loss of possession. Depressed subjects reported higher scores on number and/or impact factor of events related to illness, social relationships and housing problems. In our investigation NKCA was significantly blunted in depressed subjects and, particularly in melancholies. So NKCA is negative correlated to the severity of depression. We were unable to detect any significant relationship between NKCA, and life events ( number of impact factors ), Our results do not corroborate the thesis that life events may affect immune function, as assessed by NKCA.",

While the authors have acknowledged many of these mishaps, and may now be expected to submit an extensive errata list to the journal where their paper was once published, we regretfully note that also their latest contribution to this exchange is surprisingly inaccurate. However, its many shortcomings notwithstanding, their meta-analysis does add to the current literature by confirming that SSRIs do not seem to enhance the risk for suicide or death, and also that these drugs seem to enhance the risk of side effects categorised as serious only in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Background: Specific anti-inflammatory agents may yield antidepressant effects; however, no study has gathered the evidence on all anti-inflammatory drugs including a detailed assessment of side effects and risk of bias. Objectives: To systematically review all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that studied antidepressive treatment and side effects of pharmacological antiinflammatory intervention. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, Psychinfo, Clinicaltrials.gov, and review articles for trials published prior to January 1, 2018. We included RCTs investigating anti-inflammatory intervention in adults with depressive symptoms or major depressive disorder (MDD). Two independent reviewers extracted data. Pooled standard mean differences (SMD) including 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI) were calculated. Outcomes included depression scores after treatment including remission and response and side effects. Results: A total of 41 RCTs (N=10,344) were included, whereof 13 investigated NSAIDs (N=4,362), 11 cytokine-inhibitors (N=3,533), 9 statins (N=2,118), 3 minocycline (N=158), 3 pioglitazone (N=114), and 2 glucocorticoids (N=59). Overall, anti-inflammatory agents improved antidepressant treatment effects compared to placebo by a SMD of-0.46 (95%-CI=-0.62 to-0.30; I2=89%; N=9,459), which was present as add-on in patients with MDD (SMD=-0.56; 95%-CI=-0.84 to-0.27; I2=66%; N=634) and as monotherapy against depressive symptoms (SMD=-0.41; 95%-CI=-0.60 to-0.22; I2=93%, N=8,825). Better antidepressant effects were observed for NSAIDs as add-on (SMD=-0.82; 95%-CI=-1.17 to-0.46; I2=0%; N=132) and monotherapy (SMD=-0.29; 95%-CI=-0.51 to-0.06; I2=84%; N=4,082), cytokineinhibitors as monotherapy (SMD=-0.65; 95%-CI=-1.04 to-0.26; I2=95%; N=3,285), statins as add-on (SMD=-0.73; 95%-CI=-1.05 to-0.42; I2=0%; N=164), minocycline as monotherapy (SMD=-1.06; 95%-CI=-1.68 to-0.44; N=46), and glucocorticoids as add-on (SMD=-0.90; 95%-CI=-1.44 to-0.36; I2=0%; N=59). All studies were associated with high risk of bias. Only 19 trials reported on adverse events, and we found no increased risks for pain/muscle aching, gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events but a trend towards an increased risk for infections. Conclusion: The majority of anti-inflammatory agents improved antidepressant treatment effects. Future large, high-quality RCTs need to include longer follow-up, identify optimal doses and subgroups of patients that can benefit from anti-inflammatory intervention, possibly guided by neurovegetative symptoms, somatic comorbidity and pro-inflammatory markers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The aim of the study was to assess whether the auditory brainstem response (ABR) profiling test for schizophrenia (SZ) would recognise schizoaffective disorder (SZA) patients as SZ or not. Method: Male and female SZA patients ( n = 16) from the psychosis unit at Uppsala University Hospital were investigated. Coded sets of randomised ABR recordings intermingled with patients with SZ, adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and healthy controls were analysed by an independent party blinded to clinical diagnoses. Results: The ABR profiling test for SZ was positive in 5/16 patients (31%) and negative in 11/16 patients (69%) with SZA. A surprising finding was that 4/16 (25%) SZA patients were positive for the ABR profiling test for ADHD. Conclusion: With the ABR profiling test, a minority of patients with SZA tested positive for SZ. In contrast, a majority (85%) of patients with SZ in a previous study tested positive. These preliminary results leave us ignorant whether SZA should be regarded as a SZ-like disorder or a psychotic mood disorder and add to the questions regarding the validity of this diagnostic entity. However, the ABR profiling method is still in its infancy and its exploration in a range of psychiatric disorders is warranted.",

The chemical hemispheric-dominance in various systemic and neuropsychiatric diseases was also studied.The isoprenoid metabolites, digoxin, dolichol and ubiquinone, glycoconjugate metabolism, free radical metabolism and the RBC membrane composition, were studied in individuals with differing hemispheric-dominance. The digoxin levels and RBC membrane Na+-K+ATPase activity were also studied in systemic and neuropsychiatric diseases.The results showed that right hemispheric-dominant individuals had elevated digoxin levels, increased free radical production and reduced scavenging, increased tryptophan catabolites and reduced tyrosine catabolites, increased glycoconjugate levels and increased cholesterol : phospholipid ratio of RBC membranes. Left hemispheric-dominant individuals had the opposite patterns. This patterns could be correlated with various systemic and neuropsychiatric diseases.Right hemispheric-dominance represents a hyperdigoxinaemic state with membrane sodium-potassium ATPase inhibition. Left hemispheric-dominance represents the reverse pattern with hypodigoxinaemia and membrane sodium-potassium ATPase stimulation. Hemispheric-dominance could predispose to various systemic and neuropsychiatric diseases.",

The advent of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and the sequencing of the human genome have provided invaluable insights into the molecular genetics of the various psychiatric disorders through the study of candidate genes and linkage analyses. However, biological phenotype is dictated by protein expression, which has been shown to stray from the genetic blueprint designated by the genome. Consequently, the field of proteomics has recently emerged as a powerful means of exploring protein structure, function, and expression patterns. The ability to study disease at the gene and protein levels presents a tremendous opportunity for neuropsychiatric research, particularly in terms of the potential for developing therapeutic agents for novel protein targets.",

Methods: The subjects were 55 inpatients who were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Nine normal subjects were compared to the patient group. Each patient gave informed consent for the research involved in this study. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed using the BPRS. Results: (1) The medicated schizophrenic inpatients had significantly greater plasma NA levels, and higher but nonsignificant plasma HVA levels than the normal subjects. (2) In patients, there was a positive but nonsignificant correlation between the plasma NA levels and positive symptomatology. In contrast, plasma HVA levels were not correlated with either positive or negative symptomatology. Conclusion: On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that, mainly because of their catecholaminergic dysfunction, there is an increase in plasma NA and a tendency for increased plasma HVA in patients with chronic schizophrenia, regardless of long-term neuroleptic medication.",

Psychotic symptoms are the most frequent reason for nursing home placement of patients with Parkinson's disease. The psychotic symptoms seem to present themselves in a continuum where alterations in dreaming patterns often precede visual hallucinations, which often progress into delusional syndromes and, finally, into confusional organic syndromes. When evaluating a patient on dopaminergic treatment, it is important to inquire systematically about abnormal sleep related phenomena, for these are important clues in the early detection of psychotic symptoms. The pathogenesis of the psychotic symptoms is not yet fully understood but complex adaptations of various neurotransmitter systems seem to be involved. In the treatment of these drug-induced psychotic symptoms, the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine plays an important role. Drug-induced mania, hypersexuality and anxiety, although less frequent than the psychotic symptoms, also occur as a complication of dopaminergic treatment. Depressive symptoms, although common in Parkinson's disease, are less likely to occur as a side effect of the drug treatment.",

    "abstract": "Summary The relationship between myocardial infarction (MI), depression and cardiac death is not well understood. There is evidence that poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism and composition in phospholipids and cholesterylesters are involved in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and cardiac dysregulation. In this paper the relationship of PUFAs with 1) cardiac events 2) depressive disorder and 3) the inflammatory response system (IRS) will be reviewed. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms relate to the effects of dietary fatty acids on the IRS, the HPA-axis, serotonin metabolism and platelet reactivity. These effects are the result of the important effects of PUFAs on the structure and function of localized membrane domains, their involvement in eicosanoid synthesis and their influence on intra-cellular signalling pathways and gene expression. Antidepressive treatment has been shown to have immunosuppressive effects in healthy volunteers. In patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, PUFA supplementation resulted in significant symptom reduction. In the ongoing substudy of the MIND-IT, the effects of antidepressive treatment on immune status, PUFA composition in serum phospholipids and cholesterylesters and whole blood serotonin in depressive post-MI patients will be investigated. More knowledge on the relationships between PUFAs in diet, IRS parameters and serotonin metabolism may alter treatment strategies in the prevention of both cardiac death and the occurrence of depressive disorder in cardiac patients.",

    "abstract": "Substantial evidence exists for a cohort effect (earlier onset and increased prevalence) for both unipolar and bipolar affective disorder in every generation born since World War II. This effect could be related to inherited mechanisms (e.g., bi-Hneal pedigrees or genetic anticipation) or to environmental/experiential effects on gene expression (e.g., stressor effects on the induction of transcription and growth factors, enzymes, hormones and their receptors, and signal transduction molecules) as documented in preclinical models of neonatal maternal separation. This laboratory evidence is summarized and new clinical data on the impact of severe stressors on the unfolding course of bipolar illness are noted. The reported occurrence of childhood or adolescent physical or sexual abuse, compared to those who report their absence, is associated with: earlier bipolar illness onset; faster cycling (including ultradian) patterns; increased Axis I and II comorbidities; and increased time ill in a prospective year of follow-up. Selectively, physical abuse was associated with a reported pattern of increasingly severe mania and sexual abuse with increased numbers of serious suicide attempts. In a retrospective survey of parents of children with an approximate average age of 13 who were diagnosed with bipolar illness (compared to those with other diagnoses and those with no diagnosis), a cluster of symptoms related to irritability and dyscontrol differentiated the bipolar children earliest. These symptoms included: temper tantrums, irritability, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, poor frustration tolerance, and increased aggression. Given the growing evidence that episodes of affective dysfunction can not only convey morbidity and mortality, but may also sensitize to further recurrence and thus change the course of illness, opportunities abound for early recognition and intervention in childhood onset bipolar illness. Such a successful endeavor would both allow a more normal psychobiological development and allow the possibility of preventing the unfolding of more full-blown bipolar illness altogether.",

The benzodiazepine receptor (BDZ-R) is the most intensively studied allosteric site. It is the first allosteric modulatory site on a neurotransmitter receptor that has been found to mediate two opposite functions: facilitation and depression of GABA A -R function. The effects of BDZ-R ligands on behavior range from agonistic (anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myore-laxant/ataxic and hypno-sedative effects) to inverse-agonistic (anxiety and panic, hypervigilance and convulsions). Of particular interest for the future are BDZ-R partial agonists, as they lack several of the undesired properties of classic full agonists. Furthermore the GABA A -R system shows a high plasticity. This polymorphism raises the possibility that ligands selective for distinct subtypes of BDZ-R may emerge as useful drugs.

We set out to establish - whether schizophrenia spectrum personality traits are more common in the relatives of schizophrenic patients than relatives of affective psychotic patients; - what is the relationship between spectrum personality traits and neuropsychological deficits in these relatives. Relatives were interviewed using the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE), and also completed the National Adult Reading Test (NART), the Trail Making Test (TMT: Parts A and B) and Thurstone's Verbal Fluency Test (TVFT). Spectrum personality traits were equally common in the 129 relatives of schizophrenic and 106 relatives of affective psychotic patients. Relatives of psychotic patients who themselves had high paranoid traits had lower NART scores than those without such personality traits (p=0.007);similarly, those with high schizoid personality traits took longer to complete the TMT, part B than those without such traits (p=0.0l); and relatives with high schizotypal traits generated significantly fewer words on the verbal fluency test than those without such traits (p=0.04).",

This has resulted in an ignorance of the European psychiatric diagnostic tradition and a loss of the necessary critical observations and descriptions of psychopathology. This unfortunate process may be observed in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in mentally retarded patients where entities such as atypical psychoses, unstable mood disorder and motivational deficit syndrome are not recognized in general. The enormous increase of neuroscienti-fic knowledge, particularly the impact of genetic and intracellular mechanisms in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, warrants the use of a more dimensional and functional psychiatric paradigm. It concerns the effect of gene transcription on the expression of neurotransmitters and receptors that may account for an increased vulnerability or a relapsing course. A so called anticipatory treatment approach is therefore advocated.",

Perseveration is a core symptom of schizophrenia, yet the cause is not known. For schizophrenic patients disorders of many parts of the fronto-striatal loops are found, for example disturbances of the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. Perseveration in schizophrenia can be explained with set-maintenance problems, related to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, or with set-shifting problems that are related to disorders in the striatum. These set-maintenance and set-shifting problems can be distinguished with neuropsychological tests. Regarding the bloodflow patterns for the different subtypes of schizophrenia three problems are expected as explanations for perseveration: set-maintenance problems concerning abstract information, set-maintenance problems shifting between stimuli and enhanced set-shifting with cues.",

Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) gene expressions were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. TNF-α protein content was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.Three days after nerve injury, the threshold of pain was declined among animals subjected to neuropathic pain. Mechanical and cold allodynia, as well as thermal hyperalgesia were attenuated by glucosamine (500, 1000, 2000 mg/kg) in the prophylactic regimen. However, existing pain was not decreased by this drug. Increased mRNA expression of iNOS and TNF-α was significantly reduced in the spinal cord of CCI animals by glucosamine (500, 1000, 2000 mg/kg) in the prophylactic regimen. The overall expression of spinal TNF-α was increased by CCI, but this increase was reduced in animals receiving glucosamine prophylactic treatment.Findings suggest that glucosamine as a safe supplement may be a useful candidate in preventing neuropathic pain following nerve injury. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects may be at least in part responsible for the antinociceptive effects of this drug.",

Statistical models have been designed to study learning, such as the Bayesian Learning Model, which takes into account prior possibilities and behaviours to determine how much of a new behaviour is determined by learning instead of chance. However, the neurobiological basis underlying how anxiety interferes with learning is not yet known. Accordingly, we aimed to use neuroimaging techniques and apply a Bayesian Learning Model to study learning in individuals with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).Participants were 25 controls and 14 individuals with GAD and comorbid disorders. During fMRI, participants completed a shape-button association learning and reversal task. Using a flexible factorial analysis in SPM, activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampus was compared between groups during first reversal. Beta values from the peak of these regions were extracted for all learning conditions and submitted to repeated measures analyses in SPSS.Individuals with GAD showed less activation in the basal ganglia and the hippocampus only in the first reversal compared with controls. This difference was not present in the initial learning and second reversal.Given that the basal ganglia is associated with initial learning, and the hippocampus with transfer of knowledge from short- to long-term memory, our results suggest that GAD may engage these regions to a lesser extent during early accommodation or consolidation of learning, but have no longer term effects in brain activation patterns during subsequent learning.",

    "abstract": "The Wistar Hannover rat (WHR) is a strain commonly used for toxicity studies but rarely used in studies investigating depression neurobiology. In this study, we aimed to characterise the behavioural responses of WHR to acute and repeated antidepressant treatments upon exposure to the forced swim test (FST) or learned helplessness (LH) test. WHR were subjected to forced swimming pre-test and test with antidepressant administration (imipramine, fluoxetine, or escitalopram) at 0, 5 h and 23 h after pre-test. WHR displayed high immobility in the test compared to unstressed controls (no pre-swim) and failed to respond to the antidepressants tested. The effect of acute and repeated treatment (imipramine, fluoxetine, escitalopram or s-ketamine) was then tested in animals not previously exposed to pre-test. Only imipramine (20 mg/kg, 7 days) and s-ketamine (acute) reduced the immobility time in the test. To further investigate the possibility that the WHR were less responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the effect of repeated treatment with fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, 7 days) was investigated in the LH model. The results demonstrated that fluoxetine failed to reduce the number of escape failures in two different protocols. These data suggest that the WHR do not respond to the conventional antidepressant treatment in the FST or the LH. Only s-ketamine and repeated imipramine were effective in WHR in a modified FST protocol. Altogether, these results indicate that WHR may be an interesting tool to investigate the mechanisms associated with the resistance to antidepressant drugs and identify more effective treatments.",

In clinical situations, however, psychiatrists still do not use apropriate instruments to recognize and handle the impact of daily life stress. DSM-IV is insufficient in this respect. Objective: A different approach is sketched for clinicians to be able to integrate knowledge from research more effectively. Method: Application of a ‘broad’ biological view may reveal the significance of interpretation, emotion, impulse and reaction as stages of a ‘mental tract’, which is involved in processing the input of stressful situations. Result: This may lead to a more rational ‘targeting’ of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic strategies in clinical practice. Conclusion: A re-orientation of clinical psychiatry from mere classification towards a ‘broad’ biological approach may pave the way for a more rational and purposeful application of research findings to therapy.",

    "abstract": "Background: Here we propose a stress model with disease-specific aspects and aspecific factors. The latter are subdivided into load (perception, psychic defence mechanisms), strain (psychophysiological responses) and stress sensu strictu (biological and behavioural compensation). Insufficiently compensated strain will result in being sick and precipitation of a specific disease according to one's predisposition. In the clinical practice, multiconditionality requires a multidimensional analysis, the the five-axial DSM-system being designed especially for this purpose. Multidisciplinary treatment is then organized accordingly, i.e. Axis I: case management, medication; Axis II, (focal) psychotherapy; Axis III, somatic specialists; Axis IV, social worker; Axis V, psychotherapy for coping deficits. Objective: To test the efficacy of this multimethodical approach. Method: In a 1-year prospective study of 257 admissions in a department of psychiatry in a general hospital, the General Health Questionnaire (30 items) was filled out at admission, discharge and first polyclinical visit post-discharge. Results: The 213 evaluable questionnaires at admission did not show differences (17–18.9) between the four groups, mood disorders (62%), alcoholism (17%), psychoses (15%) and anxiety disorders (6%). At discharge all four groups had reached the cut-off value for ‘not-sick’ (&lt; 6), this remaining so at follow-up; the three measurements differed significantly throughout the patient groups. Hospitalization was definitely 28.2 days shorter than the Dutch mean of 42 days. Conclusions: Working to the proposed clinical model for multiconditionalty is effective on intensity and duration of disorders, sustained improvement is attained.",

However, these can range from symptoms of dementia and movement disorder caused by the comparatively rare autosomal dominant Huntington's disease to common everyday aspects of behaviour such as religious persuasion or career choice. Normal behaviours and most common disorders do not show simple mendelian inheritance but instead have more complex patterns of transmission involving either major genes with incomplete penetrance, multiple genes of small effect, or a combination of the two. In addition, common complex phenotypes usually involve the combination of genetic and environmental factors. Therefore once family studies have shown that a disorder or trait is familial the next stage is to perform twin studies and, if possible adoption studies to investigate whether this results from shared genes, shared environment or a combination of the two.",

We studied changes in heart rate variability (HRV), which were measured in a frequency band ranging from 0.07 to 0.14Hz. During the performance of an attention task, healthy children exhibited task load-related decreases in HRV. These decreases were found to be significantly smaller and not task load-related in a group of children with a PDDNOS who were judged to be not hyperactive. The decreases in HRV during task performance were almost absent in children with a PDDNOS who were moreover judged to be hyperactive. The magnitude of HRV decreases appeared to be significantly related to one of our task performance measures and to behaviour problems reported by the parents. Our results suggest a diminished vagal adaptivity to attention-demanding task situations in children with a PDDNOS, which is related to their resistance to unexpected changes in their daily routines.",

One in a hundred people complain of unexplained and prolonged fatigue, with half that number meeting the strictest criteria for the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Discrete fatigue syndromes have been described, particularly after Epstein Barr virus infection. The majority of patients with CFS have a syndrome similar to the ICD-10 definition of neurasthenia. Mood and somatoform disorders are common comorbid or differential diagnoses. The prognosis is poor, particularly in patients attending hospitals and those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The aetiology of both CFS and chronic unexplained fatigue are essentially unknown, perhaps reflecting the heterogenenous natures of both the symptom and syndrome. There is reasonable evidence to suggest that particular infections may trigger both prolonged fatigue and CFS. Maintaining factors are different from triggering factors and include mood and sleep disorders, illness beliefs and behaviours, and possibly inactivity. Treatments aimed at reversing these maintaining factors show promise.",

Serotonergic raphe neurons diffusely project to a variety of brain regions (e.g. cortex, amygdala, hippocampus) and play known roles in integrating emotion, cognition, motor function as well as in food intake, sleep, pain, and sexual activity. The diversity of physiologic functions is due to the fact that 5-HT acts as a master control neurotransmitter within a highly complex system of neural communication mediated by multiple pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT receptors, thus orchestrating the activity and interaction of several other neurotransmitter systems. Since proteins involved in the regulation of central serotonergic activity (e.g. enzymes, receptors, transporter) play pivotal role in brain 5-HT homeostasis, polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of their genes resulting in variation of expression and function are likely to influence complex traits, such as temperament/personality and psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "A great interindividual variability exists in biological response to drugs. This variability is partly attributable to pharmacodynamic factors (drug - receptor interactions) and partly to pharmacokinetic factors. Drugs can be eliminated from the body by renal clearance, metabolism or both. Although every tissue has some ability to metabolise xenobiotics like drugs, the liver is the principal organ of biotransformation. Major metabolising enzymes are the cytochrome-P450 mono-oxygenases, epoxide hydrolase, glucuronosyl-transferase, acetyl-transferase, sulfo-transferase and xanthine oxidase. Some of these enzymes display in a subset of subjects a ‘normal’ activity and in another subset of subjects a reduced or a greatly increased activity. This altered activity may be genetically determined and is then called genetic polymorphism. Clinically relevant metabolic differences traditionally have been defined by their genotypie expression such as ‘poor’ and ‘extensive’ metaboliser. The recent developments of powerful methods for DNA (or genomic) analysis portends a revolutionary expansion of our understanding of physiology as well as pathology. Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic variation underlying differential response to drugs. Genotyping may become a useful tool in optimising drug treatment. Another part of the genetic research is directed towards the discovery of genetic alterations leading to diseases. Once identified, these genetic alterations can become targets for drug treatment (e.g. gene therapy). Pharmaco-genomics applies the large-scale systematic approaches of genomics to speed the discovery of drug response markers, whether they act at the level of the drug target, drug metabolism or disease pathway. Table I gives some examples of genetic alterations that are identified together with their effects. Some of these examples will be briefly discussed here.",

    "abstract": "Several psychiatric diseases are considered to be neuro-developmental disorders. Amongst these are schizophrenia and autism, in which genetic and environmental components have been indicated. In these disorders intrinsic molecular mechanisms of brain development may be deranged due to genetic predispositions, or modified by external influences. Brain development is a delicate process of well-tuned cellular proliferation and differentiation of multipotent neural progenitor cells driven by spatiotemporal cues. One of the fundamental mechanisms is the interaction between external signals, e.g. growth factors, and internal regulators, e.g. transcription factors. An important transmitter system involved in behavioural and affective functions relevant for psychiatric disorders is the mesencephalic dopamine (DA) system. The mesencephalic DA system is organized in two anatomically and functionally different systems. DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area project to the mesolimbic system and are mostly related to control of behaviour. It has been implicated in drug addiction and affective disorders like dipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The dopamine system of the substantia nigra (nigro-striatal pathway) is implicated in movement control. Degeneration of this system, as in Parkinson's disease, or altered function in tardive dyskinesia have highlighted its importance in human disease. Recent findings in molecular neurobiology have provided the first clues to molecular mechanisms involved in developing and mature DA neurons. These may have clinical implications in novel therapeutic strategies.",

As with most other fields of research it is difficult to exactly pinpoint when behavioural genetics started. In fact, one might say that the notion behavioural traits can be inherited may have appeared in human thought as early at 8000 BC, when the domestication of the dog began. The scientific era of behavioural genetics is generally considered to start with Charles Darwin. In his famous book On the Origin of Species by Means of natural Selection, or the Preservation of favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, published in 1859 (and sold out the first day), he devoted an entire chapter on instinctive behavioural patterns. Some years later, in his book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, he clearly stated that the difference between the mind of a human being and the mind of an animal 'is certainly one of degree and not of kind'. Moreover he gave considerable thought that mental powers (and insanity) are heritable aspects.",

If a mutation in both copies of the gene on both chromosome homologues is necessary to cause the disease, the inheritance pattern is recessive, and a patient is the offspring of two clinically unaffected carriers. However, if a mutation in a single homologue is sufficient, the inheritance pattern is dominant and the disease is transmitted from generation to generation. Monogenic diseases are responsible for only a small fraction of all patients with genetic diseases. Many common diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes and several psychiatric diseases, are the results of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. However, these diseases can have important genetic components and can therefore still be considered genetic diseases. The identification of genes involved in complex genetic diseases can be very important for the understanding and treatment of these diseases. Over the last 15 years, much progress has been made in the identification of genes responsible for monogenic diseases, but the identification of genes involved in complex diseases has been more difficult, and at this moment little is known about the genes involved in most common diseases.",

Neuropsychology can make an important contribution in early and differential diagnostics. The borderline between normal and pathological cognitive aging is especially important in this respect. The neuropsychologist gains insight in medical, biological, psychological and social factors of the aging person. Has the profile of complaints and deficits a normal background or is a pathological process taking place? It is important to people who are unnecessarily worried about possible dementia. Neuropsychological assessment also provides information about a patient's disturbed and undisturbed cognitive functions, their personality and their way of coping with problems in every day's life. This is of major importance, because it provides information and possibilities for biological or psychological interventions. Because of the complexity of problems that may occur, it is necessary that the neuropsychologist is experienced and works in a multidisciplinary team in which neurological and psychiatric expertise is present.",

The clinically characterized groups should be statistically reclassified by discriminant analytic techniques. The existing diagnostic categories according to DSM-III-R could be widely confirmed by the statistical reconstitution of the clinical groups. Conversion, somatization and depressive disorder presented as distinct clinical categories. A classification relying widely on symptoms still seems to be too superficial and does not represent the complexity of these patients.

The objective of the present study was to provide evidence for the hypothesis on schizophrenia that abnormal fetal brain development leads to impaired sensorimotor gating of acoustic startle stimuli. To this purpose, pregnant rats were treated with methylazoxymethanol acetate on one of four subsequent days of gestation, from E9 to E12. These procedures inhibit early stages of cortical proliferation in the foetuses, resulting in early abnormalities that were mainly found in the entorhinal region. At the adult age, habituation and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle responses to acoustic stimuli were investigated. Our results show impaired habituation and PPI in rats treated at embryonic days 10 and 11. It is concluded that sensorimotor gating deficits can result from a developmental abnormality involving the entorhinal region, supporting the hypothesis that similar deficits, often observed in schizophrenic subjects may be the result of entorhinal cortex dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Samenvatting In een drietal artikelen wordt de overeenkomst besproken tussen processen die ten grondslag liggen aan twee verschillende functies: anticipatoire attentie en motorische preparatie. Beide functies zijn van belong voor een optimale afstemming op onze omgeving. Het achterste gedeelte van de hersenschors houdt zich voornamelijk bezig met binnenkomende informatie uit de buitenwereld en het eigen lichaam, terwijl het voorste deel essentieel is voor onze acties en reacties. Als bekend is wanneer wij met relevante informatie warden geconfronteerd en vermoed kan worden hoe daarop moet worden gereageerd, worden modaliteitsspecifieke sensorische en motorische kanalen geopend om zo een snelle en adequate reactie te garanderen. In deze tekst wordt gepostuleerd dat de achterste en voorste cortexhelften op vergelijkbare wijze vanuit de thalamus worden geactiveerd als onderdeel van motorische preparatie en anticipatoire attentie. Cruciaal is de inhiberende invloed die de nucleus reticularis (NR) uitoefent op de onderliggende thalamuskernen. De NR staat onder een dubbele controle: exciterend vanuit de prefrontale cortex, en inhiberend vanuit het neostriatum. Aangegeven wordt hoe selectie in de informatieverwerking via deze balans kan worden gerealiseerd, zowel in het sensorische als het motorische domein. Na het overzicht van de relevante anatomische structural in deel I, de presentatie van het model in deel II, komt in het ilenle artikel neuropsychologische evidentie aan de orde, waarna het psychofysiologisch onderzoek besproken wordt, dat geleid heeft tot de formulering van het model.",

Methods: To test the hypothesis, male Wistar rats were exposed to the elevated T-maze (ETM) model under the following treatments: L-Arginine (L-Arg) was administered before treatment with WIN55,212-2, a CB1 receptor agonist; AM251, a CB1 antagonist, was administered before treatment with L-Arg. All treatments were by intraperitoneal route. Results: The CB1 receptor agonist, WIN55,212-2 (1 mg/kg), induced an anxiolytic-like effect, which was prevented by pretreatment with an ineffective dose of L-Arg (1 mg/kg). Administration of AM251 (1 mg/kg), a CB1 antagonist before treatment with L-Arg (1 mg/kg) did not produce anxiogenic-like responses. Conclusion: Altogether, this study suggests that the anxiolytic-like effect of cannabinoids may occur through modulation of NO signalling.",

    "abstract": "The objective is to determine whether variability in the MSRA gene, related to obesity and several psychiatric conditions, may be relevant for psychopathological symptoms common in Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and/or for the susceptibility to the disorder. A total of 629 women (233 AN patients and 396 controls) were genotyped for 14 tag-SNPs. Psychometric evaluation was performed with the EDI-2 and SCL-90R questionnaires. Genetic associations were carried out by logistic regression controlling for age and adjusting for multiple comparisons (FDR method). Two tag-SNPs, rs11249969 and rs81442 (with a pairwise r2 value of 0.41), were associated with the global EDI-2 score, which measures EDI-related psychopathology (adjusted FDR-q = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Moreover, rs81442 significantly modulated all the scales of the SCL-90R test that evaluates general psychopathology (FDR-q values ranged from 4.1E-04 to 0.011). A sliding-window analysis using adjacent 3-SNP haplotypes revealed a proximal region of the MSRA gene spanning 187.8 Kbp whose variability deeply affected psychopathological symptoms of the AN patients. Depression was the symptom that showed the strongest association with any of the constructed haplotypes (FDR-q = 3.60E-06). No variants were found to be linked to AN risk or anthropometric parameters in patients or controls. Variability in the MSRA gene locus modulates psychopathology often presented by AN patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Cholecystokinin is a neuropeptide with a role in the neurobiology of adaptive behaviour that is implicated in anxiety disorders, while the underlying mechanisms currently remain insufficiently explained. The rs2941026 variation in the cholecystokinin B receptor gene has previously been associated with trait anxiety. Our aim was to investigate associations between the CCK B receptor gene polymorphism rs2941026 with anxiety, personality, depressiveness and suicidality in a longitudinal study of late adolescence and early adulthood. Methods: We used reports on trait and state anxiety, depressiveness and suicidal thoughts, as well as Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales, from the two birth cohorts of the Estonian Children Personality, Behaviour and Health Study. We measured associations between the CCKBR gene rs2941026 and anxiety-related phenotypes both longitudinally and cross-sectionally at ages 15, 18, 25 and 33. Results: Homozygosity for both alleles of the CCKBR rs2941026 was associated with higher trait and state anxiety in the longitudinal analysis. Cross-sectional comparisons were statistically significant at ages 18 and 25 for trait anxiety and at ages 25 and 33 for state anxiety. Higher depressiveness and suicidal thoughts were associated with the A/A genotype at age 18. Additionally, homozygosity for the A-allele was related to higher FEAR and SADNESS in the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales. The genotype effects were more apparent in females, who displayed higher levels of negative affect overall. Conclusions: CCKBR genotype is persistently associated with negative affect in adolescence and young adulthood. The association of the CCKBR rs2941026 genotype with anxiety-related phenotypes is more pronounced in females.",

    "abstract": "The Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS) is a novel questionnaire to assess anhedonia of recent validation. In this work, we aim to study the equivalence between the traditional paper-and-pencil and the digital format of DARS. Sixty-nine patients filled the DARS in a paper-based and digital versions. We assessed differences between formats (Wilcoxon test), validity of the scales [Kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)], and reliability (Cronbach's alpha and Guttman's coefficient). We calculated the comparative fit index and the root mean squared error (RMSE) associated with the proposed one-factor structure. Total scores were higher for paper-based format. Significant differences between both formats were found for three items. The weighted Kappa coefficient was approximately 0.40 for most of the items. Internal consistency was greater than 0.94, and the ICC for the digital version was 0.95 and 0.94 for the paper-and-pencil version (F = 16.7, p < 0.001). Comparative Adjustment Index was 0.97 for the digital DARS and 0.97 for the paper-and-pencil DARS, and RMSE was 0.11 for the digital DARS and 0.10 for the paper-and-pencil DARS. We concluded that the digital DARS is consistent in many respects with the paper-and-pencil questionnaire, but equivalence with this format cannot be assumed without caution.",

    "abstract": "Het mag als een verworvenheid beschouwd worden dat er sinds kort stoffen op de markt zijn die de kans op terugval van alcoholisten verkleinen. Natuurlijk hebben deze stoffen, zoals acamprosaat en naltrexon indicaties en contra-indicaties, en die zijn in de voorgaande artikelen beschreven. Het is daarmee echter nog niet gemakkelijk geworden een richtlijn voor de dagelijkse praktijk te formuleren. Dat blijkt wel uit deze artikelen. Immers, acamprosaat is effectief gebleken, maar nu ook weer niet zó effectief dat het niet voorschrijven ervan per definitie een gemiste kans moet worden beschouwd. De Jong en Schippers wijzen er terecht op dat als stoffen té enthousiast worden voorgeschreven, zoals dat met disulfiram is gebeurd, het grote aantal mislukkingen ertoe kan leiden dat men zich weer teleurgesteld van zo'n stof afwendt. En het risico op dit soort therapeutisch enthousiasme is juist bij de behandeling van verslavingen levensgroot. Er zijn weinig ziektebeelden die bij een behandelaar zoveel machteloosheid kunnen oproepen en dus zoveel neiging naar strohalmen te grijpen.",

    "abstract": "Traditional methods used to asses genetic effects, such as twins, adoption and family studies, have demonstrated the role genetic vulnerability factors in the etiology of major psychiatric diseases such as affective disorders and schizophrenia. It remains however impossible, using these methods, to specify the genetic variables involved and the exact mode of transmission of these diseases. New genetic approaches in psychiatry include the use of DNA markers in sophisticated strategies to examine families and populations. Genetic linkage (in families) and allelic association (in unrelated subjects) are the most frequent techniques applied searching for genes in psychiatric diseases. Advances in these methods have permitted their application to complex diseases in which the mode of genetic transmission is unknown. Affective disorders and, in particular, bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) have been examined in many molecular genetic studies which have covered a large part of the genome, specific hypotheses such as mutations have also, been studied. Most recent studies indicate that several chromosomal regions may be involved in the aetiology of affective disorders. Large multi-centre and multi-disciplinary projects are currently underway in Europe and in the US and hopefully will improve our understanding of the genetic factors involved in affective disorders. In parallel to these new developments in molecular genetics, the classical genetic epidemiology, represented by twin, adoption and family studies, have been improved, providing validated models to test the gene-environment interactions.",

    "abstract": "Samenvatting In de afgelopen zes jaar is veel onderzoek verficht naar de effecten van antipsychotica op de regionale c-fos-expressie in de hersenen. Deze benadering biedt in een dierexperimentele proefopzet de mogelijkheid op cellulair niveau de effecten van psychofarmaca te bestuderen. Het fos-gen behoort tot de groep ‘immediate early genes’. Dit zijn genen die de transcriptie van andere, vaak onbekende genen reguleren. Een aantal aspecten van dit mechanisme wordt in deze bijdrage beschreven. Het onderzoek naar de effecten van antipsychotica op c-fos-expressie wordt samengevat en de betekenis voor de classificatie van antipsychotica benadrukt. Het blijkt dat deze farmaca effectief zijn in zowel de (meso)limbische gebieden (als nucleus accumbens, septum en amygdala) als ook in de basale ganglia. De relatieve effecten, wat betreft de c-fos-reactie, van de atypische antipsychotica (als clozapine en risperidon) zijn hoger in de limbische structuren, vergeleken met de effecten van de typische (als haloperidol). De potentie van de c-fos-methodiek voor verdere ontwikkelingen in dit gebied wordt aangegeven.",

    "abstract": "Samenvatting In een drietal artikelen wordt de overeenkomst besproken tussen Processen die ten grondslag liggen aan twee verschillende functies: anticipatoire attentie en motorische preparatie. Beide functies zijn van belang voor een optimale afstemming op onze omgeving. Het achterste gedeelte van de hersenschors houdt zieh voornamelijk bezig met binnenkomende informatie uit de buiten-wereld en het eigen lichaam, terwijl het voorste deel essentieel is voor onze acties en readies. Als bekend is wanneer wij met relevante informatie worden geconfronteerd en vermoed kan worden hoe daarop moet worden gereageerd, worden modali-teitsspeeifieke sensorische en motorische kanalen geopend om zo een snelle en adequate reactie te garanderen. In deze tekst wordt gepostuleerd dat de achterste en voorste cortexhelften op vergelijkbare wijze vanuit de thalamus worden geactiveerd als onder-deel van anticipatoire attentie en motorische preparatie. Cruciaal is de inhiberende invloed die de nucleus reticularis (NR) uitoefent op de onderliggende thalamuskernen. De NR staat onder een dubbele controle: exciterend vanuit de prefrontale cortex en inhiberend vanuit het neostriatum. Aangegeven wordt hoe selectie in de informatieverwerking via deze balans kan worden gerealiseerd, zowel in het sensorische als het motorische domein. Nadat in Deel I een overzicht is gegeven van de relevante anatomische structuren, wordt hier het model voor anticipatoire attentie en motorische preparatie gepresenteerd. In het volgende artikel wordt neuropsychologische evidentie gepresenteerd, waarna het psychofysiologisch onderzoek aan de orde komt dat heeft geleid tot de formule ring van het model.",

    "abstract": "Some 40 years ago phencyclidine (PCP) was developed as the prototype of a proposed new class of 'dissociative' general anesthetics, so called because it induced a marked dissociation from the environment without complete loss of consciousness. In the earliest clinical trials of PCP anesthesia, it was observed that as many as half the subjects experienced severe psychotic reactions during and beyond emergence. This striking clinical observation at once marked the failure of PCP as a suitable general anesthetic, and the beginning of a remarkable new era in basic and clinical neuroscience which can serve as an example of the interaction between clinical observation and basic science. At once, clinical researchers turned their focus upon the characterization of the PCP-induced psychosis, and recognized striking similarities between PCP-induced symptoms and signs and both the negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, proposing the PCP psychosis as a new model of that illness. Several years later PCP suddenly emerged as a major drug of abuse, with the result that emergency rooms and psychiatric inpatient units were observing and treating large numbers of these patients, in many of whom a diagnosis of schizophrenia could not be ruled out until toxicological analyses were performed. This natural experiment yielded a huge amount of additional data, and contributed a strong public-health based impetus to research into the nature and treatment of PCP intoxication.",

    "abstract": "Since the seminal work of Geller and Blum there is a vast expanding literature relating anxiety symptoms to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT). The general picture emerging from animal research is that increasing 5-HT function is anxiogenic. However, animal research is confined by the fact that extrapolations from animal behavior to human emotions have limited validity. Human anxiety can range from normal emotions to clinical syndromes. It can be a component of different physical and mental disorders, but also the central feature of a syndromes. During the last decade, a wealth of knowledge about the origin and anatomical distribution of 5-HT neuronal systems has been obtained. Our understanding of the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of anxiety has also considerably advanced, but the picture is still puzzling. We are faced with a large number of 5-HT-receptor subtypes, each with its own specific distribution and presumably specific function. The complexity of the 5-HT system in terms of receptor heterogeneity offers a dazzling opportunity to the development of new drugs affecting selective 5-HT functions, but it also precludes that firm conclusions can be drawn when less selective agents are being used.",

    "abstract": "Biological schizophrenia research has been dominated by the dopamine hypothesis for decades, but in recent years a more diversified view has gained increasing attention. Several neurotransmitters are now being discussed, and especially their interaction in complex circuitries. The demonstration of an atypical profile of clozapine (Leponex®), with lessened extrapyramidal side effects and somewhat increased efficacy, has stimulated this research field considerably. This agent has high affinity not only for the different dopamine receptor subtypes, but also for serotonergic, alpha-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. Different workers have stressed one or more of these sites as being of major importance for the atypical profile of clozapine, and several drug companies have made attempts to mimic the profile of clozapine by developing molecules with affinity for these receptors in varying proportions. A number of such agents have reached or will soon reach the market and appear to be promising, even though they may not match clozapine in terms of atypicality.",

    "abstract": "This series of papers suggests that processes underlying anticipatory attention and motor preparation share a common control mechanism. Both functions are of utmost importance for an optimal adaptation to our environment. While the posterior part of the cortex is aimed at the analysis of incoming information, both from the outer world and our own body, the anterior part is involved in action and reaction. If we know when in the near future we will be confronted with relevant information, and how this has to be responded upon, modality specific sensoric and motoric information channels have to be open in order to guarantee an adequate response. The anterior and posterior parts of the cortex are activated from the thalamus and the information transmission is influenced via the reticular nucleus (RN) of the thalamus. The RN itself is under a double control: excitatory from the prefrontal cortex and inhibitory from the neostriatum. It is suggested that selection in anticipatory attention and motor preparation is realized in a comparable way via the RN. In Part I the relevant anatomical structures are described. In Part II the model for anticipatory attention and motor preparation is presented. In Part III the supporting neuropsychological evidence is presented, after which psychophysiological experiments will be discussed having lead to the formulation of the model.",

    "abstract": "Molecular genetics has now been widely incorporated into genetic epidemiological research in psychiatry. Affective disorders and, in particular, bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) have been examined in many molecular genetic studies which have covered a large part of the genome. Specific hypotheses such as mutations have also been studied. Most recent studies indicate that several chromosomal regions may be involved in the aetiology of BPAD. These include genes on chromosomes 18, 21, 4, 5, 11 and X. Other studies have reported the presence of anticipation in BPAD and in unipolar affective disorder (UPAD). This phenomenon describes the increase in clinical severity and decrease in age of onset observed in successive generations. This mode of transmission correlates with the presence of specific mutations (trinucleotide repeat sequences). Associations with these mutations have been reported in different populations of BPAD-patients and may represent a genetic factor involved in the transmission of the disorder. These findings are all preliminary and require to be confirmed. Large multi-centres and multi-disciplinary projects are currently underway in Europe and in the US and hopefully will improve our understanding of the genetic factors involved in affective disorders. In addition, genetic approaches used in psychiatry are being combined with an assessment of non-genetic susceptibility factors. The investigation of interactions between gene and environment is one of the most promising areas dealing with complex multi-factorial diseases such as the affective disorders.",

    "abstract": "Summary An attempt is made to relate drug and non-drug antidepressive interventions to brain processes. In the present context two concepts are proposed: vulnerability towards depressogenic factors and depression as a state of the brain. Accordingly, it is assumed that the current antidepressants make the brain less vulnerable by inhibiting monoaminergic neurons and by reducing the number or efficacy of their postsynaptic receptors. In contrast, electroconvulsive therapie and sleep-deprivation affect primarily the state of the brain and can produce spectacular (but often short lasting) improvements. It is proposed that the combination of the two aspects may lead to fast and lasting antidepressive effects.",

    "abstract": "Since some years it has become evident that objective disturbances can be found in patients suffering from personality disorders. Research findings from earlier date already demonstrated low levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid, especially in patients with personality disorders, under exclusion of depressive features. Furthermore, data have been collected on the correlation between a hyposerotonergic state and disturbances in aggression and impulse control in a variety of syndromes such as automutilation, bulimia nervosa, suicide attempts and various states of drug abuse. However, psychopharmacological research in personality disorders is rare and to date mainly patients with borderline and schizotypical personality disorders have been studied. It is quite remarkable for this area to find more review articles than original contributions based on the results of clinical trials. A great variety of recommendations for pharmacotherapy in these patients exists in literature, among which treatment with carbamazepine, lithium, low-dose neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin uptake inhibitors. In this article we will analyze the research methodology and the results of clinical trials forming the base for pharmacotherapeutic treatment recommendations. Only the results of well-controlled studies will be reviewed.",

The discovery that this melatonin secretion decreases under the influence of bright light, gave rise to the use of light therapy in some affective disorders. The literature on the relationship between melatonin secretion and mood is reviewed concerning seasonal affective disorder, non-seasonal affective disorder and premenstrual syndrome. Light therapy could reduce an abnormal high melatonin secretion back to normal proportions. None of the affective disorders, however, is accompanied by an unusual high melatonin level. Nevertheless, light therapy as well as other therapies that suppress melatonin have a therapeutic effect. This is not the case with the administration of melatonin. Mood is not affected by extra melatonin in seasonal affective disorder but it is in both other affective disorders. Melatonin plays a part in the pathogenesis of the affective disorders but it is not yet clear which one.",

Although more problems arise while performing attention tasks than memory tasks, the neuropsychological test inquiry doesn't indicate one particular neuropsychological function as consistently impaired. They often perform well because they compensate impaired wakefulness by an increased willingness to respond. Neurophysiological research indicates that the sometimes occurring cognitive dysfunction is associated with a waxing and waning between wakefulness and sleep. The increased psychopathology is partly a reflection of, partly a reaction to the symptoms. The impact of hypersomnia on psychosocial functioning is more important than that of epilepsy in epileptics. In severe cases smoking and driving should better be dissuaded.",

    "abstract": "Summary Research investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of anxiety disorder have mainly been focused on dysfunction of the GABA, noradrenergic and serotonergic (5-HT) neuronal systems. Just recently, in both animal and human studies, evidence has been found for a possible role of the cholecystokinin (CCK) neuronal system in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorder. Behaviorally, animal studies revealed anxiogenic-like properties for the ‘central’ CCK B receptor agonists, while CCK B receptor antagonists displayed intrinsic anxiolytic properties. Similarly, in man, CCK B receptor agonists, like pentagastrin and CCK 4 , were found to be able to elicited panic attacks in both panic disorder (PD) patients and healthy volunteers. These effects appear due to stimulation of the CCK B receptor. In addition, clinically effective panicolytic agents reduce the sensitivity to CCK 4 in PD patients. Taken together, these findings may suggest a role for CCK in the neurobiology of PD. On the other hand, there is circumstantial evidence for involvement of several other neuronal systems, such as the serotonergic, noradrenergic and GABA-ergic system, in the regulation of anxiety. Interestingly, evidence has been found for an interaction between CCK and 5-HT and that this interaction plays a role in the mediation of anxiety. This presentation will critically discuss the evidence for the role of the CCKB receptor in anxiety and in addition, will focus on the putative evidence that the role of CCK in anxiety is mediated by its interaction with the serotonergic neuronal system.",

PET-rCBF activation methods provide an opportunity to acquire insight in the distribution of functionally related areas of the human brain in vivo. The distinction of visual areas, activated by either motion or color within an observed scenery, points at a segregation in neuronal information processing. Such a segregation extends into both a dorsal and a ventral route towards consequently the parietal and temporal cortex. Simultaneous activation over the dorsal and ventral route, which for example occurs in relation to the perception of complex motion (optic flow), or motion perception after lesion of V5, suggests integration by means of cross-connectivity. The third principle, i.e. \"top-down\" integration, appears by analysis of V5-V1 interaction, attentional effects on V4, frontal activation in prosopagnosia, and by analysis of hallucinations. Such \"top-down\" integration indicates the presence of momentaneous effect on cortical areas, intimately related to the primary sensory cortex, by neuronal activity of remote \"association\" cortex, the latter being connected by direct (synaps-restricted) bypass from early stations of information processing.",

Changes in the duration of melatonin secretion, which usually occurs exclusively at night and therefore lasts longer in winter than in summer, often act as a chemical transducer of the effects of seasonal changes in night-length on animals' behavior and physiology. Cells in sites that regulate seasonal behaviors, such as those associated with breeding, appear to possess melatonin receptors and interval timing mechanisms that enable them to detect melatonin and measure the duration of the nightly interval when it is present. These sites then trigger changes that are appropriate for the season that is indexed by the measured length of the interval.",

As to the potential of causing interactions, special attention has to be given to the SSRI's because of their interference with the CYP450 isozyme system. Therapeutic monotoring is recommended for the TCA's. The choiseforan antidepressant should be based on various factors like symptomatology and severity of the depression, potential interactions and somatic and/or psychiatric comorbidity. Extensive clinical research has demonstrated that TCA's are the most effective for major depression with melancholia (vital depression) and depressive disorders in the elderly.",

This means that the average patient getting an antidepressant has less pain than 74% of the patients getting a placebo. However because of selective drop-out and the use of psychometri-cally inadequate pain scales, this may be an over-estimation. Real analgesic qualities of antidepressive agents seem to offer the most plausible explanation for the effect, but the importance of serotonin reuptake blocking is not confirmed. A main objection, however, is that in all studies the depression variable was insufficiently controlled at inclusion. Because both the estimation of the effect size as the explanation of the effect are confounded with methodological doubts, it is concluded that further studies need to be done to overcome these difficulties.",

The second application implies that ERP's may be used to increase the theoretical understanding of specific mental processes such as attention, memory and linguistic processes and the degree of impairment of these processes in psychiatric patients. Some examples derived from recent studies of dementia and aging are given of these two applications of ERP's.",

Insomnia and hyper-somnolence occur in more than 50% of shift workers, mainly in association with the night shift. Circadian rhythm disruption is the major determinant of these disorders. Furthermore they are frequently associated with psycho-social problems and somatic diseases. In more than 20% of the shift workers problems are so pronounced, that they fail to adapt to the rotating schedules. This is defined as 'shift maladaptation syndrome'.",

The method of limit-setting involves the reality testing of the patient, the transference reactions between patient and staff, clarity in decision-making and regulations, and architectural arrangements. These four levels of influence are separately discussed.",

Variability is an essential aspect of normal functioning. Primary or indiscriminate variability consists of the development of many strategies for the execution of motor acts. It is predominant during fetal age and infancy. Toddler age is characterized by secondary or adaptive variability, which reflects the ability to select the adequate strategy at the right moment. This is important for the development of proper planning of movement patterns and is a prerequisite for skill development. Recognition of the types and quality of variability helps to detect developmental disorders at an early age.",

Three distinct mitogens were used, i.e. phytohemaglutinin (PHA), pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and concanavalin A (CON A). We found that major depressives with associated features showed significantly lower mitogen induced lymphocyte responses to PHA and PWM as compared to all other depressed patients. The severity of illness was significantly inversely related to the lymphocyte responses to PHA. Cortisol nonsuppressors exhibited significantly lower PHA and PWM induced lymphocyte responses as compared with suppressors. There were significant and negative correlations between the postdexamethasone Cortisol values and the PHA and PWM stimulated lymphocyte responses.",

    "abstract": "Three principles of neuronal interaction within cortically distributed networks are discussed PET-rCBF activation methods provide an opportunity to acquire insight in the distribution of functionally related areas of the human brain in vivo. The distinction of visual areas, activated by either motion or color within an observed scenery, points at a segregation in neuronal information processing. Such a segregation extends into both a dorsal and a ventral route towards consequently the parietal and temporal cortex. Simultaneous activation over the dorsal and ventral route, which for example occurs in relation to the perception of complex motion (optic flow), or motion perception after lesion of V5, suggests integration by means of cross-connectivity. The third principle, i.e. ''top-down'' integration, appears by analysis of V5-V1 interaction, attentional effects on V4, frontal activation in prosapagnosia, and by analysis of hallucinations. Such ''top-down'' integration indicates the presence of momentaneous effect on cortical areas, intimately related to the primary sensory cortex, by neuronal activity of re,note ''association'' cortex, the latter being connected by direct (synaps-restricted) bypass from early stations of information processing.",

    "abstract": "Deze aflevering gaat over een probleem van naamgeving. Door de recente trends op het gebied van de indicatiestelling van psychofarmaca worden we meer en meer in de war gebracht. Uit het verloop van dit verhaal zult u wel zien waarom en de vraag is of u de redactie van advies wilt en kunt dienen. In de meeste farmacologische textboeken worden de psychofarmaca ingedeeld naar de klinische werking, zoais u weet, en drie hoofdgroepen worden onder-scheiden: de psychoanaleptica, de psycholeptica en de psychodysleptica. Hier zullen we ons beperken tot de eerste twee groepen. Tot de belangrijkste typen farmaca van de eerste groep worden de antidepressiva en soms de lithiumzouten gerekend en tot de tweede groep behoren de ataractica (zoals de ben-zodiazepinen) en de antipsychotica. Hoe verhoudt zieh zo'n indeling ten opzichte van andere farmaco-therapeutische indelingen in de geneeskunde: worden eiders farmaca gerubrieeerd volgens de klinische indicaties of volgens de primaire aangrijpingspunten c.q. chemische karakteristie-ken? Soms volgt de indeling het werkingsprineipe, dan weer het ziektebeeld of symptoom, waarbij het middel het meest wordt toegepast.",

    "abstract": "A magnetoencephalogram (MEG) is the registration of the magnetic field in points near the head. Because MEG's are weak fields, they have to be measured by means of superconducting sensors. The electric active population of neurons can be computed from the distribution of the magnetic field at a certain instant of time. This is called the inverse problem. In order to solve this probem, both the generators and the head have to be modelled. Usually, a patch of active neurons is modelled as a current dipole. Commonly, the head is described by three compartments, representing the brain, the skull and the scalp. The compartments may have the shape of spheres or they may have a realistic shape. Integration of EEG and MEG with MRI leads to a technique for functional imaging of the brain with a time resolution of one millisecond and a spatial resolution of one centimetre. Clinical applications are the non-invasive localization of an epileptic focus or the presurgical mapping of the sensorimotor cortex.",

It is seldom mentioned that the dystonie reaction may be combined with hallucinations. This combination of acute dystonia with hallucinations may be explained by overstimulation of dopamine-receptors in the striatal neurons. Awareness of these hallucinations as a complication of neuroleptics is essential to prevent that neuroleptic dose will be increased; instead it must be lowered. Prevention of the dystonia is critical. These side effects may be suppressed with anti-parkinsonian drugs. Information to the patient in due time may prevent anxiety about the side effects.",

Fasting, 8 a.m. plasma levels of Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were determined before and after administration of 1 mg dexamethasone. In 64 subjects multisequential (1-17,1-24,1-39) ACTH, and in 47 subjects intact (1-39) ACTH has been determined. Patients with melancholia exhibited significantly higher postdexamethasone Cortisol and intact ACTH values as compared with minor and simple major depressives. Severity of illness was significantly and positively related to postdexamethasone intact ACTH - but not to multisequential ACTH. Cortisol nonsuppressors showed higher postdexamethasone (only intact) ACTH values than Cortisol suppressors. Both postdexamethasone ACTH values were significantly and positively related with the postdexamethasone Cortisol values. We have established that Cortisol nonsuppression during melancholia is determined by an augmented escape of ACTH from suppression by dexamethasone. Intact ACTH showed the most significant clinical relevance for depression and Cortisol nonsuppression. In the clinical practice we advize the use of postdexamethasone intact ACTH in stead of plasma Cortisol or multisequential ACTH.",

In the case of insufficient efficacy or adverse effects the first alternative for lithium in acute mania is carbamazepine. However, the role of carbamazepine in preventive treatment is still uncertain. Well designed prospective research is hardly done. Clearly positive reports on the efficacy of carbamazepine concern specific lithium-resistant groups such as the ‘rapid-cyclers’. Valproic acid has been found effective in a few studies in bipolar disorders, especially in acute mania. Clonazepam is sometimes mentioned as a possible alternative, however recent research seriously questions the efficacy of clonazepam in bipolar disorders.

Fifteen clinical trials (353 patients), published between 1969 and 1987. were found, that can be described, as to their design, in two seperate groups: One group (7 studies) administers thyroid hormone simultaneously with a tricyclic antidepressant to reach a faster effect of the antidepressant. The other group (8 studies) adds thyroid hormone to a tricyclic antidepressant in patients who fail to respond to this treatment, with the aim to convert therapeutic failure to success. After studying the literature we think we are able to conclude that it can be usefull to combine the antidepressant with thyroid hormone in view of the fact that, in a number of depressed patients, it shortens the duration of the illness. The augmentation of tricyclics by thyroid hormone needs further study.",

Lithium has an anti-TSH-effect on the thyroid gland by inhibiting the intracellular enzyme adenylate cyclase. This might cause hypothyroidism. Moreover, lithium is also known to have a direct stabilizing effect on (behavioral manifestations) of dopamine receptor supersensitivity. The hypothesis regarding the relation between thyroid function and affective disturbances is that the altered thyroid function may cause a change in the availability of the central dopamine receptors. Dopamine is known to be able to cause a manic state. TSH and TRH are also involved in this mechanism. It is, therefore, very likely that an increased thyroid function, whether or not caused by discontinuation of lithium-therapy, could induce a (recurrent) mania.",

However when after two weeks the lithium dose was reduced to 600 mg a day (lithium plasmalevel 0.5 mmol/l), an almost immediate relapse followed. On resuming lithium in the old dose the depression disappeared again. After four weeks the second attempt at reducing and eventually stopping the lithium appeared to be successful. Half a year after cessation of lithium imipramine was also stopped. More than a year afterwards there hasn't been a depression again. In this case, after a fast potentiation of imipramine by lithium, a relapse followed when the lithium dose was reduced.

Interactional processes were defined on the basis of directly observed behaviour displayed during an interview and by the use of ethological methods. The behavioural structure of such interaction could be described by 6-7 factors. Some of these factors could predict the clinical course of depression, over an interval of tien weeks. The patients who would not improve displayed before treatment (just after admission) more involvement (i.e., looking, gesticulating) coinciding with more general activation (leg and hand movements) than the patients who would improve. The psychiatrist displayed relatively high levels of involvement (encouragement: hm, hm, yes, yes, and yes-nodding) and low levels of general activation (hand movements) in his interaction with patients who would not improve. The results provide support for interactional theories of depression.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated that psychomotor retardation is an important sign of the major depressive episode, both from a diagnostic point of view and as a predictor of treatment outcome. However, it is uncertain to what extent psychomotor retardation is specific for the major depressive episode. A heterogeneous group of psychiatric patients (n=26) was studied using a rating scale developed specifically to assess psychomotor retardation (RRS). The 13 patients suffering from a major depressive episode had a significantly higher RRS score than patients with another diagnosis. Furthermore, in the depressive subjects the severity of the depression (measured by means of Hamilton's depression rating scale) appeared to correlate with the severity of the psychomotor retardation. Cognitive features of psychomotor retardation were mainly responsible for the more severe psychomotor retardation in the depressive patients. Surprisingly. Hamilton's depression scale which was used in this study does not pay much attention to these aspects.",

These large differences are likely due to differences in the workingmechanisms. In view of the clinical relevance of these findings it is therefore both justified and essential to subdivide the neuroleptics in two distinct groups: the classical neuroleptics and the atypical neuroleptics.",

    "abstract": "Summary The last two decades have witnessed an upsurge in the interest in anxiety disorders. Much research effort has been dedicated to panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. However, it is only very recently that we have begun to understand some of the basic principles about the psychopharmacology of social phobia. Drug classes so far studied include beta-blockers, non-selective and irreversible MAO-inhibitors (MAOI's) and benzodiazepinen. Beta-blockers appear to be of use in specific social phobias, like public speaking. There is considerable evidence suggesting that MAOI's are effective in reducing both social anxiety as well as social avoidance. A disadvantage of the conventional irreversible MAOI's is their risk for hypertensive crises when combined with dietary tyramine. So far only a small number of studies with selective MAOI-A inhibitors such as moclobemide and brofaromine have been conducted in social phobia, and the results indicate that both compounds are effective. Drugs exerting selective and specific actions on certain components of e.g. the serotonergic system can now be studied and it is hoped that the role of serotonin and other neuronal systems in social phobia can be elucidated. In order to gain more information about selective serotonergic drugs the first double blind placebo-controlled study with fluvoxamine in social phobia is here reported. Preliminary results indicate a reduction of social anxiety. Finally the role of peptides in the treatment of social phobia is critically reviewed. The MSH/ACTH analog Org 2766 was investigated in patients suffering from social phobia. No anxiolytic effects of this peptide could be observed.",

Subjects were randomly allocated to two of the four dosage groups and tested on two separate occasions, one week apart, using a double-blind incomplete block design. A total of 59 intravenous injections were carried out. The panic rate with pentagastrin, irrespective of the dosage, was 55% (12/22) for patients and 5% (1/22) for controls. None of the subjects panicked with saline. The frequency of panic attacks between the three pentagastrin doses in patients was not different. One control subject had a panic-like attack at the highest dose of pentagastrin. These findings concur with previous studies on the panicogenic effect of CCK 4 and pentagastrin and suggest a greater sensitivity for CCK agonists in patients suffering from panic disorder than in healthy controls.",

The dysregulation of the serotonergic system as a consequence of the increased intracerebral tryptophan uptake is described as one of the most important pathogenetic mechanisms. The elevated intracerebral ammoniac concentration and the elevated intracerebral glutamine synthesis play in this a facilitating role. The similarity in symptomatology of the clinical picture of HE and the serotonergic syndrome support this hypothesis.

The clinical presentation and consequences in adults differ considerably from the often benign dysfunction in childhood. We present a case of incubus in a patient suffering from recurrent unipolar affective psychosis (type mania). The polysomnographic features are discussed and the differentiation from other paroxysmal amnestic conditions is emphasized. Pathophysiology encompasses a Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) arousal disorder probably related to a serotoninergic dysfunction. The relationship withpsychopa-thology is discussed.",

Vaak zullen zaken uit de literatuur worden behandeld. De gekozen onderwerpen dienen altijd klinische relevantie te hebben. Ook zal deze rubriek gaan over gewoontes die in psychofarmakologische behandeling of in onderzoek zijn geslopen die volgens de auteur lang niet altijd logisch zijn. Soms zal deze rubriek een oproep bevatten om te reageren op een bijdrage gepubliceerd in dit of in een ander tijdschrift. Ook zal de lezer worden aangemoedigd hier zijn eigen ervaringen mee te delen. Het is niet de bedoeling in deze rubriek onderzoeken uitvoerig te rapporteren. Daarvoor staan andere pagina's van de Acta Neuropsychiatrica voor u open.",

    "abstract": "Sinds mensenheugenis wordt dementie gevreesd als een ziekte van de ouderdom. Dementie treedt vooral op bij zestigers en zeventigers en wel bij meer dan 10%. Demente bejaarden kunnen moeilijk iets nieuws leren. Wat ook opvalt is een algemene traagheid: misschien worden daardoor leerproblemen en vergeetachtigheid zo centraal gezien. De bekendste vormen van dementie zijn de ziekte van Alzheimer en de multi-infarct dementie (MID). Als puntje bij paaltje komt, blijken de histopathologische kenmerken van MID (diffuus of juist strategische gelegen infarcten) weinig te worden gevonden, misschien omdat een mogelijk kenmerk van MID, n1. verdwenen zenuwcellen uit het CA1-gebied van de hippocampus, niet gezien werden. In proefdiermodellen leidt milde ischaemie tot beschadiging van deze cellen en tot siechte leerprestaties; reden genoeg om deze pathologie in verband te brengen met dementie.",
