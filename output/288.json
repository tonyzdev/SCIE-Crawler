    "abstract": "We discuss how to obtain black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) using the asymptotic iteration method (AIM), initially developed to solve second-order ordinary differential equations. We introduce the standard version of this method and present an improvement more suitable for numerical implementation. We demonstrate that the AIM can be used to find radial QNMs for Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström (RN), and Kerr black holes in a unified way. We discuss some advantages of the AIM over the continued fractions method (CFM). This paper presents for the first time the spin 0, 1/2 and 2 QNMs of a Kerr black hole and the gravitational and electromagnetic QNMs of the RN black hole calculated via the AIM and confirms results previously obtained using the CFM. We also present some new results comparing the AIM to the WKB method. Finally we emphasize that the AIM is well suited to higher-dimensional generalizations and we give an example of doubly rotating black holes.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) modelling unsteady boundary-layer flows are solved by the spectral relaxation method (SRM) and the spectral quasilinearization method (SQLM). The SRM and SQLM are Chebyshev pseudospectral based methods that have been successfully used to solve nonlinear boundary layer flow problems described by systems of ordinary differential equations. In this paper application of these methods is extended, for the first time, to systems of nonlinear PDEs that model unsteady boundary layer flow. The new extension is tested on two problems: boundary layer flow caused by an impulsively stretching plate and a coupled four-equation system that models the problem of unsteady MHD flow and mass transfer in a porous space. Numerous simulation experiments are conducted to determine the accuracy and compare the computational performance of the proposed methods against the popular Keller-box finite difference scheme which is widely accepted as being one of the ideal tools for solving nonlinear PDEs that model boundary layer flow problems. The results indicate that the methods are more efficient in terms of computational accuracy and speed compared with the Keller-box.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the effect of electromagnetic force with the effect of thermal radiation on the Williamson nanofluid on a stretching surface through a porous medium was studied considering the effect of both heat generation/absorption and Joule heating. On the other hand, the effect of Brownian motion and thermophoresis coefficients was considered. The system of nonlinear partial differential equations governing the study of fluid flow has transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations and nondimensional variables which were subsequently solved numerically by using the Rung-Kutta fourth-order method with shooting technique. Moreover, the effect of the resulting physical parameters on the distributions of velocity, temperature, and concentration of nanoparticles has been studied by using graphical forms with an interest in providing physical meanings to each parameter. Finally, special diagrams were made to explain the study of the effect of some physical parameters on the skin friction coefficient and the local Nusselt number; these results led to reinforcement in the values of the skin friction coefficient for the increased values of the magnetic field and the Darcy number while the effect on the local Nusselt number by thermal radiation as well as the heat generation/absorption coefficients became negative.",

We present a detailed analysis of the resulting theory and show that it has reasonable properties on both classical and quantum level. We describe a number of applications and show how the vector model clarifies some issues presented in theoretical description of a relativistic spin: (A) one-particle relativistic quantum mechanics with positive energies and its relation with the Dirac equation and with relativistic Zitterbewegung ; (B) spin-induced noncommutativity and the problem of covariant formalism; (C) three-dimensional acceleration consistent with coordinate-independence of the speed of light in general relativity and rainbow geometry seen by spinning particle; (D) paradoxical behavior of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon equations of a rotating body in ultrarelativistic limit, and equations with improved behavior.",

    "abstract": "The present work deals with the investigation of the time‐fractional Klein–Gordon (K‐G) model, which has great importance in theoretical physics with applications in various fields, including quantum mechanics and field theory. The main motivation of this work is to analyze modulation instability and soliton solution of the time‐fractional K‐G model. Comparative studies are investigated by β ‐fraction derivative and M ‐fractional derivative. For this purpose, we used unified and advanced exp(− ϕ ( ξ ))‐expansion approaches that are highly important tools to solve the fractional model and are used to create nonlinear wave pattern (both solitary and periodic wave) solutions for the time‐fractional K‐G model. For the special values of constraints, the periodic waves, lumps with cross‐periodic waves, periodic rogue waves, singular soliton, bright bell shape, dark bell shape, kink and antikink shape, and periodic wave behaviors are some of the outcomes attained from the obtained analytic solutions. The acquired results will be useful in comprehending the time‐fractional K‐G model’s dynamical framework concerning associated physical events. By giving specific values to the fractional parameters, graphs are created to compare the fractional effects for the β ‐fraction derivative and M ‐fractional derivative. Additionally, the modulation instability spectrum is expressed utilizing a linear analysis technique, and the modulation instability bands are shown to be influenced by the third‐order dispersion. The findings indicate that the modulation instability disappears for negative values of the fourth order in a typical dispersion regime. Consequently, it was shown that the techniques mentioned previously could be an effective tool to generate unique, precise soliton solutions for numerous uses, which are crucial to theoretical physics. This work provided the effect of the recently updated two fraction forms, and in the future, we will integrate the space–time M ‐fractional form of the governing model by using the extended form of the Kudryashov method. Maple 18 is utilized as the simulation tool.",

They are interesting materials due to not only their electromechanical applications as transducers but also to their electrochemical features and the relationship between the ionic/solvent current and the potential field. Their electrochemical properties thus suggest the possibility for exploiting them as compact fractional-order elements (FOEs) with a view of defining fabrication processes and production strategies that assure the desired performances. In this paper, the experimental electrical characterization of a brand new IPMC setup in a fixed sandwich configuration is proposed. Two IPMC devices with different platinum absorption times (5 h and 20 h) are characterized through experimental data: first, a preliminary linearity study is performed for a fixed input voltage amplitude in order to determine the frequency region where IPMC can be approximated as linear; then, a frequency analysis is carried out in order to identify a coherent fractional-order dynamics in the bode diagrams. Such analyses take the first steps towards a simplified model of IPMC as a compact electronic FOE for which the fractional exponent value depends on fabrication parameters as the absorption time.",

The latter algebra is the semi-direct sum of infinitesimal supertranslations with the conformal Killing vectors of the Riemann sphere.

Cross‐fluid is the best model to investigate the fluid flow at a very high and very low share rate. There are three nanoparticles that are added in based fluid (water) to form the requisite posited ternary hybrid nanofluid. Moreover, heat transport analysis is scrutinized by incorporating the melting conditions. The obtained nonlinear system of partial differential equations (PDEs) from assumed physical assumption is converted into the nonlinear setup of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These ODEs are passed under the boundary value problem of a fourth‐order (bvp4c) MATLAB program for numerical results. With the help of bvp4c, data are further trained through an artificial neural network and results are predicted. Results are compared with both techniques and found smooth agreement. The obtained numerical results provide valuable insight for optimizing heat transfer processes involving nanoparticle‐enhanced fluid on inclined shrinking sheets. From the results, it is concluded that the inclusion of nanoparticles enhances the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid. High temperatures make rapid heat transfer scenarios.",

The equation represents wave group dynamics in numerous physical systems, involving quantum Hall and nonlinear optical structures. To attain exact solutions, we utilize the generalized exponential rational function (GERF) method and the Paul‐Painlevé (PP) approach, revealing a various set of optical soliton solutions, containing exponential, hyperbolic, and trigonometric function‐based solitons. By utilizing suitable parametric values, we provide 3D, 2D, and contour visualizations to demonstrate the soliton characteristics. Moreover, a comprehensive sensitivity and modulation stability analysis is carried out, presenting the impact of parametric alteration on soliton behavior. The findings exhibit the emergence of dark, bright, and periodic soliton solutions, which play a key role in understanding nonlinear wave propagation in topological and optical systems. The novelty of this work lies in enhancing the study of chiral soliton within the Bohm potential framework, yielding new observations into their stability, modulation, and structural properties.",

One of the important perturbation techniques MS (multiple scales) is utilized to achieve the approximate analytical solutions of these equations and to identify the resonances of the system. Besides, the amplitude and the phase variables are renowned to study the steady-state solutions and to recognize their stability conditions. The time history for the attained solutions and the projections of the phase plane are presented to interpret the behavior of the dynamical system.

In this paper, the fractional complex Ginzburg-Landau model is investigated using the generalized exponential rational function method.

The fractional effects are also included using a novel local fractional derivative of order <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>α</mi> </math> . Many novel solutions containing trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, and exponential functions are acquired using the generalized exponential rational function method. The 3D-surface graphs, 2D-contour graphs, density graphs, and 2D-line graphs of some retrieved solutions are plotted using Maple software. A variety of exact traveling wave solutions are reported including dark, bright, and kink soliton solutions. The nature of the optical solitons is demonstrated through the graphical representations of the acquired solutions for variation in the fractional order of derivative. It is hoped that the acquired solutions will aid in understanding the dynamics of the various physical phenomena and dynamical processes governed by the considered model.",

    "abstract": "The current study examined the effects of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on time-dependent mixed convection flow of an exothermic fluid in a vertical channel. Convective heating and Navier’s slip conditions are considered. The dimensional nonlinear flow equations are transformed into dimensionless form with suitable transformation. For steady-state flow formations, we apply homotopy perturbation approach. However, for the unsteady-state governing equation, we use numerical technique known as the implicit finite difference approach. Flow is influenced by several factors, including the Hartmann number, Newtonian heating, Navier slip parameter, Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, and mixed convection parameter. Shear stress and heat transfer rates were also investigated and reported. The steady-state and unsteady-state solutions are visually expressed in terms of velocity and temperature profiles. Due to the presence of opposing force factors such as the Lorentz force, the research found that the Hartmann number reduces the momentum profile. Fluid temperature and velocity increase as the thermal Biot number and Frank-Kamenetskii parameter increase. There are several scientific and infrastructure capabilities that use this type of flow, such flow including solar communication systems exposed to airflow, electronic devices cooled at room temperature by airflow, nuclear units maintained during unscheduled shutoffs, and cooling systems occurring in low circumstances. The current findings and the literature are very consistent, which recommend the application of the current study.",

The numerical solutions are investigated using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithms through Matlab packages. These solutions are represented graphically in order to describe and discuss the behavior of the body at any instant for different values of the physical parameters of the body. The obtained results have been discussed and compared with some previous published works. Some concluding remarks have been presented at the end of this work.

The researchers utilize an implicit finite difference scheme, namely the Crank–Nicolson method, to tackle complex fuzzy heat equations. The problem’s fuzziness arises from the coefficients in both amplitude and phase terms, as well as in the initial and boundary conditions, with the Convex normalized triangular fuzzy numbers extended to the unit disk in the complex plane. The researchers take advantage of the properties and benefits of CFS theory in the proposed numerical methods and subsequently provide a new proof of the stability under CFS theory.

    "abstract": "Thermal diffusion is a phenomenon where the concentration gradient or diffusive flux is created due to the temperature gradient. Thermal diffusion is induced because of the higher temperature and uneven distribution of the mixture. Formally, thermal diffusion is called the Soret effect, and it is a crucial factor in a number of natural occurrences like the separation of isotopes technique of purification. In this research paper, Maxwell fluid’s flow in the vicinage of a flat plate is discussed by considering the effect of the thermodiffusion subject to the first-order slip at the boundary with the application of a constant proportional Caputo (CPC) fractional derivative. The effect of heat generation and radiation is also taken into consideration, as well as the effect of a magnetic field of constant magnitude. The generalized heat and mass fluxes are considered, and this generalization of heat and mass fluxes is done by utilizing the CPC fractional derivative. After converting the current model’s governing equations into a dimensionless form, the temperature, concentration, and velocity fields’ analytical solutions are found. By drawing graphs of the temperature, concentration, and velocity fields for the parametric modifications, the results are graphically illustrated. It becomes clear from the results discussion that the outcomes produced by the constant proportional derivative are more decaying than those obtained with the classical differential operator of order one.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the impact of Soret and Dufour effects on an magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) variable‐viscosity Casson nanofluid over a stretching sheet with heat generation and absorption. The Buongiorno model is employed to incorporate nanoparticle properties such as Brownian motion and thermophoresis. The governing equations are transformed into first‐order ordinary differential equations, and an analytical solution is obtained using the homotopy analysis method with the BVPh2.0 package in Mathematica. Numerical results reveal that velocity profiles increase with the Soret and Dufour effects, variable viscosity, Casson characteristics, and heat generation and absorption but decrease with the Lewis number and Forchheimer coefficient. Temperature profiles rise with the Dufour number, heat generation and absorption, and variable viscosity, while they decline with the Se number, Casson factor, and stretching parameter. Similarly, concentration profiles exhibit opposing trends, increasing with the Forchheimer coefficient, Soret number, and Casson factor while decreasing with the Dufour number, variable viscosity, and heat generation and absorption. The results highlight significant parameter‐driven variations in transport properties. An increase in the Casson parameter reduces the skin friction coefficient by 40.95%, enhances heat transfer by 15.63%, and decreases mass transfer by 6.72%, indicating a shift toward Newtonian‐like behavior. The Darcy number lowers skin friction by 18.44% and boosts heat transfer by 23.03%, confirming improved permeability‐driven fluid motion. The magnetic parameter slightly increases skin friction by 0.40%, while the Prandtl number enhances heat transfer by 18.36%. The variable viscosity parameter plays a critical role, reducing skin friction by 28.92%, decreasing heat transfer by 34.32%, and increasing mass transfer by 24.86%. Additionally, the Eckert number significantly reduces heat transfer due to viscous dissipation, whereas the radiation parameter enhances both heat and mass transfer. These findings provide valuable insights into fluid transport mechanisms, with applications in industrial and biomedical systems requiring optimized thermal and mass transport. A comparative analysis with existing literature validates the robustness of the results.",

In addition to maintaining consistency in adjusted electrical parameters, a detailed methodology is proposed to build the equivalent circuits. Illustrative examples are given and the Nyquist and Bode graphs are obtained from the numerical simulation of the corresponding transfer functions using arbitrary electrical parameters in order to illustrate the methodology. The advantage of our representation appears according to the comparison between our model and models presented in the paper, which are not physically acceptable due to the dimensional incompatibility. The Markovian nature of the models is recovered when the order of the fractional derivatives is equal to 1.",

In the proposed method, classical bits of the speech samples are initially encoded in nonorthogonal quantum state by the secret polarizing angle. In the quantum domain, encoded speech samples are subjected to bit-flip operation according to the Controlled–NOT gate followed by Hadamard transform. Complete superposition of the quantum state in both Hadamard and standard basis is achieved through Hadamard transform.

Aiming at the calculation error caused by the loading direction deviation of the Brazilian disc splitting method, a mechanical model of a disc under chord loading was constructed firstly. Based on the theory of complex variable function, the analytic solutions of stresses in a circular disc were deduced, and the calculation error of the tensile strength under chord loading was characterized by defining the error impact rate. And the stress distribution of a disc and the law of rock fracture under chord loading were detailed analyzed through numerical calculation. Through numerical calculation, the stress distribution of the disc and rock failure law under chordwise loading are discussed in detail. The results show that the stress concentration near the loading point is stronger under the chordwise loading comparing with the radial loading, which makes the disc more vulnerable to produce compression failure near the loading point. The disc exhibits a maximum tensile stress and a minimum compressive stress at the intersection of the loaded string and the horizontal diameter, so that tensile rupture damage is likely to occur here. With the increase of deviation angle, the tensile strength measured by the Brazilian splitting test decreases gradually, and the influence rate of error increases significantly. The proposed analytical solution under chord loading provides theoretical guiding significance for nonradial splitting failure of a disc.",

Two measures of averaging over time and connection between them are analyzed. The results of the study of time as a quantum observable in the cases of the discrete energy spectra are also presented, and in this case the quasi‐self‐adjoint time operator appears. Then, the general foundations of time analysis of quantum processes (collisions and decays) are developed on the base of time operator with the proper measures of averaging over time.

Singularities appear due to ill-behaviour of gauge fixing conditions, one example being the gauge in which theory is classically equivalent to standard General Relativity. The main conclusions of our analysis are: (1) singularities signal a phase transition from broken to unbroken phase of Weyl symmetry, (2) instead of a singularity there is a \"baby-universe\" or a white hole inside a black hole, (3) in the baby universe scenario there is a critical mass after which reducing mass makes black hole larger as viewed by outside observers, (4) if a black hole could be connected with white hole through the \"singularity\", this would require breakdown of (classical) geometric description, (5) the singularity of Schwarzschild BH solution is non-generic and so it is dangerous to rely on it in deriving general results. Our results may have important consequences for resolving issues related to information-loss puzzle. The theory we use is basically a completion of General Relativity, containing neither additional physical excitations nor higher-derivative terms, but requires physical scalar field such as Higgs field of Standard Model. Though quantum effects are still crucial and may change the proposed classical picture, a position of building quantum theory around essentially regular classical solutions normally provides a much better starting point.",

The main advantage of OHAM is that it does not require any small perturbations, linearization, or discretization and many reductions of the computations. Here, the proposed approach’s reliability and efficiency are demonstrated by two applications of one-dimensional motion of a viscous fluid in a tube governed by the flow field by converting them to time-fractional Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates using fractional derivatives in the sense of Caputo. For the first problem, OHAM provides the exact solution, and for the second problem, it performs a highly accurate numerical approximation of the solution compare with the exact solution. The presented simulation results of OHAM comparison with analytical and numerical approaches reveal that the method is an efficient technique to simulate the solution of time-fractional types of Navier-Stokes equation.",

    "abstract": "The present analysis is aimed at examining MHD micropolar nanofluid flow past a radially stretchable rotating disk with the Cattaneo-Christov non-Fourier heat and non-Fick mass flux model. To begin with, the model is developed in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for momentum, microrotation, thermal, and concentration with their boundary conditions. Employing suitable similarity transformation, the boundary layer micropolar nanofluid flows governing these PDEs are transformed into large systems of dimensionless coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These dimensionless ODEs are solved numerically by means of the spectral local linearization method (SLLM). The consequences of more noticeable involved parameters on different flow fields and engineering quantities of interest are thoroughly inspected, and the results are presented via graph plots and tables. The obtained results confirm that SLLM is a stable, accurate, convergent, and computationally very efficient method to solve a large coupled system of equations. The radial velocity grows while the tangential velocity, temperature, and concentration distributions turn down as the value of the radial stretching parameter improves, and hence, in practical applications, radial stretching of the disk is helpful to advance the cooling process of the rotating disk. The occurrence of microrotation viscosity in microrotation parameters ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <msub> <mrow> <mi>A</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> <mo>−</mo> <msub> <mrow> <mi>A</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>6</mn> </mrow> </msub> </math> ) declines the radial velocity profile, and the kinetic energy of the fluid is reduced to some extent far away from the surface of the disk. The novelty of the study is the consideration of microscopic effects occurring from the micropolar fluid elements such as micromotion and couple stress, the effects of non-Fourier’s heat and non-Fick’s mass flux, and the effect of radial stretching disk on micropolar nanofluid flow, heat, and mass transfer.",

The flow equations transform into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using a similarity transformation. Subsequently, the system is numerically solved using the MATLAB software’s 4th-order accuracy boundary value problem solver, known as “bvp4c”. Numeric findings reveal that skin friction values exhibit variations based on the magnitude of the stretching/shrinking parameter. Moreover, in the specific context of the flow problem being studied, the heat conduction efficiency of the hybrid (ternary) nanofluid surpasses that of the hybrid nanofluid. The system yields two distinct solutions within a specific shrinking/stretching parameter interval. Through an examination of the temporal stability of the solutions, it was determined that only one remained stable over an extended period.

Due to the complex dynamic nature of these nanoparticles, a time-consuming calibration measurement has to be performed prior to image reconstruction. During the calibration a small delta sample filled with the particle suspension is measured at all positions in the field of view where the particle distribution will be reconstructed. Recently, it has been shown that the calibration procedure can be significantly shortened by sampling the field of view only at few randomly chosen positions and applying compressed sensing to reconstruct the full MPI system matrix. The purpose of this work is to reduce the number of necessary calibration scans even further. To this end, we take into account symmetries of the MPI system matrix and combine this knowledge with the compressed sensing method. Experiments on 2D MPI data show that the combination of symmetry and compressed sensing allows reducing the number of calibration scans compared to the pure compressed sensing approach by a factor of about three.",

For reconstructing a spatial map of the particle distribution, the system matrix describing the magnetic particle imaging equation has to be known. Due to the complex dynamic behavior of the magnetic particles, the system matrix is commonly measured in a calibration procedure. In order to speed up the reconstruction process, recently, a matrix compression technique has been proposed that makes use of a basis transformation in order to compress the MPI system matrix. By thresholding the resulting matrix and storing the remaining entries in compressed row storage format, only a fraction of the data has to be processed when reconstructing the particle distribution. In the present work, it is shown that the image quality of the algorithm can be considerably improved by using a local threshold for each matrix row instead of a global threshold for the entire system matrix.",

The exact expression for the fluid velocity is obtained in terms of the exponential function, while an effective analytical procedure is suggested and successfully applied to obtain the exact temperature in terms of the generalized incomplete gamma function. It is found in this paper that the Cu-water nanofluid is slower than the TiO 2 -water nanofluid for both cases of the stretching/shrinking sheets. However, the temperature of the Cu-water nanofluid is always higher than the temperature of the TiO 2 -water nanofluid. In the case of shrinking sheet the dual solutions have been obtained at particular values of the physical parameters. In addition, the effect of various physical parameters on such dual solutions is discussed through the graphs.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth study and analysis of the image feature extraction technique for ancient ceramic identification using an algorithm of partial differential equations. Image features of ancient ceramics are closely related to specific raw material selection and process technology, and complete acquisition of image features of ancient ceramics is a prerequisite for achieving image feature identification of ancient ceramics, since the quality of extracted area-grown ancient ceramic image feature extraction method is closely related to the background pixels and does not have generalizability. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based extraction method, using Eased as a deep learning support platform, to extract and validate 5834 images of 272 types of ancient ceramics from kilns, celadon, and Yue kilns after manual labelling and training learning, and the results show that the average complete extraction rate is higher than 99%. The implementation of the deep learning method is summarized and compared with the traditional region growth extraction method, and the results show that the method is robust with the increase of the learning amount and has generalizability, which is a new method to effectively achieve the complete image feature extraction of ancient ceramics. The main content of the finite difference method is to use the ratio of the difference between the function values of two adjacent points and the distance between the two points to approximate the partial derivative of the function with respect to the variable. This idea was used to turn the problem of division into a problem of difference. Recognition of ancient ceramic image features was realized based on the extraction of the overall image features of ancient ceramics, the extraction and recognition of vessel type features, the quantitative recognition of multidimensional feature fusion ornamentation image features, and the implementation of deep learning based on inscription model recognition image feature classification recognition method; three-layer B/S architecture web application system and cross-platform system language called as the architectural support; and database services, deep learning packaging, and digital image processing. The specific implementation method is based on database service, deep learning encapsulation, digital image processing, and third-party invocation, and the service layer fusion and relearning mechanism is proposed to achieve the preliminary intelligent recognition system of ancient ceramic vessel type and ornament image features. The results of the validation test meet the expectation and verify the effectiveness of the ancient ceramic vessel type and ornament image feature recognition system.",

    "abstract": "We present a geometric framework to analyze optimal control problems of uncoupled spin 1/2 particles occurring in nuclear magnetic resonance. According to the Pontryagin's maximum principle, the optimal trajectories are solutions of a pseudo-Hamiltonian system. This computation is completed by sufficient optimality conditions based on the concept of conjugate points related to Lagrangian singularities. This approach is applied to analyze two relevant optimal control issues in NMR: the saturation control problem, that is, the problem of steering in minimum time a single spin 1/2 particle from the equilibrium point to the zero magnetization vector, and the contrast imaging problem. The analysis is completed by numerical computations and experimental results.",

This electromagnetic problem is reduced to the nonlinear boundary eigenvalue problem for ordinary differential equations. It is necessary to find eigenvalues of the problem (propagation constants of an electromagnetic wave). The dispersion equation (DE) for the eigenvalues is derived. The DE is applied to nonlinear metamaterial as well. Comparison with a linear case is also made. In the nonlinear problem there are new eigenvalues and new eigenwaves.

    "abstract": "Most quantum logics do not allow for a reasonable calculus of conditional probability. However, those ones which do so provide a very general and rich mathematical structure, including classical probabilities, quantum mechanics as well as Jordan algebras. This structure exhibits some similarities with Alfsen and Shultz's non-commutative spectral theory, but these two mathematical approaches are not identical. Barnum, Emerson and Ududec adapted the concept of higher-order interference, introduced by Sorkin in 1994, into a general probabilistic framework. Their adaption is used here to reveal a close link between the existence of the Jordan product and the non-existence of interference of third or higher order in those quantum logics which entail a reasonable calculus of conditional probability. The complete characterization of the Jordan algebraic structure requires the following three further postulates: a Hahn-Jordan decomposition property for the states, a polynomial functional calculus for the observables, and the positivity of the square of an observable. While classical probabilities are characterized by the absence of any kind of interference, the absence of interference of third (and higher) order thus characterizes a probability calculus which comes close to quantum mechanics, but still includes the exceptional Jordan algebras.",

This paper demonstrates these properties using an explicit representation of the automorphisms on split-octonions, the noncompact form of the exceptional Lie group G2. This group generates specific rotations of (3+4)-vector parts of split octonions with three extra time-like coordinates and in infinitesimal limit imitate standard Poincare transformations. In this picture translations are represented by non-compact Lorentz-type rotations towards the extra time-like coordinates. It is shown how the G2 algebra's chirality yields an intrinsic left-right asymmetry of a certain 3-vector (spin), as well as a parity violating effect on light emitted by a moving quantum system. Elementary particles are connected with the special elements of the algebra which nullify octonionic intervals. Then the zero-norm conditions lead to free particle Lagrangians, which allow virtual trajectories also and exhibit the appearance of spatial horizons governing by mass parameters.",

Thus a mathematical model, an atmospheric diffusion model, is used to estimate air quality that can be used to describe the sulfur dioxide dispersion. In this research, numerical simulations to air pollution measurement near industrial zone are proposed. The air pollution control strategies are simulated to achieve desired pollutant concentration levels. The monitoring points are installed to detect the air pollution concentration data. The numerical experiment of air pollution consisted of different situations such as normal and controlled emissions. The air pollutant concentration is approximated by using an explicit finite difference technique. The solutions of calculated air pollutant concentration in each controlled and uncontrolled point source at the monitoring points are compared. The air pollutant concentration levels for each monitoring point are controlled to be at or below the national air quality standard near industrial zone index.",

On other hand, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) is commonly employed in most industrial control systems, because of its simplicity and efficiency. The measurement errors, nonlinearities, and uncertainties degrade the performance of conventional PIDs. In this study, for the first time, a new T3-FLS-based PID scheme with deep learning approach is introduced. In addition to rules, the parameters of fuzzy sets are also tuned such that a fast regulation efficiency is obtained. Unlike the most conventional approaches, the suggested tuning approach is done in an online scheme. Also, a nonsingleton fuzzification is suggested to reduce the effect of sensor errors. The proposed scheme is examined on a case-study microgrid (MG), and its good frequency stabilization performance is demonstrated in various hard conditions such as variable load, unknown dynamics, and variation in renewable energy (RE) sources.",

We show that, compared to the analogous scheme with a ferromagnetic chain in its ground state, here the entanglement is transmitted faster, with less decay, with a much higher purity and as a narrow pulse form rising nonanalytically from zero. Here nonzero temperatures and depolarizing environments are both found to be less destructive in comparison to the ferromagnetic case.

We consider a properly defined, in a special function space, generalized solution to problem PK for which existence and uniqueness theorems hold. It is known that it may have a strong power-type singularity at one boundary point even for very smooth right-hand sides of the equation. In the present paper we study the asymptotic behavior of the generalized solutions of problem PK at the singular point.

Firstly, we derive operational matrices for Caputo fractional derivative and for Riemann-Liouville fractional integral by using the Bernstein polynomials (BPs). In the first method, we use the operational matrix of Caputo fractional derivative (OMCFD), and in the second one, we apply the operational matrix of Riemann-Liouville fractional integral (OMRLFI). The obtained results are in good agreement with each other as well as with the analytical solutions. We show that the solutions approach to classical solutions as the order of the fractional derivatives approaches 1.",

This vortex model is built on the classical potential theory of ellipsoids and applies to large-scale fluid flows, such as those found in the atmosphere and oceans, where the dynamics are strongly affected by the Earth's rotation. In this large-scale limit the governing equations reduce to the quasi-geostrophic system, where all the dynamics depends on a single scalar field, the potential vorticity, which is a dynamical marker for vortices. The solution of this system is achieved by the inversion of a Poisson equation, that in the case of an ellipsoidal vortex can be solved exactly. From this ellipsoidal solution equilibria have been determined and their stability properties have been studied. Many studies have shown that this ellipsoidal vortex model, while being conceptually simple, is an extremely powerful tool in eliciting some of the fundamental characteristics of turbulent geophysical flows.",

The system is heated from below and the model used for the nanofluid layer incorporates the effects of thermophoresis and Brownian motion. Three types of bounding systems of the model have been considered which are as follows: both the lower and upper bounding surfaces are free, the lower is rigid and the upper is free, and both of them are rigid. The eigenvalue equations of the perturbed state were obtained from a normal mode analysis and solved using the Galerkin method. It is found that the effect of internal heat source and Soret parameter destabilizes the nanofluid layer system while increasing the Coriolis force, feedback control, and Dufour parameter helps to postpone the onset of convection. Elevating the modified density ratio hastens the instability in the system and there is no significant effect of modified particle density in a nanofluid system.",

The associated metric tensor may generally depend on direction as well as position, and a number of connections emerge associated with various covariant derivatives involving affine and nonlinear coefficients. Finsler geometry encompasses Riemannian, Euclidean, and Minkowskian geometries as special cases, and thus it affords great generality for describing a number of phenomena in physics. Here, descriptions of finite deformation of continuous media are of primary focus. After a review of necessary mathematical definitions and derivations, prior work involving application of Finsler geometry in continuum mechanics of solids is reviewed. A new theoretical description of continua with microstructure is then outlined, merging concepts from Finsler geometry and phase field theories of materials science.",

The approximation of considering such components as infinitely large plates is not satisfactory for the current status of consumer electronics where size is now extremely small. In particular, the nanotechnology revolution has made the fabrication of truly finite systems with arbitrary shape and characteristic lengths that measure in nanometers possible. As a result the only accurate approach for such situations is to consider the system realistically as one with a finite size extent. In this work we calculate the amount of electrostatic energy that is stored in a charged finite size electrode that is modelled as a uniformly charged rectangular plate with arbitrary length and width. Nontrivial mathematical transformations allow us to derive a closed form exact expression for the Coulomb self-energy of such a system as a function of its length and width (therefore, shape, too). The exact result derived can be useful to understand the storage process of electrostatic energy as a function of size/shape in uniformly charged plate systems. The result also applies to calculations that deal with the properties of a finite two-dimensional electron gas within the jellium model where the finite jellium domain can have an arbitrary rectangular shape.",

A sustainable suspension in the ethylene glycol with water is set by dissolving inorganic substances, iron oxide <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mfenced open=\"(\" close=\")\" separators=\"|\"> <a:mrow> <a:msub> <a:mrow> <a:mtext>Fe</a:mtext> </a:mrow> <a:mrow> <a:mn>3</a:mn> </a:mrow> </a:msub> <a:msub> <a:mrow> <a:mtext>O</a:mtext> </a:mrow> <a:mrow> <a:mn>4</a:mn> </a:mrow> </a:msub> </a:mrow> </a:mfenced> </a:math> and cobalt (Co), to form <f:math xmlns:f=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <f:msub> <f:mrow> <f:mtext>Fe</f:mtext> </f:mrow> <f:mrow> <f:mn>3</f:mn> </f:mrow> </f:msub> <f:msub> <f:mrow> <f:mtext>O</f:mtext> </f:mrow> <f:mrow> <f:mn>4</f:mn> </f:mrow> </f:msub> <f:mo>−</f:mo> <f:mtext>Co</f:mtext> <f:mo>/</f:mo> <f:mrow> <f:msub> <f:mrow> <f:mtext>C</f:mtext> </f:mrow> <f:mrow> <f:mn>2</f:mn> </f:mrow> </f:msub> <f:msub> <f:mrow> <f:mtext>H</f:mtext> </f:mrow> <f:mrow> <f:mn>6</f:mn> </f:mrow> </f:msub> <f:msub> <f:mrow> <f:mtext>O</f:mtext> </f:mrow> <f:mrow> <f:mn>2</f:mn> </f:mrow> </f:msub> </f:mrow> <f:mo>−</f:mo> <f:msub> <f:mrow> <f:mtext>H</f:mtext> </f:mrow> <f:mrow> <f:mn>2</f:mn> </f:mrow> </f:msub> <f:mtext>O</f:mtext> </f:math> hybrid nanofluid. The numerical and analytical model portraying the fluid flow has been planned, and similitude conditions have been determined with the assistance of the same transformations. The shooting technique has been used to solve nonlinear numerical solution. To check the validity of the results obtained from the shooting mode, the Matlab built-in function BVP4c and Mathematica built-in function homotopy analysis method (HAM) are used. The influence of rising parameters on velocity, temperature, skin friction factor, Nusselt number, and Sherwood number is evaluated with the help of graphs and tables. It has been found in this work that to acquire a productive thermal framework, the hybrid nanoparticles should be considered instead of a single sort of nanoparticles. In addition, the velocities of both the hybrid nanofluids and simple nanofluids are upgraded by the mixed convection boundary, whereas they are decreased by the porosity. An augmentation in volumetric fraction of nanoparticles correlates to an increment in the heat transmission rate. It is also found that heat transfer rate for <h:math xmlns:h=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <h:msub> <h:mrow> <h:mtext>Fe</h:mtext> </h:mrow> <h:mrow> <h:mn>3</h:mn> </h:mrow> </h:msub> <h:msub> <h:mrow> <h:mtext>O</h:mtext> </h:mrow> <h:mrow> <h:mn>4</h:mn> </h:mrow> </h:msub> <h:mo>−</h:mo> <h:mtext>Co</h:mtext> <h:mo>/</h:mo> <h:mrow> <h:msub> <h:mrow> <h:mtext>C</h:mtext> </h:mrow> <h:mrow> <h:mn>2</h:mn> </h:mrow> </h:msub> <h:msub> <h:mrow> <h:mtext>H</h:mtext> </h:mrow> <h:mrow> <h:mn>6</h:mn> </h:mrow> </h:msub> <h:msub> <h:mrow> <h:mtext>O</h:mtext> </h:mrow> <h:mrow> <h:mn>2</h:mn> </h:mrow> </h:msub> </h:mrow> <h:mo>−</h:mo> <h:msub> <h:mrow> <h:mtext>H</h:mtext> </h:mrow> <h:mrow> <h:mn>2</h:mn> </h:mrow> </h:msub> <h:mtext>O</h:mtext> </h:math> hybrid nanofluids (HNF) is better than that of the <j:math xmlns:j=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <j:msub> <j:mrow> <j:mtext>Fe</j:mtext> </j:mrow> <j:mrow> <j:mn>3</j:mn> </j:mrow> </j:msub> <j:msub> <j:mrow> <j:mtext>O</j:mtext> </j:mrow> <j:mrow> <j:mn>4</j:mn> </j:mrow> </j:msub> <j:mo>−</j:mo> <j:msub> <j:mrow> <j:mtext>C</j:mtext> </j:mrow> <j:mrow> <j:mn>2</j:mn> </j:mrow> </j:msub> <j:msub> <j:mrow> <j:mtext>H</j:mtext> </j:mrow> <j:mrow> <j:mn>6</j:mn> </j:mrow> </j:msub> <j:msub> <j:mrow> <j:mtext>O</j:mtext> </j:mrow> <j:mrow> <j:mn>2</j:mn> </j:mrow> </j:msub> <j:mo>−</j:mo> <j:msub> <j:mrow> <j:mtext>H</j:mtext> </j:mrow> <j:mrow> <j:mn>2</j:mn> </j:mrow> </j:msub> <j:mtext>O</j:mtext> </j:math> of single nanofluids (SNF).

Additionally, the BTF-KdV equations are suggested to observe the effect of related parameters on the local and nonlocal coherent head-on collision phenomena for the considered system. It is observed that the proposed equations along with their new solutions not only applicable with the presence of locality but also nonlocality to study the resonance wave phenomena in fluid-filled elastic tube.

A heterogeneous two-phase model of the gastrointestinal mucosa is considered, consisting of a continuous extracellular phase and a dispersed cellular phase. The main mode of uptake is considered to be a fractional anomalous diffusion under concentration gradient and potential gradient. Appropriate partial differential equations describing the variation with time of concentrations of sodium ions in both the two phases across the intestinal wall are obtained using Riemann-Liouville space-fractional derivative and are solved by finite difference methods. The concentrations of sodium ions in the interstitial space and in the cells have been studied as a function of time, and the mean concentration of sodium ions available for absorption by the blood capillaries has also been studied. Finally, numerical results are presented graphically for various values of different parameters. This study demonstrates that fractional anomalous diffusion model is appropriate for describing the uptake of sodium ions across the epithelium of gastrointestinal mucosa.",

The rate at which such topological transformation, called coalescence phenomenon, evolves results from a competition between the inertial force which resists the transformation, the interfacial force which promotes the rate, and the viscous force which arrests it. Depending on the behaviour of these forces, different scaling laws describing the neck growth can be observed, predicted theoretically, and proved numerically. The twofold objective of the present contribution is to propose a simple theoretical framework which leads to an Ordinary Differential Equation, the solution of which predicts the different scaling laws in various limits, and to validate these theoretical predictions numerically by modelling the phenomenon in the commercial Finite Element software COMSOL Multiphysics.",

Numerically, the effect of irregularity present is analysed. It is seen that the phase velocity is significantly influenced by the wave number and the depth of the irregularity. The variations of dimensionless phase velocity against dimensionless wave number are shown graphically for the different size of rectangular irregularities with the help of MATLAB.",

In (1) we prove that a class of nonlinear coherent states can be constructed to satisfy a closure relation that is expressed uniquely in terms of the Meijer G-function. This property automatically defines the delta distribution as the P-representation of such states. Then, in principle, there must be a classical analog for them. Among other examples, we construct a family of nonlinear coherent states for a representation of the su(1,1) Lie algebra that is realized as a deformation of the oscillator algebra. In (2), we use a beam splitter to show that the nonlinear coherent states exhibit properties like anti-bunching that prohibit a classical description for them. We also show that these states lack second order coherence. That is, although the P-representation of the nonlinear coherent states is a delta function, they are not full coherent. Therefore, the systems associated with the generalized oscillator algebras cannot be considered `classical' in the context of the quantum theory of optical coherence.",

The analogy is based on the well known resemblance between the guided and radiation modes of a waveguide with the bound and scattering states of a quantum well. As resonances are scattering states that spend some time in the zone of influence of the scatterer, we associate them with the leaky modes of a waveguide, the latter characterized by suffering attenuation in the direction of propagation but increasing exponentially in the transverse directions. The resemblance is complete since resonances (leaky modes) can be interpreted as bound states (guided modes) with definite lifetime (longitudinal shift). As an immediate application we calculate the leaky modes (resonances) associated with a dielectric homogeneous slab (square well potential) and show that these modes are attenuated as they propagate.",

    "abstract": "The paper aims to adopt the complex quaternion and octonion to formulate the field equations for electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Applying the octonionic representation enables one single definition to combine some physics contents of two fields, which were considered to be independent of each other in the past. J. C. Maxwell applied simultaneously the vector terminology and the quaternion analysis to depict the electromagnetic theory. This method edified the paper to introduce the quaternion and octonion spaces into the field theory, in order to describe the physical feature of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, while their coordinates are able to be the complex number. The octonion space can be separated into two subspaces, the quaternion space and the S-quaternion space. In the quaternion space, it is able to infer the field potential, field strength, field source, field equations, and so forth, in the gravitational field. In the S-quaternion space, it is able to deduce the field potential, field strength, field source, and so forth, in the electromagnetic field. The results reveal that the quaternion space is appropriate to describe the gravitational features; meanwhile the S-quaternion space is proper to depict the electromagnetic features.",

We obtain solution branches as well as a turning point in the flow field accurately.

Based on the intelligent parallel mode, the algorithm decomposes and merges the calculation process of the image Gabor transformation, decomposes the entire image Gabor feature extraction calculation process into a parallel part and a nonparallel part, and accelerates the parallel part by using multiple cores. The calculation results are then combined to achieve the purpose of multicore parallel acceleration of the entire calculation process. Secondly, based on the consideration of improving the real-time performance of the intelligent clothing design system, combined with the existing multicore environment, this paper uses the intelligent model to design and implement the image parallel Gabor feature extraction algorithm and uses image processing and analysis technology to analyze the visual elements of traditional clothing and identify and quantify to form a relatively complete clothing visual element evaluation system, which provides a basis for large-scale collection and automated evaluation of clothing visual effects, as well as clothing trend tracking and prediction. Experiments show that the algorithm can effectively shorten the calculation time of Gabor image feature extraction and can obtain a good speedup in a multicore environment. At the same time, it combines with a multiscale intelligent clothing classification algorithm, on the basis of the VS2008 platform, combined with OpenCV 2.0, designed and implemented an intelligent clothing design system, and conducted experiments and system tests. The experimental results show that the algorithm given in this paper can accurately segment fabric defects from the background, which proves that the detection algorithm has a good detection effect. Simulation results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can more accurately identify the state of clothing features, and the real-time performance of intelligent clothing design in a multicore environment has been improved to a certain extent.",

The network structure and detection principle of the YOLO target detection algorithm based on convolutional neural nets are analysed, images of construction solid waste are collected as a dataset, and the image dataset is expanded using data enhancement techniques, and the target objects in the dataset are labelled and used to train their own YOLO detection models. To facilitate testing the images and to design a YOLO algorithm-based construction solid waste target detection system. Using the detection system for construction solid waste recognition, the YOLO model can accurately detect the location, class, and confidential information of the target object in the image. Image recognition is a technique to recognize images by capturing real-life images through devices and performing feature extraction, and this technique has been widely used since its inception. The deep learning-based classification algorithm for recyclable solid waste studied in this paper can classify solid waste efficiently and accurately, solving the problem that people do not know how to classify solid waste in daily life. The convolutional layer, pooling layer, and fully connected layer in a convolutional neural network are responsible for feature extraction, reducing the number of parameters, integrating features into high-level features, and finally classifying them by SoftMax classifier in turn. However, the actual situation is intricate and often the result is not obtained as envisioned, and the use of migration learning can be a good way to improve the overfitting phenomenon. In this paper, the combination of lazy optimizer and lookahead can improve the generalization ability and fitting speed as well as greatly improve the accuracy and stability. The experimental results are tested, and it is found that the solid waste classification accuracy can be as high as 95% when the VGG19 model is selected and the optimizer is combined.",

The benefit of this approach is that it solves the equations directly and reliably, without the prerequisite for perturbations or linearization or extensive computer labor. Five sample instances from the DDEs are given to confirm the method’s reliability and effectiveness, and the outcomes are compared with the exact solution with the assistance of tables and graphs after taking the sum of the first eight iterations of the approximate solution.

    "abstract": "With the complexity of modern power system and the susceptibility to external weather influences, it brings challenges to build an accurate load model. This paper proposes a variational autoencoder (VAE) long short‐term memory (LSTM) load model based on the attention mechanism (Attention). First, the Prophet data decomposition method is used to decompose long sequences of load data at multiple time scales. Second, the correlation‐based feature selection with maximum information coefficient (CFS‐MIC) method is employed to select weather features based on their relevance, a subset of features with high correlation and low redundancy is chosen as model inputs. Finally, the Attention‐LSTM‐VAE model is constructed to capture the temporal variations laws of load. The dataset includes 2 years of load values and weather data collected in Caojiaping, Hunan Province, China. The experimental results show that the Attention‐LSTM‐VAE model has the lowest mean absolute error of 0.0374 and the highest R ‐squared value of 0.9714, verifying the accuracy of the model. Therefore, the performance of the Attention‐LSTM‐VAE model is better than the general deep learning load models, which has important reference for the research of power load models. Comparisons with other deep learning methods, the experimental results show that the Attention‐LSTM‐VAE model has the lowest mean absolute error of 0.0374 and the highest R ‐squared value of 0.9714. The Attention‐LSTM‐VAE has better robustness, stability, and accuracy in load modeling, which has an important reference for the research of power load models.",

    "abstract": "Due to its superior thermal conductivity and efficient thermal management, ternary nanofluids play a crucial role in electronic advance cooling systems, solar thermal collectors, managing efficiency of thermal exchangers, targeted drug delivery systems, and various technologies. An essential aspect of understanding complex systems is studying the interplay between fluid movement, heat transport, and chemical processes. Therefore, examining chemical reactions is vital for various industrial applications in environmental areas. Because of these applications, this study examines the impact of endothermic/exothermic chemical reactions on the flow of a ternary nanofluid across a rotating permeable‐stretched surface. The governing equations are transformed into the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and numerically tackled with the help of the Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg 4 th 5 th (RKF45) order scheme. The outcomes of pertinent constraints on their respective profiles are illustrated through graphs. The results show that the thermal profile diminishes for the exothermic case and enhances for the endothermic case in context to the activation parameter. Improvement in solid volume fraction will improve the rate of thermal distribution for both endo and exothermic cases. The rate of thermal distribution increases by about 3.22% from ternary nanofluid to nanofluid, while the rate of mass transfer is about 2.31%. The outcomes will help in chemical manufacturing, renewable energy technologies, material sciences, and designing and optimization of the delivery of drugs.",

In the proposed formulation, the different fractional time derivatives are applied to fracture and matrix regions since they have different memory properties. We further develop a two-level time discrete method, which uses a large time step for the pressure and a small time step size for the saturation. The pressure equation is solved implicitly in each large time step, while the saturation is updated by an explicit fractional time scheme in each time substep. Finally, the numerical tests are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical model.",

The governing partial differential equations and boundary conditions are converted into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations using appropriate similarity transformations. These equations are solved analytically by regular perturbation methods with series improvement technique and numerically using an efficient Runge-Kutta Fehlberg integration technique coupled with shooting scheme. The effects of the governing parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature, skin friction, pressure drop, and Nusselt numbers are presented graphically and discussed quantitatively.",

The fluid motion is generated by the flat plate which has a translational motion in its plane with a time-dependent velocity. The adequate integral transform approach is employed to find analytic solutions for the velocity field. Solutions for the flows corresponding to Maxwell fluid, second-grade fluid, and Newtonian fluid are also determined in both cases, namely, flows with slip on the boundary and flows with no slip on the boundary, respectively. Some of our results were compared with other results from the literature. The effects of several emerging dimensionless and pertinent parameters on the fluid velocity have been studied theoretically as well as graphically in the paper.",

The complete electromagnetic solution is derived using analytical closed form expressions for the mode spectrum of the equilateral waveguide. The mathematical formulation of the electromagnetic scattering problem is based on the quasi-analytical Mode-Matching method. This method benefits from the electromagnetic field division into symmetries as well as from the plane wave formulation presented for the expressions involved. The unification of the surface integrals used in the method thanks to the plane wave formulation is revealed, leading to expressions that are very well suited for its implementation in an electromagnetic analysis and design code. The obtained results for some cases of interest (building blocks for microwave components for communication systems) are verified using other numerical methods included in a commercial software package, showing the potential of the presented approach based on quasi-analytic expressions.",

The temperature field and the heat flux intensity factor in the time domain are obtained by transforming the corresponding quantities from the Laplace domain numerically.

    "abstract": "In 1862, George Boole derived an inequality for variables, now known as Boolean variables, that in his opinion represents a demarcation line between possible and impossible experience. This inequality forms an important milestone in the epistemology of probability theory and probability measures. In 1985 Leggett and Garg derived a physics related inequality, mathematically identical to Boole's, that according to them represents a demarcation between macroscopic realism and quantum mechanics. Their formalism, constructed for the magnetic flux of SQUIDS, includes general features and applies also to many other quantum experiments. We show that a wide gulf, a wide divide, separates the \"sense impressions\" and corresponding data, as well as the postulates of macroscopic realism, from the mathematical abstractions that are used to derive the inequality of Leggett-Garg. If the gulf can be bridged, one may indeed derive the said inequality, which is then clearly a demarcation between possible and impossible experience: it cannot be violated and is not violated by quantum theory. We deduce from this fact that a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality does not mean that the SQUID-flux is not there when nobody looks, as Leggett-Garg suggest, but instead that the probability measures may not be what Leggett-Garg have assumed them to be, when no data can be secured that directly relate to them. We show that similar considerations apply to other well known quantum interpretation-puzzles including that of the two-slit experiment.",

    "abstract": "In the field of sports, the formulation of existing training plans mainly relies on the manual observation and personal experience of coaches. This method is inevitably subjective. The application of artificial intelligence technology to the training of athletes to recognize athletes’ posture can help coaches assist in decision-making and greatly enhance athletes’ competitive ability. The human body movements embodied in sports are more complicated, and the accurate recognition of sports postures plays an active and important role in sports competitions and training. In this paper, inertial sensor technology is applied to attitude recognition in motion. First, in order to improve the accuracy of attitude calculation and reduce the noise interference in the preparation process, this article uses differential evolution algorithm to apply attitude calculation to realize multisensor data fusion. Secondly, a two-level neural network intelligent motion gesture recognition algorithm is proposed. The two-level neural network intelligent recognition algorithm effectively recognizes similar actions by splitting the traditional single-level neural network into two-level neural networks. Experiments show that the experimental method designed in this article for the posture in motion can obtain the motion information of the examinee in real time, realize the accurate extraction of individual motion data, and complete the recognition of the motion posture. The average accuracy rate can reach 98.85%. There is a certain practical value in gesture recognition.",

Meanwhile, the technique of variable congelation is employed to handle the aforementioned unknown time‐varying parameter interference. Based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, the synchronization controllers in different dimensions are obtained. At the same time, adaptive laws of the unknown interference can be designed. Benefiting from the proposed methods, it is verified that regardless of whether it occurs in three‐dimensional (3D) or four‐dimensional (4D) synchronization, all synchronization errors can be globally uniformly ultimately bounded as time tends to infinity. Moreover, it is ensured that both control and estimation signals remain bounded. Eventually, simulation studies based on two financial systems are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization method.",

Using the extended fractional Riccati expansion method, we investigate optical soliton solutions of the fractional Klein–Gordon equation within this modified framework. This model in physics claims the existence of energy particles and defines the relativistic wave. The proposed procedures provide insight into wave spread and optical solitons, which enterprises in current broadcast communications can utilize to empower fast and long‐distance information transmission with minimal signal degradation. They are important for their reliability and optical communication networking. This method can analytically formulate optical soliton solutions using rational, hyperbolic, and trigonometric functions. The interaction between the breather and the king wave, as well as the bright and dark bell‐shaped singular soliton waves, are the numerical forms of the obtained solutions, examined using three‐ and two‐dimensional diagrams.

The findings reveal that increasing the Darcy number improves the average Nusselt number by 2.498% and total entropy by 9.48%, but significantly reduces the Sherwood number by 314.19%. An increase in Hartmann number suppresses heat and mass transfer, decreasing Nusselt number by 621.05%, Sherwood number by 7.404%, and Bejan number by 10.59%, while slightly increasing total entropy by 1.8%. Higher values of λ intensify entropy generation by 84.16%, increase Sherwood number by 149.175%, and Bejan number by 8.81%, but reduce Nusselt number by 105.178%. Enhancing porosity ( ɛ ) leads to a 2.88% rise in Nusselt number and a 13.72% increase in entropy, while causing substantial decreases in Sherwood number (438.54%) and Bejan number (16.65%). Similarly, rising Rayleigh number enhances heat transfer by 2.498%, increases entropy by 9.58%, and decreases Sherwood number and Bejan number by 332.419% and 10.96%, respectively.

    "abstract": "The geometrical application of split octonions is considered. The modified Fano graphic, which represents products of the basis units of split octonionic, having David's Star shape, is presented. It is shown that active and passive transformations of coordinates in octonionic '8-space' are not equivalent. The group of passive transformations that leave invariant the norm of split octonions is SO(4,4), while active rotations is done by the direct product of O(3,4)-boosts and real non-compact form of the exceptional group $G_2$. In classical limit these transformations reduce to the standard Lorentz group.",

    "abstract": "The theory of electrodynamics of radiating charges is reviewed with special emphasis on the role of the Schott energy for the conservation of energy for a charge and its electromagnetic field. It is made clear that the existence of radiation from a charge is not invariant against a transformation between two reference frames that has an accelerated motion relative to each other. The questions whether the existence of radiation from a uniformly accelerated charge with vanishing radiation reaction force is in conflict with the principle of equivalence and whether a freely falling charge radiates are reviewed. It is shown that the resolution of an electromagnetic “perpetuum mobile paradox” associated with a charge moving geodetically along a circular path in the Schwarzschild spacetime requires the so-called tail terms in the equation of motion of a charged particle.",

The beam is attached to multi single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) fractionally-damped systems, and it is subjected to a vehicle moving with a constant velocity. The damping characteristics of the beam and SDOF systems are described in terms of fractional derivatives. Three coupled second-order fractional differential equations are produced and then they are solved by combining the Laplace transform with the decomposition method. The obtained numerical results show that the dynamic response decreases as (a) the number of absorbers attached to the beam increases and (b) the damping-ratios of used absorbers and beam increase. However, there are some critical values of fractional derivatives which are different from unity at which the beam has less dynamic response than that obtained for the full-order derivatives model. Furthermore, the obtained results show very good agreements with special case studies that were published in the literature.",

This paper employs the spreading residue harmonic balance method (SRHBM) to derive analytical approximate solutions for the fifth-order nonlinear problem, which corresponds to the strongly nonlinear vibration of an elastically restrained beam with a lumped mass. When the SRHBM is used, the residual terms are added to improve the accuracy of approximate solutions. Illustrative examples are provided along with verifying the accuracy of the present method and are compared with the HAM solutions, the EBM solutions, and exact solutions in tables. At the same time, the phase diagrams and time history curves are drawn by the mathematical software. Through analysis and discussion, the results obtained here demonstrate that the SRHBM is an effective and robust technique for nonlinear dynamical systems. In addition, the SRHBM can be widely applied to a variety of nonlinear dynamic systems.",

Firstly, the stability of equilibrium points of proposed autonomous jerk oscillator is investigated by analyzing the characteristic equation and the existence of Hopf bifurcation is verified using one of the two parameters as a bifurcation parameter. By tuning its two parameters, various dynamical behaviors are found in the proposed autonomous jerk oscillator including periodic attractor, one-scroll chaotic attractor, and coexistence between chaotic and periodic attractors. The proposed autonomous jerk oscillator has period-doubling route to chaos with the variation of one of its parameters and reverse period-doubling route to chaos with the variation of its other parameter. The proposed autonomous jerk oscillator is modelled on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and the FPGA chip statistics and phase portraits are derived. The chaotic and coexistence of attractors generated in the proposed autonomous jerk oscillator are confirmed by FPGA implementation of the proposed autonomous jerk oscillator. A good qualitative agreement is illustrated between the numerical and FPGA results. Finally synchronization of unidirectional coupled identical proposed autonomous jerk oscillators is achieved using adaptive sliding mode control method.",

To ensure travel safety, improve travel efficiency, and ameliorate waiting environments for passengers, this paper proposes an adaptive multilevel collaborative passenger flow control strategy integrating the control of station entrance and station hall. An integer linear programming model is constructed, which aims at minimizing the total passenger waiting time and taking the safe capacity of each key area of all stations as the necessary constraints. The model is applied in two scenarios with different scales of passenger demand in the morning peak of the Batong line. The results show that the proposed model can adaptively activate the appropriate control level, limit the amount of accumulated passengers in each key area of the station within its safe capacity, and shorten the total passenger waiting time.",

The BGK type of the Boltzmann kinetic equation is used to study the gas dynamics various regimes with Maxwellian velocity distribution functions. An analytical solution of the model equations for the unsteady flow was given using the moment and the traveling wave methods. The manner of the mean velocity of plasmas is illustrated, which is compatible with the variation of the shear stress, viscosity coefficient, and the initial and boundary conditions.

We show also how to convert Vasiliev’s equations into an explicit nonrelativistic covariant form, such that they might apply to nonrelativistic systems. Our procedure reveals that the space of solutions of the Schrödinger equation can be regarded also as a supersymmetric module.",

The fractional-order derivative will be in the conformable (CFD) sense. Some properties which help us to solve the governing problem using the suggested approach are proven. The proposed method yields an approximate solution in the form of an infinite series that converges to a closed-form solution, which is in many cases the exact solution. This method has the advantage of producing an analytical solution by only using the appropriate initial conditions without requiring any discretization, transformation, or restrictive assumptions. Four test modeling problems from mathematical physics, conformable fractional telegraph equations in which we already knew their exact solution using other numerical methods, were taken to show the liability, accuracy, convergence, and efficiency of the proposed method, and the solution behavior of each illustrative example is presented using tabulated numerical values and two- and three-dimensional graphs. The results show that the RDTM gave solutions that coincide with the exact solutions and the numerical solutions that are available in the literature. Also, the obtained results reveal that the introduced method is easily applicable and it saves a lot of computational work in solving conformable fractional telegraph equations, and it may also find wide application in other complicated fractional partial differential equations that originate in the areas of engineering and science.",

In this paper, we established a new propagation model, which regards the number of rumors in the media as a subclass that changes with time, and then comprehensively considered the effect of these two factors on the process of rumor propagation. We proved the existence and stability of equilibrium points of the model. Then, we selected two reasonable control variables: science popularization intensity and punishment intensity. We find that the control effects are optimal when these two control variables take the maximum value. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results showed that positive media publicity can reduce the spread of rumors, but cannot stop the spread of rumors. And under the parameters given in this paper, the optimal control parameter values satisfying the constraints can be calculated through quantitative analysis. This method provided a new idea for studying the optimal control of rumor propagation.",

    "abstract": "A numerical analysis of magnetohydrodynamic natural convection along a thin vertical cylinder with a sinusoidal heat flux at the wall immersed in copper (Cu) and aluminum-oxide (Al2O3) hybrid nanofluids has been studied. A 2D vertical thin cylinder shape geometry has been considered with a radius of R. The fluid flow is considered laminar and incompressible with the Prandtl number of Pr = 6.2 and 10% concentration of hybrid nanoparticles. The nondimensional governing equations have been solved numerically by using the implicit finite difference method. An in-house FORTRAN 90 code is used for solving this problem and the code is validated with the available benchmark results. Numerical simulations have been performed for a wide range of governing parameters, Hartmann number from Ha = 0 to Ha = 4, nanoparticles volume fractions <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><a:mi>ϕ</a:mi></a:math> = 0.0 to <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><c:mi>ϕ</c:mi></c:math> = 0.1, and the amplitude of the wall heat flux ε = 0.0–0.3. The findings have been illustrated in terms of streamlines, isotherms, local skin friction coefficients, local Nusselt numbers, velocity, and temperature distributions. The flow field and temperature distribution within the boundary layer are deceased by the effects of the wall heat flux amplitudes. It is also noted that the rate of heat transfer increases with particle volume fraction and the amplitude of the wall heat flux. According to the findings, Nu increases by 24.72% as <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><e:mi>ϕ</e:mi></e:math> increases from 0 to 0.1 while ε = 0.3, and 27.66% while ε increases from 0.0 to 0.3 at 5% hybrid nanoparticles. The local skin frictions and Nusselt number diminish with the increment of the Hartman number due to the effects of the Lorenz force. The findings of this study can lead to a better understanding of the fundamental principles regarding the behavior of hybrid nanofluids under complex conditions, such as a vertical thin cylinder with a sinusoidal wall heat flux. Understanding the behavior of hybrid nanofluids in the presence of a magnetic field and a nonuniform wall heat flow can also lead to the development of innovative heat transfer enhancement strategies.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of charge density calculations in particle‐in‐cell (PIC) simulations by leveraging attention mechanisms in neural networks (NNs). We propose a three‐network architecture comprising a 1 st ‐order‐pre‐trainer, a 2 nd ‐order‐improver, and a discriminator network. The 1 st ‐order‐pre‐trainer is initially trained on a large dataset to predict charge densities from particle positions and charges. Subsequently, it is fine‐tuned with the 2 nd ‐order‐improver and discriminator network using a smaller dataset to achieve near 2 nd ‐order accuracy. Our approach substitutes the traditional particle interpolation process in JefiPIC with a meticulously trained NN. The results demonstrate that PIC simulations enhanced by NNs can simulate plasmas and electromagnetic (EM) fields with significantly enhanced accuracy, achieving an absolute accuracy improvement exceeding 10% when compared to a 1 st ‐order PIC simulator and a relative accuracy improvement of over 50% in comparison to other direct training techniques. Furthermore, our method has the potential to diminish the reliance on acquiring real labels, which are often difficult to observe. This work highlights the potential of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve the precision and efficiency of PIC simulations, paving the way for future advancements in plasma and nuclear physics research.",

Analytical solutions are obtained for steady and oscillatory onset when imposed gradients of the stratifying agencies are constant and vertical. It was found that A.C electric Rayleigh number did not affect the necessary conditions for oscillatory convection. The stability boundaries are drawn and it is observed that an increase in the A.C electric field strength is to hasten the onset of convection. The evolution of neutral curves is analyzed in detail by varying the A.C electric Rayleigh number and other physical parameters. For certain choices of physical parameters, it is noted that the oscillatory part will give rise to two oscillatory neutral solutions for each wave number and closed disconnected neutral curves are found to exist, suggesting the requirement for three critical Rayleigh numbers to specify the linear stability criterion.",

In this paper, a Newmark integral method is presented to deal with the strong, transient heat conduction in nonhomogeneous materials based on the hyperbolic heat conduction theory. The second‐order differential equation of the strong transient temperature field is discretized in the spatial and temporal domains through the finite element method (FEM) and the Newmark integral method, respectively. This allows them to be solved directly without the necessity to convert them into a pair of first‐order differential equations using the Newmark integral method. Several test examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the current method. Firstly, the stability of the Newmark integral method is analyzed to ensure that the numerical oscillation is suppressed in the calculation. Then the time‐related temperature field of functionally graded material (FGM) plate under strong transient thermal shock is analyzed. Finally, the thermal stress intensity factors (TSIFs) in an FGM plate with parallel cracks are extracted after combining with interaction energy integral methods (IEIMs). The results confirm that the Newmark integral method can efficiently address the transient thermal problem and ensure stability. The temperature overshooting phenomenon and thermal wave singularity are visualized at the finite speed of heat propagation. Moreover, the numerical results agree well with analytical solutions. The current method can be well applied to the design and evaluation of thermal protective materials in extreme thermal environments.",

    "abstract": "An analysis of an unsteady magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) natural convective transport through a uniform inclined perforated plate in the presence of thermal radiation effect has been carried out due to its potential applications in geophysics and astronomy, as well as a variety of engineering problems, such as aerodynamics, cooling towers, and nuclear reactor boundary layer control. The partial differential equations (PDEs) have been transformed into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by considering the similarity transformation. The nondimensional ODEs have been solved by using shooting technique through MATLAB tools. The influences of the numerous nondimensional numbers or parameters like inclined angle ( γ ), Prandtl number (Pr), Dufour number (Df), Schmidt number (Sc), thermal radiation parameter ( R ), and suction parameter ( v 0 ) on the fluid flow, concentration, and temperature are explained. For larger values of R and Df, the fluid’s temperature and velocity increased. The velocity field reduces for higher amounts of γ . The local skin friction coefficient ( f ′(0)) enhanced by 58% and reduced by 46% due to moving values of γ from 0° to 60° and M from 0.5 to 4.0, respectively. The values of f ′ (0) enhanced by about 16% and the values of θ ′(0) reduced by about 46% due to growing values of R from 0.5 to 3.5. Finally, we provided a comparison between our results with the published study. The comparison reveals good agreement.",

    "abstract": "The merging of carbon nanostructures has been extensively studied due to their outstanding properties. However, prior research neglected the rotational curvature through merging process, consequently restricting their advantages in the production of complex hybrid nanostructures in three‐dimensional (3D). This paper addresses a novel energy minimization approach that includes the effects of the axial and rotational curvatures to model the hybrid carbon nanotori (CNTRs), providing a more complete foundation for the formation of stable CNTRs structures with different radii and curvature features. Two methodologies in energy minimization were used, namely elastic energy for 2D merging and the Willmore energy approach for 3D merging. The results confirm that both models in two‐dimensional (2D) and 3D scenarios produce efficient and smooth joining curves. First model produces a minimum mean curvature around 0.15 and a total bending energy reduction of 18% which supports the stability of the configuration at the joining. While the second model uses zero mean curvature for the join. Moreover, the rotational curvature implication enhancing stability throughout the 3D connection process. By addressing the limitations of prior studies, this study develops an effective framework in production of stable hybrid nanostructures for future applications.",

However, we argue that FSFOD is not the best way for diffusion since different parts of spatial derivative play different roles in Perona-Malik diffusion (PMD) and derivative orders should be decided according to their roles. Therefore, we adopt a novel fractional-order diffusion scheme, named external fractional-order gradient vector Perona-Malik diffusion (EFOGV-PMD), by only replacing integer-order derivatives of “external” gradient vector to their fractional-order counterparts while keeping integer-order derivatives of gradient vector for diffusion coefficients since the ability of edge indicator for 1-order derivative is demonstrated both in theory and applications. Here “external” indicates the spatial derivatives except for the derivatives used in diffusion coefficients. In order to demonstrate the power of the proposed scheme, some real sinograms of low-dosed computed tomography (LDCT) are used to compare the different performances. These schemes include PMD, regularized PMD (RPMD), and FOPMD. Experimental results show that the new scheme has good ability in edge preserving, is convergent quickly, has good stability for iteration number, and can avoid artifacts, dark resulting images, and speckle effect.",

In this method, a new concept named “dynamic interval wavelet” is proposed to solve the problem that the numerical solution of the fractional PDE is usually sensitive to boundary conditions. Comparing with the traditional wavelet defined in the interval, the Newton interpolator is employed instead of the Lagrange interpolation operator, so, the extrapolation points in the interval wavelet can be chosen dynamically to restrict the boundary effect without increase of the calculation amount. In order to avoid unlimited increasing of the extrapolation points, both the error tolerance and the condition number are taken as indicators for the dynamic choice of the extrapolation points. Then, combining with the finite difference technology, a new numerical method for the time fractional partial differential equation is constructed. A simple Fokker-Planck equation is taken as an example to illustrate the effectiveness by comparing with the Grunwald-Letnikov central difference approximation (GL-CDA).",

The MS, embedded in the background 4D-spacetime, is an indispensable companion to the particle of interest, without relation to every other particle. The MS is not measurable directly, but we argue that a deformation (distortion of local internal properties) of MS is the origin of inertia effects that can be observed by us. With this perspective in sight, we construct the alternative relativistic theory of inertia . We go beyond the hypothesis of locality with special emphasis on distortion of MS, which allows to improve essentially the standard metric and other relevant geometrical structures referred to a noninertial frame in Minkowski spacetime for an arbitrary velocities and characteristic acceleration lengths. Despite the totally different and independent physical sources of gravitation and inertia, this approach furnishes justification for the introduction of the weak principle of equivalence (WPE), that is, the universality of free fall. Consequently, we relate the inertia effects to the more general post-Riemannian geometry.",

The image distortion effect was optimized by self-application, and then the deep learning modeler was used to model the side edge contour. Finally, the 3D ceramic model of the rotating body was restored according to the intersection and central axis of the extracted contour. By studying the existing segmentation methods based on deep learning, the automatic segmentation of target ceramic image and the effect of target edge refinement and optimization are realized. After extracting and separating the target ceramics from the image, we processed the foreground image of the target into a three-dimensional model. In order to reduce the complexity of the model, a 3D contextual sequencing model is adopted to encode the hidden space features along the channel dimensions, to extract the causal correlation between channels. Each module in the compression framework is optimized by a rate-distortion loss function. The experimental results show that the proposed 3D image modeling method has significant advantages in compression performance compared with the optimal 2D 3D image modeling method based on deep learning, and the experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is superior to JP3D and HEVC methods, especially at low bit rate points.",

    "abstract": "Arrhythmia is one of the most threatening diseases in all kinds of cardiovascular diseases. It is important to achieve efficient and accurate automatic detection of arrhythmias for clinical diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Based on previous research on electrocardiogram (ECG) automatic detection and classification algorithm, this paper uses the ResNet34 network to learn the morphological characteristics of ECG signals and get the significant information of signals, then passes into a three-layer stacked long-term and short-term memory network to get the context dependency of the features. Finally, four classification tasks are implemented on the PhysioNet Challenge 2017 test dataset by using the softmax function. The activation function is changed from the ReLu function to the mish function in this model. Negative information of ECG signals is considered in the training process, which makes the model have more stable and accurate classification ability. In addition, this paper calculates and compares the average information entropy of correctly classified samples and incorrectly classified samples in the test set. Moreover, it eliminates the impact of obvious signal abnormalities (redundancy or loss) on the model classification results, to more comprehensively and accurately explain the classification effect and performance of the model. After eliminating the possibility of abnormal signal, the ResNet34-LSTM3 model obtained an average <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mtext>F</mtext> <mn>1</mn> </math> score of 0.861 and an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.972 on the test dataset, which indicates that the model can effectively extract the characteristics of ECG signals and diagnose arrhythmia diseases. Comparing the results of the ResNet34 model and ResNet-18 model on the same test dataset, we can see that the improved model in this paper has a better classification and recognition effect on ECG signals as a whole, which can identify atrial fibrillation diseases more effectively.",

The flow in the blocks is assumed to be in local capillary disequilibrium and described by Barenblatt’s relaxation relationships for the relative permeability and capillary pressure. It is shown that the homogenization of such equations leads to a new macroscopic model that includes two kinds of long-memory effects: the mass transfer between the blocks and fractures and the memory caused by the microscopic Barenblatt disequilibrium. We have obtained a general relationship for the double nonequilibrium capillary pressure which represents great interest for applications. Due to the nonlinear coupling and the nonlocality in time, the macroscopic model remains incompletely homogenized in general case. The completely homogenized model was obtained for two different regimes. The first case corresponds to a linearized flow in the blocks. In the second case, we assume a low contrast in the block-fracture permeability. Numerical results for the two-dimensional problem are presented for two test cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology.",

In particular, we prove that both classical logic and quantum logic are sound and complete with respect to each of these lattices. We also show that there is one common nonorthomodular lattice that is a model of both quantum and classical logic. In technical terms, that enables us to run the same classical logic on both a digital (standard, two-subset, 0-1-bit) computer and a nondigital (say, a six-subset) computer (with appropriate chips and circuits). With quantum logic, the same six-element common lattice can serve us as a benchmark for an efficient evaluation of equations of bigger lattice models or theorems of the logic.",

Using the Laplace and Fourier integral transforms, the double-coupled singular integral equations and single-valued conditions of the problems are formulated. Both the singular integral equation and single-valued conditions are simplified into an algebraic equation through the Chebyshev point placement method and solved by numerical calculation. Then, the expression of the dynamic energy release rate is given with the help of the dynamic intensity factors of electric displacement and stress obtained. Finally, numerical results of the dynamic energy release rate with material parameters are demonstrated. The results show that the dynamic energy release rate depends on the size of the interface cracks, coating thickness, and the mechanical–electrical loading. Meanwhile, the fine-grained piezoelectric structures exhibit safer structural performance compared to normal one.",

The existence of the simple wave solutions to the nonreducible blood flow model is obtained by the method of characteristic decomposition.

The higher dimensional Kadomtsev−Petviashvili equation and its expansions have attracted a great deal of scientific interest during the past few decades. Several nonlinear phenomena in a range of domains, like the dynamics of long waves with modest amplitudes in oceans and plasma physics, are studied using this family. In this study, we successfully apply the Hirota bilinear method with the adoption of several test strategies. A set of results like breather, two‐wave, and lump periodic solutions are secured. To visually depict the output, a variety of graphs featuring distinct shapes are produced in response to appropriate parameter values. The computational complexities and results emphasize the transparency, effectiveness, and ease of the technique, indicating the method’s applicability to many kinds of both static and dynamic nonlinear equations regarding evolutionary phenomena in computational physics, as well as other practical domains and research fields.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the presence of deep connections among dynamical equations, experimental data, physical systems, and statistical modeling, we report on a series of findings uncovered by the authors and collaborators during the last decade within the framework of the so-called Information Geometric Approach to Chaos (IGAC). The IGAC is a theoretical modeling scheme that combines methods of information geometry with inductive inference techniques to furnish probabilistic descriptions of complex systems in presence of limited information. In addition to relying on curvature and Jacobi field computations, a suitable indicator of complexity within the IGAC framework is given by the so-called information geometric entropy (IGE). The IGE is an information geometric measure of complexity of geodesic paths on curved statistical manifolds underlying the entropic dynamics of systems specified in terms of probability distributions. In this manuscript, we discuss several illustrative examples wherein our modeling scheme is employed to infer macroscopic predictions when only partial knowledge of the microscopic nature of a given system is available. Finally, we include comments on the strengths and weaknesses of the current version of our proposed theoretical scheme in our concluding remarks.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new method for constructing an approximate solution of the two-dimensional Laplace equation in an arbitrary doubly connected domain with smooth boundaries for Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using the fact that the solution of the Dirichlet problem in a doubly connected domain is represented as the sum of a solution of the Schwarz problem and a logarithmic function, we reduce the solution of the Schwartz problem to the Fredholm integral equation with respect to the boundary value of the conjugate harmonic function. The solution of the integral equation in its turn is reduced to solving a linear system with respect to the Fourier coefficients of the truncated expansion of the boundary value of the conjugate harmonic function. The unknown coefficient of the logarithmic component of the solution of the Dirichlet problem is determined from the following fact. The Cauchy integral over the boundary of the domain with a density that is the boundary value of the analytical in this domain function vanishes at points outside the domain. The resulting solution of the Dirichlet problem is the sum of the real part of the Cauchy integral in the given domain and the logarithmic function. In order to avoid singularities of the Cauchy integral at points near the boundary, the solution at these points is replaced by a linear function. The resulting numerical solution is continuous in the domain up to the boundaries. Three examples of the solution of the Dirichlet problem are given: one example demonstrates the solution with constant boundary conditions in the domain with a complicated boundary; the other examples provide a comparison of the approximate solution with the known exact solution in a noncircular domain.",

This study represents that the presence of compressive or/and rarefactive solitary waves depends mainly on the value of the first-order nonlinear coefficient.

In this paper, we propose a new FOPMD method for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging, which is called regularized fully spatial FOPMD (RFS-FOPMD), whose numerical scheme is also given based on Grünwald-Letnikov derivative (G-L derivative). Here, fully spatial FOPMD represents all the integer-order derivatives (IODs) in the right hand of Perona-Malik Diffusion (PMD) which are replaced by fractional-order derivatives (FODs). Since the new scheme has advantages of both regularization and FOPMD, it has good abilities in singularities preserving while suppressing noise. Some real sinogram of LDCT are used to compare the different performances not only for some classical but also for some state-of-art diffusion schemes. These schemes include PMD, regularized PMD (RPMD), and FOPMD in (Hu et al. 2012). Experimental results show that besides good ability in edge preserving, the new scheme also has good stability for iteration number and can avoid artifacts and speckle effect with suitable parameters.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are biochemical entities consisting of one or more blocks typically folded in a 3D pattern. Each block (a polypeptide) is a single linear sequence of amino acids that are biochemically bonded together. The amino acid sequence in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene or several genes encoded in the DNA-based genetic code. This genetic code typically uses twenty amino acids, but in certain organisms the genetic code can also include two other amino acids. After linking the amino acids during protein synthesis, each amino acid becomes a residue in a protein, which is then chemically modified, ultimately changing and defining the protein function. In this study, the authors analyze the amino acid sequence using alignment-free methods, aiming to identify structural patterns in sets of proteins and in the proteome, without any other previous assumptions. The paper starts by analyzing amino acid sequence data by means of histograms using fixed length amino acid words (tuples). After creating the initial relative frequency histograms, they are transformed and processed in order to generate quantitative results for information extraction and graphical visualization. Selected samples from two reference datasets are used, and results reveal that the proposed method is able to generate relevant outputs in accordance with current scientific knowledge in domains like protein sequence/proteome analysis.",

We describe natural principal bundle structures associated with M\\\"{o}bius structures. Fermion fields are associated with sections of vector bundles associated with the principal bundles while interaction fields (bosons) are associated with endomorphisms of the space of fermion fields. Classical quantum field theory (the Dirac equation and Maxwell's equations) is obtained by considering representations of the structure group $K\\subset U(2,2)$ of a principal bundle associated with a given M\\\"{o}bius structure where $K$, while being a subset of $U(2,2)$, is also isomorphic to $SL(2,{\\bf C})\\times U(1)$. The analysis requires the use of an intertwining operator between the action of $K$ on ${\\bf R}^4$ and the adjoint action action of $K$ on $u(2,2)$ and it is shown that the Feynman slash operator, in the chiral representation for the Dirac gamma matrices, has this intertwining property.",

In this paper, we propose a method that improves the principal component analysis method and makes data analysis easier and more efficient. Also, we first identify the relationships between the data by fitting the multivariate copula function to data and simulate new data using the estimated parameters; then, we reduce the dimensions of new data by principal component analysis method; the aim is to improve the performance of the principal component analysis method to find effective dimensions.",

In this context, our understanding of bistable signaling pathways in terms of mathematical modeling is of particular importance because such bistable components perform crucial functions in living cells. Bistable signaling pathways can act as switches or memory functions and can determine cell fate. In the present study, properties of mathematical models of bistable signaling pathways are examined from the perspective of synergetics, a theory of self-organization and pattern formation founded by Hermann Haken. At the heart of synergetics is the concept of so-called unstable modes or order parameters that determine the behavior of systems as a whole close to bifurcation points. How to determine these order parameters for bistable signaling pathways at saddle-node bifurcation points is shown. The procedure is outlined in general and an explicit example is worked out in detail.",

To solve this problem, a depth camera is proposed as a human position detection device in mechanical safety. The process of human position detection based on depth camera image information is given; it mainly includes image information acquisition, human presence detection, and distance measurement. Meanwhile, a human position detection method based on Intel RealSense depth camera and MobileNet-SSD algorithm is proposed and applied to robot safety protection. The result shows that the image information collected by the depth camera can detect the human position in real time, which can replace the existing mechanical safety human position detection device. At the same time, the depth camera can detect only human but not mobile devices and realize the separation and early warning of people and mobile devices.",

We numerically study the optimized efficiency at two optimum operations, which lies between the maximum and minimum efficiency. The minimum efficiency either takes the efficiency value at maximum power or the lowest possible value, zero. Using a unified criterion for energy converters, we find the optimum working condition for the heat engine. We study the optimized efficiency of a quantum dot heat engine according to the optimization criteria to find their corresponding optimized quantities in an external magnetic field (stochastic driving force). Accordingly, we found (1) efficiency-wise, optimized efficiency is better than efficiency at maximum power; (2) power-wise, the optimized power is smaller than its value at maximum power by <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mn>35</mn> <mi>%</mi> </math> ; and (3) period-wise, it performs the task in a cycle twice that of the period at maximum power. We study the overall performance of the heat engine by introducing a figure of merit that considers the contribution of each of the above quantities as a function of Carnot efficiency. Based on the proposed figure of merit, the model shows that the second optimization criteria are 3 times better than the first optimization criteria as a function of Carnot efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the free convection of nanofluids between a rectangular enclosure and a sinusoidal cylinder is numerically analyzed using the finite element method (FEM). Two-phase Buongiorno’s formulation was used to model the fluid layer, and Brinkman-Forchheimer equation was used to formulate the porous layer. The enclosure has a low temperature, while the cylinder is maintained at a high temperature. The governing equations are expressed in PDEs and converted into weak formulations (Galerkin FEM). In numerical simulations, the average concentration, the amplitude of undulated cylinder, the number of undulated, and the Rayleigh number are investigated. It is observed that the homogeneous nanofluid model could be valid for low heating intensity with higher waviness frequency and/or higher amplitude. The higher the alumina concentration, the higher the heat transfer rate. The heat transfer rate can be boosted by up to 13% by suspending 1% alumina particles. The heat transfer enhancement decreases with increasing the amplitude and/or increasing the waviness number.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the effect of a fractional constitutive model on the rheological properties of fluids and its application in numerical simulation are investigated, which is important to characterize the rheological properties of fluids and physical characteristics of materials more accurately. Based on this consideration, numerical simulation and analytical study of unsteady fractional Oldroyd-B viscoelastic flow are carried out. In order to improve the degree of accuracy, the mixed partial derivative including the fractional derivative in the differential equation is converted effectively by integrating by parts instead of by direct discretization. Then, the stability, convergence, and unique solvability of the difference scheme are verified. The validity of the finite difference method is tested by making comparisons with analytical solutions for two kinds of fractional Oldroyd-B viscoelastic flow. Numerical results obtained using the finite difference method are in good agreement with analytical solutions obtained via the variable separation method. Viscoelastic characteristics of the unsteady Poiseuille flow are similar to the second-order fluid or integer-order Oldroyd-B fluid when the parameter is close to 0 or to 1. Oscillation characteristics of fractional viscoelastic oscillatory flow are similar to those of the classical viscoelastic fluid under the same condition. Compared with the previous research, the present work studies the rheological properties of fluids with the finite difference method, and the application of fractional constitutive models in describing the rheological properties of fluids is developed. Meanwhile, more cases reflecting the fractional-order characteristics are given. The present method can accurately capture the flow characteristics of unsteady fractional Oldroyd-B viscoelastic fluid and is applicable for the generalized fractional fluid.",

The series solutions for the number of deviant people, the number of nondeviant people, the number of people quarantined, and the number of people recovered using the FPSM are unquestionably almost identical to the series solutions for same subgroups using the RPSM, with the exception that these series solutions have initial conditions of the subgroup of the population size.

    "abstract": "The current paper scrutinized the flow dynamics of Eyring–Powell nanofluid on porous stretching cylinder under the effects of magnetic field and viscous dissipation by employing Cattaneo–Christov theory. In order to study impacts of thermophoretic force and Brownian motion, the two-phase (Buongiorno) model is considered. As a consequence, very nonlinear PDEs that govern flow problem were formulated, transformed into ODEs via relevant similarity variables, as well as tackled by utilizing R-K-45 integration scheme along with the shooting technique in the MATLAB R2018a software. Consequently, the numerical simulations reveal that Eyring–Powell fluid, curvature, velocity ratio parameters have the propensity to raise nanofluid velocity. Nanofluid temperature shows an increasing pattern with magnetic, curvature, dissipative heating, and thermophoresis parameters. Besides, Prandtl number, Eyring–Powell fluid, velocity ratio, thermal relaxation time, and porous parameters indicate the declining impact against the nanofluid temperature. Hence, the porous medium reasonably and successfully managed nanofluid temperature as well as the overall thermal system in terms of system cooling. The concentration profile gets fall down with escalating values of Schmidt number, magnetic, curvature, dissipative heating, thermophoresis, Brownian motion, and solutal relaxation time parameters. Moreover, coefficient of the skin friction gets rise for larger values of Eyring–Powell fluid, magnetic and curvature parameters however porous medium and velocity ratio parameters reveal the opposite trends on it. The magnetic, curvature, Eyring–Powell fluid, velocity ratio, and dissipative heating parameters indicate increasing impacts on both Nusselt <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>N</mi> <mi>u</mi> </math> and Sherwood <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>S</mi> <mi>h</mi> </math> numbers even though both <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <mi>N</mi> <mi>u</mi> </math> and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <mi>S</mi> <mi>h</mi> </math> get cut down with the porous medium parameter.

Mutual media conversion for the angular momentum between photon polarization and electron spin is also achieved with high fidelity via positively charged exciton state without external magnetic field. This is a clear indication that the coupling of photon polarizations and electron spins keeps secured during whole processes before photon emission.

Using the integral transform method, analytical solutions to the axial velocity, azimuthal velocity, nonsymmetric force-stress tensor, and couple-stress vector are obtained. The obtained solutions incorporate the characteristic material length scale, which is essential to understand the fluid behavior at microscales. If characteristic length of the couple-stress fluid is zero, the results to the classical fluid are recovered. The influence of the scale parameter on the fluid velocity, axial flow rate, force-stress tensor, and couple-stress vector is analyzed by numerical calculus and graphical illustrations.

The governing partial differential equation of the boundary layer flow region is reduced to its corresponding ordinary differential equation using a similarity transformation technique. Then, the numerical method called the Galerkin finite element method (GFEM) is applied to solve the proposed fluid model. We performed a grid-invariance test or grid-convergence test to confirm the convergence of the series solution. The effects of the different noteworthy variables on velocity, temperature, concentration, local skin friction, local Nusselt number, and local Sherwood number are analyzed in both graphical and tabular forms. We have compared our result with the existing results in the literature, and it is shown that GFEM is accurate and efficient. Moreover, our result shows that the velocity field is retarded when the angle of inclination enhances and the heat transfer rate is reduced with larger values of the curvature of the cylinder.",

For certain simple but natural choices of extended potentials, we compute scalar field trajectories by projecting numerical solutions of the lifted equations of motion from the Poincar\\'e half-plane through the uniformization map, thus illustrating the rich cosmological dynamics of such models.",

By applying theory of stochastic differential equations to the numerical simulation of stochastic resonance problem, we simulate and analyze the system responses and pay close attention to stochastic control in the proposed systems. Then, the factors of influence to the SR are investigated by the Euler-Maruyama algorithm, Milstein algorithm, and fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm, respectively. The results show that the SR phenomenon can be generated in the proposed system under certain conditions by adjusting the parameters of the control effect with different noises. We also found that the type of the noise has little effect on the resonance peak of the output power spectrum density, which is not observed in conventional harmonic systems driven by multiplicative noise with only an overdamped term. Therefore, the conclusion of this paper can provide experimental basis for the further study of stochastic resonance.",

    "abstract": "The authors of this paper solve the fractional space-time advection-dispersion equation (ADE). In the advection-dispersion process, the solute movement being nonlocal in nature and the velocity of fluid flow being nonuniform, it leads to form a heterogeneous system which approaches to model the same by means of a fractional ADE which generalizes the classical ADE, where the time derivative is substituted through the Caputo fractional derivative. For the study of such fractional models, various numerical techniques are used by the researchers but the nonlocality of the fractional derivative causes high computational expenses and complex calculations so the challenge is to use an efficient method which involves less computation and high accuracy in solving such models numerically. Here, in order to get the FADE solved in the form of convergent infinite series, a novel method NHPM (natural homotopy perturbation method) is applied which couples Natural transform along with the homotopy perturbation method. The homotopy peturbation method has been applied in mathematical physics to solve many initial value problems expressed in the form of PDEs. Also, the HPM has an advantage over the other methods that it does not require any discretization of the domains, is independent of any physical parameters, and only uses an embedding parameter <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>p</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <mfenced open=\"[\" close=\"]\"> <mrow> <mn>0</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </mfenced> </math> . The HPM combined with the Natural transform leads to rapidly convergent series solutions with less computation. The efficacy of the used method is shown by working out some examples for time-fractional ADE with various initial conditions using the NHPM. The Mittag-Leffler function is used to solve the fractional space-time advection-dispersion problem, and the impact of changing the fractional parameter <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>α</mi> </math> on the solute concentration is shown for all the cases.",

In this paper, contact surface structure is described with the fractal theory and damping blade is simplified as 2-DOF cantilever beam model with lumped masses. By changing the position of the damper, lacing and shroud structure are separately simulated to study vibration absorption effect of damping blade. The results show that both shroud structure and lacing could not only dissipate energy but also change stiffness of blade. Under the same condition of normal pressure and contact surface, the damping effect of lacing is stronger than that of shroud structure. Meanwhile, the effect on changing blade stiffness of shroud structure is stronger than that of lacing. This paper proposed that there is at least one position of the blade, at which the damper dissipates the most vibration energy during a vibration cycle.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the processing of digital media images using a diffusion equation to increase the contrast of the image by stretching or extending the distribution of luminance data of the image to obtain clearer information of digital media images. In this paper, the image enhancement algorithm of nonlinear diffusion filtering is used to add a velocity term to the diffusion function using a coupled denoising model, which makes the diffusion of the original model smooth, and the interferogram is solved numerically with the help of numerical simulation to verify the denoising processing effect before and after the model correction. To meet the real-time applications in the field of video surveillance, this paper focuses on the optimization of the algorithm program, including software pipeline optimization, operation unit balancing, single instruction multiple data optimization, arithmetic operation optimization, and onchip storage optimization. These optimizations enable the nonlinear diffusion filter-based image enhancement algorithm to achieve high processing efficiency on the C674xDSP, with a processing speed of 25 posts per second for <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mn>640</mn> <mo>×</mo> <mn>480</mn> </math> size video images. Finally, the significance means a value of super pixel blocks is calculated in superpixel units, and the image is segmented into objects and backgrounds by combining with the Otsu threshold segmentation algorithm to mention the image. In this paper, the proposed algorithm experiments with several sets of Kor Kor resolution remote sensing images, respectively, and the Markov random field model and fully convolutional network (FCN) algorithm are used as the comparison algorithm. By comparing the experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively, it is shown that the algorithm in this paper has an obvious practical effect on contrast enhancement of digital media images and has certain practicality and superiority.",

The novelty of present research is that the first time-dependent Casson MHD flow of hybrid is addressed analytically in the form of a series solution along with flexible properties on an extending surface.

In this context, it is of practical significance to measure the logistics capacity of the core cities along the B&amp;R. Since combing domestic and overseas research, this paper first uses clustering analysis to screen out nine core cities along the B&amp;R and then uses fuzzy matter-element analysis to measure their urban logistics capacity and sort them. The results show that the urban logistics capacity in the eastern coastal areas of China is higher than that in northwest and southwest China. The logistics capacity of cities along “The 21st Century Sea Silk Road” is more robust than that of others and through the urban agglomeration could further achieve economies of scale. The logistics capacity of cities along the “Silk Road Economic Zone” should improve the construction of logistics infrastructure and enhance logistics information in the future.",

In the large detuning regime ( Δ = 1.5 meV), there is only one peak for maximum entanglement occurring at 625 picoseconds. Second, the entanglement dynamics is considered with decoherence by including the effects of spin‐nucleus and hole‐nucleus hyperfine interactions. In the small detuning regime, a decent amount of entanglement (35% entanglement) can only be obtained within 200 picoseconds of interaction. Afterward, all entanglement is lost. In the large detuning regime, a smaller amount of entanglement is realized, namely, 25%. And, it lasts only within the first 300 picoseconds.",

We conclude that in dynamical theories formulated whithin the category of supermanifolds, the space that classically parametrizes time (the real line ℝ ) must be replaced by the simplest linear supermanifold ℝ 1|1 . This supermanifold admits several different Lie supergroup structures, and we analyze from a group‐theoretic point of view what is the meaning of the usual covariant superderivatives, relating them to a change in the underlying group law.

In this paper, the relatively difficult multidimensional problem of solving the Saha equation is transformed into a one-dimensional problem in the simulation of capillary discharge by constructing an iteration equation about temperature. A coefficient is introduced to ensure the convergence of this iteration equation. In order to improve the computational efficiency, this coefficient is further optimized and the methods of setting the iteration initial value dynamically are introduced. Several simulation tests are conducted to study the performance of these two methods. The results show that the simulation runtime could be significantly reduced with the methods presented in this paper.",

    "abstract": "The electromagnetic vector fields, which are scattered off a highly conductive spheroid that is embedded within an otherwise lossless medium, are investigated in this contribution. A time-harmonic magnetic dipolar source, located nearby and operating at low frequencies, serves as the excitation primary field, being arbitrarily orientated in the three-dimensional space. The main idea is to obtain an analytical solution of this scattering problem, using the appropriate system of spheroidal coordinates, such that a possibly fast numerical estimation of the scattered fields could be useful for real data inversion. To this end, incident and scattered as well as total fields are written in a rigorous low-frequency manner in terms of positive integral powers of the real-valued wave number of the exterior environment. Then, the Maxwell-type problem is converted to interconnected Laplace’s or Poisson’s equations, complemented by the perfectly conducting boundary conditions on the spheroidal object and the necessary radiation behavior at infinity. The static approximation and the three first dynamic contributors are sufficient for the present study, while terms of higher orders are neglected at the low-frequency regime. Henceforth, the 3D scattering boundary value problems are solved incrementally, whereas the determination of the unknown constant coefficients leads either to concrete expressions or to infinite linear algebraic systems, which can be readily solved by implementing standard cut-off techniques. The nonaxisymmetric scattered magnetic and electric fields follow and they are obtained in an analytical compact fashion via infinite series expansions in spheroidal eigenfunctions. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of our analytical approach, the results are degenerated so as to recover the spherical case, which validates this approach.",

The nonlinear instantaneous equation which describes dynamics of nonwave entropy mode in the field of intense magnetoacoustic perturbations is the result of special projecting of the conservation equations in the differential form. It is analyzed in some physically meaningful cases; those are periodic magnetoacoustic perturbations and particular cases of heating-cooling function. A plasma is situated in the straight magnetic field with constant equilibrium magnetic strength which form constant angle with the direction of wave propagation. A plasma is initially uniform and equilibrium. The conclusions concern nonlinear effects of fast and slow magnetoacoustic perturbations and may be useful in direct and inverse problems.",

Several new classes of solutions are found to the governing equation by imposing various forms on one of the potentials. Interestingly, a complex transformation leads to an exact solution with only real metric functions. All solutions are written in terms of elementary functions. We demonstrate graphically that the fluid pressure, energy density, and heat flux are well behaved for the model, and the model is consistent with a core-envelope framework.",

In addition, the probability density function of the eigenvalues of turbulence dissipation tensor is presented. The isotropic subrange of PDF always exists in swirling flows relevant to small-scale vortex structure. Thus, with remarkable large-scale vortex breakdown, the isotropic subrange of PDF is reduced in strongly swirling flows, and anisotropic energy dissipation is proven to exist in the core region of the vortex breakdown. More specifically, strong anisotropic turbulence dissipation occurs concentratively in the vortex breakdown region, whereas nearly isotropic turbulence dissipation occurs dispersively in the peripheral region of the strong swirling flows.",

However, a) the explicit scheme of the circuit is only given and no design rules are provided, b) the existence of losses is implicitly assumed, c) the attack has been formulated against qubit based protocol only and it is not clear whether it can be adapted to higher dimensional systems. These deficiencies are removed in the presented contribution. A new generic eavesdropping scheme built on a firm theoretical background is proposed. In contrast to the previous approach, it does not refer to the properties of the vacuum state, so it is fully consistent with the absence of losses assumption. Moreover, the scheme applies to the communication paradigm based on signal particles of any dimensionality. It is also shown that some well known attacks are special cases of the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth study and analysis of human action recognition in dancesport video images through chaotic system equations. A novel fractional-order chaotic system model with hidden multistability is constructed. Since this fractional-order chaotic system has no equilibrium point, the equilibrium point stability analysis is not required. The effect of system parameters on the multistability characteristics of the fractional-order chaotic system is investigated in depth by using the control variable method and nonlinear dynamic tools. In addition, the system has a special property of offset incremental control, which makes the system more widely and practically useful in engineering applications. Finally, circuit simulation experiments and hardware circuit experiments are conducted for the fractional-order chaotic system, and the results are consistent with the corresponding theoretical analysis. The system architecture of the mobile augmented reality-based ethnic dynamic art display system is designed, and the system architecture adopts a hierarchical design. The experimental results show that the design method of the mobile augmented reality-based dynamic art display system proposed in this thesis can meet the purpose of expanding the ways of dancesport display, and the system designed in this thesis is customizable and the synthesized images have a high sense of realism.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we geometrically analyze the relation between a point vortex system and deviation curvatures on the Jacobi field. First, eigenvalues of deviation curvatures are calculated from relative distances of point vortices in a three point vortex system. Afterward, based on the assumption of self-similarity, time evolutions of eigenvalues of deviation curvatures are shown. The self-similar motions of three point vortices are classified into two types, expansion and collapse, when the relative distances vary monotonously. Then, we find that the eigenvalues of self-similarity are proportional to the inverse fourth power of relative distances. The eigenvalues of the deviation curvatures monotonically convergent to zero for expansion, whereas they monotonically diverge for collapse, which indicates that the strengths of interactions between point vortices related to the time evolution of spatial geometric structure in terms of the deviation curvatures. In particular, for collapse, the collision point becomes a geometric singularity because the eigenvalues of the deviation curvature diverge. These results show that the self-similar motions of point vortices are classified by eigenvalues of the deviation curvature. Further, nonself-similar expansion is numerically analyzed. In this case, the eigenvalues of the deviation curvature are nonmonotonous but converge to zero, suggesting that the motion of the nonself-similar three point vortex system is also classified by eigenvalues of the deviation curvature.",

The feature module is a complex gesture recognition module based on hidden Markov model gesture features, which applies the hidden Markov model features to gesture recognition and performs the recognition of complex gestures made by combining simple gestures based on simple gesture recognition. The combination of the two modules forms the overall technology of this paper, which can be applied to many scenarios, including some special scenarios with high-security levels that require real-time feedback and some public indoor scenarios, which can achieve different prevention and services for different age groups. With the increase of the depth of the feature extraction network, the experimental effect is enhanced; however, the two-dimensional convolutional neural network loses temporal information when extracting features, so the three-dimensional convolutional network is used in this paper to extract features from the video in time and space. Multiple binary classifications of the extracted features are performed to achieve the goal of multilabel classification. A multistream residual neural network is used to extract features from video data of three modalities, and the extracted feature vectors are fed into the attention mechanism network, then, the more critical information for video recognition is selected from a large amount of spatiotemporal information, further learning the temporal dependencies existing between consecutive video frames, and finally fusing the multistream network outputs to obtain the final prediction category. By training and optimizing the model in an end-to-end manner, recognition accuracies of 92.7% and 64.4% are achieved on the dataset, respectively.",

Based on this approach, this paper describes the specific forms of exercise content, movement characteristics, and skill levels in the table tennis framework and specifies the calculation methods of motion capture and movement characteristics suitable for table tennis. Meanwhile, to further improve the accuracy of the inertial motion capture system in restoring the position posture of the trainees, this paper improves the original inertial motion capture system from two aspects: contact judgment of both feet and correction of the position posture based on the contact position constraint. The simulation results show that the corrected human posture has good action smoothness. This paper first proposes a knowledge-based generic sports-assisted training framework based on generalizing the traditional sports training model. The framework contains four main modules: domain knowledge, trainees, sport evaluation, and controller. The domain knowledge module is a digital representation of the knowledge of the exercise content, improvement instructions, and skill indicators of the sport; the trainee module is the active response of the trainee to the exercise content and improvement instructions; the motion evaluation module uses motion capture technology to obtain the raw motion data of the trainee and further calculates the motion characteristics; the controller module proposes improvement instructions to the trainee or makes him/her practice new content based on the results of the motion evaluation. Based on the results of the motion evaluation, the controller module proposes improvement instructions or makes the trainee practice new content until the trainee achieves the desired goal.",

We start this paper with the presentation of the notions related to the projection postulate. Then we remind that the argument of Einstein‐Podolsky‐Rosen against completeness of QM was based on the version of the projection postulate which is nowadays called Lüders postulate. Then we recall that all basic measurements on composite systems are represented by observables with degenerate spectra. This implies that the difference in the formulation of the projection postulate (due to von Neumann and Lüders) should be taken into account seriously in the analysis of the basic constructions of quantum information theory. This paper is a review devoted to such an analysis.",

The severe difficulties emerging from the literature lead us to argue about the way to follow, and in a preliminary stage, we consider how to proceed in order to provide a reasonable contribution to the conceptualization of information in classical and quantum physics. We conclude that we should go toward the essential elements of the system that acquire information and should define the common components of the measurement processes. In this way we should be able to establish fundamental properties and to circumvent tricky difficulties arisen by the concept of the observer and the variety of interferences that disturb the acquisition of information. Universal experience shows how sharpness is the indispensable feature of detected signals and we calculate the discernability of observables using various mathematical formalisms. The present logical frame brings evidence on how information is not an absolute quantity, and we close with a few notes on the information relativism which modern literature tackles from the operational stance and the philosophical stance.",

    "abstract": "Globally, cyanobacteria blooms frequently occur, and effective prediction of cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and reservoirs could constitute an essential proactive strategy for water-resource protection. However, cyanobacteria blooms are very complicated because of the internal stochastic nature of the system evolution and the external uncertainty of the observation data. In this study, an adaptive-clustering algorithm is introduced to obtain some typical operating intervals. In addition, the number of nearest neighbors used for modeling was optimized by particle swarm optimization. Finally, a fuzzy linear regression method based on error-correction was used to revise the model dynamically near the operating point. We found that the combined method can characterize the evolutionary track of cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and reservoirs. The model constructed in this paper is compared to other cyanobacteria-bloom forecasting methods (e.g., phase space reconstruction and traditional-clustering linear regression), and, then, the average relative error and average absolute error are used to compare the accuracies of these models. The results suggest that the proposed model is superior. As such, the newly developed approach achieves more precise predictions, which can be used to prevent the further deterioration of the water environment.",

    "abstract": "A predator-prey model incorporating individual behavior is presented, where the predator-prey interaction is described by a classical Lotka-Volterra model with self-limiting prey; predators can use the behavioral tactics of rock-paper-scissors to dispute a prey when they meet. The predator behavioral change is described by replicator equations, a game dynamic model at the fast time scale, whereas predator-prey interactions are assumed acting at a relatively slow time scale. Aggregation approach is applied to combine the two time scales into a single one. The analytical results show that predators have an equal probability to adopt three strategies at the stable state of the predator-prey interaction system. The diversification tactics taking by predator population benefits the survival of the predator population itself, more importantly, it also maintains the stability of the predator-prey system. Explicitly, immediate contest behavior of predators can promote density of the predator population and keep the preys at a lower density. However, a large cost of fighting will cause not only the density of predators to be lower but also preys to be higher, which may even lead to extinction of the predator populations.",

By using the basic definitions of fractional calculus, we introduced the fractional order form of the fourth-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation. The resulting boundary value fractional problems are solved by the new iterative and Picard methods. Convergence of the considered methods is confirmed by obtaining absolute residual errors for approximate solutions for various Reynolds number. The comparisons of the solutions for various Reynolds number and various values of the fractional order confirm that the two methods are identical and therefore are suitable for solving this kind of problems. Finally, the effects of various Reynolds number on the solution are also studied graphically.",

We use a perturbation theory for small coupling between the lattices to perform the analysis, which is then confirmed by numerical calculations. Such analysis is based on the concept of the so-called anticontinuum limit approach. We consider the fundamental onsite and intersite bright solitons. Each solution has symmetric and antisymmetric configurations between the arms. The stability of the solutions is then determined by solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem. We obtain that both symmetric and antisymmetric onsite mode can be stable for small coupling, in contrast to the reported continuum limit where the antisymmetric solutions are always unstable. The instability is either due to the internal modes crossing the origin or the appearance of a quartet of complex eigenvalues. In general, the gain-loss term can be considered parasitic as it reduces the stability region of the onsite solitons. Additionally, we analyse the dynamic behaviour of the onsite and intersite solitons when unstable, where typically it is either in the form of travelling solitons or soliton blow-ups.",

In all these pseudotensorial prescriptions the momenta are found to vanish, while the Landau-Lifshitz and Weinberg prescriptions give the same result for the energy distribution. In addition, the limiting behavior of the energy for the cases r tends toward infinity, r=0 and q=0 is studied. The special case {\\mu}=4 and {\\alpha}=3 is also examined.

Due to the subjectivity, low efficiency, and low level of intelligence in the existing product form innovation design methods in the mining of design goals. This study combines the semantic dictionary of Tongyici Cilin with Kansei engineering theory and uses clustering analysis algorithm, semantic difference method, and word similarity calculation method to realize product Kansei image design. Tongyici Cilin is a computable Chinese semantic dictionary. In this study, we innovatively introduced Tongyici Cilin into the image word similarity calculation in product image design. First, the product image design process based on Tongyici Cilin is proposed. Then, we establish a model of image word similarity calculation using the common distance, difference distance, common adjustment parameter, and differential adjustment parameter. By comparing with international standard data, it is confirmed that the image word similarity calculation model proposed in this article is effective and efficient. Using the sedan image design of middle-aged, middle-income men as an example, the sedan form style of each target image was successfully derived from the Internet-based questionnaire. Based on the case studies, we determined that it is effective to use the Tongyici Cilin semantic dictionary to determine the target image and improve the efficiency of product image design.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy graph (FG) models take on the presence being ubiquitous in environmental and fabricated structures by human, specifically the vibrant processes in physical, biological, and social systems. Owing to the unpredictable and indiscriminate data which are intrinsic in real-life, problems being often ambiguous, so it is very challenging for an expert to exemplify those problems through applying an FG. Vague graph structure (VGS), belonging to FGs family, has good capabilities when facing with problems that cannot be expressed by FGs. VGSs have a wide range of applications in the field of psychological sciences as well as the identification of individuals based on oncological behaviors. Therefore, in this paper, we apply the concept of vague sets (VSs) to GS. We define certain notions, VGS, strong vague graph structure (SVGS), and vague <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <msub> <mrow> <mi>β</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>i</mi> </mrow> </msub> </math> -cycle and describe these notions by several examples.

Excellent segmentation results can directly affect the accuracy of image recognition and processing. The essence of image segmentation is to segment each frame of a certain image or a video into multiple specific objects or regions and represent them with different labels. This paper focuses on the segmentation results obtained in image segmentation of images used for intelligent monitoring of Mandarin exams are usually visualized for image analysis. In this paper, we first investigate the performance improvement techniques for semantic segmentation in the image segmentation task for intelligent monitoring of Mandarin exams, improve the pixel classification capability by performing semantic migration, and, for the first time, extend the dataset substantially by style transformation to improve the model’s recognition of advanced features. In addition, to further address the shortcomings of the dataset, this paper improves the performance of image segmentation using synthetic datasets by investigating synthetic dataset image segmentation improvement techniques that reduce the reliance on manually annotated datasets. Image segmentation techniques continue to advance, and there are even thousands of commonly used segmentation methods for image segmentation development to date. Among them, they can be broadly classified as region-based segmentation methods, threshold-based segmentation methods, edge-based segmentation methods, specific theory-based segmentation methods, and deep learning-based segmentation methods. However, the methods used in this paper have all been experimentally demonstrated to improve the effectiveness of the techniques and proved to outperform other existing methods in the same field in the publicly available datasets LSUN, Cityscapes, and GTA5 datasets, respectively.",

Once the oil spill accident happens, it not only causes huge economic loss, but also kills the marine ecological environment. Oil spill trajectory model considers almost all weathering processes including evaporation, emulsification, dispersion, dissolution, photooxidation, sedimentation, and biodegradation. Model simulations indicated that both tidal currents and wind drag force have significant effect in oil spill movement. The dominant wind in the area is South-westerly wind during the summer monsoon and North-easterly wind during the winter monsoon, but South-westerly wind is far stronger and last longer than the North-easterly wind. As a result, oil spill trajectory is most likely towards offshore to North-east during the summer period (April to September). During the winter period (November–January), oil spill would move towards shore under North-westerly winds. Once oil reaches shore, it would stay at shore permanently and eventually sink to seabed or beach in the simulation. Although the model does not consider longshore drift by waves, oil movement along shore by waves would be a slow process. Therefore, the impact of oil spill during the winter monsoon would be limited to local area around Ras Markaz.",

One of the interesting phenomena involved in this issue is that diseases may or may not die out when the basic reproduction number falls below unity (i.e., a backward bifurcation may exist and cause multistability). The disease eventually becomes endemic in the population when the basic reproduction number exceeds one. By comparing different vaccination rates, vaccine efficacy, and infection rate factors, the diseases can be eliminated, not only by vaccines but also by strict protective measures. In addition, we used the COVID-19 number of reported cases in Xiamen in September 2021 to fit the model, and the model and the reported data were well matched.",

Firstly, a sufficient criterion for universal asymptotic stability of RNNs with integral time-varying delays is obtained by estimating a tight upper bound of augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) derivative with inequality scaling technique and mutually convex combined inequality. Secondly, in order to eliminate the time that error system state trajectory slides along sliding mode flow pattern until convergence at the origin, based on drive response and SMC theory, a suitable sliding mode controller is designed by considering that sliding mode flow pattern is equal to synchronization error. Finally, maximum allowable upper bound of delay under different delay derivatives are obtained by considering trajectory change of input function under different initial value. Synchronization trajectory of drive and response systems with mismatched parameters and activation functions under the influence of controller are studied, and synchronization time which is required for error system to reach stability is obtained. Simulation results show that the introduction of integral delay can be more comprehensive from both difference and area, so that drive system state is eventually steady at equilibrium point and synchronized with response system. Stability criterion of this paper not only has less conservative and computation complexity but also has shorter synchronization control time.",

    "abstract": "This work conducts a numerical investigation of convection heat transfer within two composite enclosures. These enclosures consist of porous and nanofluidic layers, where the porous layers are saturated with the same nanofluid. The first enclosure has two porous layers of different sizes and permeabilities, while the second is separated by a single porous layer. As the porous layer thickness approaches zero, both enclosures transition to clear nanofluid enclosures. The study uses the Navier–Stokes equations to govern fluid flow in the nanofluid domain and the Brinkman–Forchheimer extended Darcy model to describe flow within the saturated porous layer. Numerical solutions are obtained using an iterative finite difference method. Key parameters studied include the porous thickness ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mn>0.0</mn> <mo>≤</mo> <mi>S</mi> <mo>≤</mo> <mn>1.0</mn> </math> ), the nanoparticle volume fraction ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mn>0.0</mn> <mo>≤</mo> <mi>ϕ</mi> <mo>≤</mo> <mn>0.05</mn> </math> ), the thermal conductivity ratio ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <mn>0.5</mn> <mo>≤</mo> <msub> <mi>R</mi> <mi>k</mi> </msub> <mo>≤</mo> <mn>10</mn> </math> ), and the Darcy number ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <msup> <mn>10</mn> <mrow> <mo>−</mo> <mn>5</mn> </mrow> </msup> <mo>≤</mo> <mi>D</mi> <mi>a</mi> <mo>≤</mo> <msup> <mn>10</mn> <mrow> <mo>−</mo> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msup> </math> ).

One of the major concerns is the ability to sum such series in closed form so that one can better understand the structural and functional behavior of the basic physics problems. The purpose of this review article is to present some of the recent methods for providing such series in closed form with applications to: (i) the summation of Kapteyn series for radiation from pulsars; (ii) the summation of other Kapteyn series in radiation problems; (iii) Kapteyn series arising in terahertz sideband spectra of quantum systems modulated by an alternating electromagnetic field; and (iv) some plasma problems involving sums of Bessel functions and their closed form summation using variations of the techniques developed for Kapteyn series. In addition, a short review is given of some other Kapteyn series to illustrate the ongoing deep interest and involvement of scientists in such problems and to provide further techniques for attempting to sum divers Kapteyn series.",

We show that an archetypal quantum Cheshire Cat, a paradox of a separation between a position of a quantum particle, a photon, and its internal property, the polarization, in a two-path Mach–Zehnder setting, is robust to decoherence caused by a bosonic infinite bath locally coupled to the polarization of a photon. Decoherence affects either the cat or its grin depending on which of the two paths is noisy. For a pure decoherence, in an absence of photon–environment energy exchange, we provide exact results for weak values of the photon position and polarization indicating that the information loss affects the quantum Cheshire Cat only qualitatively and the paradox survives. We show that it is also the case beyond the pure decoherence for a small rate of dissipation.",

A new quantitative index using knowledge of control centrality and condition number is constructed to measure the controllability of given networks. For complex networks with different controllable subspace dimensions, their controllability is mainly determined by the control centrality factor. For the complex networks that have the equal controllable subspace dimension, their different controllability is mostly determined by the condition number of subnetworks’ controllability matrix. Then the effect of this index is analyzed based on simulations on various types of network topologies, such as ER random network, WS small-world network, and BA scale-free network. The results show that the presented index could reflect the holistic controllability of complex networks. Such an endeavour could help us better understand the relationship between controllability and network topology.",

An adaptive tracking control law and an adaptive synchronization control law are proposed based on backstepping and Lyapunov stability theory. The adaptive laws of the unknown parameters are derived by using the Lyapunov stability theory. To handle the effect caused by the input saturation, an auxiliary system is used to compensate the tracking error and synchronization error. The proposed adaptive tracking control and synchronization schemes ensure the effects of tracking and synchronization. Several examples have been detailed to illuminate the design procedure.",

The performances of these new methods and Hardy Cross method were compared by solving a sample pipe network considering four different scenarios (92 cases). The results show that the one-step methods improve the rate of convergence of the Hardy Cross method in 10 out of 24 cases (41%), while this improvement was found to be 39 out of 56 cases (69.64%) and 5 out of 8 cases (62.5%) for the two-step and three-step methods, respectively.

Making use of the solutions of the resulting differential equations, we determined the mean photon number for the cavity mode and their correlation, EPR variables, smallest eigenvalue of the symplectic matrix, intensity difference fluctuation, and photon number correlation. It is found that the squeezed vacuum reservoir increases the degree of the statistical and nonclassical features of light produced by the system. Furthermore, using the criteria developed by logarithm negativity and Hillery-Zubairy criteria, the quantum entanglement of the cavity mode is quantified.

    "abstract": "The research in this paper mainly includes as follows: for the principle of action recognition based on the 3D diffusion model convolutional neural network, the whole detection process is carried out from fine to coarse using a bottom-up approach; for the human skeleton detection accuracy, a multibranch multistage cascaded CNN structure is proposed, and this network structure enables the model to learn the relationship between the joints of the human body from the original image and effectively predict the occluded parts, allowing simultaneous prediction of skeleton point positions and skeleton point association information on the one hand, and refinement of the detection results in an iterative manner on the other. For the combination problem of discrete skeleton points, it is proposed to take the limb parts formed between skeleton points as information carriers, construct the skeleton point association information model using vector field, and consider it as a feature, to obtain the relationship between different skeleton points by using the detection method. It is pointed out that the reorganization problem of discrete skeleton points in multiperson scenes is an NP-Hard problem, which can be simplified by decomposing it into a set of subproblems of bipartite graph matching, thus proposing a matching algorithm for discrete skeleton points and optimizing it for the skeleton dislocation and algorithm problems of human occlusion. Compared with traditional two-dimensional images, audio, video, and other multimedia data, the 3D diffusion model data describe the 3D geometric morphological information of the target scene and are not affected by lighting changes, rotation, and scale transformation of the target and thus can describe the realistic scene more comprehensively and realistically. With the continuous updating of diffusion model acquisition equipment, the rapid development of 3D reconstruction technology, and the continuous enhancement of computing power, the research on the application of 3D diffusion model in the detection and extraction of a human skeleton in sports dance videos has become a hot direction in the field of computer vision and computer graphics. Among them, the feature detection description and model alignment of 3D nonrigid models are a fundamental problem with very important research value and significance and challenging at the same time, which has received wide attention from the academic community.",

    "abstract": "Film video noise can usually be defined as the error information visible on the video image, caused by the digital signal system. This distortion is inevitably present in the video obtained by various camera equipment. Noise reduction techniques are important preprocessing processes in many video processing applications, and its main goal is to reduce the noise contained in a video image while preserving as much of its edge and texture information as possible. In this paper, we describe in detail the principles of the space-time noise reduction filter, propose a 3D-filter algorithm for Gaussian noise, an improved 3D-filter algorithm based on the 3D-BDP (bloom-deep-split) filter for mixed noise, and a filter algorithm for luminance and color noise in low-brightness scenes. By dissecting the partial differential equation (PDE) denoising process, we establish a new iterative denoising algorithm. The partial differential equation method can be considered as the iterative denoising of the filter, and the first stage of the new algorithm uses wavelet-domain adaptive Wiener filter as the filtering base and achieves good results by adjusting the parameters. The proposed model in this paper is compared with the existing denoising model, and the analysis results show that the model proposed in this section can effectively remove multiplicative noise. The experimental report shows that the parameters set by the algorithm have some stability and can achieve good processing results for multiple images, which is an advantage over the partial differential equation method for denoising. The second stage of the algorithm uses the appropriate partial differential equation method to remove the pseudo-Gibbs in the first stage, which further improves the performance of the algorithm. After the image containing Gaussian noise is processed by the new algorithm, the pseudo-Gibbs effect, which often occurs in wavelet denoising, is eliminated, and the step effect, which occurs in partial differential equation denoising, is avoided; the details are better preserved, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio is improved, and a large number of experiments show that it is an effective denoising method.",

    "abstract": "The signal corresponding to English speech contains a lot of redundant information and environmental interference information, which will produce a lot of distortion in the process of English speech translation signal recognition. Based on this, a large number of studies focus on encoding and processing English speech, so as to achieve high-precision speech recognition. The traditional wavelet denoising algorithm plays an obvious role in the recognition of English speech translation signals, which mainly depends on the excellent local time-frequency domain characteristics of the wavelet signal algorithm, but the traditional wavelet signal algorithm is still difficult to select the recognition threshold, and the recognition accuracy is easy to be affected. Based on this, this paper will improve the traditional wavelet denoising algorithm, abandon the single-threshold judgment of the original traditional algorithm, innovatively adopt the combination of soft threshold and hard threshold, further solve the distortion problem of the denoising algorithm in the process of English speech translation signal recognition, improve the signal-to-noise ratio of English speech recognition, and further reduce the root mean square error of the signal. Good noise reduction effect is realized, and the accuracy of speech recognition is improved. In the experiment, the algorithm is compared with the traditional algorithm based on MATLAB simulation software. The simulation results are consistent with the actual theoretical results. At the same time, the algorithm proposed in this paper has obvious advantages in the recognition accuracy of English speech translation signals, which reflects the superiority and practical value of the algorithm.",

A multifeature fusion face live detection method based on diffusion model extracts Diffusion Kernel (DK) features and depth features from diffusion-processed face images, respectively. DK features provide a nonlinear description of the correlation between successive face images and express face image sequences in the temporal dimension; depth features are extracted by a pretrained depth neural network model that can express the complex nonlinear mapping relationships of images and reflect the more abstract implicit information inside face images. To improve the effectiveness of the face image features, the extracted DK features and depth features are fused using a multicore learning method to obtain the best combination and the corresponding weights. The two features complement each other, and the fused features are more discriminative, which provides a strong basis for the live determination of face images. Experiments show that the method has excellent performance and can effectively discriminate the live nature of faces in images and resist forged face attacks. Based on the above face detection and expression recognition algorithms, the classroom concentration analysis system based on expression recognition is designed to achieve real-time acquisition and processing of classroom images, complete student classroom attendance records using face detection and face recognition methods, and analyze students’ concentration from the face integrity and facial expression of students facing the blackboard by combining face detection and expression recognition to visualize and display students’ classroom data for teachers, students, and parents with more data support and help.",

In this paper, we devote ourselves to consider the evolutoids of the regular mixed-type curves in <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <c:msubsup> <c:mrow> <c:mi>ℝ</c:mi> </c:mrow> <c:mrow> <c:mn>1</c:mn> </c:mrow> <c:mrow> <c:mn>2</c:mn> </c:mrow> </c:msubsup> </c:math> . As the angle of lightlike vector and nonlightlike vector can not be defined, we introduce the evolutoids of the nonlightlike regular curves in <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <e:msubsup> <e:mrow> <e:mi>ℝ</e:mi> </e:mrow> <e:mrow> <e:mn>1</e:mn> </e:mrow> <e:mrow> <e:mn>2</e:mn> </e:mrow> </e:msubsup> </e:math> and give the conception of the <g:math xmlns:g=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <g:mi>σ</g:mi> </g:math> -transform first. On this basis, we define the evolutoids of the regular mixed-type curves by using a lightcone frame. Then, we study when does the evolutoid of a mixed-type curve have singular points and discuss the relationship of the type of the points of the mixed-type curve and the type of the points of its evolutoid.",

The models are constructed through the junction of two exact solutions of the Einstein field equations: an interior collapsing fluid solution and a vacuum exterior solution. The vacuum exterior solutions are either static or containing gravitational waves. We then review the global geometrical properties of the matched solutions which, besides black holes, may include the existence of naked singularities and wormholes. In the case of radiating exteriors, we show that the data at the boundary can be chosen to be, in some sense, arbitrarily close to the data for the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini solution.",

It is known that geometric distribution weight information of image data plays an important role in machine learning approaches. However, FLDA does not employ the geometric distribution weight information of facial images in the training stage. Hence, its recognition accuracy will be affected. In order to enhance the classification power of FLDA method, this paper utilizes radial basis function (RBF) with fractional order to model the geometric distribution weight information of the training samples and proposes a novel geometric distribution weight information based Fisher discriminant criterion. Subsequently, a geometric distribution weight information based LDA (GLDA) algorithm is developed and successfully applied to face recognition. Two publicly available face databases, namely, ORL and FERET databases, are selected for evaluation. Compared with some LDA-based algorithms, experimental results exhibit that our GLDA approach gives superior performance.",

First, the batch process with ILC was derived as a two-dimensional autoregressive and moving average (2D-ARMA) model. Then two kinds of stability indices are constructed based on the innerwise matrix through the identification of the 2D-ARMA. Finally, the statistical process control (SPC) chart was adopted to monitor those stability indices. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

It played a key role in the construction of heterotic-string models with an anomaly free extra $Z^\\prime$ symmetry that may remain unbroken down to low energy scales. A generic signature of the low scale string derived $Z^\\prime$ model is via di-photon excess that may be within reach of the LHC. A fascinating possibility is that the spinor-vector duality symmetry is rooted in the structure of the heterotic-string compactifications to two dimensions. The two dimensional heterotic-string theories are in turn related to the so-called moonshine symmetries that underlie the two dimensional compactifications. In this paper we embark on exploration of this connection by the free fermionic formulation to classify the symmetries of the two dimensional heterotic-string theories. We use two complementary approaches in our classification. The first utilises a construction which is akin to the one used in the spinor-vector duality. Underlying this method is the triality property of $SO(8)$ representations. In the second approach we use the free fermionic tools to classify the twenty four dimensional Niemeier lattices.",

The insurer’s dynamic income is given by the remainder after a dynamic reward budget being subtracted from the insurer’s net premium which is calculated according to expected premium principle. Applying stochastic control technique, a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is established and the explicit solution is obtained under the objective of maximizing the insurer’s power utility of terminal wealth. Some economic interpretations of the obtained results are explained in detail. In addition, numerical analysis and several graphics are given to illustrate our results more meticulous.",

Next, we introduce a fully discrete approximation of the variational problem based on a finite element method and on an implicit time integration scheme. We study this fully discrete approximation schemes and bound the errors of the approximate solutions. Under regularity assumptions imposed on the exact solution, optimal order error estimates are derived for the fully discrete solution. Finally, after recalling the solution of the frictional contact problem, some numerical simulations are provided in order to illustrate both the behavior of the solution related to the frictional contact conditions and the theoretical error estimate result.",

In all these cases, the parameter indexing the family measures the behavior (regularity, decay properties) of particular functions or operators. It turns out that all these space families are, or contain, scales or lattices of Banach spaces, which are special cases of partial inner product spaces (PIP‐ spaces ). In this context, it is often said that such families should be taken as a whole and operators, bases, and frames on them should be defined globally, for the whole family, instead of individual spaces. In this paper, we will give an overview of PIP‐spaces and operators on them, illustrating the results by space families of interest in mathematical physics and signal analysis. The interesting fact is that they allow a global definition of operators, and various operator classes on them have been defined.",

Here, we prove that small noise could also induce the group to achieve truth in heterogenous HK model, and, moreover, we first theoretically prove that large noise could drive some agents to deviate from the truth.

We perform an analysis of stability of binary adsorption with second-order kinetics in multiple ways. We address perturbations around the steady state analytically, first in a classical way, then by introducing Langevin forces and analyzing the reaction flux and cross-correlations, then by applying the stochastic chemical master equation approach, and finally, numerically, by using stochastic simulation algorithms. Our results show that stationary states in this model are stable nodes. Hence, experimental results with purported oscillations in response should be addressed from the point of view of fluctuations and noise analysis.",

Moreover, this paper considers the flight speed of the ballistic missile and the flow of the exhaust plume. Then the effects of different seasons, locations, and time zones on the release are compared. The results show that H 2 O can effectively dissipate background electrons to form spindle-shaped holes after release in the ionosphere. The height of the cavity radius corresponds to the peak of electron density of the background ionosphere, and the daytime dissipation is stronger than the nighttime dissipation, dissipation at low latitude is stronger than that at high latitude, and the seasonal difference is not obvious.",

Predictive functions are developed to derive both point prediction and interval prediction based on type-II censored data, where the median Bayesian estimation is a novel formulation to get Bayesian sample prediction, as the integral for calculating the Bayesian prediction directly does not exist. All kinds of predictions are obtained with symmetric and asymmetric loss functions. Two sample techniques are considered, and gamma conjugate prior density is assumed. Illustrative examples are provided for all the scenarios considered in this article. Both illustrative examples with real data and the Monte Carlo simulation are carried out to show the new method is acceptable. The results show that Bayesian and E-Bayesian predictions with the two kinds of loss functions have little difference for the point prediction, and E-Bayesian confidence interval (CI) with the two kinds of loss functions are almost similar and they are more accurate for the interval prediction.",

The Kaluza framework reproduces known physics exactly when the scalar field goes to one, so we studied perturbations of the scalar field around unity, as is done for gravity in the Newtonian limit of general relativity. A suite of interesting phenomena unknown to the Kaluza literature is revealed: planetary masses are clothed in scalar field, which contributes 25% of the mass-energy of the clothed mass; the scalar potential around a planet is positive, compared with the negative gravitational potential; at laboratory scales, the scalar charge which couples to the scalar field is quadratic in electric charge; a new length scale of physics is encountered for the static scalar field around an electrically-charged mass, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <msub> <mrow> <mi>L</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>s</mi> </mrow> </msub> <mo>=</mo> <msub> <mrow> <mi>μ</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>0</mn> </mrow> </msub> <msup> <mrow> <mi>Q</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msup> <mo>/</mo> <mi>M</mi> </math> ; the scalar charge of elementary particles is proportional to the electric charge, making the scalar force indistinguishable from the atomic electric force. An unduly strong electrogravitic buoyancy force is predicted for electrically-charged objects in the planetary scalar field, and this calculation appears to be the first quantitative falsification of the Kaluza unification. Since the simplest classical field, a long-range scalar field, is expected in nature, and since the Kaluza scalar field is as weak as gravity, we suggest that if there is an error in this calculation, it is likely to be in the magnitude of the coupling to the scalar field, not in the existence or magnitude of the scalar field itself.",

    "abstract": "The optical properties of metallic nanoparticles are well known, but the study of their thermal behavior is in its infancy. However the local heating of surrounding medium, induced by illuminated nanostructures, opens the way to new sensors and devices. Consequently the accurate calculation of the electromagnetically induced heating of nanostructures is of interest. The proposed multiphysics problem cannot be directly solved with the classical refinement method of Comsol Multiphysics and a 3D adaptive remeshing process based on an a posteriori error estimator is used. In this paper the efficiency of three remeshing strategies for solving the multiphysics problem is compared. The first strategy uses independent remeshing for each physical quantity to reach a given accuracy. The second strategy only controls the accuracy on temperature. The third strategy uses a linear combination of the two normalized targets (the electric field intensity and the temperature). The analysis of the performance of each strategy is based on the convergence of the remeshing process in terms of number of elements. The efficiency of each strategy is also characterized by the number of computation iterations, the number of elements, the CPU time, and the RAM required to achieve a given target accuracy.",

At first, we derive an invariant for a simple superconducting qubit-oscillator through the introduction of its reduced Hamiltonian. Afterwards, an adiabatic invariant for a nanomechanical resonator linearly interfaced with a superconducting circuit, via a coupling with a time-dependent strength, is evaluated using the technique of unitary transformation. The accuracy of conservation for such invariant quantities is represented in detail.

    "abstract": "In this note we show that a \"dynamical\" interaction for arbitrary spin can be constructed in a straightforward way if gauge and Lorentz transformations are placed on the same foundation. As Lorentz transformations act on space-time coordinates, gauge transformations are applied to the gauge field. Placing these two transformations on the same ground means that all quantized field like spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 spinors are functions not only of the coordinates but also of the gauge field components. This change of perspective solves a couple of problems occuring for higher spin fields like the loss of causality, bad high-energy properties and the deviation of the gyromagnetic ratio from its constant value g=2 for any spin, as caused by applying the minimal coupling. Starting with a \"dynamical\" interaction, a non-minimal coupling can be derived which is consistent with causality, the expectation for the gyromagnetic ratio, and well-behaved for high energies. As a consequence, on this stage the (elektromagnetic) gauge field has to be considered as classical field. Therefore, standard quantum field theory cannot be applied. Despite this inconvenience, such a common ground is consistent with an old dream of physicists almost a century ago. Our approach, therefore, indicates a straightforward way to realize this dream.",

According to the respective advantages and complementary characteristics of RGB video and depth video, a retrieval algorithm based on multisource motion feature fusion is proposed. Firstly, the algorithm uses the combination of spatiotemporal interest points and word bag model to represent the features of RGB video. Then, the directional gradient histogram is used to represent the feature of the depth video frame. The statistical features of key frames are introduced to represent the histogram features of depth video. Finally, the multifeature image fusion algorithm is used to fuse the two video features. The experimental results show that multisource feature fusion can greatly improve the retrieval accuracy of motion features.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we inspect and analyze a two dimensional, unsteady mixed convectional hybrid nanofluid hydromagnetic flow (Al2O3-Cu/H2O) over a convectional heated an extending/contracting surface with the influence of thermal radiation. Hybrid nanofluid (Al2O3-Cu/H2O) flows with magnetohydrodynamic and heat source or sink. Brownian motion and thermophoresis were incorporated using the Buongiorno model. Hybrid nanofluid with vol. fraction range limited to 1.5% and within the higher temperature range of 50°C to 70°C is considered for thermal conductivity and viscosity analysis. The proposed model is then converted into ODEs through similarity transformation with the help of homotopy analysis. The effect of embedded input factors on the temperature, velocity, and concentration profiles is visually demonstrated and explained. The magnetic field has inverse impact on velocity and temperature profiles. Velocity profile increases for both mixed convection and buoyancy ratio parameters. It has been noticed that the temperature profile increases with thermal radiation. For increasing values of Lewis number, the concentration of hybrid nanoparticles is considerably lowered. Moreover, we observed an increase in the concentration of hybrid nanoparticles through a destructive chemical reaction, whereas a generative chemical reaction has the reverse effect.

    "abstract": "China’s jewelry sales maintain a good momentum of annual growth, and consumption potential is huge. However, jewelry packaging design faced many problems. Even through China has many jewelry brands, the packaging is poorly designed. The fundamental reason lies in the lack of targeted design of jewelry packaging and the lack of detailed analysis and research, only to meet the functional use. Fuzzy front-end is suitable for the initial stage of product design and determines the success or failure of product design. In view of the uncertain factors, such as consumer demand, technical characteristics, and competitive environment that need to be considered in jewelry packaging design, this paper takes jewelry packaging products, jewelry brands, and fuzzy front-end as research objects, analyzes the existing problems, and makes quantitative analysis by using methods such as questionnaire survey, brainstorming, and scenario analysis. Rough set theory and Kano Model are used to classify and analyze user demand information and determine the realization opportunity. Finally, the research ideas of this topic are formed, and the corresponding research methods and models for ring packaging in jewelry are put forward and verified by examples, so as to form a research method suitable for fuzzy front-end design of jewelry packaging and improve the quality of jewelry packaging design.",

Complex wireless communication can establish information interaction between vehicles, in order to reduce the delay time of the coordination control optimization timing scheme in coordination delay time. For smart car driving, a complex signal system, this study first establishes a relevant mathematical model. It is used to compare three mathematical models commonly used today. The results obtained under the same conditions show that the mathematical model is better in dealing with the complex signal system in terms of transmission accuracy in all segments. A number of vehicles in different states of the traffic system are selected, and the relevant data are collected to plot ROC curves using the mathematical model. It can be concluded that the freer and more complex the movement behavior of the vehicle, the greater the load it imposes on the road and the system. The results of the confusion matrix show that the model can effectively reduce the pressure on the road and the signal system. With the starting objective of smooth operation of public transportation, the target values are optimized by layering, and finally, the regional roadway capacity is effectively converged. Then, the mathematical model optimization of complex wireless systems and intelligent transportation networks is quantitatively evaluated. The optimized timing scheme through coordinated control achieves the expected effect in coordinated control of delay time and also reduces the average delay time of all intersections of the road network.",

The governing equations are transformed into coupled ordinary differential equations along with Boussinesq approximation by imposing the similarity analysis. Applying the shooting technique, the obtained non-linear coupled similarity equations are solved numerically with the help of “ODE45 MATLAB” software.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the unsteady hydrodynamic convective heat and mass transfer of three fluids namely air, water, and electrolyte solution past an impulsively started vertical surface with Newtonian heating in a porous medium under the influences of magnetic field and chemical reaction. Suitable dimensionless parameters are used to transform the flow equations and the approximate analytic method employed to solve the flow problem. The results are illustrated graphically for the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles. Though, low Prandtl numbers produce high-thermal boundary layer thickness, however, as a novelty, the presence of the magnetic field delayed the convection motion hence, the thermal boundary layer thickness is greater for water with high Pr = 7.0 as compared to air with low Pr = 0.71 and electrolyte solution with low Pr = 1.0. Practically, water with a high-Prandtl number can effectively absorb and release heat. This makes water useful in applications such as geothermal heat pumps and solar thermal collectors, industrial processes such as chemical reactions, distillation, and drying, and in oceanography in predicting the movement and behavior of ocean currents, which in turn can impact weather patterns and climate. Another major observation from the study is that the rate of cooling associated with air, water, or electrolyte impacts differently on the product being cooled.",

By the Laplace transform, the ordinary differential equation about the orthogonal expansion coefficient is transformed into a linear algebraic equation system, with the coefficient matrix being a tridiagonal lower triangular matrix. The orthogonal expansion coefficients of frequency domain components are obtained through this transformation. The approximate solution at any time is then obtained by using the numerical inverse Laplace transform with the Talbot algorithm.

    "abstract": "Springs are fundamental components in mechanical systems, crucial for ensuring the safety and functionality of mechanisms. Timoshenko’s stiffness formula accounts for both bending and torsional energy effects, providing accurate results for small deformations. However, when the deformation becomes large, the spring stiffness becomes a nonlinear problem due to the changing inclination angle and radius during deformation. In this study, we derive a formula for the cylindrical spring stiffness under nonlinear large deformation by considering two assumptions: the invariability of the polar angle at any point and spring wire length during deformation. This formula incorporates the effects of inclination and radius changes on the spring wire. We analyze the stiffness of the cylindrical spring with different initial inclinations using the finite element method (FEM). FEM results were compared with those obtained from Timoshenko’s formula, Hiroyuki’s formula, and the derived formula. For small deformations, the FEM results matched well with all three formulas. However, for nonlinear large deformations, the calculated results from Timoshenko’s formula showed a discrepancy of up to 32.58% compared to the FEM results. The modified Hiroyuki formula also exhibited slightly poorer agreement with the FEM results than the formula proposed in this paper. On the other hand, our derived formula demonstrated excellent agreement with the FEM results for nonlinear large deformations. Therefore, our stiffness formula for cylindrical springs is recommended for mechanical engineering spring design applications involving nonlinear large deformations.",

Our findings highlight significant deviations from traditional Fourier models, enhancing the predictive capabilities for designing thermal protection systems in extreme thermal environments. The cracks are modeled as distributions of thermal dislocations, with densities determined through Fourier and Laplace transforms. By solving the resulting singular integral equations, we calculate the temperature gradient intensity factors across multiple scenarios. Additionally, we examine the effects of thermal relaxation time, loading parameters, and crack spacing on the thermal intensity factors, both in transient and steady‐state conditions. This research confirms the robustness of the hyperbolic model and its practical implications for thermal analysis in engineering applications.",

A novel feature selection method based on partial differential equation learning model is proposed. The extracted features are invariant to rotation and translation and more robust to illumination changes. In the evaluation of students’ concentration in class, this paper firstly uses the face detection algorithm in face recognition technology to detect the face and intercept the expression data, and calculates the rise rate. Then, the improved model of concentration analysis and evaluation of a college Chinese class is used to recognize facial expression, and the corresponding weight is given to calculate the expression score. Finally, the head-up rate calculated at the same time is multiplied by the expression score as the final concentration score. Through the experiment and analysis of the experimental results in the actual classroom, the corresponding conclusions are drawn and teaching suggestions are provided for teachers. For each face, a large neighborhood set is firstly selected by the <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>k</mi> </math> -nearest neighbor method, and then, the sparse representation of sample points in the neighborhood is obtained, which effectively combines the locality of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>k</mi> </math> -nearest neighbor and the robustness of sparse representation.

The two algorithms obtain good clustering and recognition results in various cases of real and simulated occlusion, which shows the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm. In order to verify the reliability of the model, this paper verified the model through in-class practice tests, teachers’ questions, and interviews with students and teachers.

Firstly, the traditional Mallat algorithm is optimized; since the mean value of the transform coefficients generated after the wavelet transform of the image is used as the initial value of the chaotic system to iterate, when the image is modified, then the mean value of the wavelet coefficients will also change, and the final iteration comes out as two different sequences using the property that the chaotic system is extremely sensitive to the initial conditions, so the algorithm has a certain sensitivity to tampering and localization effect. The image of the encrypted graphic design is decrypted by the chaos decryption system, and the final image information of the graphic design is obtained. In terms of the security of the graphic design image itself, the complex dynamical properties of chaos are fully utilized to encrypt it, and the algorithm has a good encryption effect after statistical characteristic analysis, attack complexity, difference analysis, adjacent pixel correlation analysis, and key sensitivity analysis. The plaintext image is decomposed in odd-even sequence using the boosting algorithm to get the sequence with an even index and the sequence with an odd index; then, the diffusion algorithm is applied to the two sequences by the prediction and update algorithm, and this process is repeated many times to get the two ciphertext sequences after scrambling, merging these two sequences, and matrixing them to get the ciphertext image. Finally, the testing of the embedded planar designed image revolves around four aspects, namely, image processing, tamper sensitivity, robustness, and imperceptibility, to examine the designed planar designed image system. In the diffusion manipulation, the key matrix for diffusion is obtained using the threshold processing method of the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithm for the matrices generated by the Logistic Chaos system, which improves the randomness of the algorithm. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and security of the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction of images with high-dimensional nonlinear structure is the key to improving the recognition rate. Although some traditional algorithms have achieved some results in the process of dimensionality reduction, they also expose their respective defects. In order to achieve the ideal effect of high-dimensional nonlinear image recognition, based on the analysis of the traditional dimensionality reduction algorithm and refining its advantages, an image recognition technology based on the nonlinear dimensionality reduction method is proposed. As an effective nonlinear feature extraction method, the nonlinear dimensionality reduction method can find the nonlinear structure of datasets and maintain the intrinsic structure of data. Applying the nonlinear dimensionality reduction method to image recognition is to divide the input image into blocks, take it as a dataset in high-dimensional space, reduce the dimension of its structure, and obtain the low-dimensional expression vector of its eigenstructure so that the problem of image recognition can be carried out in a lower dimension. Thus, the computational complexity can be reduced, the recognition accuracy can be improved, and it is convenient for further processing such as image recognition and search. The defects of traditional algorithms are solved, and the commodity price recognition and simulation experiments are carried out, which verifies the feasibility of image recognition technology based on the nonlinear dimensionality reduction method in commodity price recognition.",

J. C. Maxwell was the first to employ the quaternions to study the electromagnetic fields. His method inspires subsequent scholars to introduce the quaternions, octonions, and sedenions to research the electromagnetic field, gravitational field, and nuclear field. The application of complex-sedenions is capable of depicting not only the field equations of classical mechanics, but also the field equations of quantum mechanics. The latter can be degenerated into the Dirac equation and Yang-Mills equation. In contrast to the complex-number wave function, the complex-quaternion wave function possesses three new degrees of freedom, that is, three color degrees of freedom. One complex-quaternion wave function is equivalent to three complex-number wave functions. It means that the three spatial dimensions of unit vector in the complex-quaternion wave function can be considered as the “three colors”; naturally the color confinement will be effective. In other words, in the complex-quaternion space, the “three colors” are only the spatial dimensions, rather than any property of physical substance.",

Hence, it is inevitable to consider how to obtain an approximate solution for PDE with nonlinear coefficients. Research on using HDG method for PDE with nonlinear coefficients has been conducted along with results obtained from computer simulations. However, error analysis on HDG method for such settings has been limited. In this research, we give error estimations of the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for parabolic equations with nonlinear coefficients. We first review the classical HDG method and define notions that will be used throughout the paper. Then, we will give bounds for our estimates when nonlinear coefficients obey “Lipschitz” condition. We will then prove our main result that the errors for our estimations are bounded.",

A nonlinear stationary boundary-value problem for coupled heat and radiation transfer equations for the layer, which exchanges by energy with external medium by convection and radiation, has been formulated. In the case of optically thick layer, when its thickness is much more of photon-free path, the problem becomes a singularly perturbed one. In the inverse case of optically thin layer, the problem is regularly perturbed, and it becomes a regular (unperturbed) one, when the layer’s thickness is of order of several photon-free paths. An iterative method for solving of the unperturbed problem has been developed and its convergence has been tested numerically. With the use of the method, the temperature field and radiation fluxes have been studied. The model and method can be used for development of noncontact methods for temperature testing in dielectrics and for nondestructive determination of its radiation properties on the base of the data obtained by remote measuring of IR radiation emitted by the layer.",

It is found that the convergent series solutions, obtained by the homotopy analysis method (HAM), consist of the nonlinear hydroelastic wave profile and the velocity potential. The impacts of important physical parameters are discussed in detail. With the increment of the following current intensity, we find that the amplitudes of the hydroelastic waves decrease very slightly, while the opposing current produces the opposite effect on the hydroelastic waves. Furthermore, the amplitudes of waves increase very obviously for higher opposing current speed but reduce very slightly for higher following current speed. A larger amplitude of the incident wave increases the hydroelastic wave deflections for both opposing and following current, while for Young’s modulus of the plate there is the opposite effect.",

The failure process characterizes with strong nonlinearity, and hence it is difficult to be described by conventional methods. In this paper, firstly, the cracks in different positions are described using crack fractal theory. The basic failure modes of the impeller are summarized. Secondly, a three-dimensional finite element model of the impeller is constructed. Then the von Mises stress under the centrifugal force is calculated, and the corresponding impeller failure process is simulated by “element life and death technology” in ANSYS. Finally, the impeller failure mechanism is analyzed. It can be found that the static stress is not the main cause of the impeller failure, and the dynamic characteristics of the impeller are not perfect because of the pitch vibration modes which appeared in the investigated frequency range. Meanwhile, the natural frequency of the impeller also cannot avoid the frequency of the excitation force.",

Therefore, accurate wind power forecast is important for reliable and economic operation of the power systems. Complexities and nonlinearities exhibited by wind power time series necessitate use of elaborative and sophisticated approaches for wind power forecasting. In this paper, a local neurofuzzy (LNF) approach, trained by the polynomial model tree (POLYMOT) learning algorithm, is proposed for short-term wind power forecasting. The LNF approach is constructed based on the contribution of local polynomial models which can efficiently model wind power generation. Data from Sotavento wind farm in Spain was used to validate the proposed LNF approach. Comparison between performance of the proposed approach and several recently published approaches illustrates capability of the LNF model for accurate wind power forecasting.",

With the bilateral risk exposure among Chinese listed commercial banks, we find that the possibility of systemic risk contagion in Chinese interbank market is fairly small. But of great concern on each individual bank, the matter is different. Our simulation shows that the failures of three special banks (i.e., Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China) most likely lead to systemic risk contagion. Furthermore, we test the antirisk ability of the Chinese interbank market from the perspective of risk sharing and discover that the interbank market is stable when the loss scale is lower than forty percent of banks’ total core capital.",

We show that both of these equations depend on the reference frame, and that, however, they can be given a rigorous meaning. Then we review the definitions of the canonical and Hilbert energy-momentum tensors from a Lagrangian through the principle of stationary action in a general spacetime. Using relatively elementary mathematics, we prove precise results regarding the definition of the Hilbert tensor field, its uniqueness, and its tensoriality. We recall the meaning of its covariant conservation equation. We end with a proof of uniqueness of the energy density and flux, when both depend polynomially of the fields.

Due to economic, environmental, and other factors, it is very difficult to obtain a precise long-term stock price prediction. The exponentially segmented pattern (ESP) is introduced here and used to predict the fluctuation of different stock data over five future prediction intervals. The new feature of stock pricing during the subinterval, named the interval slope, can characterize fluctuations in stock price over specific periods. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of MSE was compared to those of MMSE-BC and SVR. We concluded that the interval slope developed here can capture more complex dynamics of stock price trends. The mean stock price can then be predicted over specific time intervals relatively accurately, in which multiple mean values over time intervals are used to express the time series in the long term. In this way, the prediction of long-term stock price can be more precise and prevent the development of cumulative errors.",

Unlike other numerical approaches, the time variables in the given equation can be handled analytically by AH basis functions. By using the Galerkin’s method, one can eliminate the time variables from calculations, which results in a series of implicit equations. And the coefficients of results for all orders can then be obtained by the expanded equations and the numerical results can be reconstructed during the computing process. The precision and stability of the proposed method are proved by some examples, which show the numerical solution acquired is acceptable when compared with some existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Based on the wave function expansion method, the dynamic antiplane characteristics of a wedge-shaped quarter-space containing a circular hole are studied in a complex coordinate system. The wedge-shaped medium is decomposed into two subregions along the virtual boundary using the virtual region decomposition method. The scattering wave field in subregion I is constructed by the mirror method, and the standing wave field in region II is constructed by the fractional Bessel function. According to the continuity conditions at the virtual boundary and the stress-free boundary of the circular hole, the unknown coefficients of the wave fields are obtained by the Fourier integral transform, and the analytical solution of the dynamic stress concentration factor (DSCF) of the circular hole is then obtained. Through parametric analysis, the effects of incident wave frequency, geometry of the wedge, and corner slope on the DSCF of the circular hole are discussed. The results show that when the SH-wave is horizontally incidence at high frequencies, the DSCF of the circular hole can be significantly changed by introducing the corner slope. Moreover, when the corner slope is high, the maximum DSCF can be amplified about 1.2 times. Finally, the back propagation (BP) neural network prediction model of DSCF is established, and the coefficient of regression is found to reach more than 0.99.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, a new approximated method for solving the nonlinear Duffing-Van der Pol (D-VdP) oscillator equation is suggested. The approximate solution of this equation is introduced with two separate techniques. First, we convert nonlinear D-VdP equation to a nonlinear Volterra integral equation of the second kind (VIESK) using integration, and then, we approximate it with the hybrid Legendre polynomials and block-pulse function (HLBPFs). The next technique is to convert this equation into a system of ordinary differential equation of the first order (SODE) and solve it according to the proposed approximate method. The main goal of the presented technique is to transform these problems into a nonlinear system of algebraic equations using the operational matrix obtained from the integration, which can be solved by a proper numerical method; thus, the solution procedures are either reduced or simplified accordingly. The benefit of the hybrid functions is that they can be adjusted for different values of <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>n</mi> </math> and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>m</mi> </math> , in addition to being capable of yield greater correct numerical answers than the piecewise constant orthogonal function, for the results of integral equations. Resolved governance equation using the Runge-Kutta fourth order algorithm with the stepping time 0.01 s via numerical solution. The approximate results obtained from the proposed method show that this method is effective. The evaluation has been proven that the proposed technique is in good agreement with the numerical results of other methods.",

Recently, we have been able to construct a partial differential equations‐based model of a quantum Hall system, which consists of the Schrödinger equation supplemented with a special‐type nonlinear feedback loop. This result stems from a novel theoretical approach, which in particular brings to the fore the notion of quantum information. Here we undertake to modify the original model by substituting the dynamics based on the Dirac operator. This leads to a model that consists of a system of three nonlinearly coupled first‐order elliptic equations in the plane.",

    "abstract": "The previously obtained integral field representation in the form of double weighted Fourier transform (DWFT) describes effects of inhomogeneities with different scales. The first DWFT approximation describing the first-order effects does not account for incident wave distortions. However, in inhomogeneous media the multiscale second-order effects can also take place when large-scale inhomogeneities distort the field structure of the wave incident on small-scale inhomogeneities. The paper presents the results of the use of DWFT to derive formulas for wave statistical moments with respect to the first- and second-order effects. It is shown that, for narrow-band signals, the second-order effects do not have a significant influence on the frequency correlation. We can neglect the contribution of the second-order effects to the spatial intensity correlation when thickness of the inhomogeneous layer is small, but these effects become noticeable as the layer thickness increases. Accounting for the second-order effects enabled us to get a spatial intensity correlation function, which at large distances goes to the results obtained earlier by the path integral method. This proves that the incident wave distortion effects act on the intensity fluctuations of a wave propagating in a multiscale randomly inhomogeneous medium.",

According to the hypothesis of fully developed chaos, this statistics is here analyzed assuming that the entropy associated with the fluid kinematic state is maximum. The distribution of the local Lyapunov exponents results in an unsymmetrical uniform function in a proper interval of variation. From this PDF, we determine the relationship between average and maximum Lyapunov exponents and the longitudinal velocity correlation function. This link, which in turn leads to the closure of von Kármán–Howarth and Corrsin equations, agrees with results of previous works, supporting the proposed PDF calculation, at least for the purposes of the energy cascade main effect estimation. Furthermore, through the property that the Lyapunov vectors tend to align the direction of the maximum growth rate of trajectories distance, we obtain the link between maximum and average Lyapunov exponents in line with the previous results. To validate the proposed theoretical results, we present different numerical simulations whose results justify the hypotheses of the present analysis.",

In both cases we find that there is a logarithmic dependence of the orbital energy on the mean motion. Using that, we derive an expression for the mean motion as a function of the Yukawa orbital energy, as well as specific Yukawa potential parameters. Furthermore, various special cases are examined.

    "abstract": "The mathematical concept of minimal atomicity is extended to fractal minimal atomicity, based on the nondifferentiability of the motion curves of physical system entities on a fractal manifold. For this purpose, firstly, different results concerning minimal atomicity from the mathematical procedure of the Quantum Measure Theory and also several physical implications are obtained. Further, an inverse method with respect to the common developments concerning the minimal atomicity concept has been used, showing that Quantum Mechanics is identified as a particular case of Fractal Mechanics at a given scale resolution. More precisely, for fractality through Markov type stochastic processes, i.e., fractalization through stochasticization, the standard Schrödinger equation is identified with the geodesics of a fractal space for motions of the physical system entities on nondifferentiable curves on fractal dimension two at Compton scale resolution. In the one-dimensional stationary case of the fractal Schrödinger type geodesics, a special symmetry induced by the homographic group in Barbilian’s form “makes possible the synchronicity” of all entities of a given physical system. The integral and differential properties of this group under the restriction of defining a parallelism of directions in Levi-Civita’s sense impose correspondences with the “dynamics” of the hyperbolic plane so that harmonic mappings between the ordinary flat space and the hyperbolic one generate (by means of a variational principle) a priori probabilities in Jaynes’ sense. The explicitation of such situation specifies the fact that the hydrodynamical variant of a Fractal Mechanics is more easily approached and, from this, the fact that Quantum Measure Theory can be a particular case of a possible Fractal Measure Theory.",

In this paper, the alternating segment pure explicit-implicit (PASE-I) and implicit-explicit (PASI-E) parallel difference schemes are constructed for time fractional telegraph equation. Based on the alternating segment technology, the PASE-I and PASI-E schemes are constructed of the classic explicit scheme and implicit scheme. It can be concluded that the schemes are unconditionally stable and convergent by theoretical analysis. The convergence order of the PASE-I and PASI-E methods is second order in spatial direction and 3- α order in temporal direction. The numerical results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis, which shows that the PASE-I and PASI-E schemes are superior to the classical implicit schemes in both accuracy and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Different nanostructures of boron nitride have been observed experimentally such as fullerenes, tubes, cones, and graphene. They have received much attention due to their physical, chemical, and electronic properties that lead them to numerous applications in many nanoscale devices. Joining between nanostructures gives rise to new structures with outstanding properties and potential applications for the design of probes for scanning tunneling microscopy and other nanoscale devices, as carriers for drug delivery and liquid separation. This paper utilizes calculus of variations to model the joining between two types of BN nanostructures, namely, BN nanotubes and BN nanocones. Based on the curvature of the join curve, the joining of these structures can be divided into two models. Model I refers to when the join profile includes positive curvature only, and Model II contains both positive and negative curvatures. The main goal here is to formulate the basic underlying structure from which any such small perturbations can be viewed as departures from an ideal model. For this scenario of joining, we successfully present simple models based on joining BN nanotubes to BN nanocones with five different angles of the cone.",

Besides the $sl(2)\\oplus u(1)$ invariance of the Calogero Conformal Mechanics, an $osp(2|2)$ invariant superalgebra, realized by first-order and second-order differential operators, is obtained. The invariant algebras with an infinite tower of generators are given by the universal enveloping algebra of the deformed Heisenberg algebra, which is shown to be equivalent to a deformed version of the Schr\\\"odinger algebra. This vector space also gives rise to a higher spin (gravity) superalgebra. We furthermore prove that the pure and DFF Matrix Calogero PDEs possess isomorphic dynamical symmetries, being related by a similarity transformation and a redefinition of the time variable.",

Central projection transformation is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the original input pattern, and general contour (GC) of the pattern is derived. Affine invariant features cannot be extracted from GC directly due to shearing. To address this problem, a group of curves (which are called shift curves) are constructed from the obtained GC. Fractal dimensions of these curves can readily be computed and constitute a new feature vector for the original pattern. The derived feature vector is used in question for pattern recognition. Several experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can be used for object classification.",

The problem is defined as a mathematical model which focuses on the fluid memory, which is represented by a constituent equation with the Caputo time-fractional derivative. The integral transformations approach (the Laplace transform and the finite sine-Fourier transform) is used to determine analytical solutions for velocity, shear stress, and the temperature fields with fluid interface, initial, and boundary conditions. For semianalytical solutions, the algorithms of Talbot are used to calculate the Laplace inverse transformation. We used the Mathcad software for graphical illustration and numerical computation.

Instead of variational minimization of usual area functional, the quasi-minimal Bézier surface with shifted knots is obtained as the solution of variational minimization of Dirichlet functional that turns up as the sum of two integrals and the vanishing condition gives us the system of linear algebraic constraints on the control points. The coefficients of these control points bear symmetry for the pair of summation indices as well as for the pair of free indices. These linear constraints are then solved for unknown interior control points in terms of given boundary control points to get quasi-minimal Bézier surface with shifted knots. The functional gradient of the surface gives possible candidate functions as the minimizers of the aforementioned Dirichlet functional; when solved for unknown interior control points, it results in a surface of minimal area called quasi-minimal Bézier surface.

Based on the stress induction experiment, an audiovisual-induced psychological stress recognition system based on EEG (electroencephalogram) signals was built. Aiming at the problem that the spatial uniform sampling method cannot well reflect the dynamic characteristics of the multivariate EEG signal, based on the Duffing equation, a nonuniform sampling algorithm that adaptively selects the projection direction is proposed. At present, the use of the Duffing equation to detect weak unknown signals is to select a set of fixed parameters. Analysis of these two aspects to determine the parameters of the system is based on the parameter analysis of the Duffing equation oscillator. Due to the sensitivity of the Duffing equation to the initial value, the choice of parameters has a great influence on the detection effect. In response to this situation, the relationship between the parameters and initial values of the Duffing equation is analyzed. From the relationship between the parameters and the initial values, the influence of different parameters on the detection effect is analyzed to verify the superiority of the current equation parameters. First, the multichannel EEG signal is nonuniformly sampled multiempirical modal decomposition, and an effective intrinsic modal function is selected to extract the mental stress EEG characteristics. Experimental results show that the EEG signal recognition algorithm based on the Duffing equation effectively extracts EEG signal features and improves the classification accuracy of mental stress EEG signals.",

The paper studies the music signal feature recognition technology based on the mathematical equation inversion method, which is aimed at designing a method that can help music learners in music learning and music composition. The paper firstly studies the modeling of music signal and its analysis and processing algorithm, combining the four elements of music sound, analyzing and extracting the characteristic parameters of notes, and establishing the mathematical model of single note signal and music score signal. The single note recognition algorithm is studied to extract the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient of the signal and improve the DTW algorithm to achieve single note recognition. Based on the implementation of the single note algorithm, we combine the note temporal segmentation method based on the energy-entropy ratio to segment the music score into single note sequences to realize the music score recognition. The paper then goes on to study the music synthesis algorithm and perform simulations. The benchmark model demonstrates the positive correlation of pitch features on recognition through comparative experiments and explores the number of harmonics that should be attended to when recognizing different instruments. The attention network-based classification model draws on the properties of human auditory attention to improve the recognition scores of the main playing instruments and the overall recognition accuracy of all instruments. The two-stage classification model is divided into a first-stage classification model and a second-stage classification model, and the second-stage classification model consists of three residual networks, which are trained separately to specifically identify strings, winds, and percussions.

    "abstract": "Although the development time of cross-border e-commerce in China is very short, the scale of its transactions and the speed of development are amazing, and as a supporting foundation for promoting economic and trade globalization, cross-border e-commerce has an extremely important strategy for this guiding role. This not only brings new opportunities to cross-border e-commerce companies but also excavates a huge potential market for the logistics industry. Cross-border e-commerce not only breaks through the trade barriers between countries; it makes trade move towards borderlessness and at the same time triggers major changes in international trade. This paper introduces partial differential equations into the video surveillance image enhancement system of cross-border e-commerce logistics. Aiming at the shortcomings of the contrast enhancement method based on gradient field equalization, this paper proposes a partial differential enhancement method based on histogram equalization. By proposing a gradient transformation function, the edges and textures with relatively small gradient values are enhanced to make the original weaker texture details clearer. In order to better adjust the brightness and contrast of the image, combined with histogram equalization, we propose an inverse equalization transformation. When the histogram equalization and the inverse equalization transform are combined reasonably, the brightness and contrast of the image can be adjusted very well. In this paper, the finite difference method is used for discretization when solving partial differential equations, and Euler’s equation is obtained by applying the principle of least squares. By introducing the heat equation, the direct solution of Euler’s equation is converted into an iterative form, which greatly reduces the amount of calculation. This article uses statistical methods to obtain the empirical formula of the fractional differential order. This empirical formula makes the calculation of the order of the fractional derivative easy and can be extended to other fractional image enhancement models and overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional fractional derivative order obtained through experience or a large number of experiments. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm not only enhances detailed texture information but also improves image clarity, overall brightness, and contrast without color distortion. The objective evaluation indicators also show the superiority of the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of networks and the emergence of various devices, images have become the main form of information transmission in real life. Image restoration, as an important branch of image processing, can be applied to real-life situations such as pixel loss in image transmission or network prone to packet loss. However, existing image restoration algorithms have disadvantages such as fuzzy restoration effect and slow speed; to solve such problems, this paper adopts a dual discriminator model based on generative adversarial networks, which effectively improves the restoration accuracy by adding local discriminators to track the information of local missing regions of images. However, the model is not optimistic in generating reasonable semantic information, and for this reason, a partial differential equation-based image restoration model is proposed. A classifier and a feature extraction network are added to the dual discriminator model to provide category, style, and content loss constraints to the generative network, respectively. To address the training instability problem of discriminator design, spectral normalization is introduced to the discriminator design. Extensive experiments are conducted on a data dataset of partial differential equations, and the results show that the partial differential equation-based image restoration model provides significant improvements in image restoration over previous methods and that image restoration techniques are exceptionally important in the application of environmental art design.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical equipment is a key component of mechanical equipment, and its working condition is directly related to the overall performance of mechanical equipment. Accurate evaluation and prediction of the performance degradation trend of mechanical equipment is of great significance to ensure the reliability and safety of the mechanical equipment system. Based on the data of typical faulty equipment, this paper analyzes the energy characteristic parameters of mechanical equipment under different types and degrees of failure in the time domain. Using amplitude spectrum analysis, Hilbert envelope demodulation and wavelet packet decomposition method, and other vibration signal processing methods, preliminary extraction of multiple statistical feature parameters are given. Secondly, in view of the irrelevant and redundant components of multiple statistical parameters, a new method for extracting fault features of mechanical equipment based on variance value and principal component analysis is proposed. This method can effectively classify the fault status of mechanical equipment. The effectiveness of the method is verified by actual equipment signals. After that, the value extracted from the vibration signal of the double-row roller equipment is used as the degradation feature. In order to reduce the influence of irregular characteristics in the vibration signal and simplify the complexity of the vibration signal, the wavelet transform and the support vector machine model are combined, according to the degradation after decomposition. The 95% confidence interval of the predicted value is also given. The SVM model is established based on data characteristics, and single-step and multistep prediction of equipment degradation trends are carried out. The prediction result shows that, according to the mapping position formula, the distribution of equipment degradation prediction points is obtained, and a 95% confidence interval based on the distribution of the prediction points is given. Finally, on the basis of completing feature extraction, this paper applies an unsupervised feature selection method. The sensitive characteristics of life prediction and the prediction results of a single SVM model and a neural network model are compared and analyzed at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Digital image processing technology is widely used in production and life, and digital images play a pivotal role in the ever-changing technological development. Noise can affect the expression of image information. The edge is the reflection of the main structure and contour of the image, and it is also the direct interpretation of image understanding and the basis for further segmentation and recognition. Therefore, suppressing noise and improving the accuracy of edge detection are important aspects of image processing. To address these issues, this paper presents a new detection algorithm combined with information fusion based on the existing image edge detection techniques, and the algorithm is studied from two aspects of fuzzy radial basis fusion discrimination, in terms of preprocessing algorithm, comparing the denoising effect of mean and median filters with different template sizes on paper images with added noise, and selecting the improved median filter denoising, comparing different operator edge detection. The effect of image edge detection contour is finally selected as the <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mn>3</mn><mo>∗</mo><mn>3</mn></math> Sobel operator for edge detection; the binarized image edge detection contour information is found as the minimum outer rectangle and labeled, and then, the original paper image is scanned line by line to segment the target image edge region. The image edge detection algorithm based on fuzzy radial basis fuser can not only speed up the image preprocessing, meet the real-time detection, and reduce the amount of data processed by the upper computer but also can accurately identify five image edge problems including folds and cracks, which has good application prospects.",

Secondly the definitions of the adjoint representations are presented to establish the relationships of the Lie groups SO(3) and SE(3) and their Lie algebras so(3) and se(3). After that the general situation of the differential equations with matrices belonging to SO(3) and SE(3) is presented. According to these equations the features of the error function on SO(3) are discussed. Then an error function on SE(3) is devised which creates a new way of error functions constructing. In the simulation a trajectory tracking example is given with a target trajectory being a curve of elliptic cylinder helix. The result shows that a better tracking performance is obtained with the new devised error function.",

The theory can precisely predict the propagation of thermoelastics waves in case of an isotropic medium. However, the propagation of thermoelastic waves in the anisotropic medium is not fully understood. In this case, the theory of elasticity employs an approximate theory of temperature stress which does not take into consideration the interactions of temperature and deformations. In this paper, an analytical study has been carried out by using method of matricant to investigate the propagation of longitudinal elastic and heat waves in the anisotropic medium of a monoclinic, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubical crystal systems.

The numerical solutions of the potential and velocity distributions are obtained by solving the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation, the constitutive equation of the Jeffrey fluid, and the Cauchy momentum equation applying the Chebyshev spectral method and the finite difference method. By contrast, the Chebyshev spectral method has higher accuracy and less computation. The flow characteristics of Jeffrey fluid at high Zeta potential are analyzed with the numerical solution obtained by the Chebyshev spectral method. The results show that the velocity of Jeffrey fluid increases with the increase of the wall Zeta potential and electric width. The oscillation amplitude of velocity distribution increases with the increase of relaxation time but decreases with the increase of retardation time. When the Hartmann number is smaller, the increase of relaxation time leads to the increase of velocity; when the Hartmann number is larger, the increase of relaxation time leads to the decrease of velocity. No matter what the Hartmann number is, the velocity always decreases with the increase of the retardation time. The velocity tends to be stable gradually with the increase of time.",

    "abstract": "Since task allocation is one of the core tasks of ship design, the choice of its allocation strategy is a key factor that affects whether the task and the design agent can be beneficially matched. Different from the traditional one-way assignment mode of assigning tasks to designers, in the task assignment strategy of modern ship collaborative design mode, designers’ ability and benefit ratio is getting higher and higher. Therefore, in order to improve the efficiency and quality of task design, this paper proposes a multidesign agent-task allocation decision-making method. In this paper, the task attributes and designers’ attributes are introduced into the task allocation strategy model, and the fuzzy linguistic variable method is used to build the evaluation index matrix of the design agent, and the task timeliness function is established. Secondly, the multidesign agent-task benefit function is established and solved to obtain the best allocation strategy. Finally, through example verification and comparative analysis with the Round-Robin algorithm (RR) and the Weighted Round-Robin (WRR) algorithm, the validity, feasibility, and stability of the multidesign agent-task allocation decision-making method proposed in this paper are verified, and it is proved that the task allocation method takes the bilateral needs of the task and the design agent into account, solves the optimal allocation strategy of collaborative design tasks, and realizes the balanced allocation between the ship collaborative design task and the design agent.",

    "abstract": "Noncoherent light, as a common light source in life, can effectively avoid problems such as scattering noise caused by optical components incoherent light imaging, and through the design of the optical path can also trigger interference and holographic imaging of objects, allowing holography to be used in more fields. Various techniques have emerged for recording holograms using incoherent light sources as technology has developed. A recording method has been proposed that exploits the correlation between the object wave information and the Fresnel band sheet to achieve incoherent hologram recording. Using a spatial light modulator (SLM) loaded with a bit-phase mask with multiplexed lens function, the incident light wavefield is phase-modulated to achieve diffraction spectroscopy and phase shifting. And holograms with different phase shifts can be obtained and combined with phase-shifting techniques to eliminate the effects of twin images caused by coaxial holography in the reproduction process. Based on the study of this incoherent holographic imaging system, the influence of the characteristics of the main components of the system and the corresponding parameters on the resolution of the recorded and reproduced holograms is investigated, and optimization methods are given from both theoretical and experimental studies. The empirical analysis of the FINCH imaging system is carried out. The observed optical path is designed, and the method of making a bit-phase mask loaded on a spatial light modulator is presented. The effect of the focal length and recording distance of the dislocation mask on the resolution of the system is investigated by both computer simulation and experimental operation.",

First, the SMOTE- (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique-) based method is employed to address the sample unbalance problem by oversampling the minority class and undersampling the majority class of the futures price change. Then, the FRS- (fuzzy rough set-) based method, as an efficient tool for analyzing complex and nonlinear information with high noise and uncertainty of financial time series, is adopted for the price change multiclassification of the CSI300 futures. Next, based on the multiclassification results of the futures price movement, a trading strategy is developed to execute a one-year simulated trading for an out-of-sample test of the trained model. From the experimental results, it is found that the proposed method averagely yielded an accumulated return of 6.36%, a F1-measure of 65.94%, and a hit ratio of 62.39% in the four testing periods, indicating that the proposed method is more accurate and more profitable than the benchmarks. Therefore, the proposed method could be applied by the market participants as an alternative prediction and trading system to forecast and trade in the Chinese financial futures market.",

In this way, the challenge of accurately describing exchange and correlation in many-electron systems is shifted to the stationary initial state, which is much better understood. The proposed scheme further requires the choice of an auxiliary basis set, which determines the speed of convergence but always allows systematic convergence in practical implementations.",

Indicator function used to distinguish the solid zone and the fluid zone is an essential part concerning the whole prediction accuracy of FDM. In this work, a new indicator function through volume intersection is developed for FDM. In this method, the arbitrarily polyhedral cells across the interface between fluid and solid are located and subdivided into tetrahedrons. The fraction of the solid volume in each cell is accurately computed to achieve high precision of integration calculation in the particle domain, improving the accuracy of the whole method. The quadrature over the solid domain shows that the newly developed indicator function can provide results with high accuracy for variable integration in both stationary and moving boundary problems. Several numerical tests, including flow around a circular cylinder, a single sphere in a creeping shear flow, settlement of a circular particle in a closed container, and in-line oscillation of a circular cylinder, have been performed. The results show good accuracy and feasibility in dealing with the stationary boundary problem as well as the moving boundary problem. This method is accurate and conservative, which can be a feasible tool for studying problems with moving boundaries.",

New research in this area has demonstrated that a system of inertial torques, which are generated by the rotating mass of spinning objects, acts upon a gyroscope. The actions of the system of inertial forces are validated by practical tests of the motions of a gyroscope with one side support. The action of external load torque on a gyroscope with one side support demonstrates that the gyroscope’s upward motion is wrongly called an “antigravity” effect. The upward motion of a gyroscope is the result of precession torque around its horizontal axis. The novelty of the present work is related to the mathematical models for the upward and downward motions of gyroscopes influenced by external torque around the vertical axis. This analytical research describes the physics of gyroscopes’ upward motion and validates that gyroscopes do not possess an antigravity property.",

Such plasmas have generated a lot of interest in the last decade owing to their importance in many areas of physics such as semiconductors, metals, microelectronics, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, and quantum wells. Besides, degenerate plasmas present very interesting features for fusion burning waves’ ignition and propagation. In this paper, we investigated the effects of static magnetic field on energy states and degeneracy of electrons in dense plasma. Using perturbation theory, two cases are considered, strongly and weakly magnetized electrons. Strong magnetic field will not eliminate completely the degeneracy, but it functions to reduce degeneracy. Perturbed energy eigenvalues ΔE are calculated to high accuracy. Besides, regardless of whether the perturbed state is degenerate or not, the energy ΔE is given by considering the average of orbital and spin coupling Ws=ℵrL→·S→ with respect to the eigenfunction Ψn,l,m,ms. Here L→ is the angular momentum vector, S→ is the spin vector of electrons, and ℵr is the energy of spin orbit coupling in plasma, which plays a crucial role in the study of energy states and degeneracy of plasma electrons.",

Secondly, the limit behavior of the obtained Riemann solutions as the magnetic field drops to zero is studied. It is shown that, as the magnetic field vanishes, the Riemann solutions of the pressureless MHD system just tend to the corresponding Riemann solutions of the Euler equations for pressureless fluids.

In this work, we first propose a method to predict viscoelastic-creep and mechanical-hysteresis behaviors in a body-centered-cubic (BCC) solid using a PFC method that is incorporated with a pressure-controlled dynamic equation which enables convenient control of deformation by specifying external pressure. To achieve our objective, we use constant pressure for the viscoelastic-creep study and sinusoidal pressure oscillation for the mechanical-hysteresis study. The parametric studies show that the relaxation time in the viscoelastic-creep phenomena is proportional to temperature. Also, mechanical-hysteresis behavior and the complex moduli predicted by the model are consistent with those of the standard linear solid model in a low-frequency pressure oscillation. Moreover, the impact of temperature on complex moduli is also investigated within the solid-stabilizing range. These results qualitatively agree with experimental and theoretical observations reported in the previous literature. We believe that our work should contribute to extending the capability of the PFC method to investigate the deformation problem when the externally applied pressure is required.",

By providing the 5D matter Lagrangian, this work completes a Lagrangian analysis of the classical Kaluza theory that began by establishing the proper form of the unique Kaluza field Lagrangian. This work considers the transformation properties necessitated by general covariance of the Kaluza source terms, to establish the correct form for the source terms in the field equations, and to establish the 5D matter Lagrangian that corresponds to the 5D geodesic hypothesis. In addition to the effects of a scalar field expected from other scalar-tensor or scalar-electromagnetic theories, a peculiar Kaluza coupling coefficient arises for charged matter which acts to vary the source strengths in ways unknown to conventional physics. We briefly evaluate the implied modifications to source terms in the field equations. We find an ADM-like neutralization of gravity at high specific charge states and a saturation in field strength at high specific charge-to-mass ratios.",

This RBFs approach was theoretically proved with different problems of two numerical examples: time step arbitrage bubble case and time linear arbitrage bubble case. Then, the numerical results were compared with the semiclassical solution in case of fractional order close to 1. As a result, both numerical examples showed that the option prices from RBFs method satisfy the semiclassical solution.",

It is often difficult to solve dynamic equations, and the use of variable transformation can make the equations easier to solve. The theory of canonical transformations plays an important role in solving Hamilton’s canonical equations. Birkhoffian mechanics is a natural generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics. This paper attempts to extend the canonical transformation theory of Hamilton systems to Birkhoff systems and establish the generalized canonical transformation of Birkhoff systems. First, the definition and criterion of the generalized canonical transformation for the Birkhoff system are established. Secondly, based on the criterion equation and considering the generating functions of different forms, six generalized canonical transformation formulas are derived. As special cases, the canonical transformation formulas of classical Hamilton’s equations are given. At the end of the paper, two examples are given to illustrate the application of the results.",

Joining between BN nanostructures gives new enhanced structures with outstanding properties and potential applications for design of probes for scanning tunnelling microscopy and other nanoscale devices. This paper uses calculus of variations to model the joining between BN graphene with other BN nanostructures: BNNTs and BNNCs. Furthermore, during the joining between these BN nanostructures, this research examines two models which are depending on the curvature of the join profile. For the first case, Model I refers to when the join profile only includes positive curvature where for the second case, Model II is considered for both positive and negative curvatures. Thus, the purpose of this research is to formulate the basic underlying structure to present simple models based on joining BN graphene to other BN nanostructures.",

The temperature field, displacement field, and electric field of the coupling of thermal and electromechanical problems are constructed via integral transformation and the principle of superposition. Thus, problems are transformed into a system of singular integral equations, and the expressions of thermal intensity factor, thermal stress intensity factor, and electric displacement intensity factor are obtained.

The results were in good agreement with the theory of Gormley and Kennedy and the experiment results of Kumar et al. for particles size smaller than 100 nm. Particles penetration rate increases with increasing of the Schmidt number (Sc), and it decreases with increasing Reynolds and tube length. Particles deposition on the wall induces the changes of the mass and average diameter of particles continuously. Therefore, a nondimensional parameter ( ς ) defined dependency on Reynolds number and particle residence time in tube has been used to express total mass penetration efficiency and mean size growth rate through a straight tube.",

Then we immediately prove that C μ , t is a unitary isomorphism. To accomplish this we identify the reproducing kernel function of the appropriate Hilbert space of holomorphic functions. As a consequence we prove that the Segal‐Bargmann transforms for Versions A , B , and D are also unitary isomorphisms though not by a direct application of the restriction principle. The point is that the C ‐version is the only version where a restriction principle, in our definition of this method, applies directly. This reinforces the idea that the C ‐version is the most fundamental, most natural version of the Segal‐Bargmann transform.",

The algorithms considered are based on the widely used approach of iteratively exchanging boundary condition data on the shared boundary at each time step. There exists a significant and sophisticated numerical analysis of such methods. However, computations for practical applications are often carried out under conditions under which it is unclear if rigorous results apply while relatively few iterations are used per time step. To examine this situation, we derive exact matrix expressions for the propagation of the error due to incomplete iteration that can be readily evaluated for specific discretization parameters. Using the formulas, we show that the universal validity of several tenants of the practitioner’s conventional wisdom are not universally valid.",

If the coefficient inside the divergence is isotropic, many uniqueness results are known. However, it is known that inverse problem with anisotropic coefficients has many possible coefficients giving the same measured data for the inverse problem. For anisotropic coefficient with anomaly with or without jumps from known or unknown background, nonuniqueness of the inverse problems is discussed and the relation to cloaking or illusion of the anomaly is explained. The uniqueness and nonuniqueness issues are discussed firstly for EIT and secondly for ISP in similar arguments.

However, the theory of Lamé functions and ellipsoidal harmonics affiliated with the ellipsoidal system is rather complicated. A turning point would reside in the existence of expressions interlacing these two different systems. Still, there is no simple way, if at all, to bridge the gap. The present paper addresses this issue. We provide explicit formulas of specific ellipsoidal harmonics expressed in terms of their counterparts in the classical spherical system. These expressions are then put into practice in the framework of physical applications.",

Assuming that the fluid is inviscid and incompressible and the motion is irrotational, we consider incident progressive waves with a given angular frequency within the framework of potential flow theory. With the aid of the homotopy analysis method (HAM), the convergent analytical series solutions are derived by solving the simultaneous equations in which we apply a convergence-control parameter to obtain convergent solutions with relatively few terms. The clear calculation results are represented to show nonlinear wave-plate interaction. The effects of different physical parameters, including incident wave amplitude, Young’s modulus, the thickness and density of the plate on the wave scattering, and the hydroelastic response of the floating plate, are considered. We find that the variations of the plate stiffness, thickness, and density greatly change amount of wave energy which is reflected into the open water region and is transmitted into the plate-covered region. Further, the hydroelastic response of the plate also can be affected by the amplitude of incident wave.",

The general solution of this system is represented by two arbitrary harmonic functions and solution of the Helmholtz equation. Based on the general solution, an algorithm of constructing approximate solutions of boundary value problems is developed. Using the proposed method, the approximate solutions of some problems on stress concentration on the contours of holes are constructed. The values of stress concentration coefficients obtained in the case of moment elasticity and for the classical elastic medium are compared. In the final part of the paper, we construct the approximate solution of a nonlocal problem whose exact solution is already known and compare our approximate solution with the exact one. Supposedly, the proposed method makes it possible to construct approximate solutions of quite a wide class of boundary value problems.",

Geometric active contour model based on level set method can deal with the problem of image segmentation, but it does not consider the problem of image denoising. In this paper, a new diffusion equation model for noisy image segmentation is proposed by incorporating some classical diffusion equation denoising models into the segmental process. An assumption about the connection between the image intensity and level set function is given firstly. Some classical denoising models are employed to describe the evolution of level set function secondly. The final nonlinear diffusion equation model for noisy image segmentation is built thirdly. Then image segmentation and image denoising are combined in a united framework. The segmental results can be presented by level set function. Experimental results show that the new model has the advantage of noise resistance and is superior to traditional segmentation model.",

Because of the time-dependence of parameters, we cannot solve the Schrödinger solutions relying only on the conventional method of separation of variables. To overcome this difficulty, special mathematical methods, which are the invariant operator method, the unitary transformation method, and the Nikiforov-Uvarov method, are used when we derive solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the system. In particular, the Nikiforov-Uvarov method with an appropriate coordinate transformation enabled us to reduce the eigenvalue equation of the invariant operator, which is a second-order differential equation, to a hypergeometric-type equation that is convenient to treat. Through this procedure, we derived exact Schrödinger solutions (wave functions) of the system. It is confirmed that the wave functions are represented in terms of time-dependent radial functions, spherical harmonics, and general time-varying global phases. Such wave functions are useful for studying various quantum properties of the system. As an example, the uncertainty relations for position and momentum are derived by taking advantage of the wave functions.",

The Motz problem has been known as a benchmark problem to verify the efficiency of numerical methods in the presence of a jump boundary data singularity at a point, where an abrupt change occurs for the boundary condition. We propose a singular basis function enrichment technique in the context of partition of unity based meshfree method. We take the leading terms of the local series expansion at the point singularity and use them as enrichment functions for the local approximation space. As a result, we obtain highly accurate leading coefficients of the Motz problem that are comparable to the most accurate numerical solution. The proposed singular enrichment technique is highly effective in the case of the local series expansion of the solution being known. The enrichment technique that is used in this study can be applied to monotone singularities (of type<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math>with<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn mathvariant=\"normal\">1</mml:mn></mml:math>) as well as oscillating singularities (of type<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">sin</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϵ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math>).

The novelty is the fact of considering massive agents, namely particles whose individual mass does not become infinitesimal when $N$ grows. This implies that the total mass of the system is not constant but grows with $N$. The main result is that the two types of models approach one another in the limit $N\\to\\infty$, provided the strength and/or the domain of pedestrian interactions are properly modulated by $N$ at either scale. This is consistent with the idea that pedestrians may adapt their interpersonal attitudes according to the overall level of congestion.",

The cluster state is a special, highly entangled quantum state that forms the universal resource on which measurement‐based quantum computation can be performed. This paper provides a brief review of the theoretical foundations of cluster state quantum computation and how it evolved from the traditional model of digital computers. It then proposes a scheme for the generation of such entanglement in a solid‐state medium through the suppression of resonant tunneling of a ballistic electron by a single‐electron charge qubit. To investigate the viability of the scheme for the creation of cluster states, numerical calculations are performed in which the entanglement interaction is modeled in detail.",

B-splines with quasilinearization and Tikhonov regularization methods are used to obtain new numerical solutions to this problem. First, a quasilinearization method is used to linearize the equation in a specific time step. Then, a linear combination of B-splines is used to approximate the largest order of derivatives in the equation. By integrating from this linear combination, some approximations have been obtained for each of the functions and derivatives with respect to time and space. The boundary and additional conditions of the problem are also applied in these approximations. The Tikhonov regularization method is used to solve the system of linear equations using noisy data. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method.",

Through parameter setting, the solution of the kinked solitary wave is found from the general solution of the traveling wave, and it is found that when the two fractional derivatives become smaller synchronically, the waveform becomes more smooth, but the position is basically unchanged. The reason for this phenomenon is that the kink solitary wave reaches equilibrium in the counterclockwise and clockwise rotation, and the stretching phenomenon is accompanied in the process of reaching equilibrium.

Then, the inverse problem about parameter estimation for these fractional-order SEIAR models of the Norovirus outbreak is studied firstly. To provide the numerical solution of the single-term (or multiterm) fractional-order nonlinear differential equation, the GMMP scheme and Newton method are introduced. Then, we make use of the modified hybrid Nelder-Mead simplex search and particle swarm optimization (MH-NMSS-PSO) algorithm to obtain the fractional orders and parameters for these fractional-order SEIAR models of Norovirus outbreak. To guarantee the correctness and effectiveness of the methods, the data of a 2007 Norovirus outbreak in a middle school in one city is used as the real data to solve the inverse problem of the parameter estimation. With the new parameters, all numerical studies illustrate that the numerical solutions fit very well with the real data, which reveals that the single-term and multiterm fractional-order SEIAR models of Norovirus outbreak all can predict the number of the infectious people accurately. And it also shows that the GMMP scheme and the MH-NMSS-PSO method are efficient and valid for estimating the parameters of the single-term (or multiterm) fractional-order nonlinear equations. Then, we research the impact of changes in each parameter on the amount of infected humans <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mi>I</a:mi> <a:mfenced open=\"(\" close=\")\"> <a:mrow> <a:mi>t</a:mi> </a:mrow> </a:mfenced> </a:math> when the remaining parameters are unchanged.

And we also study the effect of the isolation on different days. The conclusion is obtained that the earlier the isolation is taken, the less the infected people are. Hence, for a fractional-order application in the SEIAR model of Norovirus outbreak, we establish the effective parameter estimation methods.",

    "abstract": "In the Internet age, social needs have become more diverse. The private sector has achieved great success in integrating resources to provide services to customers thanks to technological breakthroughs such as mobile Internet and big data, while the public sector has become even more dwarfed. The public sector urgently needs new theoretical support to integrate administrative resources more effectively, so as to provide the public with one-stop, holistic and seamless services as a whole. The “holistic governance” theory effectively responded to the abovementioned problems and gradually condensed the consensus of the academic and practical circles and became the most influential theory. The method of mathematical modeling is used to combine the improved wavelet domain Wiener filter and the comprehensive model of partial differential equations. This paper proposes an image recognition algorithm based on partial differential equations and wavelet transform. The algorithm uses weight coefficients to organically combine high-order partial differential equation models, retains the advantages of the second- and fourth-order partial differential recognition models, effectively improves the ability to maintain image edge detail information, and achieves better recognition results. This article starts with the description of the fragmentation of a street’s grassroots governance and sorts out the process of implementing overall governance with the “big linkage mechanism” as the main carrier. Due to the limitations of research ability and objective conditions, this article intercepts the “cross-section” of the big linkage mechanism in a certain street to demonstrate it and analyzes this “cross-section” more thoroughly. The experimental results of the data show that the image recognition algorithm based on partial differential equations and wavelet transform is effective and practical in the intelligent linkage system of the government urban public management.",

After analyzing the classical Mumford-Shah model and related improvement algorithms, we found that most of the improvement algorithms start from the initialization strategy of the model and the minimum value solution of the energy generalization function, so we will also improve the classical Mumford-Shah model from these two perspectives. For the initialization strategy of the Mumford-Shah model, we propose to first reduce the dimensionality of the image data by the PCA principal component analysis method, and for the reduced image feature vector, we use <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>K</mi> </math> -means, a general clustering method, as the initial position algorithm of the segmentation curve. For the image data that have completed the above two preprocessing processes, we then use the Mumford-Shah model for image segmentation. The Mumford-Shah curve evolution model solves the image segmentation by finding the minimum of the energy generalization of its model to obtain the optimal result of image segmentation, so for solving the minimum of the Mumford-Shah model, we first optimize the discrete problem of the energy generalization of the model by the convex relaxation technique and then use the Chambolle-Pock pairwise algorithm We then use the Chambolle-Pock dual algorithm to solve the optimization problem of the model after convex relaxation and finally obtain the image segmentation results. Finally, a comparison with the existing model through many numerical experiments shows that the model proposed in this paper calculates the texture image segmentation with high accuracy and good edge retention. Although the work in this paper is aimed at two-phase image segmentation, it can be easily extended to multiphase segmentation problems.",

Secondly, the multiperson target dynamic tracking method based on the adaptive search box is used, combined with target isolation and occlusion detection, to judge the athlete’s training target.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we use discriminative objective equations to conduct an in-depth study and analysis of face recognition methods in teaching attendance and use the model in actual teaching attendance. It focuses on the design and implementation of the attendance module, which uses wireless network technology to record students’ access to classrooms in real time, and relies on face recognition technology to identify students’ sign-in images to achieve attendance records of students’ independent attendance sign-in. Real-time detection of student attendance is achieved by combining face detection and face recognition technology through regular camera photography and automatic attendance check-in by the server. Based on the recognition results of the attendance check-in image, an attendance mechanism is proposed, and the attendance score of the student for the current course can be calculated using the attendance mechanism, which realizes the automatic management of student attendance. For the face recognition process, the system uses the Ad boost algorithm based on Hear features to achieve face detection, preprocesses the face samples with gray normalization, rotation correction, and size correction, and uses the method based on LBP features to achieve face recognition. Firstly, a combination of histogram equalization and wavelet denoising is chosen to preprocess the training sample images to obtain the face image light invariance description, and then, the initial dictionary is constructed using the dimensionality reduction performance of the PCA method; next, the initial dictionary is updated, and a new dictionary with representation and discrimination capabilities is obtained using the LC-KSVD algorithm that makes improvements in the dictionary update stage. The sparse coefficients of the feature matrix of the test sample image under the new dictionary are calculated, and the class correlation reconstruction is performed on the feature matrix of the test sample image, and the corresponding reconstruction error is solved; finally, the discriminative classification of the test sample image is achieved according to the solved class correlation reconstruction error. The relevant experiments on the face database prove that the algorithm can improve the recognition accuracy to a certain extent and better solve the influence of changing lighting conditions on the face recognition accuracy.",

Based on a 4-dimensional dynamic model, the existence of multistability is verified in supercavitating system through simulation, and the robustness of vehicles varying with parameters is analyzed by basins of attraction. Results of the research disclose that the supercavitating system has three stable states in some regions of parameters space, namely, stable, periodic, and chaotic states, while in other regions it has various multistability, such as coexistence of two types of stable equilibrium points, coexistence of a limit cycle with a chaotic attractor, and coexistence of 1-periodic cycle with 2-periodic cycle. Provided that cavitation number varies within a small range, with increase of the feedback control gain of fin deflection angle, size of basin of attraction becomes smaller and robustness of the system becomes weaker. In practical application, robustness of supercavitating vehicles can be improved by setting parameters of system or adjusting initial launching conditions.",

Moreover, the finite stopping time when resolving the disagreement has been clarified. The estimation of the finite stopping time will effectively reveal which factors and how they determine the consequence of intervention. However, the upper bound for the estimation of the integrable stopping time when noise is oriented has been quite conservative. In this paper, we investigate the finite stopping time of eliminating the disagreement by completely oriented noise and a much more precise formula for the estimation of the finite stopping time is obtained finally via direct calculation.",

The dependencies of the dispersion behavior and interaction for different wave modes on the thickness of the annular beam and betatron oscillation frequency are studied in detail by numerical calculations. The results show that the inner and outer radii of the beam have different influences on propagation properties of the electrostatic and electromagnetic modes with different betatron oscillation parameters. In the weak ion channel situation, the two types of electrostatic waves, that is, space charge and betatron modes, have no interaction with the transverse magnetic modes. However, in the strong ion channel situation, the transverse magnetic modes will have two branches and a low frequency mode emerged as the new branch. In this case, compared with the solid beam case, the betatron modes not only can interact with the high frequency branch at small wavenumber but also can interact with the low frequency branch at large wavenumber.",

By using the Fourier transform on the state space of the walk, we obtain a formula that links the moments of the walk’s probability distributions directly with annihilation and creation operators on Bernoulli functionals. We also prove some other results on the structure of the walk. Finally, as an application of these results, we establish a quantum central limit theorem for the annihilation and creation operators themselves.",

The chemotaxis suppresses the range of velocity for the circular motion. This braking effect on velocity originates from the refractory period behind the rear interface of the spot and the negative chemotactic velocity.

The advantages of the two devices are utilized to achieve effective separation of solid particles and prevent secondary pollution. Among the various structural influence factors of filtration equipment, four structural parameters that affect the separation performance significantly are selected as optimization variables. The response surface methodology was used to design the simulation experiment. Using fluid mechanics analysis software, multiple sets of parameters were simulated. Then, the simulation data was used to establish a mathematical model of separation efficiency, and structural optimization analysis was performed based on the mathematical model. Finally, the results show that the inner exhaust pipe diameter and the cone height have more influence on the efficiency of the cyclone separation structure. The interaction between the diameter and insertion depth of the inner exhaust pipe is also obvious. Among the four optimization variables, there is an optimum value for the inner exhaust pipe insertion depth, and the effect of the other three factors on the separation efficiency is monotonic. In the case of a total separation efficiency of 99.9% and after optimizing the combined model within a reasonable interval, 81.25% of the 1- μ m particles can be removed by the cyclone separation part, and only 18.75% are removed by the filter cartridge.",

The nonlocal symmetries related to truncated Painlevé expansion, the finite transformation, and the symmetry reduction solutions of the AKNS system are presented. The corresponding Bäcklund transformations and the interaction solutions of the AB-mKdV system are constructed based on the special reduction. The results demonstrate that the AB-mKdV system possesses many kinds of interaction solutions, such as the interactions between kink and soliton and kink and cnoidal waves.

In order to achieve the purpose of research, we newly define the absorptive capacity coefficient, the creativity ability coefficient, the depreciation coefficient of knowledge, the ambiguity coefficient of knowledge, and the knowledge affinity coefficient of organizational culture. And various knowledge quantities such as knowledge energy, knowledge temperature, and diffusion coefficient for the knowledge diffusion equation were defined and simulations were carried out by the lattice kinetic method. And, based on the new model, we have successfully studied the impact of the characteristics of members, knowledge itself, and organizational culture on the diffusion of competitive knowledge. The results show that the diffusion velocity of knowledge in the organization increases as the knowledge absorbing ability of the members is larger, and the ambiguity of knowledge has a negative impact on the diffusion of knowledge. The degree of knowledge affinity of organizational culture is a decisive factor in the diffusion and accumulation of knowledge in the organization, and the cultural characteristics of the organization have a much greater influence on the diffusion of competitive knowledge than the personal characteristics of members. Therefore, the organization manager needs to pay more attention to building a better organizational culture than improving personal characteristics. Our research is helpful in analyzing the factors affecting competitive knowledge diffusion and constructing an effective knowledge management system.",

Using suitable mathematical assumptions, the novel kinds of solitary, periodic, and singular soliton solutions are derived and established in view of the trigonometric and rational functions of the governing equation. To achieve this, the illustrative example of the VC generalized nonlinear wave equation is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the procedure used in this study. The trajectory solutions of the traveling waves are shown explicitly and graphically. The effect of the free parameters on the behavior of acquired figures of a few obtained solutions for two nonlinear rational exact cases was also discussed.

We obtain periodic, solitary, mixed periodic-soliton, and polynomial solutions through the approach. In particular, we exhibit topological kink-dark bell wave, topological kink, singular kink, bright bell, peakon solitons, and periodic shape waves to apply suitable values on parameters for both distinct models. The impact of fractionality on the wave shape and its deformation is analyzed and discussed graphically. We also investigate multishock wave’s solutions of both models and analyzed the effect of each existing parameters involved in the obtained solutions. To visualize the real characters of the solitary solutions, the graphical elucidation in 3D and 2D profiles are plotted. In computational effort and realization, it is emphasized that the proposed scheme is friendly useful, highly effective, and a powerful mathematical tool to extract exact solitary wave solutions for the differential models, as well as fractional differential models.",

It is of great importance to study the Schrödinger equation with those potentials. In this paper, we further extend the hyperbolic Pöschl-Teller potential through generalizing the superpotential of that potential of the form Atanh (αx)-Bcoth (αx) to the more general form -Atanh (npx)-Bcoth (mpx). First, we introduce briefly the shape invariance and the potential algebra in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Second, we derive three additive shape invariances, which are related to parameters <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>A</mi> <mtext> </mtext> </math> and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>B</mi> </math> of the partner potentials with the generalized superpotential, and discuss the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in detail. Although the superpotential has two parameters, those shape invariances still belong to the one-parameter form. The reason is that there is always a constraint relationship between <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <mi>A</mi> </math> and <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <mi>B</mi> </math> in the additive shape invariance of the partner potentials. Third, through the potential algebra approach, we obtain the relevant shape invariance and calculate the corresponding eigenvalue of the Schrödinger equation with the potential of the generalized superpotential. The calculation shows that the algebraic form shape invariance of the partner potentials with that superpotential is anastomotic to the above. Last, we make a summary and outlook.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of designing individualized products is to meet the specific requirements presented by the customer. Therefore, designers need to adapt the relevant components of the product for each customer, which is difficult to achieve efficiently with existing methods. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach that enables intuitive modelling of products and supports fast conversion of different customer requirements (CRs) to configuration solutions. Firstly, the product properties are decomposed, and a standardized CR expression template is established to enable the mapping of CR information to product properties change information. Secondly, the community structure in complex network theory is introduced to visualize and quantitatively describe the relationship between product parts. The community detection method based on fuzzy clustering is applied to module division, and the optimal result is obtained using the <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mi>F</a:mi> </a:math> -statistic and modularity as evaluation indexes. Finally, the individualized product configuration problem is transformed into a dynamic constraint satisfaction problem. According to CR information and product module division result, the hierarchical community structure is used to narrow the search space and quickly derive solutions with high customer satisfaction through case-based configuration. An automatic guided vehicle is used as an example to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Art design major is a relatively important course in college teaching. It involves a wide range of directions. Advertising art, landscape art, interior design, etc. are closely related to people’s lives. Art design has appeared in all aspects of people’s lives. However, a new art design program is time-consuming and human resources for art design. Different art designs will contain relatively similar characteristics, which can alleviate many difficulties for art designers. However, it is also a relatively difficult task to discover the relationship between the characteristics of the art and design only by artificial means. Image recognition technology can assist designers to discover and find the relationship between artworks, and these related features can assist designers to design. In this study, an intelligent image recognition method for intelligent art design is designed using the VB-CNN-GRU method. It can identify patterns, shapes, color matching, and text features of artistic design products. The research results show that the VB-CNN-GRU method can accurately complete the intelligent image recognition task of art design major. The VB-CNN-GRU method has specifically higher accuracy in art design image recognition than the single VB-CNN method. The maximum prediction error of VB-CNN-GRU in art design image recognition is only 2.37%. For the four characteristics of art design, it can better assist designers to complete related designs.",

All of them have simplified expressions for the inertial torques and mathematical models of the gyroscope motions do not validate by practice. Recent research in the theory of the gyroscopic effects for rotating objects solved problems with mathematical models for interrelated inertial torques generated by the spinning disc, bar, and ring and their motions. Practitioners of engineering designed gyroscopic devices with spinning rotors whose geometry can be an annulus or similar designs. Such spinning annulus generates inertial torques whose expressions differ from the disc bar and ring and hence another mathematical model describes the motions of the gyroscopic devices. The value of gyroscopic effects of the devices with spinning annulus is bigger than for the disc-type rotor. This manuscript presents mathematical models for the inertial torques generated by the spinning annulus and the interrelated angular velocities of the gyroscopic devices about axes of rotation.",

It will also become an inexhaustible driving force to help colleges and universities promote the reform and innovation of the education and teaching system. This paper takes student evaluation data and student online learning data as research objects. Focusing on the teaching operation and students’ autonomous learning, this paper uses the improved k-mode algorithm to cluster analyze the classroom teaching operation. This paper uses neural network algorithm based on machine learning to predict and compare students’ online course learning. It is hoped that it can provide meaningful reference for the construction of teaching management system and the reform and innovation of teaching management system in colleges and universities. Two research works are mainly carried out through the preliminary analysis and transformation of the data of student evaluation of teaching in a certain university. The improved cosine dissimilarity algorithm is used to eliminate the abnormal teaching evaluation data. The normalization method was used to standardize the teaching evaluation data. The traditional k-mode algorithm is used to cluster the teaching evaluation data. Some problems of k-mode algorithm are pointed out, and the traditional k-mode algorithm is improved. Experimental results show that the improved algorithm is more reasonable and effective.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of manufacturing informatization, many transactions are conducted on the Internet, but the final form of transaction completion is the transaction of actual products, which makes the logistics industry emerge as the times require. How to achieve the optimal allocation scheme and the fastest efficiency in the supply chain has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper considers the characteristics and advantages of 3D image processing technology, describes the characteristics of 3D image processing supply chain (SC), and analyzes the channels that 3D image technology affects SC. Combining the respective characteristics of fuzzy theory and grey theory, the two theories are combined to develop strengths and circumvent weaknesses to form grey fuzzy theory. Comprehensive evaluation of supply chain logistics capability can achieve better evaluation results. The application of grey theory in this chapter includes constructing the factor set of the evaluation index system and determining the weight matrix of the factor set with the game method. The grey fuzzy evaluation weight matrix (i.e., single index evaluation result) is determined with the grey theory, and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation result is finally calculated. This paper studies the supply chain logistics capability evaluation and optimization system from the aspects of system analysis, system function module design, and system architecture design and analyzes the overall goal, demand, feasibility, system business process, and data flow of the system construction. At the same time, this paper designs the supply chain logistics capability evaluation and optimization system and shows some functional interfaces. It is of great significance to improve the responsiveness, total inventory level, total cost level, supply chain performance, agility, and flexibility of the supply chain in the new environment.",

Also, it depicts the characteristic of magnetism to many insulating crystals as well as interaction spins. Moreover, the ferromagnetism plays a fundamental role in modern technology and industry and it is principal for many electrical and electromechanical devices such as generators, electric motors, and electromagnets.

Consequently, much more new Jacobi elliptic traveling wave solutions are found. These new solutions have not yet been reported in the studied models. For the study models, the new solutions are singular solitons not yet observed. Additionally, certain interesting 3D and 2D figures are performed on the obtained solutions. The geometrical representation of the HFSCE provides the dynamical information to explain the physical phenomena.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses an adaptive control approach for synchronizing two chaotic oscillators with saturated nonlinear function series as nonlinear functions. Mathematical models to characterize the behavior of the transmitter and receiver circuit were derived, including in the latter the adaptive control and taking into account, for both chaotic oscillators, the most influential performance parameters associated with operational amplifiers. Asymptotic stability of the full synchronization system is studied by using Lyapunov direct method. Theoretical derivations and related results are experimentally validated through implementations from commercially available devices. Finally, the full synchronization system can easily be reproducible at a low cost.",

Heat transfer augmentation in the coolant chamber was achieved through the use of pin fin structure and mist cooling, which could increase the turbulence and heat transfer efficiency. The present research is focused on heat transfer and pressure characteristics of the impinging cooling in the coolant chamber using FLUENT software. With the given diameter of impinging hole, pin fin diameter ratios<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D/d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>have been numerically studied in ranges from 1 to 2.

After the pin fin structure was taken, the resulting temperature decrease of 38.77 K at most compared with the result of structure without pin fins. And with the mist injecting into the cooling chamber, the area weighted average temperature got a lower value without excess pressure loss, which could satisfy the more stringent requirements in engineering.",

In the present paper, we propose a new model of antipenetration which preserves the conservation of linear momentum on the boundaries and enables us to simulate complex and flexible boundaries.

Such measures possess singular features because of the existence of so-called divergence points. By the box-counting principle, we analyze multifractal structure of the divergence points of some homogeneous Moran measures and show that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of divergence points is the same as the dimension of the whole Moran set.",

This paper addresses direct solution based on the selective use of different dimensional models at different regions of the problem domain. For the multidimensional approach, a higher-order transition element is developed to connect the different element types where two- and three-dimensional laminated elements based on higher-order subparametric concept are considered. Modeling simplicity and calculation efficiency of the multidimensional approach are shown for the analysis of cantilever plates with stepped section and patch-repaired plates.",

Such a model is appropriate to characterize the chemical and biological solutions as well as to some nanotechnological devices. An exact analytic expression of the output amplitude is obtained. Based on it, some characteristic features of stochastic resonance phenomenon are revealed. On the other hand, by the use of the exact expression, we obtain the phase diagram for the resonant behaviors of the output amplitude versus noise intensity under different values of system parameters.

The D1Q3 lattice Boltzmann model with spatial second-order accuracy is constructed, and the accuracy of the established D1Q5 model is greater than second order. The numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and numerical accuracy of the proposed models and indicate that our proposed models are suitable for solving the Black-Scholes equation.

The influence of velocity slip on the flow and heat transfer properties of a hyperbolic nanofluid has been investigated. The partial differential equations for nanoparticle solid concentration, energy, and motion were turned into ordinary differential equations. Nanoparticle mass fluxes at boundaries are assumed to be zero, unlike surface concentrations. The influence of the main parameters on flow characteristics, surface friction coefficients, and the Nusselt number has been visualized. The results suggest that Brownian motion has a negligible impact on the heat transfer rate. The ratio of the elastic force to the viscosity force was found to decrease the fluid velocity. The resulting thermophysical properties of nanofluids are in agreement with previous research. The present findings can be used to expand the potential for using nanofluids as a coolant in critical thermophysical and industrial installations.",

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of society and the increasingly fierce competition among enterprises, it is necessary to analyze the production and operation conditions of enterprises in a timely and effective manner. In the context of the development of information technology, many companies analyze financial data, and corporate financial analysis indicators are the analysis of various report data of the company’s operations, which can effectively reflect the company’s debt repayment, operation, profit, and development capabilities. Enterprises can judge the operation status of the enterprise and make strategic changes in time according to the indicators of enterprise financial analysis. However, due to the large amount of operational data of enterprises and different relationships among different types of data, the analysis of enterprise financial data is not accurate enough when using traditional enterprise financial analysis indicators for analysis. This paper established an engineering scientific model through fuzzy sets and improved the data analysis ability of enterprise financial analysis indicators in enterprises by means of fuzzy analysis. By comparing the enterprise financial analysis indicators of the engineering science model based on fuzzy sets and the traditional enterprise financial analysis indicators, the experimental results showed that the average financial information analysis accuracy of the enterprise financial analysis index based on the engineering science model based on fuzzy sets and the traditional enterprise financial analysis index are 84% and 74%, respectively. Therefore, applying the engineering science model based on fuzzy sets to the corporate financial analysis indicators can effectively improve the accuracy of financial information analysis.",

Secondly, the expected value model of UVIP is established after the expected value is discretized by the Stieltjes integral. Furthermore, a gap function is constructed to transform UVIP into an uncertain constraint optimization problem, and the optimal value of the constraint problem is proved to be the solution of UVIP. Finally, the convergence of solutions of the Stieltjes integral discretization approximation problem is proved.",

After the image noise reduction processing by the mean shift filtering algorithm, the infrared small and weak target image data model is constructed by using the denoised infrared small and weak target image. And the brightness value and position of unknown small and weak targets are obtained. The tracking and measurement model of small and weak targets is built. The joint probabilistic data association algorithm is used to calculate the probability that each measurement is associated with its possible source targets, and the particle filter is used to update the tracking status of small and weak targets to achieve real-time tracking of small and weak targets. The experimental results show that the algorithm can enhance the edge contour information of small and weak images, so as to accurately track small and weak targets moving in any track, and has good real-time tracking and accuracy. There is a small deviation between the tracking track of weak and small targets tracked by the algorithm and the actual track, and the root mean square difference of tracking weak and small targets is within 2 pixels. In addition, the detection probability of detecting weak and small targets is less affected by SNR environmental factors.",

We apply the newly proposed numerical method to a known random function, stochastic 1D wave equation, and stochastic 2D Schnakenberg model, respectively.

The aircraft track angle system is abstractly modeled to obtain a triangular model in the form of strict feedback. For the abstracted strict feedback model, the fuzzy logic is used to approximate the uncertain part of the model. A command filter and an error compensation mechanism are introduced to prevent the computational bloat problem caused by excessive system order, and a convergent series sequence is used to deal with the truncation error caused by the approximation of the fuzzy logic.

We obtain the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral operator for Müntz orthogonal functions so that we can reduce the complexity of calculations and increase the speed of solving the problem, which can be seen in the process of running the Maple program. To solve the fractional Bagley–Torvik equation with initial and boundary conditions, we use Müntz orthogonal functions and consider simple and distinct real roots of Müntz orthogonal functions as collocation points. By using the Riemann–Liouville fractional integral operator that we define for the Müntz orthogonal functions, the process of numerically solving the fractional Bagley–Torvik equation that is solved using Müntz orthogonal functions is reduced, and finally, we reach a system of algebraic equations. By solving algebraic equations and obtaining the vector of unknowns, the fractional Bagley–Torvik equation is solved using Müntz orthogonal functions, and the error value of the method can be calculated. The low error value of this numerical solution method shows the high accuracy of this method. With the help of the Müntz functions, we obtain the error bound for the approximation of the function. We have obtained the error bounds for the numerical method using which we solved the fractional Bagley–Torvik equation with initial and boundary conditions. Finally, we have given a numerical example to show the accuracy of the solution of the method presented in this paper.

A matrix representation of the Caputo fractional derivative of ISFs is presented using matrices representing the fractional integral and derivative operators. Using this matrix, the spectral element method reduces the desired equation to a system of algebraic equations. To find the solution, the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES method) and Newton’s method are used in linear and nonlinear forms of this system, respectively.

From this theoretical result, it shows that a surface water wave progressing over two different muddy sections, the surface wave will excite two opposite-traveling short interfacial waves, forming a nearly standing wave at the interface of the fresh water and the muddy layer. Meanwhile, two opposite-outgoing “mud” waves each with very long wavelength will be simultaneously induced at the interface of two muddy sections. As a result, the amplitudes of the two short internal waves are found to grow exponentially in time.

    "abstract": "Mass is experienced to have two intrinsic properties: inertia (resistance to acceleration) and gravity (attraction to other masses). In this paper we evaluate the gravitational effect of all masses of the universe on an accelerated mass, starting from linearized general relativity. The gravitational interaction of all masses in a finite static universe model is shown to create a finite resistance to acceleration, which is inertia. Then, we propose a generalization of the linearized theory and evaluate the Hubble expanding universe. It is shown that the gravitational impact of an infinite expanding universe creates finite inertia, according to <svg style=\"vertical-align:-0.1638pt;width:52.137501px;\" id=\"M1\" height=\"15.85\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 52.137501 15.85\" width=\"52.137501\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> <g transform=\"matrix(.017,-0,0,-.017,1.288,11.962)\"><path id=\"xF5C42\" d=\"M637 591q-54 -43 -110 -109q-4 2 -12 8t-12 8l47 68h-523v50h523l-47 68l24 16q56 -66 110 -109z\" /></g><g transform=\"matrix(.017,-0,0,-.017,44.825,15.4)\"><path id=\"xF5C41\" d=\"M449 591q-54 -43 -110 -109q-4 2 -12 8t-12 8l47 68h-335v50h335l-47 68l24 16q56 -66 110 -109z\" /></g><g transform=\"matrix(.017,-0,0,-.017,43.475,15.588)\"><path id=\"x1D44E\" d=\"M483 97q-42 -50 -88.5 -79.5t-68.5 -29.5q-37 0 -17 93l22 102h-2q-54 -79 -144 -149q-59 -46 -100 -46q-24 0 -43 29t-19 86q0 78 34.5 153t94.5 120q41 31 94 51.5t98 20.5q29 0 72 -9q26 -6 39 -6l2 -4q-30 -117 -67 -323q-8 -41 2 -41q16 0 79 58zM374 387&#xA;q-32 15 -73 15q-52 0 -83 -23q-48 -36 -78 -108.5t-30 -152.5q0 -33 8.5 -50.5t20.5 -17.5q31 0 107 79t99 132q15 40 29 126z\" /></g><g transform=\"matrix(.017,-0,0,-.017,.062,15.588)\"><path id=\"x1D439\" d=\"M599 650l-18 -160l-30 -2q-2 70 -11 94q-5 16 -26 24t-75 8h-94q-27 0 -33.5 -6.5t-12.5 -32.5l-43 -226h108q52 0 72.5 5t31 18t28.5 52h28l-40 -200h-28q-1 42 -6 56.5t-24.5 21t-70.5 6.5h-108l-32 -177q-13 -65 1 -80.5t88 -22.5l-8 -28h-279l6 28q61 5 77.5 20.5&#xA;t29.5 81.5l72 387l7.5 40.5t1 26.5t-4 18t-15.5 10t-24 6t-37 4l8 28h461z\" /></g><g transform=\"matrix(.017,-0,0,-.017,15.344,15.588)\"><path id=\"x3D\" d=\"M535 323h-483v50h483v-50zM535 138h-483v50h483v-50z\" /></g><g transform=\"matrix(.017,-0,0,-.017,30.048,15.588)\"><path id=\"x1D45A\" d=\"M766 88q-40 -45 -83.5 -72.5t-63.5 -27.5q-39 0 -16 103l49 224q15 68 -10 68q-36 0 -112.5 -78.5t-105.5 -133.5q-27 -101 -38 -165q-35 -4 -77 -18l-6 6q42 153 70 288q12 55 10 78t-19 23q-38 0 -114 -80.5t-101 -131.5q-24 -68 -41 -165q-36 -3 -76 -18l-8 6&#xA;q56 202 87 347q7 33 -3 33q-8 0 -31.5 -17.5t-41.5 -35.5l-12 28q42 45 84 72t63 27q44 0 10 -124l-20 -75h2q92 121 193 178q36 21 64 21q62 0 28 -159l-8 -37h2q50 67 103.5 112t94.5 65q39 19 62 19q60 0 23 -156l-45 -189q-9 -39 2 -39q17 0 71 49z\" /></g> </svg>.

Our formalism yields them as solutions of sets of linear equations with simple constant coefficients. The role of zero-sum multiplets constituted in terms of roots of unity is pointed out, and their origin is traced to circular permutations of the indices in the tensor products of basis states induced by our class of matrices. The role of free parameters, increasing as with N , is emphasized throughout. Spin chain Hamiltonians are constructed and studied for all N . Inverse Cayley transforms of the Yang-Baxter matrices corresponding to our braid matrices are obtained for all N . They provide potentials for factorizable S -matrices. Main results are summarized, and perspectives are indicated in the concluding remarks.",

The free boundary is the surface that separates the inner core (where the velocity is uniform) from the external layer where the fluid behaves as an upper convected Maxwell fluid. We present a procedure to obtain an explicit representation formula for the solution. We then exploit such a representation to write the free boundary equation in terms of the initial and boundary data only. We also perform an asymptotic expansion in terms of a parameter tied to the rheological properties of the Maxwell fluid. Explicit formulas of the solutions for the various order of approximation are provided.",

Introduction of LMIs enables one to take into consideration the sign of connection weights.

We further extend the idea of the almost everywhere partition of unity and apply it to linear elasticity problem. We use a special mapping to build a partition of unity on a non-convex domain. The partition of unity that we use has a unique feature: the mapped partition of unity has a curved shape in the physical coordinate system.

The thermodynamic potentials can be obtained by computing the free energy of a gas of quasi-particles, whose energy spectrum is conditional on the gap function. However, the nontrivial dependence of the gap on the temperature jeopardises the validity of the standard thermodynamic relations. In this article, it is shown how the thermodynamic consistency (i.e., the validity of the Maxwell relations) is recovered, and the correction terms to the quasi-particles potentials are computed. It is shown that the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation avoids the problem of the thermodynamic consistency of the quasi-particle approach; in fact, the correct identification of the variables, which are associated with the quasi-particles, leads to a precise calculation of the quasi-particles vacuum energy and of the dependence of the chemical potential on the electron density. The stationarity condition for the grand potential coincides with the gap equation, which guarantees the thermodynamic consistency.

This technique can be applied to different topologies and is robust to parametric uncertainties caused by tolerances in the electronic components. The design of coupling signals is based on the definition of a set of functionals which depend on the errors between the outputs of the nodes and the errors between the output of a reference system and the outputs of the nodes. When there are no parametric uncertainties, we establish a criterion to design the coupling signals using only one state variable of each system. When the parametric uncertainties are present, we add a robust observer and a low pass filter to estimate the perturbation terms, which are subsequently compensated through the coupling signals, resulting in a robust closed loop system. The performance of the synchronization technique is illustrated by real-time simulations.",

However, the big initial boundary value problem is also a topic of theoretical significance. In this paper, we devote oneself to the well-posedness of the Kirchhoff-type wave system under the big initial boundary conditions. Combining the potential well method with an improved convex method, we establish a criterion for the well-posedness of the system with nonlinear source and dissipative and viscoelastic terms. Based on the criteria, the energy of the system is divided into different levels. For the subcritical case, we prove that there exist the global solutions when the initial value belongs to the stable set, while the finite time blow-up occurs when the initial value belongs to the unstable set.

Here frame domains are expanded to include space and time lattices. Strings of qukits are described as hybrid systems as they are both mathematical and physical systems. As mathematical systems they represent numbers. As physical systems in each frame the strings have a discrete Schrodinger dynamics on the lattices. The frame field has an iterative structure such that the contents of a stage j frame have images in a stage j-1 (parent) frame. A discussion of parent frame images includes the proposal that points of stage j frame lattices have images as hybrid systems in parent frames. The resulting association of energy with images of lattice point locations, as hybrid systems states, is discussed. Representations and images of other physical systems in the different frames are also described.",

In this paper, we attempt to explore the uncertain random data envelopment analysis approach so as to solve the problem that the inputs and outputs of DMUs are uncertain random variables. Chance theory is applied to handling the uncertain random variables, and hence, two evaluating models, one for increasing returns to scale (IRS) and the other for decreasing returns to scale (DRS), are proposed, respectively. Along with converting the two uncertain random models into corresponding equivalent forms, we also provide a numerical example to illustrate the evaluation results of these models.",

It is found that the rational lump decays algebraically in all directions in the space plane and its amplitude possesses one maximum and two minima. One kind of the mixed solution describes the interaction between one lump and one line solitary wave, which exhibits fission and fusion phenomena under the different parameters. The other kind of the mixed solution shows one lump interacting with two paralleled line solitary waves, in which the evolution of the lump gives rise to a two-dimensional rogue wave. This shows that these three interesting phenomena exist in the corresponding physical model.",

The governing nonlinear partial differential equations of the problem are transformed into a set of coupled nonlinear third-order ordinary differential equations by the similarity variable method and have been systematically solved using the optimal homotopy asymptotic method. The main aim of the present study is to inspect the effects of various physical parameters in the flow model on velocity and heat transfer in steady two-dimensional laminar boundary layer flow with convective boundary conditions. The influences of the Grashof number, internal heat generation, the Biot number, radiation parameter, and the Prandtl number on the skin-friction coefficient, the fluid velocity profile, and temperature distribution have been determined and discussed in detail through several plots. The finding revealed that the fluid velocity and temperature delivery upsurge with snowballing in the values of the Biot number and internal heat generation parameters. The temperature profile of the fluid declines contrary to the value of the Grashof number and the Prandtl number but increases with thermal radiation. Moreover, it is found that the skin-friction coefficient and the rate of heat intensify with the Grashof number, internal heat generation, the Biot number, and thermal radiation parameter. The obtained result is likened with the previously published numerical results in a limited case of the problem and shows an excellent agreement.",

    "abstract": "Based on the introduction of the basic ideas and related technologies of partial differential equations, as well as the method of path planning, the application of partial differential equations in solving urban path planning is studied. The path planning model of partial differential equations and the setting of obstacle boundary conditions are introduced, and adaptive. Theoretical research and experimental results show that it is feasible and effective to solve urban path planning by partial differential equations, which provides a new way for urban path planning research ideas and methods. This paper proposes an image detection algorithm based on diffusion equation. According to the logarithmic transformation, the multiplicative speckle noise in the image can be converted into additive noise. We first perform logarithmic transformation on the image and then use the denoising model of the diffusion equation to filter out the noise in the image and then use the logarithm to recognize the image. The difference image is obtained by the domain difference method, and finally, the difference image is classified by the clustering algorithm, and the change area is extracted. Experiments show that the algorithm can effectively reduce the effect of multiplicative speckle noise on the change detection results, improve the accuracy of change detection, and shorten the change detection time. This article takes the path planning problem of a two-dimensional space city as an example to discuss the application of partial differential equations. According to the principle of energy conservation, this paper uses the two-dimensional space radiant heat conduction equation as an example to model and illustrate the solution of the path planning problem.",

    "abstract": "The saliency calculation model based on the principle of partial differential equations sometimes highlights areas with high contrast in the background, and the salient targets obtained occasionally have holes. The above problems can be solved by combining the improved convex hull calculation center saliency map. This paper designs a single-target color image segmentation algorithm based on partial differential equations. First, we calculate the basic saliency map according to the uniqueness of the color and the spatial distribution of the color; second, we then use the superpixel to improve the convex hull and calculate the central saliency map according to the principle; finally, the basic saliency map and the central saliency map are calculated. The weighted fusion is used to obtain the comprehensive saliency map, and the threshold method is used to segment the comprehensive saliency map to obtain the final target image. This paper designs an evaluation standard suitable for the segmentation of the illuminated highlight area of the effect image. It compares the experimental results of the segmentation method in this paper with the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) method and the traditional superpixel method to segment the illuminated highlight area. The segmentation method is applied to the image enhancement experiment. Based on the fuzzy means clustering algorithm, a fuzzy clustering objective function including brightness, color, and distance parameters is designed, which improves the weight of the brightness value in the clustering and improves the edge fit of the segmentation of the lighting highlight area of the rendering. The segmentation method produced by combining the clustering method with the superpixel biased clustering method can improve the output effect of the illuminated highlight area of the effect image after segmentation. We perform color equalization processing on the image to be segmented to reduce the impact of light, then set the closed value of the brightness information component, perform segmentation judgment, and expand the long and short axes of the ellipse model in the high-brightness area to further reduce the impact of light. The experimental results prove that the above method has a better segmentation effect than the traditional ellipse model and can accurately segment the gesture image. Compared with the existing mainstream saliency calculation models, this algorithm is closer to the true value image in terms of visual effects and has obvious advantages in terms of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth analysis and research on the identification of psychological crisis signals of college students using the optimized Dufferin equation. The early warning index system of college students’ psychological crisis was established and tested on 300 junior college students, and the early warning system of college students’ psychological crisis was established by using structural equation model, focusing on the mediating effect of coping mode between stress source and stress response and the mediating effect of stress source between social support and stress response. At the same time, the characteristics of psychological crises among college students of different genders and grades were compared and analyzed. To address the shortcomings of the classical Dufferin equation with limited noise immunity, the use of a higher-order double-coupled Dufferin system was further improved. A detection model based on the higher-order double-coupled system was established, and its feasibility was verified by the psychological crisis signal. The geometric features of the phase trajectory are adopted as the basis for judging the system state, which greatly reduces the computational effort. Based on defining the conceptual connotation of college students’ psychological crisis behavior system, the vulnerability of college students’ psychological crisis behavior system is interpreted from the perspective of system self-organization theory, and the vulnerability of college students’ psychological crisis behavior is mainly expressed in latent and manifest states, and its vulnerability transformation is a self-organization process. A questionnaire survey was conducted for ordinary college students to examine the performance of college students’ vulnerability state of the subject who endured college students’ psychological crisis behavior, and it was concluded that most college students appear to be normal and healthy on the surface, but college students’ vulnerability is in an uncertain state of intermediate transition.",

    "abstract": "This article comprehensively and systematically expounds the development trends and basic theory of partial differential methods, analyzes the characteristics of sampling multiscale transformation in detail, and deeply studies the network image denoising and network image restoration methods that perform partial differential diffusion in the pixel domain and the transform domain. An adaptive diffusion method of partial differential equations is proposed. Among them, the key parameters can be adaptively changed according to the curvature and gradient of the local geometric information of the network image, and the diffusion direction and intensity of the diffusion can be controlled. First, using the principle of variation, we derive the Euler equation corresponding to the diffusion method of partial differential equations and analyze its diffusion ability using the local orthogonal coordinate system of the network image. Based on the theoretical analysis of public opinion, this article applies opinion mining technology to the online public opinion early warning system to achieve the purpose of grasping the opinions of netizens in time and guiding the trend of public opinion. Opinion mining is the use of natural language processing technology to automatically extract the emotional tendencies and evaluation objects contained in the subjective text. In the edge area of the network image, the diffusion along the edge direction should have a large diffusion coefficient, and the diffusion along the vertical edge direction should have a small diffusion coefficient; in the flat area of the network image, it diffuses to the surrounding with equal intensity, and the diffusion intensity value is relatively high. Secondly, based on the analysis of the adaptive partial differential equation diffusion method, using the half-point difference format, a numerical method for network image recognition is designed. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the network image recognition model based on adaptive partial differential equation diffusion is more effective than the model based on partial differential equation recognition; at the same time, experiments show that the network image recognition model based on adaptive partial differential equation diffusion is more effective than the network image recognition model based on ordinary diffusion. The network image recognition model based on constant partial differential equation diffusion is more effective in improving the quality of network image recognition.",

This paper also considers the needs of computer fluid animation simulation in terms of computational accuracy and simulation efficiency, takes high real-time, high interactivity, and high physical accuracy of simulation algorithm as the research focus and target, and proposes a solution algorithm and acceleration scheme based on deep neural network framework for the key problems of simulation of natural phenomena including smoke and liquid. With the deep development of artificial intelligence technology, deep neural network models are widely used in research fields such as computer image classification, speech recognition, and fluid detail synthesis with their powerful data learning capability. Its stable and efficient computational model provides a new problem-solving approach for computerized fluid animation simulation. In terms of time series reconstruction, this paper adopts a tracking-based reconstruction method, including target tracking, 2D trajectory fitting and repair, and 3D trajectory reconstruction. For continuous image sequences, a linear dynamic model algorithm based on pyramidal optical flow is used to track the feature centers of the objects, and the spatial coordinates and motion parameters of the feature points are obtained by reconstructing the motion trajectories. The experimental results show that in terms of spatial reconstruction, the matching method proposed in this paper is more accurate compared with the traditional stereo matching algorithm; in terms of time series reconstruction, the error of target tracking reduced. Finally, the 3D motion trajectory of the point feature object and the motion pattern at a certain moment are shown, and the method in this paper obtains more ideal results, which proves the effectiveness of the method.",

First, some mainstream segmentation algorithms are studied, and on this basis, a segmentation algorithm for spectral clustering analysis of athletes’ physical condition in training is proposed. After that, through the analysis of the existing methods, compared with some algorithms that only process a single frame in the video, this article analyzes the continuous multiple frames in the video and extracts the continuous multiple frames of the sampling points through the Lucas-Kanade optical flow method. We densely sampled feature points contain as much motion information as possible in the video and then express this motion information through trajectory description and finally achieve segmentation of moving targets through clustering of motion trajectories. At the same time, the basic concepts of image segmentation and video motion target segmentation are described, and the division standards of different video motion segmentation algorithms and their respective advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. The experiment determines the initial template by comparing the gray-scale variance of the image, uses the characteristic optical flow to estimate the search area of the initial template in the next frame, reduces the matching time, judges the template similarity according to the Hausdorff distance, and uses the adaptive weighted template update method for the templates with large deviations. The simulation results show that the algorithm can achieve long-term stable tracking of moving targets in the mine, and it can also achieve continuous tracking of partially occluded moving targets.",

However, there is no theoretical investigation about the configuration of the range of incident directions. In this paper, we carefully explore the mathematical structure of topological derivative imaging functional by establishing a relationship with an infinite series of Bessel functions of integer order of the first kind. Based on this, we identify the condition of the range of incident directions and it is highly depending on the shape of unknown defect. Results of numerical simulations with noisy data support our identification.",

A hybrid finite element method and finite volume method (FEM/FVM) are introduced to solve the above-mentioned model. The distributions of viscoelastic stress, temperature, backbone orientation, and backbone stretch are given in 4 : 1 planar contraction viscoelastic flows. The effect of Pom-Pom molecular parameters and a slip parameter on thermorheological behaviors is discussed. The numerical results show that the backbones are oriented along the direction of fluid flow in most areas and are spin-oriented state near the wall area with stronger shear of downstream channel.

By introducing potential functions, the closed-form expressions for the displacement and the stress of the viscoelastic soil surrounding the deeply buried spherical methane tank are obtained. Two die structures are considered: a homogeneous elastic medium and a shell structure. Based on the theory of elastic motion and the Flügge theory, analytic solutions for the dynamic responses of the spherical methane tank in a fractional-derivative viscoelastic soil are derived explicitly. Analytic solution expressions of the undetermined coefficients are determined by using the continuum boundary conditions. The system dynamic responses to the homogeneous elastic medium and the shell structure and the influences of the parameters of the fractional derivative, soil, and die on the dynamic characteristic of the system are compared and analyzed. The results indicate a significant difference between the dynamic responses of the die structures for the two models.",

We considered a quadratic and a cubic eigenvalue problem related to the inclusion of smart materials and surface effects. Simulations were performed for a two stepped beam with a piezoelectric patch subject to pulse forcing terms. Results with Timoshenko models that include surface effects are presented for micro- and nanoscale. It was observed that the effects are significant just in nanoscale. We also simulate the frequency effects of a double-span beam in which one segment includes rotatory inertia and shear deformation and the other one neglects both phenomena. The proposed analytical methodology can be useful in the design of micro- and nanoresonator structures that involve deformable flexural models for detecting and imaging of physical and biochemical quantities.",

Hence, the convergence of the discretization scheme is guaranteed. Unfortunately, the matrix coefficients are improper integrals involving oscillating and, in the worst cases, slowly decaying functions. Moreover, the classical analytical asymptotic acceleration technique leads to faster decaying integrands without overcoming the most important problem of their oscillating nature. Thus, the computation time rapidly increases as higher is the accuracy required for the solution. The aim of this paper is to show a new analytical technique for the efficient evaluation of such kind of integrals even when high accuracy is required for the solution.",

Analytical expressions for the interaction energies are obtained to determine the optimal radii of the tubes to enclose the nickel atom by determining the radii that give the minimum interaction energies. We first investigate the suction energy of the nickel atom entering the nanotube. The atom is assumed to be placed on the axis and near an open end of a semi-infinite, single-walled nanotube. Moreover, the equilibrium offset positions of the nickel atoms are found with reference to the cross-section of the nanotubes. The results may further the understanding of the encapsulation of Ni atoms inside defective nanotubes. Furthermore, the results may also aid in the design of nanotube-based materials and increase the understanding of their nanomagnetic applications and potential uses in other areas of nanotechnology.",

In this paper, an alternative method is proposed for computing the nonclassical symmetry of PDEs. The method consists of the following three steps: firstly, a relationship between the classical and nonclassical symmetries of PDEs is established; then based on the link, we give three principles to obtain additional equations (constraints) to extend the system of the determining equations of the nonclassical symmetry. The extended system is more easily solved than the original one; thirdly, we use Wu’s method to solve the extended system. Consequently, the nonclassical symmetries are determined. Due to the fact that some constraints may produce trivial results, we name the candidate constraints as “potential” ones. The method gives a new way to determine a nonclassical symmetry. Several illustrative examples are given to show the efficiency of the presented method.",

To better characterize its attributes and improve the prediction accuracy of screening efficiency, this study involves the acquisition of the vibration signals and screening efficiency data under various operational conditions. Subsequently, empirical mode decomposition energy entropy (EMD‐EE), variational mode decomposition energy entropy (VMD‐EE), and wavelet packet energy entropy (WP‐EE) features are extracted from the time series vibration signals, and three single input energy entropy‐generalized regressive neural network (GRNN) prediction accuracy models are established and compared. Furthermore, we introduce the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA)‐WP‐EE feature reconstruction‐GRNN prediction algorithm. This approach involves reconstructing the feature vector by optimizing WP‐EE‐GRNN prediction under varying parameters. The parameterized GRNN model is then predicted and analyzed through secondary reconstruction involving KPCA dimensionality reduction features. The results show that WP‐EE‐GRNN achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to box dimension ( d )‐GRNN, box dimension‐back propagation neural network (BPNN), and d ‐weighted least squares support vector machine, WP‐ d ‐GRNN, WP‐EE‐BPNN, EMD‐EE‐GRNN, and VMD‐EE‐GRNN. Additionally, the WP‐EE feature reconstruction‐GRNN algorithm exhibits higher prediction accuracy than the single‐input WP‐EE‐GRNN algorithm. The WP‐EE‐GRNN prediction algorithm using KPCA dimensionality reduction and secondary reconstruction not only achieves higher prediction accuracy than prior to KPCA dimensionality reduction but also improves prediction efficiency. Following the extraction of two core principal components, model parameters when KPCA’s σ 2 = 0.85, the optimal parameter of GRNN model Spread = 0.051, and the optimal number of training samples N = 19, the average prediction error is 1.434%, the minimum prediction error reaching 0.708%, the minimum root mean square error reaching 0.836% and Pearson correlation coefficient marking the closest to 1, these result all representing the optimum achievable values.

    "abstract": "The incorporation of renewable energy on a broad scale into power grids increases the complexity to the issue of transient voltage stability in power systems. This research presents a rapid evaluation technique for assessing the stability of voltage fluctuations in power grids that receive electricity from photovoltaic sources. At first, a receiving‐end system model was developed, which includes photovoltaics, and an alternative circuit of the virtual induction motor (IM) is obtained by utilizing the Thevenin equivalent. Second, the torque balance equation and the Kirchhoff voltage equation are interconnected to determine the unstable slip of the IM following a malfunction. Finally, by merging the unstable slip with the conventional transient stability discriminant index, the effects of different photovoltaic outputs, IM ratios, and system contact impedances on transient voltage stability are investigated. The proposed method avoids the computational burden of solving the differential‐algebraic equations describing the complex transient processes of the IM. It also obviates the necessity of iteratively modifying the receiving load or fault clearance time in the simulation platform to achieve the constrained stability condition of the system’s transient voltage. The transient stabilization of voltage results is efficiently obtained by directly solving algebraic equations.",

    "abstract": "Several scientific areas utilize fractional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) to model various phenomena, yet most of these equations lack exact solutions (Ex‐Ss). Consequently, techniques for obtaining approximate solutions (App‐S), which sometimes yield Ex‐Ss, are essential for solving these equations. This study employs a novel technique by combining the residual function and modified fractional power series (FPS) with the Aboodh transform (A‐T) to solve various nonlinear problems within the framework of the Caputo derivative. Studies on absolute error (Abs‐E), relative error (Rel‐E), residual error (Res‐E), and recurrence error (Rec‐E) validate the accuracy and effectiveness of our approach. We apply the limit principle at infinity to determine the coefficients of the series solution terms. In contrast, other methods, such as variational iteration, homotopy perturbation, and Elzaki Adomian decomposition, rely on integration, while the residual power series method (RPSM) employs differentiation, both of which face challenges in fractional scenarios. Moreover, the efficiency of our approach in solving nonlinear problems without depending on Adomian and He polynomials makes it more effective than various approximate series solution techniques. Our method yields results that are very similar to those obtained from the differential transform, the homotopy perturbation, the analytical computational, and Adomian decomposition methods (ADMs). This demonstrates that our technique is a suitable alternative tool for solving nonlinear models.",

    "abstract": "In problems defined on a semi‐infinite domain, rational Chebyshev or Laguerre functions are the generic choices of basis functions in spectral methods. The rationale is that if the solution is oscillatory near the origin, then large number of basis functions may be required to retrieve the spectral accuracy that is not convenient. In this paper, we propose a novel idea that combines Chebyshev wavelets and orthogonal rational functions for solving problems in semi‐infinite domain numerically. The semi‐infinite domain [0, ∞) is divided into two subdomains [0, α ) and [ α , ∞). As the basis functions, Chebyshev wavelets are considered in the subdomain [0, α ) and a new class of orthonormal rational functions is derived on the semi‐infinite subdomain [ α , ∞). By constructing the operational matrices of derivative, integral, and product, and implementing the collocation method, the original problem is transcribed to a system of algebraic equations. A key feature of the method is that for a suitably chosen α , it yields good approximations to the solutions that first oscillate and then decay fast as t → ∞. Application of the proposed method to the Volterra’s model for population growth of a species in a closed system is explained. Numerical results show that the discrete solution exhibits exponential convergence as a function of suitable α and the number of collocation points.",

Fundamentally, the sine‐Gordon equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) commonly used to model wave propagation, soliton dynamics, and particle interactions across various physical systems. This article focuses on the analytical solution of the 2D nonlinear coupled sine‐Gordon equations in nonlinear wave contexts, considering specific boundary and initial conditions. The solution approach combines the triple Sumudu transform (TST) with an iterative method, detailing the analytical techniques and discussing their convergence properties. The exact solution, presented as a convergent series, is visually depicted through graphs. To address the nonlinear part of the equations, a successive iterative method was applied. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated through two test problems, with examples from engineering applications demonstrating its applicability. In conclusion, this method proves to be highly effective, efficient, and promising for finding exact solutions. Overall, the 2D nonlinear coupled sine‐Gordon equations capture the intricate dynamics of nonlinear wave propagation, soliton interactions, and energy conservation in systems with multiple interacting components, making them a powerful tool for modeling a broad range of physical systems.",

    "abstract": "The known publications related to the gyroscope theory consider only several geometries of the spinning rotors, like the disc, bars, rings, spheres, and others. The geometries of the spinning objects in engineering can have many designs that generate different values of inertial torques. A computing of inertial torques produced by the object’s rotating masses depends on the radii of their locations. Gyroscopic devices with a spinning torus or ring like other objects should be computed for the quality of their operation. The simplified expression for the radius of the mass disposition for the ring is presented by its middle radius which does not give the correct results for inertial torques and motions of gyroscopic devices. The radius of distributed masses of a ring is bigger than its middle radius because of the differences in the external and internal semirings. A torus is a ring whose exact expression of the radius for distributed mass should be derived for the correct solution for the inertial torques generated by the rotating mass. The precise formulas for inertial torques acting on the spinning torus enable finding its optimal size for the gyroscopic devices. This paper presents the method and derivation of mathematical models for the inertial torques produced by the spinning torus and its interrelated angular velocities about the axes of rotations that manifest gyroscopic effects.",

At present, the sharing economy is on the rise worldwide and influences labor accounting. In this paper, starting from the context of the sharing economy and the current situation of labor accounting, several important aspects of labor accounting will be discussed. In the context of the sharing economy, household subsistence service production is to be included in the production accounting boundary, which is the root of the changes in labor accounting. On this basis, the following findings are drawn. (1) The scope of accounting for employment should be expanded, which puts higher demands on the labor accounting method. (2) Working time should be remeasured, especially indicators based on pay time. (3) Finally, the design of indicators in labor underutilization also requires the formation of new ideas, especially unemployment should be redefined. Finally, in view of the current status of labor accounting in China, policy suggestions for future improvement under the sharing economy are put forward.",

    "abstract": "In the process of research on the flow velocity distribution in a partially filled pipe, the under-sampling of measurement data often occurs. For the first time, this problem is solved by the improved non-uniform B-spline curve fitting approximation (NBSC) method. The main innovation of this method is to reconstruct the flow velocity distribution fitting curve with a small amount of non-uniform feature points containing flow velocity information. First, the curvature of a whole discrete sampled data is analyzed, then the weighted threshold is set, and the sampled points that satisfy the threshold are extracted as the initial velocity distribution feature points. Next the node vectors were constructed according to the initial feature points, and the initial interpolation fitting curves are generated. Secondly, by using the relative deviation between the initial approximation curve and each sampled point, new feature points were added where the curve allowable deviation exceeded the specified tolerance, and then a new interpolation fitting curve was obtained. The above procedure was repeated until the fitting curve reached expected accuracy, thus the appropriate feature points were determined. Experimental results showed that, in the case of the same approximation deviation, the proposed NBSC method can solve the problem of under-sampling of measurement data better.",

The heat concentration around a cylindrical interface crack in a bilayered composite tube has not been resolved in literature and thus is investigated in this paper based on the singular integral equation method. The time variable in the two-dimensional temperature governing equation, derived from the non-Fourier theory, is eliminated using the Laplace transformation technique and then solved exactly in the Laplacian domain by the employment of a superposition method. The heat concentration degree caused by the interface crack is judged quantitatively with the employment of heat flux intensity factor. After restoring the results in the time domain using a numerical Laplace inversion technique, the effects of thermal resistance of crack, liner material, and crack length on the results are analyzed with a numerical case study. It is found that heat flux intensity factor is material-dependent, and steel is the best liner material among the three potential materials used for sustaining transiently high temperature loadings.",

In the previous studies, it is assumed that the prior information of the target is known, and the definition of target spectrum variance has not changed. In this paper, we study on robust waveform design problem in multiple targets scene. We hope that the upper and lower bounds of the uncertainty range of robustness are more close to the actual situation, and establish a finite time random target signal model based on mutual information (MI). On the basis of the optimal transmitted waveform and robust waveform based on MI, we redefine the target spectrum variance as harmonic variance, and propose a novel robust waveform design method based on harmonic variance and MI. We compare its performance with robust waveform based on original variance. Simulation results show that, in the situation of multiple targets, compared to the original variance, the MI lifting rate of robust waveform based on harmonic variance relative to the optimal transmitted waveform in the uncertainty range has great improvement. In certain circumstances, robust waveform based on harmonic variance and MI is more suitable for more targets.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear hydroelastic interaction among a floating elastic plate, a train of deepwater waves, and a current which decays exponentially with depth is studied analytically. We introduce a stream function to obtain the governing equation with the dynamic boundary condition expressing a balance among the hydrodynamic, the shear currents, elastic, and inertial forces. We use the Dubreil-Jacotin transformation to reformulate the unknown free surface as a fixed location in the calculations. The convergent analytical series solutions for the floating plate deflection are obtained with the aid of the homotopy analysis method (HAM). The effects of the shear current are discussed in detail. It is found that the phase speed decreases with the increase of the vorticity parameter in the opposing current, while the phase speed increases with the increase of the vorticity parameter in the aiding current. Larger vorticity tends to increase the horizontal velocity. In the opposing current, the horizontal velocity under the wave crest delays more quickly as the depth increases than that of waves under the wave trough, while in the aiding current case, there is the opposite effect. Furthermore, the larger vorticity can sharpen the hydroelastic wave crest and smooth the trough on an opposing current, while it produces an opposite effect on an aiding current.",

Based on the finite-time stability theory, Itô’s lemma, and some inequality technologies, the synchronization criterion of network models in the nonlinear coupling mode is obtained; at the same time, unknown parameters of networks are also identified by an effective controller. In addition, several corollaries are given to illustrate the general applicability of the control rules in the paper. Finally, two typical numerical simulations are given to prove the rationality and feasibility of theoretical analysis of network models.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses the GIS technology to collect location and geographic information of the South Atlantic ecological environment and then uses the remote sensing image technology to extract and analyse the collected information to provide a strong basis for maintaining a healthy marine ecological environment. Based on multitemporal remote sensing images, this paper constructs an ecological vulnerability evaluation model for marine by coupling several ecological indicators, analyses the status of marine ecological environment and its dynamic changes, explores the driving factors of its changes, further analyses the relationship between ecological vulnerability, land use changes, and landscape patterns, and proposes targeted ecological protection countermeasures for marine ecological environment. This paper analyses and studies the quality control mechanism of marine environment monitoring data, the construction of marine environment evaluation model, and the automation of evaluation and early warning response based on the application of GIS, with the support of marine environment evaluation and early warning business, to enhance the availability and integrity of marine environment monitoring data, improve the execution efficiency of marine environment evaluation business and early warning response, reduce the risk of marine environment emergencies, and realize the integration and intelligence of marine environment evaluation and early warning, to improve the level of Informa ionization and management of marine environment evaluation business in marine management departments. The operational watershed ecological environment monitoring service system built in this paper, which integrates GIS, RS, GPS, data warehouse, and other information technologies, has the advantages of high accuracy of information extraction, convenient data management, good portability, and strong operability, which can provide a scientific basis for the unified scheduling management of the marine environment, ecological environment evaluation, and sustainable development planning of the economy, and it is of great theoretical and practical significance and can be used in other watersheds. Meanwhile, the unique environment of the ocean has endowed the marine microorganism with affluent diversity, which can display a variety of bioactivities. In this study, thirty-two seawater and sediment samples were collected from different depths within the scope of 5 m to 3203 m at 18 sampling sites in the South Atlantic Ocean. 1017 culturable strains were obtained after isolation and identification. The tip culture method was used to screen strains with antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic activities. The tip culture results showed that a total of thirty-one marine strains were confirmed to have significant antagonism against aflatoxin production with an inhibition ratio exceeding 80%, including 11 strains with a mycelial growth inhibition ratio exceeding 80% simultaneously. The variability of culturable bacterial distribution and diversity were studied by phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences revealed a significant diversity of culturable strains. A total of 31 strains clustered into 13 genera: Marinobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Alteromonas sp., Idiomarina sp., Halomonas sp., Alcanivorax sp., Thalassospira sp., Jannaschia sp., Stakelama sp., Erythrobacter sp., Chengkuizengella sp., Bacillus sp., and Microbacterium sp. The 31 strains with antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic activities were dominated by populations of strains belonging to the genus Thalassospira (19.35%). To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first report to analyse the diversity of culturable bacteria with antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic activities in the South Atlantic Ocean from three perspectives: different media, different sampling stations, and different sampling depths.",

Using the fixed-time synchronization theory, inequality technique, we obtain simple robust fixed-time synchronization conditions. Designing proper feedback controllers is a key step for the implementation of synchronization. Furthermore, based on the fixed-time robust synchronization, we design a switching adaptive controller and obtain the finite-time synchronization. It is noted that the settling time is independent on the initial value in the fixed-time robust synchronization. Hence, under the conditions of this paper, the considered system has better stability and feasibility.

Then, the Fourier analysis method is used to analyze the stability of the scheme, which shows that the new scheme is conditionally stable and the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is superior to most existing methods of equivalent order of accuracy in the literature. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy, stability, and efficiency of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an intelligent helmet recognition model in complex scenes based on YOLOv5. Firstly, in construction site projects, consider that the photograph which needs to be identified has numerous problems. For example, helmet’s pixels are too tiny to detect, or a large number of workers makes helmets appear densely. A SE-Net channel attention module is added in different parts of the network layer of the model, so that the improved model can pay more attention to the global variables and increase the detection performance of small target information and dense target information. In addition, this paper constructs a helmet data set based on projects and adds training samples of dense targets and long-range small targets. Finally, the modified mosaic data enhancement reduces the influence of redundant background on the model and improves the recognition accuracy of the tiny target. The experimental results show that in the project, the average accuracy of helmet detection reaches 92.82%. Compared with SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv5, the average accuracy of this algorithm is improved by 6.89%, 8.28%, and 2.44% and has strong generalization ability in dense scenes and small target scenes, which meets the accuracy requirements of helmet wearing detection in engineering applications.",

With the embedded homotopy parameter monotonously changing from 0 to 1, the special easy-to-solve fractional problem continuously deforms to the class of local fractional IDE. As a concrete example, an explicit and exact Mittag–Leffler function solution of one special case of the local fractional IDE is obtained. In the process of solving, two initial solutions are selected for the iterative operation of local fractional HPM. One of the initial solutions has a critical condition of convergence and divergence related to the fractional order, and the other converges directly to the real solution. This paper reveals that whether the sequence of approximate solutions generated by the iteration of local fractional HPM can approach the real solution depends on the selection of the initial approximate solutions and sometimes also depends on the fractional order of the selected initial approximate solutions or the considered equations.",

These parameters may be film thickness, volumetric flux, liquid velocity profile, viscosity, shear stress, gravity, density, and different boundary formations. We have expanded the formulations of non-Newtonian third grade fluid for lifting and draining in fractional space. Fractional calculus along with Homotopy Perturbation Method is used for the solution and analysis purposes. The suitability and consistency of the solutions is determined by detecting residuals in each case. Velocity profile, average velocity, and volume flow for lifting and drainage cases are calculated. To the best of authors knowledge, thin film flow of fractional third grade fluid is not attempted before in lifting and drainage. Investigation shows increase in value of fractional parameter that decreases the velocity profile in lifting while increases the velocity in drainage scenario. Also, the frictional parameter and the gravitational parameter have opposite, while material constant has direct relationship with the velocity profile in lifting case. All the parameters showed inverse effect on the velocity in drainage case.",

The boundary layer equations with the associated boundary conditions that govern the flow are converted into a nondimensional form by using an appropriate transformation. In the domain of a vertical plate that is flat, the resulting method of nonlinear PDEs is mapped and then worked out numerically by applying the implicit central finite difference technique with Newton’s quasilinearization method, and the block Thomas algorithm is well known as the Keller-box method. The outputs are obtained in the terms of the heat transferring rate, the frictional coefficient of skin, the isotherms, and streamlines. The outcomes showed that the local heat transferring rate, the local skin friction coefficient, the temperature, and the velocity all are decreasing, and both the thermal layer of boundary and velocity become narrower with the rising values of reciprocal variation of temperature-dependent thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the friction coefficient of skin, the velocity, and the temperature decrease where the friction coefficient of skin and velocity decrease by 43% and 64%, respectively, but the heat transfer rate increases by 61% approximately, and both the boundary layer thermal and velocity become thinner when the Prandtl number increases.",

This is because the common analytic modeling procedures such as linear regression are often inappropriate for such data and leads to inadequate results. In this article, we proposed a new model for regression analysis of the right-skewed data by assuming the weighted inverse Gaussian, as a great flexible distribution, for response observations. In the proposed model, the complementary reciprocal of the location parameter of response variable is considered to be a linear function of the explanatory variables. We developed a fully Bayesian framework to infer about the model parameters based on a general noninformative prior structure and employed a Gibbs sampler to derive the posterior inferences by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A comparative simulation study is worked out to assess and compare the proposed model with other usual competitor models, and it is observed that efficiency is quite satisfactory. A real seismological data set is also analyzed to explain the applicability of the proposed Bayesian model and to access its performance. The results indicate to the more accuracy of proposed regression model in estimation of model parameters and prediction of future observations in comparison to its usual competitors in literature. Particularly, the relative prediction efficiency of the proposed regression model to the inverse Gaussian and log-normal regression models has been obtained to be 1.16 and 64, respectively, for the real-world example discussed in this paper.",

First, the cubic nonlinear memristive chaotic system is analyzed using the Lyapunov exponential map, bifurcation map, and attractor phase diagram. The experimental results show that under four pairs of symmetric coordinates, the system exists not only parameter-dependent symmetric rotational coexisting attractor and transient chaotic phenomena but also exists super-multistationary with alternating chaotic cycles dependent on the initial value of the memristor. Then, it is proposed to add a constant term to the linear state variable to explore the effect of the offset increment of the linear state variable on the system in four pairs of symmetric coordinates, while circuit simulation of the five-dimensional chaotic system is carried out using Simulink to verify its existence and realisability. Finally, the synchronization of the dimensionality reduction system and the confidential transmission of the image are achieved, using the control voltage of the system to replace the internal state variables of the memristor to achieve the one-dimensional reduction process, and an adaptive synchronization controller is designed to synchronize the system before and after the dimensionality reduction. Based on the above, an image to be transmitted is modulated into a one-dimensional array and then subjected to the fractional and cyclic operations and combined with the linear encryption and decryption functions and the chaotic masking technique, the simple encryption and decryption of the image processes are realized.",

    "abstract": "The boundary element method is widely used in practical engineering problems, especially in the field of acoustics. For flow-induced noise, the main target of acoustic calculations is to solve the wave equation with the flow field information. However, the sound field distribution of noncompact structures in half-space is especially complex because of the strong scattering effect, while the object surface boundary integration often brings a large workload and generates numerical singularities. In this paper, an improved boundary element method for predicting the aeroacoustic noise of noncompact structures is proposed, which can consider the characteristic distribution of sound field induced by complex structures in half-space. The smooth permeable boundary surrounding the object is used as the integration boundary, while the scattering effect of the ground boundary is investigated by combining the mirror Green’s function method, and the numerical prediction of aeroacoustic noise is carried out for the dipole source and NACA0012 airfoil in half-space. Numerical results show that the far-field noise obtained by using the permeable surface is consistent with that obtained by integrating the direct object boundary under the influence of ground boundary scattering. The mirror image Green’s function method is able to finely capture the ground scattering effect, which has a significant effect on the sound field as the frequency increases.",

A K ‐nearest neighbor filter that performs the weight average of the set of K ‐nearest neighbor HPD matrices of each HPD matrix is proposed to reduce the clutter power. Then, the clutter covariance matrix is estimated as the Riemannian mean of a set of secondary HPD matrices. Signal detection is considered as distinguishing the matrices of clutter and target signal on the Riemannian manifold. Moreover, to speed up the convergence of matrix equation of Riemannian mean, we exploit a strategy to choose the initial input matrix and step size of this equation.

When studying the fluid motion of arterial blood flow in arterial vascular tissue, where the density of the vessel wall is roughly equal to that of the blood, the coupling between the blood and the vessel wall is highly nonlinear. In this case, the fluid space where the arterial blood flow is located is no longer fixed in the fluid–structure interaction (FSI) model, and its boundary position is determined by the position of the elastic vessel wall. The contact force exerted by the elastic vascular structure on the blood flow also affects the movement of the blood flow, while the position of the blood vessel is determined by the contact force exerted by the blood flow on the blood vessel; that is, two‐way coupling occurs between the vascular diameter and the blood flow space.

These knots are trivial homology cycles which are Poincaré dual to the higher-order Seiberg-Witten potentials. Moreover the linking number of a standard 1-cycle with the Poincaré dual of the gauge field is shown to be written as an expansion of the linking number of this 1-cycle with the Poincaré dual of the Seiberg-Witten gauge fields. In the process we explicitly compute the noncommutative “Jones-Witten” invariants up to first order in the noncommutative parameter. Finally in order to exhibit a physical example, we apply these ideas explicitly to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. It is explicitly displayed at first order in the noncommutative parameter; we also show the relation to the noncommutative Landau levels.",

Starting from the higher requirements on system operational safety and economy, the reliability focused optimal models of multiobjective maintenance strategies were built. For safety-critical systems, the pessimistic maintenance strategies are usually taken, and, in these cases, the system reliability evaluation has also to be tackled pessimistically. For safety-uncritical systems, the optimistic maintenance strategies were usually taken, and, in these circumstances, the system reliability evaluation had also to be tackled optimistically, respectively. Besides, the reasonable maintenance strategies and their corresponding reliability evaluation can be obtained through the convex combination of the above two cases. With a high-speed train system as the example background, the proposed method is verified by combining the actual failure data with the maintenance data. Results demonstrate that the proposed study can provide a new system reliability calculation method and solution to select and optimize the multiobjective operational strategies with the considerations of system safety and economical requirements. The theoretical basis is also provided for scientifically estimating the reliability of a high-speed train system and formulating reasonable maintenance strategies.",

This physical situation is analysed here on a combined theoretical and numerical analysis. The mathematical framework consists of the two-phase flow phase-field equation set, an advection-diffusion chemical concentration equation, and closure relationships relating the surface tensions to the chemical concentration. The numerical framework is composed of the COMSOL Laminar two-phase flow phase-field method coupled with an advection-diffusion chemical concentration equation. Through transient studies, we show that the penetrating length of the bidroplet system into the capillary tube is linear at early-time regime and exponential at late-time regime. Through parametric studies, we show that the rate of penetration of the bidroplet system into the capillary tube is proportional to a time-dependent exponential function. We also show that this speed obeys the Poiseuille law at the early-time regime. A series of position, speed-versus-property graphs are included to support the analysis. Finally, the overall results are contrasted with available experimental data, grouped together to settle a general mathematical description of the phenomenon, and explained and concluded on this basis.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of rotating objects is an area of classical mechanics that has many unsolved problems. Among these problems are the gyroscopic effects manifested by the spinning objects of different forms. One of them is the Tippe top designed as the truncated sphere which is fitted with a short, cylindrical rod for rotation. The unexplainable gyroscopic effect of the Tippe top is manifested by its inversion towards the support surface. Researchers tried to describe this gyroscopic effect for two centuries, but all modelings were on the level of assumptions. It is natural because the Tippe top has a more complex design than the simple spinning disc, which gyroscopic effects did not have an analytical solution until recent time. The latest research, in the area of gyroscopic effects, reveals the action of the system of several interrelated inertial torques on any spinning object. The gyroscopic inertial torques are generated by their rotating mass. These inertial torques and the variable ratio of the angular velocities of the spinning object around axes of rotations constitute the fundamental principles of gyroscope theory. These physical principles of dynamics of rotating objects enable to description and compute of any gyroscopic effects and also the Tippe top inversion.",

In both the intrasegment and intersegment domains of the data matrix, a robust algorithm is employed to suppress unwanted interference, which significantly improves the robustness of demodulation.

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of image processing research, the study of nonstandard images has gradually become a research hotspot, for example, fabric images, remote sensing images, and gear images. Some of the remote sensing images have a complex background and low illumination compared with standard images and are easy to be mixed with noise during acquisition; some of the fabric images have rich texture information, which adds difficulty to the related processing, and are also easy to be mixed with noise during acquisition. In this paper, we propose a fractional-order adaptive <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <mi>P</mi> </math> -Laplace equation image edge detection algorithm for the problem of image edge detection in which the edge and texture information of the image is lost. The algorithm can apply for the order adaptively to filter the noise according to the noise distribution of the image, and the adaptive diffusion factor is determined by both the fractional-order curvature and fractional-order gradient of the iso-illumination line and combined with the iterative approach to realize the fine-tuning of the noisy image. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm can remove the noise while preserving the texture and details of the image. A fractional-order partial differential equation image edge detection model with a fractional-order fidelity term is proposed for Gaussian noise. The model incorporates a fractional-order fidelity term because this fidelity term smoothes out the rougher parts of the image while preserving the texture in the original image in greater detail and eliminating the step effect produced by other models such as the Perona-Malik (PM) and Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) models. By comparing with other algorithms, the image edge detection effect is measured with the help of evaluation metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity, and the optimal value is selected iteratively so that the image with the best edge detection result is retained. A convolutional mask image edge detection model based on adaptive fractional-order calculus is proposed for the scattered noise in medical images. The adaption is mainly reflected in the model algorithm by constructing an exponential parameter relation that is closely related to the image, which can dynamically adjust the parameter values, thus making the model algorithm more practical. The model achieves the scattering noise removal in four steps.",

    "abstract": "According to the current situation of knowledge popularization, students simply rely on the knowledge learned in the classroom that is far from adapting to the development of modern society; so, every student needs to have the consciousness and ability of independent learning. The research of the English self-help learning system based on partial differential equation method comes into being with information network technology as the foundation for survival and development. The existing partial differential equation recognition models based on average curvature motion are all edge-based and need to use the external force defined by the image gradient to attract the zero level set (evolution curve) to move to the target edge and finally stay on the target edge. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain ideal results when extracting fuzzy or discrete boundaries (perceptual boundaries), and it is very sensitive to the selection of initial contour and noise. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new recognition model of partial differential equations based on mean curvature motion. This overcomes some defects of existing edge models because it is region-based and does not require image gradient as a condition to stop evolution. The proposed model can avoid manual initial curve selection and allow stopping conditions to be set in the algorithm. In addition, in the numerical solution of partial differential equations, the existing model uses upwind difference scheme, and the semi-implicit additive operator separation method is adopted in this paper. Some other layers are added, and some hyperparameters are adjusted when the convolutional neural networks of inception PDEs are constructed by stacking the structure of inception PDEs. In the contrast experiment with the prototype, the software and hardware environment are the same, and the input is exactly the same. For the handwritten English alphabet data set, the variant structure can obtain more than 90% of the training accuracy and verification accuracy, which is better than the experimental accuracy of the prototype. In addition, because the inception PDE structure contains fewer parameters than the prototype, it is more computationally efficient and takes less training time per batch than the prototype.",

Because of its large amount of data and high redundancy, there are many security hidden dangers in ordinary image encryption methods. Aiming at the problems of low flexibility and poor anti-interference of traditional image scrambling technology, this paper proposes to select the scrambling diffusion encryption structure in the process of chaotic digital image encryption, which can produce relatively better encryption performance than single scrambling and diffusion scrambling. The composite chaotic operation used in this paper masks the distribution characteristics of chaotic subsequences. Based on the composite chaotic mapping model, the image scrambling password under the two-dimensional chaotic equation is established by scrambling the image in space and frequency domain. Several rounds of experiments show that the algorithm has a large scrambling scheme, further expands the key space of Arnold algorithm, and effectively resists the common computer brute force attack cracking and image decryption cracking methods such as exhaustive, differential attack and known plaintext attack. The improved encryption algorithm can realize the key avalanche effect, is very sensitive to the initial key and has high key security performance, and solves the security problem in the process of image transmission. Several performance syntheses show that the algorithm has high security performance and is suitable for image encryption scheme.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses partial differential equation image processing techniques to establish image texture analysis models based on nonlinear anisotropic diffusion equations for image denoising, image segmentation, and image decomposition. This paper proposes a class of denoising models based on the hybrid anisotropic diffusion equation from the characteristics of different noise types. The model exhibits anisotropic diffusion near the image boundary, which can protect the boundary well, and isotropic diffusion inside the image; so, it can remove the noise effectively. We use the immovable point theory to prove the uniqueness of the model solution and further discuss other properties such as asymptotics of the solution. We propose a class of image texture analysis algorithms based on anisotropic diffusion equations and discrete gray level sets. First, a class of nonconvex generalized functions is proposed to remove the noise from the original image to obtain a smooth image while sharpening the edges. Then, an energy generalization function based on the gray level set is proposed, and the existence of the global minimum of this energy generalization function is discussed. Finally, an equivalent form of this energy generalization is given in the discrete case, and an image texture analysis algorithm is designed based on the equivalent form. The algorithm is improved by initial position optimization, dynamic adjustment of parameters, and adaptive selection of thresholds so that the ants can search along the real edges. Experiments show that the improved algorithm for image edge detection can obtain more complete edges and better detection results. The energy generalization function is calculated directly on the discrete gray level set instead of solving the corresponding partial differential equation, which can avoid the selection of the initial level set and the reinitialization of the level set, thus greatly improving the segmentation efficiency. The new algorithm has a high improvement in segmentation efficiency and can efficiently handle large size complex images.",

As an important technical means to assist the government and community in management, video recognition technology plays an important role in the accurate management and service of the government and community. Traditional algorithms based on partial differential equations will destroy image edges and image details in video recognition. Based on this, this paper improves the traditional partial differential equation algorithm of image recognition, selects the GAC model based on image segmentation in the main function, and innovatively optimizes the stop function of its equation function, so as to improve the effect of community case image segmentation. In the image smoothing layer, this paper innovatively selects the second derivative based on image processing as the inherent feature of image recognition, so as to solve the rough problem of image edge and improve the processing efficiency of the algorithm. In order to further maintain the details of the relevant images of community cases, this paper integrates the Gaussian curvature driving function on the improved partial differential equation algorithm, so as to protect the details of the smooth region of the relevant recognition video and solve the disadvantages of the traditional algorithm. The experimental results show that the improved partial differential equation algorithm proposed in this paper improves the accuracy of video recognition by about 5% compared with the traditional algorithm.

This paper is based on the partial differential equation to do the following research: Based on the partial differential equation is a kind of equation that simulates the human visual perception system to analyze images; based on the summary of the advantages and disadvantages of multifeature image retrieval technology, we propose a multifeature image retrieval technology method based on the partial differential equation to alleviate the indexing imbalance caused by the mismatch of multifeature image retrieval technology distribution. To improve the search speed of the data-dependent locally sensitive hashing algorithm, we propose a query pruning algorithm compatible with the proposed partial differential equation-based multifeature image retrieval technology method, which greatly improves the retrieval speed while ensuring the retrieval accuracy; to implement the data-dependent partial differential equation algorithm, we need to distribute the data set among different operation nodes, and to better achieve better parallelization of operations, we need to measure the similarity between categories, and we achieve the problem of distributing data among various categories in each operation node by introducing a clustering method with constraints. The purpose of this article for image recognition is for better shopping platforms for merchants. This algorithm has trained multiple samples and has data support. The experimental results show that our proposed data set allocation method shows significant advantages over the data set allocation method that does not consider category correlation. However, the image features used in image retrieval systems are often hundreds or even thousands of dimensions, and these features are not only high in dimensionality but also huge in number, which makes image retrieval systems encounter an inevitable problem—“dimensionality disaster.” To overcome this problem, scholars have proposed a series of approximate nearest neighbor methods, but multifeature image retrieval techniques based on partial differential equations are more widely used in people’s daily life.",

Uncertain information processing is an important research content in the field of artificial intelligence. In this paper, we combine the three-branch concept lattice and linguistic values with the digital elevation model and propose the three-branch fuzzy linguistic concept lattice as well as the attribute approximation method. In this paper, an improved serial algorithm for sink accumulation is proposed. The improved algorithm changes the order of cell calculation; after the cumulative amount of a “sub-basin” is calculated, all cells of the next “sub-basin” are calculated until all cells are calculated. The improved algorithm reduces the overhead space in the calculation process, reduces the pressure of cells entering and leaving the queue, and improves the calculation efficiency. The improved cumulant algorithm is compared with the commonly used recursive cumulant algorithm and the nonrecursive cumulant algorithm, and the improved algorithm improves by about 17% compared with the nonrecursive algorithm at 106 cell level, and the computation time of the recursive algorithm is about 3 times of the improved algorithm. Because the sink accumulation serial algorithm is an important part of the parallel calculation of sink accumulation, and the execution time is shorter by using the improved algorithm, this paper applies the proposed improved accumulation serial algorithm to the process of parallel calculation of accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Image recognition is one of the core research directions in the field of computer vision research, which can be divided into general image recognition and fine-grained image recognition. General image recognition refers to the recognition of different types of objects; fine-grained image recognition refers to the recognition of different subclasses in the same broad class of objects, such as SME financing inventory pledge image recognition. In this paper, we propose a partial differential equation-based image recognition method for SME financing inventory pledges and conduct detailed analysis and experiments. Compared with general images, partial differential equation-based SME financing inventory pledges image recognition is difficult to recognize due to data characteristics such as small differences in features between classes, large differences in features within classes, and a small percentage of targets in the image. To address the problem that existing methods ignore the role of shallow features on fine-grained image recognition, this paper proposes a fine-grained image recognition method based on partial differential equations. By analyzing the important role of shallow features for fine-grained image recognition, a feature fusion method with adaptive weights is proposed. Using this method to fuse shallow and high-level semantic features for recognition, the role of shallow features in fine-grained image recognition is fully exploited. In addition, the proposed method does not change the order of magnitude of the model parameters and is highly transferable. The relevant experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

It classifies the obtained electronic data information into bills, converts it into electronic information related to bills according to the corresponding categories of the bill template, and stores it in the bill table of the database to achieve the management operation of formatted electronic files. After categorizing the bills according to the electronic information of bills to match the business scenarios, financial journal vouchers can be generated according to the preconfigured voucher templates of the corresponding business scenarios, and the financial journal vouchers are converted into voucher messages using XML technology. Finally, we use agent technology to design middleware for heterogeneous financial systems to realize the function of communicating voucher messages to each other in different business systems. The system automatically extracts the key information of invoices through OCR technology and performs real-time verification and cyclical feedback to the verification results to the suppliers. The system has realized the intelligent management of the power company’s VAT invoices, thus greatly enhancing the efficiency of VAT invoice verification and settlement. The automatic tax invoice recognition system adopts a network structured tax invoice recognition model, which eliminates the cumbersome steps of character decomposition and character classification in traditional OCR character recognition.

The feedback process can be described as a communication process based on information theory. The feedback information entropy is associated with the degree of uncertainty elimination of the users who provide feedback information. Many factors are related to this uncertainty, such as information senders often stopped feedback process for some reasons and information senders may have provided fake or spam information. In order to encourage more useful feedback information, a model of a user’s willingness to provide feedback was established with personality traits and cognitive styles as independent variables, feedback motivation as intermediary variables, and feedback willingness as the dependent variable. 206 online and offline questionnaires were obtained to be analyzed by correlation analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation analysis. Cronbach’s <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mi>α</a:mi> </a:math> coefficient was used to test the reliability of the questionnaire, and exploratory factor analysis method was used to verify the validity of the questionnaire. First, correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between personality traits, cognitive styles, and motivation factors. Second, we further explored the strength of the relationship of the five correlated groups of variables through linear regression analysis. At last, we conducted structure equation analyses to test the hypotheses. The results show that both personality traits and cognitive styles can have a significant impact on feedback motivation factors and also show that self-efficacy may be the only evident feedback motivation to encourage useful feedback information. The results show that the willing users with extraversion trait are more likely be motivated by self-efficacy and thus have evident feedback willingness.",

In this era of information explosion, designs that can deliver information faster and more accurately are bound to gain popularity among the public. In this paper, we propose a fast decomposition algorithm image processing method based on a new transform of the wavelet transform, which mainly addresses the problems of large computation of feature points and long-time consumption of traditional image processing algorithms. Firstly, the second-order decomposition of the image is performed by wavelet function to obtain the low-frequency components of the image, and the wavelet gradient vector is used to extract feature points from the overlapping regions of the low-frequency image so that the transformation parameters of feature points can be obtained quickly under the low-frequency image to guide the feature point extraction under the high-frequency image; on this basis, an improved algorithm of image processing based on the fast decomposition algorithm of two-dimensional wavelet transform with planar design is proposed. Using the properties of one-way matching and directional consistency of feature point constraints, the mismatched point pairs are effectively eliminated to improve the feature point matching accuracy and real-time performance. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are verified by two sets of experiments.",

    "abstract": "The oil painting retrieval technology based on the reaction diffusion equation has attracted widespread attention in the fields of oil painting processing and pattern recognition. The description and extraction of oil painting information and the classification method of oil paintings are two important processes in content-based oil painting retrieval. Inspired by the restoration and decomposition functional model of equal oil painting, we propose a reaction diffusion equation model. The new model contains two reaction diffusion equations with different principal parts. One principal part is total variation diffusion, which is used to remove noise. The other main part is thermal diffusion, which is used to modify the source term of the denoising reaction-diffusion equation to achieve the effect of protecting the texture of the oil painting. The interaction of the two reaction-diffusion equations finally achieves denoising while maintaining the boundaries and textures. Under the framework of the above reaction diffusion equation model, we introduce Laplace flow to replace the original total variation flow, so that the new denoising reaction diffusion equation combines the isotropic diffusion and total variation flow of the thermal reaction diffusion equation to achieve the effect of adaptive theoretical research. Using regularization methods and methods, we, respectively, get the well-posedness of the two model solutions, which provides the necessary preparation for numerical calculations. Based on the statistical theory and classification principles of support vector machines, combined with the characteristics of oil painting classification, the research and analysis are carried out from the three important aspects of kernel function, training algorithm, and multiclass classifier algorithm that affect the classification effect and speed. Numerical experiments show that the given filter model has a better processing effect on images with different types and different degrees of noise pollution. On this basis, an oil painting classification system based on texture features is designed, combined with an improved gray-level cooccurrence matrix algorithm and a multiclass support vector machine classification model, to extract, train, and classify oil paintings. Experiments with three types of oil paintings prove that the system can achieve a good oil painting classification effect. Different from the original model, the new model is based on the framework of reaction-diffusion equations. In addition, the new model has good effects in removing step effects, maintaining boundaries and denoising, especially in maintaining texture.",

    "abstract": "This paper is conducted to explore a new characterization method as a supplement to the traditional roughness characterization. The main research includes the extraction and evaluation of damage features of ceramic surface morphology by applying wavelet methods, the extraction of damage features in surface contours by using wavelet analysis, and the quantitative evaluation of damage degree by using damage rate and damage mean spacing. By comparing various fractal dimension calculation methods, a fractal dimension method suitable for calculating the ceramic surface was selected, and the fractal method was used to describe the ceramic surface topography as a whole. By comparing different methods of calculating the fractal dimension and further verifying them with the measured three-dimensional morphology, it is found that the vibrational method is more suitable for calculating the fractal dimension of ceramic surface, and its calculation accuracy is investigated, and the results show that the method is a reliable one. Based on the fractal theory, a mathematical model of surface wear and surface sealing was established. Further study of the model shows that the surface with a large fractal dimension has a good sealing effect; the surface corresponding to the best fractal dimension is the most resistant to wear. The fractal method can characterize the complexity of the surface profile as a whole. The wavelet method can describe the ceramic surface profile from a local perspective, and the combination of the two methods can characterize the ceramic surface well. Finally, the experimental device of the ceramic surface defect detection system is constructed, and the joint debugging of hardware and software is completed. Under different light source intensities, ceramic image samples are collected, and the accuracy detection experiments of sample defective edges are conducted, and the results show that the light source has a small impact on the accuracy of ceramic defective edge detection. The results show that the light source has more influence on the accuracy of scratch detection. The results show that the system constructed in this thesis has good applicability for different ceramic sample detection.",

For data owners, outsourcing the management and maintenance of image data to cloud service providers can effectively reduce costs, but there is a privacy leakage problem.

To protect the BOVW features of images, an inverted index based on word frequency division is designed, the index is stored in chunks, and an image secure similarity recognition scheme based on CNN (convolutional neural networks) features is proposed. The scalable hash index based on dimensional division is designed based on the image CNN features secure extraction algorithm. The security and performance of the proposed scheme are theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified.

Considering the real-time nature of our system, our face feature extraction network is modeled by DeepID, and the network is slightly improved by introducing a central loss verification signal to train a DeepID-like network model using central loss and use it to extract face features. To further investigate and optimize the schedulability analysis problem of the directed graph real-time task model, this paper proposes a rigorous and approximate response time analysis method for the directed graph real-time task model with an arbitrary time frame. Based on the theoretical results of the greatly additive algebra, it is shown that the coherent qualifying function is linearly periodic, i.e., the function can be represented by a finite nonperiodic part and an infinitely repeated periodic part, thus calculating the coherent qualifying function independent of the magnitude of the interval time. The algorithm for high-capacity real-time face retrieval and recognition in the treatment area of hospital based on the task scheduling model is further investigated, and a face database is established by using the PCA dimensionality reduction technique. Based on the internal architecture of the processor, image preprocessing and IP core packaging are implemented, and the hardware engineering of the high-capacity real-time face recognition system for hospital visits is built using the IP-based design concept. The performance tests of the face detection model and feature extraction network show that the face detection model has a significant reduction in false-positive rate, better fitting of border regression, and improved time performance. The face feature extraction network has no overfitting, and the features are highly discriminative with small feature extraction time consumption. The high-capacity real-time face recognition system for the treatment area of hospital combined with the optimized directed graph task scheduling model can approach 25 fps, which meets the real-time requirements, and the face recognition rate surpasses that of real people. It realizes the intelligence, self-help, and autonomy of medical services and satisfies the medical needs of users in all aspects.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that routing strategies based on global topological information is not a good choice for the enhancement of traffic throughput in large-scale networks due to the heavy communication cost. On the contrary, acquiring spatial information, such as spatial distances among nodes, is more feasible. In this paper, we propose a novel distance-based routing strategy in spatial scale-free networks, called LDistance strategy. The probability of establishing links among nodes obeys the power-law in the spatial network under study. Compared with the LDegree strategy (Wang et al., 2006) and the mixed strategy (a strategy combining both greedy routing strategy and random routing strategy), results show that our proposed LDistance strategy can further enhance traffic capacity. Besides, the LDistance strategy can also achieve a much shorter delivering time than the LDegree strategy. Analyses reveal that the superiority of our strategy is mainly due to the interdependent relationship between topological and spatial characteristics in spatial scale-free networks. Furthermore, along transporting path in the LDistance strategy, the spatial distance to destination decays more rapidly, and the degrees of routers are higher than those in the LDegree strategy.",

We model the behavior of the decision makers, derive the equilibrium conditions, and establish the variational inequality formulation for interbank credit network and trust network. We then utilize the variational inequality formulation to obtain qualitative properties of the equilibrium pattern in terms of existence and uniqueness.",

The multiplicity of their irreducible components is governed by a compact gauge group. The mutually commuting observable algebra and gauge group form a dual pair in the sense of Howe.

An algebraic method with computerized symbolic computation is applied in obtaining a series of exact solutions of the KdV equation. Numerical studies have been made using plasma parameters which reveal different solutions, that is, bell-shaped solitary pulses, rational pulses, and solutions with singularity at finite points, which called “blowup” solutions in addition to the propagation of an explosive pulses. The weakly relativistic effect is found to significantly change the basic properties (namely, the amplitude and the width) of the ion-acoustic waves. The result of the present investigation may be applicable to some plasma environments, such as ionosphere region.",

Radius estimate of the convergence ball of the relaxed secant method is attained for the nonlinear equation systems with Lipschitz continuous divided differences of first order. The error estimate is also established with matched convergence order. From the radius and error estimate, the relation between the radius and the speed of convergence is discussed with parameter.

The system of coupled Konno-Oono equations is one of those models. We extract some vital solutions for this model, which describe some vital phenomena in applied science.

Solutions to the output regulation problem are given in two situations. On the one hand, the exogenous signal is assumed to be a constant. By designing a sampled-data state feedback controller, we obtain that the closed-loop system is mean-square exponentially stable and the regulation output tends to zero. On the other hand, the exogenous signal is assumed to be time-varying with bounded derivative. By constructing a class of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and a switching rule which satisfies the average dwell time, sufficient conditions for the solvability of practical output regulation problem are given for switched stochastic systems. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.",

To find the traveling speed in a reaction-diffusion system with a global coupling term, the stability of the standing pulse and the relation between traveling speed and bifurcation parameter are examined.

Coupled photon pairs generated in a ladder quantum beat laser using coherent-induced classical field and atomic state coherent superposition are considered. Once the quantum coherence get sufficient time, it can generate quantum correlations that include quantum discord, quantum entanglement, and quantum steering, which quickly increase with time until they get their maximum strength. Their strength can be improved further by increasing the number of superposed atoms per unit time, selecting an appropriate amplitude of the classical fields, and managing the amount of temperatures and phase fluctuations. In particular, two-way quantum steering, which is a guarantee for the existence of quantum discord and quantum entanglement, can be achieved by increasing the rate of atomic injection from 2 kHz to 25 kHz even if the mean temperature of the heat bath is considered. The maximum achievable strength of quantum correlations is enhanced by increasing the rate of atomic injection and choosing an appropriate parameters of the coherent-induced classical field in the open quantum system which is treated by using the density operator approach.",

The main purpose of this article is to extend the DT and GDT to a conformable fractional two-component generalized Hirota (TCGH) equation for revealing novel dynamic characteristics of fractional soliton and semirational solutions. As for the main contributions, specifically, we propose a fractional form of the TCGH equation, provide the associated fractional Lax pair, and obtain fractional soliton and semirational solutions of the fractional TCGH equation by constructing its fractional DT and GDT. In addition, we find that the dominant role of fractional order leads to new dynamic characteristics of the obtained fractional soliton and semirational solutions, mainly including a certain degree of tilt of wave crests and the variations in velocities and wave widths over time during propagation, which are not possessed by the corresponding integer-order TCGH equation. Meanwhile, this study predicts the deceleration propagation of solitons in fractional dimensional media and brings the possibility of exploring the asymmetric regulation mechanism of rogue waves from the perspective of fractional-order dominance.",

The flexoelectric beam that is the main structural unit of the flexoelectric signal output has broad application prospects in the next generation of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems. Therefore, the investigation of flexoelectric materials and structures has important scientific and engineering application significances for the design of flexoelectric devices. In this paper, a model of flexoelectric Timoshenko beam is established, the deflection, rotation angle, and dynamic electrical signal output of the forced vibration are taken as the system response, and the density <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mi>ρ</a:mi> </a:math> , shear correction factor <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <c:mi>κ</c:mi> </c:math> , and frequency ratio <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <e:mi>λ</e:mi> </e:math> are selected as the key performance parameters of the system. The combination of available data and engineers’ experience suggests that there are random and cognitive uncertainties in the parameters. Therefore, the probability distribution of the system performance response is expressed by the likelihood function and belief function through the quantification of margins and uncertainties (QMUs) analysis methodology under the framework of evidence theory, and the system reliability or performance evaluation is measured by the calculated confidence factors. These results provide a theoretical basis for accurate analysis of flexoelectric components and provide guidance for the design of flexoelectric components with excellent performance.",

The objective of this paper is to use the boundary conditions of the penny-shaped interface crack to study the dynamic propagation of the crack under the action of load, so as to provide some valuable implications for the fracture mechanics of the piezoelectric bimaterials and simulate the interface crack between piezoelectric bimaterials, it is necessary to establish a suitable model and give appropriate boundary conditions according to the actual situation. The elastic displacement and potential equations are constructed according to the structural characteristics of the circular crack. In the case of a given displacement or stress, the Laplace transform and Hankel transform are used to simplify the problem into an integral equation with unknown functions. According to the boundary conditions, the corresponding unknowns are obtained, and the closed solution is derived. The results show that the fracture toughness of a penny-shaped interface crack in piezoelectric bimaterials is related to the thickness of the material, the impact time, the material characteristics, and the electric field. At the same time, it can be found that different materials have different roles in the crack propagation, so it is very important to study the crack opening displacement (COD) intensity factor of the crack for safety design.",

Main natural convection impact factors, such as system configuration parameters (tilting angle and PV panel unit number) and fluid thermal–physical properties, are investigated with indoor temperature distribution and streamline comparison by finite-volume method (FVD). Preliminary results show that with rising Rayleigh number (Ra), natural convection is enhanced with growing Nusselt number (Nu). Moreover, panel slope tilting angle (θ) highly determines inside heat transfer subregions in terms of the vertical temperature gradient declines with rising θ, improving the temperature distribution uniformity inside. The solar greenhouse example illustrates that with the increasing numbers of panel group numbers (n), the air temperature gradient differences decrease, improving the temperature distribution uniformity inside, which is preferable to built environment accurate control for greenhouse in the practical engineering.

The boundary-saddle-node (BSN) bifurcation occurs at a critical value when the saddle-node point is located on the discontinuity boundary. We derive a local topological normal form for the BSN bifurcation and study its local dynamics by applying the classical Filippov’s convex method and a novel regularization approach. In fact, by the regularization approach a given Filippov system is approximated by a piecewise-smooth continuous system. Moreover, the regularization process produces a singular perturbation problem where the original discontinuous set becomes a center manifold. Thus, the regularization enables us to make use of the established theories for continuous systems and slow-fast systems to study the local behavior around the BSN bifurcation.",

In addition, we analyze the existence conditions of the local stability of the temperature index model without stochastic term and estimate its parameters by using the same historical data of the four cities, respectively. The numerical simulation results of the four cities are basically consistent with the descriptions of their historical temperature data, which proves that the temperature index model constructed has good fitting degree. It also shows that unreasonable delay parameter can make the model lose stability and improve the complexity. Stochastic factors do not usually change the trend in temperature, but they can cause high frequency fluctuations in the process of temperature evolution. Stability control is successfully realized for unstable systems by the variable feedback control method.

Such moments characterize distribution of fields under prescribed loading of a representative volume element and depend on the geometry features and location of components within a volume. The information of the internal geometrical structure is taken into account by means of multipoint correlation functions. Within the framework of the second approximation of the boundary value problem, the correlation functions up to the fifth order are required to calculate the statistical characteristics. Using the method of Green’s functions, analytical expressions for the moments in distinct phases of the microstructure are obtained explicitly in a form of integral equations.

Some numerical analyses show that the dynamic behavior of these systems is very complex and in fact chaotic in a large range of their parameter. I prove that these Hamiltonian systems are nonintegrable in the sense of Liouville. My proof is based on the analysis of normal variational equations along some particular solutions and the investigation of their differential Galois group.",

Using such models, boundary value problems can be solved to estimate the temperatures over all the length by means of measurements taken only at the boundaries. Conditions for the stability of the estimation error given by the difference between the temperatures and their estimates are established by using a Lyapunov approach. Toward this end, a method to construct nonlinear Lyapunov functionals is addressed by relying on a polynomial diagonal structure. This stability analysis is extended in case of the presence of bounded modeling uncertainty. The theoretical findings are illustrated with numerical results, which show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

It has been observed that for small singular perturbation parameter, the problem under consideration displays sharp interior or boundary layers in the solution which cannot be captured by standard numerical techniques. In the present work, Hughes stabilization strategy along with the streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method has been proposed to capture these boundary layers. Reliable a posteriori error estimates in energy norm on anisotropic meshes have been developed for the proposed scheme. But these estimates prove to be dependent on the singular perturbation parameter. Therefore, to overcome the difficulty of oscillations in the solution, an efficient adaptive mesh refinement algorithm has been proposed. Numerical experiments have been performed to test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

Therefore, the two-dimensional M-L oscillator is directly extended to the three-dimensional case, and it is proved that the three-dimensional M-L oscillator can be reduced to the two-dimensional case.

However, using this class of models for modeling skewed data leads to unreliable results due to the disability of these models for modeling skewness. In this setting, replacing the normality assumption with a more flexible distribution that can accommodate skewness will provide effective results. In this article, we propose a partially linear autoregressive model by considering the skew normal distribution for independent and dependent innovations. A semiparametric approach for estimating the nonlinear part of the regression function is proposed based on the conditional least squares approach and the nonparametric kernel method. Then, the conditional maximum-likelihood approach is used to estimate the unknown parameters through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Some asymptotic properties for the semiparametric method are established. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is verified through simulation studies and analysis of a real dataset.",

    "abstract": "Time or space or time-space fractional-order diffusion equations (FODEs) are widely used to describe anomalous diffusion processes in many physical and biological systems. In recent years, many authors have proposed different numerical methods to solve the modified fractional-order diffusion equations, and some achievements have been obtained. However, to our knowledge of the literature, up to date, all the proposed numerical methods to modify FODE have achieved at most a second-order time accuracy. In this study, we focus mainly on the numerical methods based on numerical integration in order to modify the fractional-order diffusion equation: <a:math

    "abstract": "In this article, two-phase compressible six equation flow model is numerically investigated. The six-equation model consists of velocity, pressure equations, and also relaxation terms. An extra seventh equation is included describing the total energy of the mixture to ensure the correct treatment of the sharp discontinuities. The model is hyperbolic and poses numerous difficulties for numerical schemes. An efficient and well-balanced scheme can handle the numerical difficulties related to this model. The second order space-time CE/SE scheme is extended to solve the model. This scheme offers an effective numerical method for several continuum mechanics problems. The suggested scheme suppresses the numerical oscillations and dissipation effects. Several numerical test cases have been carried out to reveal the efficiency and performance of the proposed approach. The results are compared with the exact solution and also with Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) and central (NT) schemes.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the change of enterprises’ investment following the financing system reform through the established stochastic investment model. In this constructed model, financing property, market-oriented reform, and government intervention are regarded as a stochastic process. Furthermore, the modern China’s economic situation is interpreted to analyze the enterprises’ investment by government intervention plan combined with he deduced proposition from the stochastic investment model. The results provide a depth understanding for characteristics of the enterprise in China that the steady capital of state-owned enterprises’ investment is higher than that of non-state-owned enterprises without government intervention before completing financing reform. Although government intervention can increase the investment level of state-owned enterprises, doing so increases the turbulence of the market economy. Additionally, the impact of government-led financing reform on enterprises’ investment is asymmetrical. Promoting market-oriented, clear-cut financing reform, and reducing government-led investment plans will improve enterprises’ investment efficiency and stabilize China’s economic development. The present paper provides a specific future orientation of China’s financing reform determining the level of enterprises’ investment.",

Then, we modify the two-level continuation scheme for 3D dipolar BECs described in Jeng et al. (2014) to develop a single-parameter continuation method for quasi-2D rotating dipolar BECs, where the chemical potential is treated as the continuation parameter. Further, by adding the ratio of dipolar interaction strength to contact interaction strength as the second continuation parameter, we propose an efficient two-parameter continuation method which can effectively show the change of the ground-state vortex structures as the dipolar interaction strength gradually increases. Moreover, we also study linear stability analysis for the GPE. Sample numerical results on quasi-2D rotating dipolar BECs are reported.",

Different from some existing studies on nonlinear system with sector nonlinear input, this paper studies the synchronization of two complex dynamic networks when the boundary of sector nonlinear input is unknown. The controller does not include the boundary value of the sector nonlinear input and the time delay term, so it is more practical and relatively easy to implement.

NOSs are a combination of neutrosophic, intuitionistic fuzzy, and octahedron sets that provide a better platform for dealing with imprecise and ambiguous data. First of all, we analyze uncertainty, for this purpose, we need neutrosophic octahedron set that can also reduce the loss of information about ambiguity and uncertainty. We use NOS over TOPSIS method (technique to order the performance by similarity with the ideal solution). It is a most suitable technique for describing uncertain data in the TOPSIS method in order to allow more imprecision than the neutrosophic, intuitionistic fuzzy, and octahedron set. Thus, the TOPSIS method of NOSs in decision making is used to overcome the problems that arise during decision-making. We use this proposed structure to implement the selection of the energy source by a numerical example as an application. As a result, this model is valuable for decision-making and can be used to choose the most environmentally friendly energy source. Finally, we present an example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",

The stability of the standing pulse is considered by two different methods, and the applicability of the methods is demonstrated. The chemotaxis influences the Hopf and drift bifurcations and the collision of two traveling pulses. It also enlarges the bifurcation point and enhances the repulsive force between pulses so that the parameter region of the elastic collision becomes large. Although the ordinary differential equation of interfaces can describe the elastic collision, it cannot describe the pair annihilation of pulses caused by the collision. The conditions for the reliable calculation of pulse collision are discussed.",

Recently, China has made a strict policy for third-party payment institutions and warned against issuing any new licenses concerning payment. On the other hand, 39 payment institutions’ licenses have been canceled for various reasons.

    "abstract": "At present, various economic and social problems have become more complex, requiring a multidisciplinary perspective to seek solutions, and thus more complex and innovative talents are needed. Deepening the reform of postgraduate interdisciplinary education, improving the quality of postgraduate interdisciplinary education, and cultivating high-level technical talents with a multidisciplinary background, innovation ability and comprehensive quality have also become the core issues to be solved urgently in postgraduate education. This paper takes the interdisciplinary training mode of postgraduates in finance as the research object and uses interdisciplinary education theory, systems science theory, and higher education theory to explore the components and main characteristics of the postgraduate interdisciplinary training mode. On this basis, this paper investigates the current situation of interdisciplinary training of postgraduates in finance in Chinese universities and then analyzes and discusses the problems existing in the current mode of interdisciplinary cultivation of postgraduates in finance in my country. Finally, based on the above research results, relevant suggestions for improving the interdisciplinary training of postgraduates in finance in my country are put forward. The research results show that postgraduate interdisciplinary training is a new form of talent training that readjusts the source and composition of each training link after introducing the concept of interdisciplinary education. The components of the postgraduate interdisciplinary training model include interdisciplinary support elements and postgraduate training elements. The former provides interdisciplinary external support for postgraduate training, and the latter constitutes the main content of postgraduate interdisciplinary training. The research results can be used to guide the interdisciplinary educational practice of other types of postgraduates and provide certain theoretical and empirical references for cultivating more high-level compound talents urgently needed by society.",

    "abstract": "Compression is a typical stress condition for cracks in deep-water structures, where the cracks tend to close from a nonclosed state, due to a certain gap that exists between the surfaces on both sides of cracks. The stress field models around the crack have been established in previous studies, while the crack surfaces are simply assumed in a nonclosed or full-closed state. In fact, the cracks inside deep-water structures are usually in a semiclosed state, leaving the reliability of calculation results in risk. To reflect the actual state of crack, a comprehensive stress field model around the semiclosed crack is established based on the complex potential theory, and the stress intensity factor <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <a:msub> <a:mrow> <a:mi>K</a:mi> </a:mrow> <a:mrow> <a:mtext>II</a:mtext> </a:mrow> </a:msub> </a:math> at the crack tip related to the closure amount of crack surfaces, deep-water pressure, friction coefficient in the closed region, and crack inclination angle is derived. The analytical solution of the stress field around the semiclosed crack contains three <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <c:mi>T</c:mi> </c:math> -stress components, i.e., <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <e:msub> <e:mrow> <e:mi>T</e:mi> </e:mrow> <e:mrow> <e:mi>x</e:mi> </e:mrow> </e:msub> </e:math> , <g:math xmlns:g=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M5\"> <g:msub> <g:mrow> <g:mi>T</g:mi> </g:mrow> <g:mrow> <g:mi>y</g:mi> </g:mrow> </g:msub> </g:math> , and <i:math xmlns:i=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M6\"> <i:msub> <i:mrow> <i:mi>T</i:mi> </i:mrow> <i:mrow> <i:mi>x</i:mi> <i:mi>y</i:mi> </i:mrow> </i:msub> </i:math> . The rationality and effectiveness of the proposed stress field model are verified by the isochromatic fringe patterns around the crack obtained from the photoelastic experiment.

We first construct a combination of the general exponential function, periodic function, and hyperbolic function in order to derive the general periodic-kink solution for this equation. Then, the more periodic wave solutions are presented with more arbitrary autocephalous parameters, in which the periodic-kink solution localized in all directions in space. Furthermore, the modulation instability is employed to discuss the stability of the available solutions, and the special theorem is also introduced. Moreover, the constraint conditions are also reported which validate the existence of solutions. Furthermore, 2-dimensional graphs are presented for the physical movement of the earned solutions under the appropriate selection of the parameters for stability analysis.

    "abstract": "In this paper, combined with the partial differential equation music signal smoothing model, a new music signal recognition model is proposed. Experimental results show that this model has the advantages of the above two models at the same time, which can remove noise and enhance music signals. This paper also studies the music signal recognition method based on the nonlinear diffusion model. By distinguishing the flat area and the boundary area of the music signal, a new diffusion coefficient equation is obtained by combining these two methods, and the corresponding partial differential equation is discretized by the finite difference method with numerical solution. The application of partial differential equations in music signal processing is a relatively new topic. Because it can accurately model the music signal, it solves many complicated problems in music signal processing. Then, we use the group shift Fourier transform (GSFT) to transform this partial differential equation into a linear homogeneous differential equation system, and then use the series to obtain the solution of the linear homogeneous differential equation system, and finally use the group shift inverse Fourier transform to obtain the noise frequency modulation time-dependent solution of the probability density function of the interference signal. This paper attempts to use the mathematical method of stochastic differentiation to solve the key problem of the time-dependent solution of the probability density function of noise interference signals and to study the application of random differentiation theory in radar interference signal processing and music signal processing. At the end of the thesis, the application of stochastic differentiation in the filtering processing of music signals is tried. According to the inherent self-similarity of the music signal system and the completeness and stability of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm, a new kind of EMD music using stochastic differentiation is proposed for signal filtering algorithm. This improved anisotropic diffusion method can maintain and enhance the boundary while smoothing the music signal. The filtering results of the actual music signal show that the algorithm is effective.",

In this paper, we propose a multitask multiview semisupervised learning model based on partial differential equation random field and Hilbert independent standard probability image genus attribute model, i.e., shared semantics. In the framework of the image-like genus attribute model, data from different data sources are generated by their shared hidden space representation. Different from the traditional model, this paper uses the Hilbert independence criterion to inscribe the shared relationship of hidden expressions. Meanwhile, to exploit the correlations between labels in the label space as well, this paper uses the partial differential equation random field to inscribe the correlations between different kinds of labels in the label space and the correlations between hidden features and labels. Using the variational expectation-maximization algorithm, the whole generative process model can be inferred. To verify the effectiveness of the model, two artificial datasets and three real datasets are tested in this paper, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in the paper. On the one hand, it not only improves the classification accuracy of the multiclassification problem and the multilabel problem; it also outputs the association structure between different kinds of labels and between hidden features and labels.",

    "abstract": "The digitization, analysis, and processing technology of music signals are the core of digital music technology. There is generally a preprocessing process before the music signal processing. The preprocessing process usually includes antialiasing filtering, digitization, preemphasis, windowing, and framing. Songs in the popular wav format and MP3 format on the Internet are all songs that have been processed by digital technology and do not need to be digitalized. Preprocessing can affect the effectiveness and reliability of the feature parameter extraction of music signals. Since the music signal is a kind of voice signal, the processing of the voice is also applicable to the music signal. In the study of adaptive wave equation inversion, the traditional full-wave equation inversion uses the minimum mean square error between real data and simulated data as the objective function. The gradient direction is determined by the cross-correlation of the back propagation residual wave field and the forward simulation wave field with respect to the second derivative of time. When there is a big gap between the initial model and the formal model, the phenomenon of cycle jumping will inevitably appear. In this paper, adaptive wave equation inversion is used. This method adopts the idea of penalty function and introduces the Wiener filter to establish a dual objective function for the phase difference that appears in the inversion. This article discusses the calculation formulas of the accompanying source, gradient, and iteration step length and uses the conjugate gradient method to iteratively reduce the phase difference. In the test function group and the recorded music signal library, a large number of simulation experiments and comparative analysis of the music signal recognition experiment were performed on the extracted features, which verified the time-frequency analysis performance of the wave equation inversion and the improvement of the decomposition algorithm. The features extracted by the wave equation inversion have a higher recognition rate than the features extracted based on the standard decomposition algorithm, which verifies that the wave equation inversion has a better decomposition ability.",

This feature extraction method often relies on the partitioning of the grid and is only effective when the overall similarity of different images is high. The BOF model is borrowed from the method for text retrieval, which generally extracts the local features of an image by the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm and clusters them using <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>k</mi> </math> -means to obtain a low-dimensional visual dictionary and characterizes the image features with a histogram vector based on the visual dictionary. However, when there are many kinds of images, the dimensionality of the visual dictionary will be large and it is not convenient to construct the BOF model. The last fully connected layer is taken as the image feature, and it is dimensionalized by the principal component analysis method, and then, the low-dimensional feature index structure is constructed using the locality-sensitive hashing- (LSH-) based approximate nearest neighbor algorithm. The accuracy of our graph retrieval has increased by 8%. The advantages of feature extraction by a convolutional neural network and the high efficiency of a hash index structure in retrieval are used to solve the shortcomings of traditional methods in terms of accuracy and other aspects in image retrieval. The results show that compared with the above two algorithms, for most of the attractions, the method has a relatively obvious advantage in the accuracy of retrieval, and when there are few similar images of a particular attraction in the attraction image library, the accuracy of the query results is not much different from the first two methods.",

    "abstract": "The noise pollution in tourist street view images is caused by various reasons. A major challenge that researchers have been facing is to find a way to effectively remove noise. Although in the past few decades people have proposed many methods of denoising tourist street scene images, the research on denoising technology of tourist street scene images is still not outdated. There is no doubt that it has become a basic and important research topic in the field of digital image processing. The evolutionary diffusion method based on partial differential equations is helpful to improve the quality of noisy tourist street scene images. This method can process tourist street scene images according to people’s expected diffusion behavior. The adaptive total variation model proposed in this paper is improved on the basis of the total variation model and the Gaussian thermal diffusion model. We analyze the classic variational PDE-based denoising model and get a unified variational PDE energy functional model. We also give a detailed analysis of the diffusion performance of the total variational model and then propose an adaptive total variational diffusion model. By improving the diffusion coefficient and introducing a curvature operator that can distinguish details such as edges, it can effectively denoise the tourist street scene image, and it also has a good effect on avoiding the step effect. Through the improvement of the ROF model, the loyalty term and regular term of the model are parameterized, the adaptive total variation denoising model of this paper is established, and a detailed analysis is carried out. The experimental results show that compared with some traditional denoising models, the model in this paper can effectively suppress the step effect in the denoising process, while protecting the texture details of the edge area of the tourist street scene image. In addition, the model in this paper is superior to traditional denoising models in terms of denoising performance and texture structure protection.",

On the basis of preprocessing the urban planning image, the urban planning image is divided into several equal area subareas; the pixel gray value of each subarea and the average value of pixel distribution density of node landscape image are calculated; and whether the pixel points are at the edge of urban planning image is judged by setting the comprehensive mean threshold. According to the judgment results, the high difference features of urban planning images are intelligently recognized. Simulation results show that the proposed method can realize efficient and accurate recognition of high difference features in urban planning images.",

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction techniques for animated images and animation techniques for faces are important research in computer graphics-related fields. Traditional 3D reconstruction techniques for animated images mainly rely on expensive 3D scanning equipment and a lot of time-consuming postprocessing manually and require the scanned animated subject to remain in a fixed pose for a considerable period. In recent years, the development of large-scale computing power of computer-related hardware, especially distributed computing, has made it possible to come up with a real-time and efficient solution. In this paper, we propose a 3D reconstruction method for multivisual animated images based on Poisson’s equation theory. The calibration theory is used to calibrate the multivisual animated images, obtain the internal and external parameters of the camera calibration module, extract the feature points from the animated images of each viewpoint by using the corner point detection operator, then match and correct the extracted feature points by using the least square median method, and complete the 3D reconstruction of the multivisual animated images. The experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain the 3D reconstruction results of multivisual animation images quickly and accurately and has certain real-time and reliability.",

The classification accuracy of NP-DP-DCNN structure is about 1% higher than that of other methods and 1.77% higher than that of NP-DCNN. Traditional image aesthetic evaluation methods are only effective for specific image sets or specific style images and are not suitable for all types of images. Based on the introduction of the partial differential equation image filtering method, through the parallel supervised learning of aesthetic attribute labels, this paper extracts the global aesthetic depth features, adopts the partial differential equation to evolve the contour C constant, and constructs a convolution neural network. The structure of a convolution kernel learned by using parallel network structure achieves better classification performance. Through the aesthetic evaluation experiment, the overall test accuracy is improved by 0.58% and the average accuracy of the integration of color harmony and composition features is 75.17%, which is higher than that of a single feature. The classification accuracy of NP-DP-DCNN structure is about 1% higher than that of other methods and 1.83% higher than that of NP-DCNN. It has achieved better test accuracy than before in the seven subcategories with discrimination between high aesthetic and low aesthetic images. It has achieved better classification performance than the traditional feature extraction methods in the public dataset CUHK database, and it has excellent aesthetic reference value.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, an in-depth study and analysis of attribute modelling and knowledge acquisition of massive images are conducted using image recognition. For the complexity of association relationships between attributes of incomplete data, a single-output subnetwork modelling method for incomplete data is proposed to build a neural network model with each missing attribute as output alone and other attributes as input in turn, and the network structure can deeply portray the association relationships between each attribute and other attributes. To address the problem of incomplete model inputs due to the presence of missing values, we propose to treat and describe the missing values as system-level variables and realize the alternate update of network parameters and dynamic filling of missing values through iterative learning among subnets. The method can effectively utilize the information of all the present attribute values in incomplete data, and the obtained subnetwork population model is a fit to the attribute association relationships implied by all the present attribute values in incomplete data. The strengths and weaknesses of existing image semantic modelling algorithms are analysed. To reduce the workload of manually labelling data, this paper proposes the use of a streaming learning algorithm to automatically pass image-level semantic labels to pixel regions of an image, where the algorithm does not need to rely on external detectors and a priori knowledge of the dataset. Then, an efficient deep neural network mapping algorithm is designed and implemented for the microprocessing architecture and software programming framework of this edge processor, and a layout scheme is proposed to place the input feature maps outside the kernel DDR and the reordered convolutional kernel matrices inside the kernel storage body and to design corresponding efficient vectorization algorithms for the multidimensional matrix convolution computation, multidimensional pooling computation, local linear normalization, etc., which exist in the deep convolutional neural network model. The efficient vectorized mapping scheme is designed for the multidimensional matrix convolution computation, multidimensional pooling computation, local linear normalization, etc. in the deep convolutional neural network model so that the utilization of MAC components in the core loop can reach 100%.",

    "abstract": "The present study employs the power series method (PSM) to accurately predict the natural frequencies of eleven offshore wind turbines (OWT). This prediction is very important as it helps in the quick verification of experimental or finite element results. This study idealizes the OWT as a stepped Euler-Bernoulli beam carrying a top mass and connected at its bottom to a flexible foundation. The first part of the beam represents a monopile and the transition piece while its second part is a tower. The foundation is modeled using three springs (lateral, rotational, and cross-coupling springs). This work’s aim is at improving therefore the previous researches, in which the whole wind turbine was taken as a single beam, with a tower being tapered and its wall thickness being negligible compared to its diameter. In order to be closer to real-life OWT, three profiles of the tapered tower are explored: case 1 considers a tower with constant thickness along its height. Case 2 assumes a tower’s thickness being negligible compared to its mean diameter, while case 3 describes the tower as a tapered beam with varying thickness along its height. Next, the calculated natural frequencies are compared to those obtained from measurements. Results reveal that case 2, used by previous researches, was only accurate for OWT with tower wall thickness lower than 15 mm. Frequencies produced in case 3 are the most accurate as the relative error is up to 0.01%, especially for the OWT with thicknesses higher or equal to 15 mm. This case appears to be more realistic as, practically, wall thickness of a wind tower varies with its height. The tower-to-pile thickness ratio is an important design parameter as it highly has impact on the natural frequency of OWT, and must therefore be taken into account during the design as well as lateral and rotational coupling springs.",

    "abstract": "Based on the 3D Poisson equation, this paper extracts the features of the digital video human body action sequence. By solving the Poisson equation on the silhouette sequence, the time and space features, time and space structure features, shape features, and orientation features can be obtained. First, we use the silhouette structure features in three-dimensional space-time and the orientation features of the silhouette in three-dimensional space-time to represent the local features of the silhouette sequence and use the 3D Zernike moment feature to represent the overall features of the silhouette sequence. Secondly, we combine the Bayesian classifier and AdaBoost classifier to learn and classify the features of human action sequences, conduct experiments on the Weizmann video database, and conduct multiple experiments using the method of classifying samples and selecting partial combinations for training. Then, using the recognition algorithm of motion capture, after the above process, the three-dimensional model is obtained and matched with the model in the three-dimensional model database, the sequence with the smallest distance is calculated, and the corresponding skeleton is outputted as the results of action capture. During the experiment, the human motion tracking method based on the university matching kernel (EMK) image kernel descriptor was used; that is, the scale invariant operator was used to count the characteristics of multiple training images, and finally, the high-dimensional feature space was mapped into the low-dimensional to obtain the feature space approximating the Gaussian kernel. Based on the above analysis, the main user has prior knowledge of the network environment. The experimental results show that the method in this paper can effectively extract the characteristics of human body movements and has a good classification effect for bending, one-foot jumping, vertical jumping, waving, and other movements. Due to the linear separability of the data in the kernel space, fast linear interpolation regression is performed on the features in the feature space, which significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of the estimation of the human motion pose in the image sequence.",

    "abstract": "Video event detection and annotation work is an important content of video analysis and the basis of video content retrieval. Basketball is one of the most popular types of sports. Event detection and labeling of basketball videos can help viewers quickly locate events of interest and meet retrieval needs. This paper studies the application of anisotropic diffusion in video image smoothing, denoising, and enhancement. An improved form of anisotropic diffusion that can be used for video image enhancement is analyzed. This paper studies the anisotropic diffusion method for coherent speckle noise removal and proposes a video image denoising method that combines anisotropic diffusion and stationary wavelet transform. This paper proposes an anisotropic diffusion method based on visual characteristics, which adds a factor of video image detail while smoothing, and improves the visual effect of diffusion. This article discusses how to apply anisotropic diffusion methods and ideas to video image segmentation. We introduced the classic watershed segmentation algorithm and used forward-backward diffusion to process video images to reduce oversegmentation, introduced the active contour model and its improved GVF Snake, and analyzed the idea of how to use anisotropic diffusion and improve the GVF Snake model to get a new GGVF Snake model. In the study of basketball segmentation of close-up shots, we propose an improved Hough transform method based on a variable direction filter, which can effectively extract the center and radius of the basketball. The algorithm has good robustness to basketball partial occlusion and motion blur. In the basketball segmentation research of the perspective shot, the commonly used object segmentation method based on the change area detection is very sensitive to noise and requires the object not to move too fast. In order to correct the basketball segmentation deviation caused by the video noise and the fast basketball movement, we make corrections based on the peak characteristics of the edge gradient. At the same time, the internal and external energy calculation methods of the traditional active contour model are improved, and the judgment standard of the regional optimal solution and segmentation validity is further established. In the basketball tracking research, an improved block matching method is proposed. On the one hand, in order to overcome the influence of basketball’s own rotation, this article establishes a matching criterion that has nothing to do with the location of the area. On the other hand, this article improves the diamond motion search path based on the basketball’s motion correlation and center offset characteristics to reduce the number of searches and improve the tracking speed.",

    "abstract": "This paper uses the web live broadcast and on-demand platform based on the B/S architecture as the application side and designs a video image forensic system that can meet multiple police types and multiple application scenarios. The system uses mobile phones as the video image capture terminal to solve the problem of rapid response and concealment and uses 5G communication technology as the transmission medium to solve the problem of device mobility and link maintenance. The problem of diversification of the use and application modes of multiple police types is solved; the video image evidence is managed in a centralized storage, audit, and export method, and the security and authenticity of the evidence are solved. While the system realizes a series of functions such as the collection, transmission, storage, and application of video image evidence, it also realizes the application-side video image live broadcast function according to actual work needs and solves the large-scale case command and decision-making problem that has been plagued by public security organs. In order to remove the noise in the public security forensic images and to smooth the noise while retaining the details of the image, this paper proposes a denoising algorithm based on the two-way coupling diffusion equation. By improving the second-order partial differential equation, a new diffusion function with better diffusion effect than the original model is constructed. We combined the adaptive edge threshold and stop criterion to establish a new denoising algorithm model, which can get better denoising results. When the noise level is low, the PSNR value and SSIM value of several denoising methods are relatively ideal, and the result is at a higher level, the denoising picture effect is better, and there is no obvious incomplete noise removal or detail problems. As the noise level increases, the denoising results will gradually decrease, and the effects will also vary to different degrees. When the noise intensity increases, visually, it can be clearly seen that the two-way coupled diffusion equation and DnCNN have better denoising effects. When the noise level is high, the two-way coupled diffusion equation network is used to use the clear image and the denoised image for indistinguishable calculation. The method in this paper almost retains all the texture details in the clear image, and there are almost no artifacts and images. On the other hand, the color of the image after denoising by the method in this paper is more vivid, and it is closer to the target picture in terms of picture definition and tone, the denoising effect is ideal, and the generated image has a higher degree of restoration. Compared with the residual GAN, the two-way coupling diffusion equation network converges faster and the network performance is improved.",

    "abstract": "This paper takes the advantageous ability of Kalman filter equation as a means to jointly realize the accurate and reliable extraction of 3D spatial information and carries out the research work from the extraction of 3D spatial position information from multisource remote sensing optical stereo image pairs, recovery of 3D spatial structure information, and joint extraction of 3D spatial information with optimal topological structure constraints, respectively. Taking advantage of the stronger effect capability of Wiener recovery and shorter computation time of Kalman filter recovery, Wiener recovery is combined with Kalman filter recovery (referred to as Wiener-Kalman filter recovery method), and the mean square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio of the recovered image of this method are comparable to those of Wiener recovery, but the subjective evaluation concludes that the recovered image obtained by the Wiener-Kalman filter recovery method is clearer. To address the problem that the Kalman filter recovery method has the advantage of short computation time but the recovery effect is not as good as the Wiener recovery method, an improved Kalman filter recovery algorithm is proposed, which overcomes the fact that the Kalman filter recovery only targets the rows and columns of the image matrix for noise reduction and cannot utilize the pixel point information among the neighboring rows and columns. The algorithm takes the first row of the matrix image as the initial parameter of the Kalman filter prediction equation and then takes the first row of the recovered image as the initial parameter of the second Kalman filter prediction equation. The algorithm does not need to estimate the degradation function of the degradation system based on the degraded image, and the recovered image presents the image edge detail information more clearly, while the recovery effect is comparable to that of the Wiener recovery and Wiener-Kalman filter recovery method, and the improved Kalman filter recovery method has stronger noise reduction ability compared with the Kalman filter recovery method. The problem that the remote sensing optical images are seriously affected by shadows and complex environment detail information when 3D spatial structure information is extracted and the data extraction feature edge is not precise enough and the structure information extraction is not stable enough is addressed. A global optimal planar segmentation method with graded energy minimization is proposed, which can realize the accurate and stable extraction of the topological structure of the top surface by combining the edge information of remote sensing optical images and ensure the accuracy and stability of the final extracted 3D spatial information.",

    "abstract": "Digital light processing (DLP) can be used to form HAP/ZrO2 mixed ceramic slurry. In the printing technology, the scraper geometry has an important effect on the scraping process; thus, it is necessary to conduct analysis. A modified lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is proposed to conduct the numerical simulations according to the non-Newtonian behavior of the slurry. The Cross behavior of the slurry is viewed as a special external force; then, the traditional LBM including the true external force can be utilized effectively. The triangle, rectangle, trapezium, and rounded rectangle are the main considered section geometries of the scraper. When the flow velocity is set to 0.1 m/s, the results show that the maximum velocity occurs near the bottom surface of the scraper. In four situations, the velocity peak of the triangle case is 0.6270 m/s, which is the maximum, and much larger than the flow velocity of 0.1 m/s. The velocity peak of the rectangle case is 0.0466 m/s, which is the minimum. Although the velocity peak of the rounded rectangle case is 0.0556 m/s, the second velocity peak is 0.0465 m/s; the difference is smaller than that of the rectangle case. In addition, the streamlines figures show that the sharp corner leads to the obvious velocity change. In summary, the rounded rectangle is considered to be more suitable for scraping the HAP/ZrO2 mixed slurry.",
