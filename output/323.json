    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) can provide exposure to nature for those living in isolated confined environments. We evaluated VR-presented natural settings for reducing stress and improving mood.There were 18 participants (9 men, 9 women), ages 32 ± 12 yr, who viewed three 15-min 360° scenes (an indoor control, rural Ireland, and remote beaches). Subjects were mentally stressed with arithmetic before scenes. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability measured psycho-physiological arousal. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the 15-question Modified Reality Judgment and Presence Questionnaire (MRJPQ) measured mood and scene quality.Reductions in EDA from baseline were greater at the end of the natural scenes compared to the control scene (-0.59, -0.52, and 0.32 μS, respectively). The natural scenes reduced negative affect from baseline ( 1.2 and 1.1 points), but the control scene did not ( 0.4 points). MRJPQ scores for the control scene were lower than both natural scenes (4.9, 6.7, and 6.5 points, respectively). Within the two natural scenes, the preferred scene reduced negative affect ( 2.4 points) more than the second choice scene ( 1.8 points) and scored higher on the MRJPQ (6.8 vs. 6.4 points).Natural scene VR provided relaxation both objectively and subjectively, and scene preference had a significant effect on mood and perception of scene quality. VR may enable relaxation for people living in isolated confined environments, particularly when matched to personal preferences.Anderson AP, Mayer MD, Fellows AM, Cowan DR, Hegel MT, Buckey JC.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Stress Management Training programs are increasingly being adopted in the military field for resilience empowerment and primary stress prevention. In the last several years, advanced technologies (virtual reality in particular) have been integrated in order to develop more innovative and effective stress training programs for military personnel, including soldiers, pilots, and other aircrew professionals. This systematic review describes experimental studies that have been conducted in recent years to test the effectiveness of virtual reality-based Stress Management Training programs developed for military personnel. This promising state-of-the-art technology has the potential to be a successful new approach in empowering soldiers and increasing their resilience to stress. METHODS: To provide an overview from 2001 to 2016 of the application of virtual reality for Stress Management Training programs developed for the military, a computer-based search for relevant publications was performed in several databases. Databases used in the search were PsycINFO, Web of Science (Web of Knowledge), PubMed, and Medline. The search string was: (“Virtual Reality”) AND (“Military”) AND [“Stress Training” OR (“Stress Management”)]. RESULTS: There were 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. DISCUSSION: The main observation to be drawn from this review is that virtual reality can provide interactive Stress Management Training to decrease levels of perceived stress and negative affect in military personnel. This technology appears to be a promising tool for assessing individuals’ resilience to stress and for identifying the impact that stress can have on physiological reactivity and performance.Pallavicini F, Argenton L, Toniazzi N, Aceti L, Mantovani F.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sustained high-level cognitive performance is of paramount importance for the success of space missions, which involve environmental, physiological, and psychological stressors that may affect brain functions. Despite subjective symptom reports of cognitive fluctuations in spaceflight, the nature of neurobehavioral functioning in space has not been clarified. METHODS: We developed a computerized cognitive test battery ( Cognition ) that has sensitivity to multiple cognitive domains and was specifically designed for the high-performing astronaut population. Cognition consists of 15 unique forms of 10 neuropsychological tests that cover a range of cognitive domains, including emotion processing, spatial orientation, and risk decision making. Cognition is based on tests known to engage specific brain regions as evidenced by functional neuroimaging. Here we describe the first normative and acute total sleep deprivation data on the Cognition test battery as well as several efforts underway to establish the validity, sensitivity, feasibility, and acceptability of Cognition . RESULTS: Practice effects and test-retest variability differed substantially between the 10 Cognition tests, illustrating the importance of normative data that both reflect practice effects and differences in stimulus set difficulty in the population of interest. After one night without sleep, medium to large effect sizes were observed for 3 of the 10 tests addressing vigilant attention (Cohen’s d = 1.00), cognitive throughput (d = 0.68), and abstract reasoning (d = 0.65). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to providing neuroimaging-based novel information on the effects of spaceflight on a range of cognitive functions, Cognition will facilitate comparing the effects of ground-based analogues to spaceflight, increase consistency across projects, and thus enable meta-analyses.Basner M, Savitt A, Moore TM, Port AM, McGuire S, Ecker AJ, Nasrini J, Mollicone DJ, Mott CM, McCann T, Dinges DF, Gur RC.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Physical training has been conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) for the past 10 yr as a countermeasure to physiological deconditioning during spaceflight. Each member space agency has developed its own approach to creating and implementing physical training protocols for their astronauts. We have divided physical training into three distinct phases (preflight, in-flight, and postflight) and provided a description of each phase with its constraints and limitations. We also discuss how each member agency (NASA, ESA, CSA, and JAXA) prescribed physical training for their crewmembers during the first 10 yr of ISS operations. It is important to understand the operational environment, the agency responsible for the physical training program, and the constraints and limitations associated with spaceflight to accurately design and implement exercise training or interpret the exercise data collected on ISS. As exploration missions move forward, resolving agency differences in physical training programs will become important to maximizing the effectiveness of exercise as a countermeasure and minimizing any mission impacts.Loehr JA, Guilliams ME, Petersen N, Hirsch N, Kawashima S, Ohshima H.

    "abstract": "The coding of space as near and far is not only determined by arm-reaching distance, but is also dependent on how the brain represents the extension of the body space. Recent reports suggest that the dissociation between reaching and navigational space is not limited to perception and action but also involves memory systems. It has been reported that gender differences emerged only in adverse learning conditions that required strong spatial ability.In this study we investigated navigational versus reaching memory in air force pilots and a control group without flight experience. We took into account temporal duration (working memory and long-term memory) and focused on working memory, which is considered critical in the gender differences literature.We found no gender effects or flight hour effects in pilots but observed gender effects in working memory (but not in learning and delayed recall) in the nonpilot population (Women's mean = 5.33; SD= 0.90; Men's mean = 5.54; SD= 0.90). We also observed a difference between pilots and nonpilots in the maintenance of on-line reaching information: pilots (mean = 5.85; SD=0.76) were more efficient than nonpilots (mean = 5.21; SD=0.83) and managed this type of information similarly to that concerning navigational space. In the navigational learning phase they also showed better navigational memory (mean = 137.83; SD=5.81) than nonpilots (mean = 126.96; SD=15.81) and were significantly more proficient than the latter group.There is no gender difference in a population of pilots in terms of navigational abilities, while it emerges in a control group without flight experience. We found also that pilots performed better than nonpilots. This study suggests that once selected, male and female pilots do not differ from each other in visuo-spatial abilities and spatial navigation.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular deconditioning apparently progresses with flight duration, resulting in a greater incidence of orthostatic intolerance following long-duration missions. Therefore, we anticipated that the proportion of astronauts who could not complete an orthostatic tilt test (OTT) would be higher on landing day and the number of days to recover greater after International Space Station (ISS) than after Space Shuttle missions. METHODS: There were 20 ISS and 65 Shuttle astronauts who participated in 10-min 80° head-up tilt tests 10 d before launch, on landing day (R+0), and 3 d after landing (R+3). Fisher’s Exact Test was used to compare the ability of ISS and Shuttle astronauts to complete the OTT. Cox regression was used to identify cardiovascular parameters associated with OTT completion and mixed model analysis was used to compare the change and recovery rates between groups. RESULTS: The proportion of astronauts who completed the OTT on R+0 (2 of 6) was less in ISS than in Shuttle astronauts (52 of 65). On R+3, 13 of 15 and 19 of 19 of the ISS and Shuttle astronauts, respectively, completed the OTT. An index comprised of stroke volume and diastolic blood pressure provided a good prediction of OTT completion and was altered by spaceflight similarly for both astronaut groups, but recovery was slower in ISS than in Shuttle astronauts. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of ISS astronauts who could not complete the OTT on R+0 was greater and the recovery rate slower after ISS compared to Shuttle missions. Thus, mission planners and crew surgeons should anticipate the need to tailor scheduled activities and level of medical support to accommodate protracted recovery after long-duration microgravity exposures.Lee SMC, Feiveson AH, Stein S, Stenger MB, Platts SH.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Postflight postural ataxia reflects both the control strategies adopted for movement in microgravity and the direct effects of deconditioning. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) has been used during the first decade of the International Space Station (ISS) expeditions to quantify the initial postflight decrements and recovery of postural stability. METHODS: The CDP data were obtained on 37 crewmembers as part of their pre- and postflight medical examinations. Sensory organization tests evaluated the ability to make effective use of (or suppress inappropriate) visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information for balance control. This report focuses on eyes closed conditions with either a fixed or sway-referenced base of support, with the head erect or during pitch-head tilts (± 20° at 0.33 Hz). Equilibrium scores were derived from peak-to-peak anterior-posterior sway. Motor-control tests were also used to evaluate a crewmember’s ability to automatically recover from unexpected support-surface perturbations. RESULTS: The standard Romberg condition was the least sensitive. Dynamic head tilts led to increased incidence of falls and revealed significantly longer recovery than head-erect conditions. Improvements in postflight postural performance during the later expeditions may be attributable to higher preflight baselines and/or advanced exercise capabilities aboard the ISS. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic assessment of postural instability is more pronounced during unstable-support conditions requiring active head movements. In addition to supporting return-to-duty decisions by flight surgeons, the CDP provides a standardized sensorimotor measure that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures designed to either minimize deconditioning on orbit or promote reconditioning upon return to Earth.Wood SJ, Paloski WH, Clark JB.

Accident risk factors (e.g., adverse weather, geographical region, post-impact fire, gender differences) will be discussed. The review will also summarize the development and implementation of stringent crashworthiness designs with multi-axis dynamic testing and head-injury protection and its impact on mitigating occupant injury severity. The benefits and drawbacks of new technology and human factor considerations associated with increased general aviation automation will be debated. Data on the safety of the aging general aviation population and increased drug usage will also be described. Finally, areas in which general aviation occupant survival could be improved and injury severity mitigated will be discussed with the view of equipping aircraft with 1) crash-resistant fuel tanks to reduce post-impact conflagration; 2) after-market ballistic parachutes for older aircraft; and 3) current generation electronic locator beacons to hasten site access by first responders.Boyd DD.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seven astronauts after 6-mo missions to the International Space Station showed unexpected vision problems. Lumbar punctures performed in the four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. We hypothesized that lower body negative pressure (LBNP) imposed during head-down tilt (HDT) would reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitude, a noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) surrogate. METHODS: Participating in this study were 25 normal healthy nonsmoking volunteers (mean age: 36 yr). Subjects were positioned supine (5 min), sitting (5 min), 15° whole body HDT (5 min), and 10 min of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests was balanced. Right and left IOP, transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitude, arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute (steady state) of each testing condition. RESULTS: IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 ± 1.4 mmHg (mean ± SD: N = 25), and increased by 0.9 ± 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during HDT significantly lowered IOP to supine levels. In addition, LBNP significantly reduced transcranial ultrasound pulse amplitudes by 38% as compared to the HDT condition ( N = 9). Sitting mean blood pressure (BP) was significantly higher (+5 mmHg) than BP values after 10 min of LBNP during HDT. However, heart rate was not significantly different across all conditions. DISCUSSION: These data suggest that short duration exposures to LBNP attenuate HDT-induced increases in IOP and ICP.Macias BR, Liu JHK, Grande-Gutierrez N, Hargens AR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dynamic visual acuity (DVA) refers to the ability of the eye to discern detail in a moving object and plays an important role whenever rapid physical responses to environmental changes are required, such as while performing tasks onboard a space shuttle. A significant decrease in DVA has previously been noted after astronauts returned from long-duration spaceflight (0.75 eye chart lines, 24 h after returning from space). As part of a NASA-funded, head-mounted multimodal visual assessment system for monitoring vision changes in spaceflight, we elaborate upon the technical development and engineering of dynamic visual acuity assessments with virtual reality (VR) technology as the first step in assessing astronaut performance when undergoing G-transitional effects. We also report results from an early validation study comparing VR DVA assessment with traditional computer based DVA assessment. METHODS: Various VR/AR headsets have been utilized to implement DVA tests. These headsets include HTC Vive Pro Eye system. Epic’s game engine UnrealEngine 4 Version 4.24 was used to build the framework and SteamVR was used to experience virtual reality content. Eye tracking technology was used to maintain fixation of the participant. An early validation study with five participants was conducted comparing this technology versus traditional DVA with a laptop. RESULTS: The head-mounted technology developed for assessing DVA changes during G-transitions is fully functional. The results from the early validation study demonstrated that the two DVA tests (laptop-based and VR) indicated a strong association between both methods (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91). A Bland-Altman plot was employed to assess levels of agreement, with all data points falling within the limits of agreement. DISCUSSION: The results from this early validation study indicate that head-mounted DVA assessment performs similarly to traditional laptop-based methods and is a promising method for assessing DVA during spaceflight, particularly in G-transitions. Future studies are required for further assessment of validation and reliability of this technology. With its ease of use, accessibility, and portable design, VR DVA has the potential in the near-future to replace conventional methods of assessing DVA. The technology will likely be an important aspect to help monitor functionality and safety during interplanetary missions where astronauts are exposed to G-transitions.

Isokinetic testing of the knee, ankle, and trunk quantifies movement-specific strength changes following spaceflight and offers insight into the effectiveness of in-flight exercise countermeasures.We retrospectively evaluated changes in isokinetic strength for 37 ISS crewmembers (Expeditions 1-25) following 163 ± 38 d (mean ± SD) of spaceflight. Gender, in-flight resistance exercise hardware, and preflight strength were examined as potential modifiers of spaceflight-induced strength changes.Mean isokinetic strength declined 8-17% following spaceflight. One month after return to Earth, strength had improved, but small deficits of 1-9% persisted. Spaceflight-induced strength losses were not different between men and women. Mean strength losses were as much as 7% less in crewmembers who flew after the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) replaced the interim Resistive Exercise Device (iRED) as the primary in-flight resistance exercise hardware, although these differences were not statistically significant. Absolute and relative preflight strength were moderately correlated (r = -0.47 and -0.54, respectively) with postflight strength changes.In-flight resistance exercise did not prevent decreased isokinetic strength after long-duration spaceflight. However, continued utilization of ARED, a more robust resistance exercise device providing higher loads than iRED, may result in greater benefits as exercise prescriptions are optimized. With reconditioning upon return to Earth, strength is largely recovered within 30 d.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cognitive performance is crucial during military operations. It is suggested that impaired cognitive performance accounts for most of the accidents during training courses and actual battle. There is a need to define when soldiers’ operational readiness becomes impaired. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of sustained military operations (SUSOPS) on vigilance, reaction time, working memory, and reasoning in order to select good indicators for performance impairment. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed using publicly accessible databases (IngentaConnect, PubMed, Science Direct, and Defense Technical Information Center online) that were screened until July 2015. Keywords were military, sustained operations, (cognitive) performance, soldier, and training. RESULTS: Only 7 out of 589 studies met the inclusion criteria. Selected studies were difficult to compare due to different methodologies, cognitive tasks, and military courses. Vigilance, reaction time, and working memory were affected after only a few hours, showing severe impairment. They are linearly related to military stress up to 80 h of SUSOPS. These three indicators needed little recovery time to return to baseline levels. After more than 80 h of SUSOPS, no significant impairments of those indicators were observed. Reasoning becomes impaired after high stress levels of relatively short duration and can remain affected after more than 80 h of SUSOPS. DISCUSSION: Vigilance, reaction time, and working memory are affected after only a few hours while little recovery time is needed. For reasoning to return to baseline values, longer recovery is needed than the time available during SUSOPS.Vrijkotte S, Roelands B, Meeusen R, Pattyn N.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This is a systematic review of suicide and homicide-suicide events involving aircraft. In aeromedical literature and in the media, these very different events are both described as pilot suicide, but in psychiatry they are considered separate events with distinct risk factors. METHODS: Medical databases, internet search engines, and aviation safety databases were searched in a systematic way to obtain relevant cases. Relevant articles were searched for additional references. RESULTS: There were 65 cases of pilot suicide and 6 cases of passengers who jumped from aircraft found. There were also 18 cases of homicide-suicide found involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to non-aviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%). DISCUSSION: Homicide-suicide events occur extremely rarely. However, their impact in terms of the proportion of deaths is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after by media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides.Kenedi C, Friedman SH, Watson D, Preitner C. Suicide and murder-suicide involving aircraft .

    "abstract": "More than half of astronauts develop ophthalmic changes during long-duration spaceflight consistent with an abnormal intraocular and intracranial pressure (IOP, ICP) difference. The aim of our study was to assess IOP and ICP during head-down tilt (HDT) and the additive or attenuating effects of 1% CO2 and lower body negative pressure (LBNP).In Experiment I, IOP and ICP were measured in nine healthy subjects after 3.5 h HDT in five conditions: -6°, -12°, and -18° HDT, -12° with 1% CO2, and -12° with -20 mmHg LBNP. In Experiment II, IOP was measured in 16 healthy subjects after 5 min tilt at +12°, 0°, -6°, -12°, -18°, and -24°, with and without -40 mmHg LBNP.ICP was only found to increase from supine baseline during -18° HDT (9.2 ± 0.9 and 14.4 ± 1 mmHg, respectively), whereas IOP increased from 15.7 ± 0.3 mmHg at 0° to 17.9 ± 0.4 mmHg during -12° HDT and from 15.3 ± 0.4 mmHg at 0° to 18.7 ± 0.4 mmHg during -18° HDT. The addition of -20 mmHg LBNP or 1% CO2 had no further effects on ICP or IOP. However, the use of -40 mmHg LBNP during HDT lowered IOP back to baseline values, except at -24° HDT.A small, posterior intraocular-intracranial pressure difference (IOP > ICP) is maintained during HDT, and a sustained or further decreased difference may lead to structural changes in the eye in real and simulated microgravity.Marshall-Goebel K, Mulder E, Bershad E, Laing C, Eklund A, Malm J, Stern C, Rittweger J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Future deep space missions will expose astronauts to more intense stressors than previously encountered. Isolation will be greater and more prolonged, living and work areas more confined, and communications and resupply channels to Earth longer and less reliable. Astronauts will need to function more autonomously, with less guidance and support from Earth. Thus, it is important to select and train astronauts who can adapt and function effectively under extreme and variable conditions. In order to identify factors linked to individual adaptability, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on cognitive and behavioral adaptation to isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environments. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsychINFO databases for studies addressing individual adaptability to ICE environments. Studies were rated for quality and fidelity to long-duration space missions and key results extracted. RESULTS: There were 73 studies that met all inclusion criteria. Adaptability attributes for ICE environments include intelligence, emotional stability, self-control, openness, achievement facets of conscientiousness, optimism, mastery, introversion, hardiness, task-oriented coping, past experience, low need for social support, and adequate sleep . DISCUSSION: This review identifies individual factors linked to adaptability under ICE conditions. Further studies are needed to verify causal directions and determine the relative importance of these factors. Bartone PT, Krueger GP, Bartone JV.

Research conducted in Russia on the orbital stations Salyut and Mir, as well as simulation experiments on the ground, have demonstrated that changes that occur during extended spaceflight in various physiologic systems can be prevented or significantly decreased by using countermeasures. Hardware and techniques used on the ISS have been substantially improved to reflect the experience of previous extended missions on Russian orbital stations. Countermeasures used during early ISS missions consisted of the U.S. treadmill (TVIS), cycle ergometer (ВБ-3), a set of resistance bands, a postural muscle loading suit (Penguin-3), electrical stimulator (Tonus-3), compression thigh cuffs (Braslet-М), a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) suit (Chibis), a lower body g-loading suit (Kentavr), and water/salt supplements.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the last 35 yr, 17 commercial aviation accidents and incidents, with 576 fatalities, could likely have been attributed to mental disease of a pilot. Screening tools for mental health risks in airline pilots are needed. There is growing interest in pilot peer-support programs and how to incorporate them in a just culture, meaning that pilots can report mental health complaints without a risk of job or income loss. We combined findings from aviation accidents and incidents with a search of scientific literature to provide data-based recommendations for screening, peer-support, and a just culture approach to mental health problems. METHODS: Commercial aviation accidents and incidents in which a mental disorder of a pilot was thought to play a role were reviewed. Subsequently, PubMed and PsychInfo literature searches were performed on peer-support programs, just culture human resource management, and the risk of negative life events on developing suicidal ideation and behavior in comparable professional groups. RESULTS: Lethal accidents were mostly related to impaired coping with negative life events. Negative life events are clearly related to suicidal thoughts, attempts, and completed suicide. A protective effect of peer-support programs on mental health problems has not been established, although peer-support programs are generally appreciated by those involved. We did not find relevant literature on just culture. DISCUSSION: Negative life events are likely a useful screening tool for mental health risks. There is still a lack of evidence on how peer-support groups should be designed and how management of mental health risks can be implemented in a just culture.Mulder S, de Rooy D.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of acute mild hypoxic hypoxia (HH) and physical activity on physiological measures, signs and symptoms, mood, fatigue, cognition, and performance on a simulated flight task were investigated between 8000 (8K; 2438 m) and 14,000 ft (14K; 4267 m). METHOD: In a hypobaric chamber, 16 military helicopter pilots were randomly exposed to 4 altitudes and 3 physical exertion levels. After each exercise period, participants identified targets on a designated flight path on a desktop simulator and completed a cognitive test battery. Cerebral regional and finger pulse oxyhemoglobin saturation levels (rSO 2 and S p o 2 ), heart and respiration rates were continuously monitored. Participants indicated their symptoms, mood and fatigue. RESULTS: rSO 2 and S p o 2 were affected by the increase of altitude and exercise level. Target identification accuracy and latency within the simulated flight task showed decrements at 8K, 10K (3048 m), 12K (3658 m), and 14K. Cognitive performance was degraded at 14K. More than 60% of the participants at 8K and 10K and more than 80% at 12K and 14K reported symptoms. Altitude increased symptoms, negative mood, general fatigue, and physical fatigue. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate a significant influence of mild HH on a number of outcome measures at altitudes above 10K, where operational restrictions are well established. In contrast, there was no clear influence of HH on performance at lower altitudes (i.e., 8K and 10K). The occurrence of HH symptoms and the decrements in target identification latency and accuracy at 8K and 10K may negatively impact flight performance and require further study.

Echographic video was recorded using a volume capture method directed by a trained sonographer on the ground through videoconferencing. Vessel properties were later assessed by processing the downlinked video. Data were collected from 10 astronauts who performed the echographic video capture at the beginning of the spaceflight (day 15) and near the end of the spaceflight (day 115 to 165). In-flight and postflight measurements were compared to preflight assessments.No significant changes with spaceflight were found for CC and FA diameter. Intima-media thickness (IMT) of the CC was found to be significantly increased (12% ± 4) in all astronauts during the spaceflight (early and late flight) and remained elevated 4 d after returning to Earth. Similarly, FA IMT was increased during the flight but returned to preflight levels 4 d postflight.The experiment demonstrated that, using the volume capture method of echography, untrained astronauts were able to capture enough echographic data to display vessel images of good quality for analysis. The increase in both CC and FA IMT during the flight suggest an adaptation to microgravity and to the confined environment of spaceflight which deserves further investigation.",

METHODS: To further the understanding of this risk and the nature of its molecular mechanism, a review was conducted on the literature from various fields. RESULTS: Numerous physiological changes are produced by increased partial pressures of oxygen (Po 2 ), which may ultimately result in CNS O 2 toxicity. The human body has several equilibrated safeguards that minimize effects of reactive species on neural networks, believed to play a primary role in CNS O 2 toxicity. Increased partial pressure of oxygen (Po 2 ) appears to saturate protective enzymes and unfavorably shift protective reactions in the direction of neural network overstimulation. Certain regions of the CNS appear more susceptible than others to these effects. Failure to decrease the elevated Po 2 can result in a tonic-clonic seizure and death. Randomized, controlled studies in human populations would require a multicenter trial over a long period of time with numerous endpoints used to identify O 2 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The mounting scientific evidence and apparent increase in the number of hyperbaric O 2 treatments demonstrate a need for further study in the near future.Manning EP.

Among subjects who stated that they were motion sick, the severity of symptoms did not differ between women and men.

The battery was designed to assess multiple domains of neurocognitive functions linked to specific brain systems. Tests included in Cognition have been validated, but not in high-performing samples comparable to astronauts, which is an essential step toward ensuring their usefulness in long-duration space missions.We administered Cognition (on laptop and iPad) and the WinSCAT, counterbalanced for order and version, in a sample of 96 subjects (50% women; ages 25-56 yr) with at least a Master's degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). We assessed the associations of age, sex, and administration device with neurocognitive performance, and compared the scores on the Cognition battery with those of WinSCAT. Confirmatory factor analysis compared the structure of the iPad and laptop administration methods using Wald tests.Age was associated with longer response times (mean β = 0.12) and less accurate (mean β = -0.12) performance, women had longer response times on psychomotor (β = 0.62), emotion recognition (β = 0.30), and visuo-spatial (β = 0.48) tasks, men outperformed women on matrix reasoning (β = -0.34), and performance on an iPad was generally faster (mean β = -0.55).

    "abstract": "The hardware systems necessary to support exercise countermeasures to the deconditioning associated with microgravity exposure have evolved and improved significantly during the first decade of the International Space Station (ISS), resulting in both new types of hardware and enhanced performance capabilities for initial hardware items. The original suite of countermeasure hardware supported the first crews to arrive on the ISS and the improved countermeasure system delivered in later missions continues to serve the astronauts today with increased efficacy. Due to aggressive hardware development schedules and constrained budgets, the initial approach was to identify existing spaceflight-certified exercise countermeasure equipment, when available, and modify it for use on the ISS. Program management encouraged the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, or hardware previously developed (heritage hardware) for the Space Shuttle Program. However, in many cases the resultant hardware did not meet the additional requirements necessary to support crew health maintenance during long-duration missions (3 to 12 mo) and anticipated future utilization activities in support of biomedical research. Hardware development was further complicated by performance requirements that were not fully defined at the outset and tended to evolve over the course of design and fabrication. Modifications, ranging from simple to extensive, were necessary to meet these evolving requirements in each case where heritage hardware was proposed. Heritage hardware was anticipated to be inherently reliable without the need for extensive ground testing, due to its prior positive history during operational spaceflight utilization. As a result, developmental budgets were typically insufficient and schedules were too constrained to permit long-term evaluation of dedicated ground-test units (\"fleet leader\" type testing) to identify reliability issues when applied to long-duration use. In most cases, the exercise unit with the most operational history was the unit installed on the ISS.Korth DW. Exercise countermeasure hardware evolution on ISS: the first decade .

Controlled breathing has been shown to maximize parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) tone and may have the ability to decrease motion sickness symptoms. METHODS: The effects of slow diaphragmatic breathing (DB) in a motion sickness-inducing environment were examined within motion sickness susceptible individuals. Subjects ( N = 43) were assigned randomly to either an experimental group trained in slow DB or a control group breathing naturally at a normal pace. The experimental group was trained using a digital video that helped them pace their diaphragmatic breathing at six breaths/min. During the study, subjects viewed a virtual reality (VR) experience of a boat in rough seas for 10 min. Motion sickness ratings along with heart rate and respiration rate were collected before, during, and after the VR experience. RESULTS: Results indicated that the experimental group was able to decrease their breathing to eight breaths/min during the VR experience. This breathing rate was significantly slower than those in the control group. We found that DB subjects, compared to those in the control group, displayed significantly greater heart rate variability and reported feeling less motion sickness during exposure to the VR experience than those in the control group.

This provokes cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, and autonomic nervous system responses. The resulting altered functional state can result in orthostatic hypotension and intolerance upon landing and return to a gravity environment. In-flight lower body negative pressure (LBNP) transiently restores normal body fluid distribution. Early in the U.S. space program, LBNP was devised as a way to test for orthostatic intolerance. With the development of the Skylab Program and longer duration spaceflight, it was realized that it could provide a method of monitoring orthostatic intolerance in flight and predicting the post-landing orthostatic response. LBNP was also investigated not only as an in-flight cardiovascular orthostatic stress test, but also as a countermeasure to cardiovascular deconditioning on Soviet space stations, Skylab, and the Shuttle. It is still being used by the Russian program on the International Space Station as an end-of-flight countermeasure.Campbell MR, Charles JB.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this research was to evaluate neuroendocrine and physical performance responses in sailors and Marines undergoing U.S. Navy Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) training. METHODS: Participants were 20 men (Age: 25.3 ± 3.6 yr; Height: 178.1 ± 6.1 cm; Weight: 83.7 ± 12.6 kg). Men were further split into high fit ( N = 10) and low fit ( N = 10) subgroups based on physical fitness test scores. Blood samples were obtained at baseline (T1), stress (T2), and recovery (T3) timepoints, and were analyzed for plasma epinephrine, plasma norepinephrine, plasma dopamine, serum cortisol, serum testosterone, and plasma neuropeptide Y. Vertical jump and handgrip tests were performed at T1 and T2. RESULTS: Stress hormone concentrations were significantly elevated at T2, with a concomitant reduction in testosterone concentrations. NPY concentrations did not increase at T2, but decreased significantly at T3. Subjects maintained performance on vertical jump and handgrip tests from T1 to T2. Significant between group differences were observed in norepinephrine (high fit: 3530.64 ± 2146.54 pmol · L −1 , low fit: 4907.16 ± 3020.85 pmol · L −1 ) and NPY (high fit: 169.30 ± 85.89 pg · ml −1 , low fit: 123.02 ± 88.86 pg · ml −1 ) concentrations at T3. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that despite significant increases in stress hormone concentrations in all subjects during SERE, fitter subjects exhibited differential hormonal responses during recovery, with quicker return of norepinephrine and NPY to baseline concentrations. This suggests physical fitness level may have a protective effect in recovery from periods of high stress military training.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Submarines routinely operate with higher levels of ambient carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) (i.e., 2000 – 5000 ppm) than what is typically considered normal (i.e., 400 – 600 ppm). Although significant cognitive impairments are rarely reported at these elevated CO 2 levels, recent studies using the Strategic Management Simulation (SMS) test have found impairments in decision-making performance during acute CO 2 exposure at levels as low as 1000 ppm. This is a potential concern for submarine operations, as personnel regularly make mission-critical decisions that affect the safety and efficiency of the vessel and its crew while exposed to similar levels of CO 2 . The objective of this study was to determine if submariner decision-making performance is impacted by acute exposure to levels of CO 2 routinely present in the submarine atmosphere during sea patrols. METHODS: Using a subject-blinded balanced design, 36 submarine-qualified sailors were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 CO 2 exposure conditions (600, 2500, or 15,000 ppm). After a 45-min atmospheric acclimation period, participants completed an 80-min computer-administered SMS test as a measure of decision making. RESULTS: There were no significant differences for any of the nine SMS measures of decision making between the CO 2 exposure conditions. DISCUSSION: In contrast to recent research demonstrating cognitive deficits on the SMS test in students and professional-grade office workers, we were unable to replicate this effect in a submariner population—even with acute CO 2 exposures more than an order of magnitude greater than those used in previous studies that demonstrated such effects.

    "abstract": "Sleep and fatigue management is one of the main challenges in airline operations scheduling. Our aim was to compare the differences regarding fatigue, sleep, and labor specificities between the two most common types of flight, short/medium haul (SM-H) and long haul (L-H), in a large sample of airline pilots.A self-report questionnaire was developed, composed of socio-economic and labor questions, and psychological assessment scales for fatigue and sleep. Associations of these variables and type of flight were tested.Of the total sample of Portuguese airline pilots (N = 435), 313 (72%) were from SM-H and 122 (28%) were from L-H. For SM-H, the values obtained for sleep complaints were 34.2%, daytime sleepiness 61.6%, and fatigue 93.0%. For L-H, 36.9%, 53.3%, and 84.4%, respectively. Looking at labor variables, the differences between the two types of flights were evident, with SM-H pilots' having statistically significant higher mean values of duty and flight hours, numbers of sectors, and early mornings. Only the mean number of night periods was higher in L-H pilots. All values were reported for 28 consecutive scheduling days.Night periods and time-zone crossing may explain higher prevalence levels of sleep disturbances in L-H pilots. However, the values for daytime sleepiness were higher in SM-H pilots, which may be attributed to diminished sleep caused by a combination of frequent early starts and long duty periods. Taking into account the large differences between the two types of flights, different regulatory limits should be considered by aviation authorities. Reis C, Mestre C, Canhão H, Gradwell D, Paiva T.

In addition, we examined how exercise affects functional performance after long-term axial body unloading during 70 d of bed rest at 6° head-down tilt. METHODS: Data were collected twice during the 2-mo period before spaceflight or during the 2-wk period before bed rest, and four times after flight or bed rest: on the day of landing or the day bed rest ended, 1 d and 6 d later, and a final session 12 d after bed rest or 30 d after spaceflight. RESULTS: For bed rest subjects, long-term axial unloading alone caused functional performance deficits immediately after bed rest. However, the addition of an exercise regimen did not significantly improve median functional performance immediately after this axial unloading. For spaceflight subjects, the length of the space mission was directly related to the severity of functional performance deficits within 1 d of landing and during the subsequent recovery period after flight. DISCUSSION: The performance data suggest that an additional sensorimotor-based countermeasure may be necessary to maintain functional performance at preflight levels immediately after spaceflight.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Compression garments tend to be difficult to don/doff, due to their intentional function of squeezing the wearer. This is especially true for compression garments used for space medicine and for extravehicular activity (EVA). We present an innovative solution to this problem by integrating shape changing materials—NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) coil actuators formed into modular, 3D-printed cartridges—into compression garments to produce garments capable of constricting on command. METHODS: A parameterized, 2-spring analytic counterpressure model based on 12 garment and material inputs was developed to inform garment design. A methodology was developed for producing novel SMA cartridge systems to enable active compression garment construction. Five active compression sleeve prototypes were manufactured and tested: each sleeve was placed on a rigid cylindrical object and counterpressure was measured as a function of spatial location and time before, during, and after the application of a step voltage input. RESULTS: Controllable active counterpressures were measured up to 34.3 kPa, exceeding the requirement for EVA life support (29.6 kPa). Prototypes which incorporated fabrics with linear properties closely matched analytic model predictions (4.1%/−10.5% error in passive/active pressure predictions); prototypes using nonlinear fabrics did not match model predictions (errors &gt;100%). Pressure non-uniformities were observed due to friction and the rigid SMA cartridge structure. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of controllable compression technology incorporating active materials, a novel contribution to the field of compression garment design. This technology could lead to easy-to-don compression garments with widespread space and terrestrial applications.Holschuh BT, Newman DJ.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological studies suggest that pilots and cabin crew have higher incidences and mortality rates of cutaneous malignant melanoma than those of the general population. Exposure to UV radiation is one of the main risk factors for this type of cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of UV radiation in an airliner in flight. METHODS: Measurements were taken with a three sensor-integrated electronics UV radiometer (A, B, and C) during 14 flights from July to October 2016. They were performed during daylight hours once the airliner had reached cruising altitude. RESULTS: We failed to find UVC radiation. The measurements detected neither UV A nor B in any parts of the cabins of the planes tested, nor in the Airbus cockpits. UVA radiation was however found in the cockpit of Boeing 777s. But UVA levels remained well below the values found at ground level and they were also strongly reduced (more than 10 times) by cockpit sun visors. DISCUSSION: Few studies have assessed the level of UV radiation in an airplane. They suggested that the cockpit windshields reduced this type of radiation to some degree (according mainly to the wavelength of the radiation and the nature of the windshield). Our study strongly confirms these results and suggests that increased incidence of melanoma and mortality by this type of illness found among pilots and airline cabin crews may not be related to in-flight UV radiation exposure.Cadilhac P, Bouton M-C, Cantegril M, Cardines C, Gisquet A, Kaufman N, Klerlein M.

    "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of low back pain (LBP) for astronauts in space (68%) is higher than the 1-mo prevalence for the general population on Earth (39%). It is unclear whether differences occur between healthy subjects and astronauts with a history of LBP. Knowledge of this issue is important to assess whether a history of LBP could have an operational impact. Methods: We evaluated LBP prospectively during short duration spaceflight (15 d; N = 20) and compared this with similar data collected during two bed rest studies ( N = 40). Astronauts completed a questionnaire 5–10 d preflight, during each flight day, and 5–10 d postflight. Results: All astronauts with a history of LBP also developed LBP in flight. These astronauts reported a significantly longer duration of LBP and a different pain location. LBP was most often experienced in the central area of the lower back during spaceflight with an incidence of 70% and a mean pain level of 3 (on a scale of 0–10). Pain resolved within 10 d of flight. No neurological signs were present. The most frequently reported countermeasure was assuming a “knees to chest (fetal tuck) position” combined with stretching. Greater LBP intensity was reported in spaceflight than bed rest with a trend indicating a greater number of days of pain during spaceflight. Discussion: The current study represents a prospective study of LBP in spaceflight. The results indicate that LBP is self-limiting in spaceflight and should not pose an operational risk. Prior LBP on Earth appears to be a risk factor for LBP in spaceflight.Pool-Goudzwaard AL, Belavý DL, Hides JA, Richardson CA, Snijders CJ. Low back pain in microgravity and bed rest studies.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many in-flight hypoxia-like incidents involve exposure to normobaric hypoxia following an oxygen delivery equipment failure. Studies have documented the effect of hypoxia on specific aspects of human performance. The goal of the present study was to establish the effects of acute hypoxia on cognitive, psychomotor, and perceptual abilities and to chronicle the time required for these capabilities to fully recover to pre-exposure levels. METHODS: Subjects were presented with a battery of tests designed to assess visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, color vision, executive control, and reaction time (simple reaction time, SRT, and choice reaction time, CRT) before, during, immediately following, 60 min, 120 min, and 24 h after hypoxic exposure. Oxygen saturation was continuously measured throughout the duration of the study using near-infrared spectroscopy measured on the forehead and finger pulse oximetry. RESULTS: During the course of six assessment periods, contrast sensitivity, color vision, and subjective workload were affected to varying degrees during hypoxic exposure, but returned to baseline levels soon after a return to normoxia. Conversely, reaction time values and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (M rSO 2 ), while also affected during hypoxic exposure (MSRT = 362.17 ms, M CRT = 389.55 ms, M rSO 2 = 79.36%), did not return to baseline levels (M SRT = 337.35 ms, M CRT = 372.75 ms, M rSO 2 = 99.75%) until the assessment period 24 h following exposure (M SRT = 324.35 ms, M CRT = 366.22 ms, M rSO 2 = 99.10%). DISCUSSION: Evidence from this study suggests an impairment of specific performance characteristics following hypoxic exposure – some for a considerable period of time. Mitigation efforts should focus more on the prevention of hypoxia exposure rather than relying exclusively on training operators to recognize and react earlier to hypoxic symptomology.Phillips JB, Hørning D, Funke ME.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the space environment, the traditional radioprotective principles of time, distance, and shielding become difficult to implement. Additionally, the complex radiation environment inherent in space, the chronic exposure timeframe, and the presence of numerous confounding variables complicate the process of creating appropriate risk models for astronaut exposure. Pharmaceutical options hold tremendous promise to attenuate acute and late effects of radiation exposure in the astronaut population. Pharmaceuticals currently approved for other indications may also offer radiation protection, modulation, or mitigation properties along with a well-established safety profile. Currently there are only three agents which have been clinically approved to be employed for radiation exposure, and these only for very narrow indications. This review identifies a number of agents currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which could warrant further investigation for use in astronauts. Specifically, we examine preclinical and clinical evidence for statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), metformin, calcium channel blockers, β adrenergic receptor blockers, fingolimod, N-acetylcysteine, and pentoxifylline as potential radiation countermeasures.McLaughlin MF, Donoviel DB, Jones JA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although once a widely speculated about and largely theoretical topic, spaceflight-induced intracranial hypertension has gained acceptance as a distinct clinical phenomenon, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. In the past, many terms were used to describe the symptoms of malaise, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo, though longer duration spaceflights have increased the prevalence of overlapping symptoms of headache and visual disturbance. Spaceflight-induced visual pathology is thought to be a manifestation of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) because of its similar presentation to cases of known intracranial hypertension on Earth as well as the documentation of increased ICP by lumbar puncture in symptomatic astronauts upon return to gravity. The most likely mechanisms of spaceflight-induced increased ICP include a cephalad shift of body fluids, venous outflow obstruction, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and disruption to CSF flow. The relative contribution of increased ICP to the symptoms experienced during spaceflight is currently unknown, though other factors recently posited to contribute include local effects on ocular structures, individual differences in metabolism, and the vasodilator effects of carbon dioxide. This review article attempts to consolidate the literature regarding spaceflight-induced intracranial hypertension and distinguish it from other pathologies with similar symptomatology. It discusses the proposed physiological causes and the pathological manifestations of increased ICP in the spaceflight environment and provides considerations for future long-term space travel. In the future, it will be critical to develop countermeasures so that astronauts can participate at their peak potential and return safely to Earth.Michael AP, Marshall-Bowman K.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The current research was to investigate pilots’ visual scan patterns in order to assess attention distribution during air-to-air maneuvers. METHODS: A total of 30 qualified mission-ready fighter pilots participated in this research. Eye movement data were collected by a portable head-mounted eye-tracking device, combined with a jet fighter simulator. To complete the task, pilots had to search for, pursue, and lock on a moving target while performing air-to-air tasks. RESULTS: There were significant differences in pilots’ saccade duration (ms) in three operating phases, including searching (M = 241, SD = 332), pursuing (M = 311, SD = 392), and lock-on (M = 191, SD = 226). Also, there were significant differences in pilots’ pupil sizes (pixel 2 ), of which the lock-on phase was the largest (M = 27,237, SD = 6457), followed by pursuit (M = 26,232, SD = 6070), then searching (M = 25,858, SD = 6137). Furthermore, there were significant differences between expert and novice pilots in the percentage of fixation on the head-up display (HUD), time spent looking outside the cockpit, and the performance of situational awareness (SA). DISCUSSION: Experienced pilots have better SA performance and paid more attention to the HUD, but focused less outside the cockpit when compared with novice pilots. Furthermore, pilots with better SA performance exhibited a smaller pupil size during the operational phase of lock on while pursuing a dynamic target. Understanding pilots’ visual scan patterns and attention distribution are beneficial to the design of interface displays in the cockpit and in developing human factors training syllabi to improve the safety of flight operations.Yu C-S, Wang EM, Li W-C, Braithwaite G, Greaves M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persistent headward fluid shift and mechanical unloading cause neuro-ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal deconditioning during long-term spaceflight. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) reintroduces footward fluid shift and mechanical loading. METHODS: We designed, built, and tested a wearable, mobile, and flexible LBNP device (GravitySuit) consisting of pressurized trousers with built-in shoes to support ground reaction forces (GRF) and a thoracic vest to distribute load to the entire axial length of the body. In eight healthy subjects we recorded GRF under the feet and over the shoulders (Tekscan) while assessing cardiovascular response (Nexfin) and footward fluid shift from internal jugular venous cross-sectional area (IJVa) using ultrasound (Terason). RESULTS: Relative to normal bodyweight (BW) when standing upright, increments of 10 mmHg LBNP from 0 to 40 mmHg while supine induced axial loading corresponding to 0%, 13 ± 3%, 41 ± 5%, 75 ± 11%, and 125 ± 22% BW, respectively. Furthermore, LBNP reduced IJVa from 1.12 ± 0.3 cm 2 to 0.67 ± 0.2, 0.50 ± 0.1, 0.35 ± 0.1, and 0.31 ± 0.1 cm 2 , respectively. LBNP of 30 and 40 mmHg reduced cardiac stroke volume and increased heart rate while cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were unaffected. During 2 h of supine rest at 20 mmHg LBNP, temperature and humidity inside the suit were unchanged (23 ± 1°C; 47 ± 3%, respectively). DISCUSSION: The flexible GravitySuit at 20 mmHg LBNP comfortably induced mechanical loading and desired fluid displacement while maintaining the mobility of hips and knee joints. The GravitySuit may provide a feasible method to apply low-level, long-term LBNP without interfering with daily activity during spaceflight to provide an integrative countermeasure.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Integrated Medical Model (IMM) is a quantified, evidence-based decision support tool developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to assist in the assessment of the medical risk of human spaceflight missions. The IMM utilizes a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approach to simulate potential in-flight medical events and resultant health and mission outcomes. METHODS: The IMM has been utilized to estimate the medical risk associated with International Space Station (ISS) missions. The IMM outputs that have been most informative to the ISS program are the probabilities of evacuation (pEVAC) and loss of crew life (pLOCL). These outputs are incorporated into a continuously maintained ISS PRA model so that its quantification of total ISS mission risk includes the medical risk. RESULTS: Results of this analysis revealed that the forecasted risk values of pEVAC and pLOCL due to medical events were improved by using the IMM with the ISS PRA model instead of using data from prior sources in which these values were underestimated. DISCUSSION: The IMM provides an evidence-based PRA approach to directly communicate and integrate medical risk with other ISS risks. A comparison of IMM outputs of pEVAC and pLOCL to empirical spaceflight data and analog population data revealed that IMM outputs were comparable with actual experience. With appropriate outcome context, these findings increase subject matter expert confidence in the accuracy of IMM risk estimates. IMM outputs provide quantifiable objective estimates of medical risk that can be used to inform mission risk assessments and to optimize crew health. Walton ME, Kerstman EL.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Space agencies will embark on manned journeys to Mars on smaller vehicles than those used previously. In-flight exercise on those flights must abate the adverse effects microgravity (μG) has on humans. Due to space constraints on these vehicles, a single exercise device must address multiple fitness needs. Exercise and μG individually cause body heat accrual. During in-flight exercise they conspire to exacerbate heat gain. Given the duration of Mars missions and volume of exercise they entail, excess heat accrual must be addressed. METHODS: This review presents data on μG, thermoregulation, and exercise. Since their relationships are impacted by other variables, energy balance, body water, and cerebral and vascular physiology are discussed. Data are integrated to acknowledge the challenges long-term missions, and the in-flight exercise that accompanies them, impose on thermoregulation. Strategies to limit heat accrual are discussed. RESULTS: Current in-flight exercise and hardware will not address heat accrual mitigation or operational performance needs for Mars missions. DISCUSSION: This review suggests for future missions, crewmembers: 1) consume beverages with high sodium contents; 2) employ palm cooling for conductive heat transfer; and 3) perform plyometric exercise on gravity-independent hardware. Research should continue to evaluate these treatments to abate heat gain in μG. Maguire K, Wydotis M, Bollinger L, Caruso J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With the increasing use of aeromedical transport for critically ill patients, it is essential to understand the impact of pressure changes on drug infusion delivery systems. As airplanes ascend and descend, gases/bubbles are released from solutions when ambient pressure decreases and dissolves when pressure increases. This may affect mechanical fluid delivery systems and cause clinically significant changes, especially within a critical care setting. We aimed to evaluate the impact of pressure changes on volumetric pumps and syringe drivers. METHODS: An in vitro study of six volumetric pumps and eight syringe drivers was conducted in a hypobaric chamber to mimic pressure changes during flights. Infusion devices were set to deliver water at 0.2 ml ⋅ h −1 and infused volumes were measured. There were 15 open-ended syringes also studied. RESULTS: During ascent, syringe drivers and volumetric pumps over-delivered 173 µL and 38 µL of fluid. During descent, syringe drivers under-delivered by 166 µL, whereas volumetric pumps under-delivered by 9 µL. Syringe drivers experienced statistically significant changes in fluid delivery during both ascent and descent. In volumetric pumps, only the descent phase infusion differed significantly from other phases. The volume of fluid expansion is dependent on volume and the mechanical properties of the fluid. DISCUSSION: Decreasing ambient pressure causes bubble formation, which displaces fluid, and increasing ambient pressure causes bubble reabsorption in mechanical infusion devices. Hence, atmospheric pressure changes during air travel may alter fluid delivery from medical fluid delivery systems and affect critically ill patients who require both aeromedical evacuation and accurate infusion of drugs.

Although there is no gold standard tool for its assessment, Yoshitake’s Feeling of Fatigue Scale (FFS) appears promising for application to fighter pilots as it has already been validated for Brazilian commercial airline pilots. The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the FFS in Brazilian fighter pilots. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study, carried out between March–August 2023, with 58 fighter pilots operating F-5M and JAS 39E aircraft. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the FFS, and the Samn-Perelli Scale were applied in two moments with a maximum interval of 7 d between them. The reliability/reproducibility and agreement of the instrument were evaluated using Cronbach’s α, Cohen’s κ test (for categorical variables), and the intraclass correlation coefficient for numerical variables in the test-retest. Criterion validation was carried out using the Samn-Perelli Scale. Data were also analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences statistical software, version 25.0. RESULTS: The instrument presents good reliability, being suitable for evaluating the domains of drowsiness [a = 0.840, F = 6.241, confidence interval (CI): 0.576–0.827], concentration (a = 0.907, F = 10.739, CI: 0.726–0.894) and physical discomfort (a = 0.747, F = 3.948, CI: 0.385–0.730).

Astronauts should be prepared to manage medical and dental emergencies. This scoping review maps the evidence on oral health alterations and dental emergencies faced by astronauts during short- and long-term space missions. METHODS: A “Topical Team” assembled by the European Space Agency performed the review described herein. An electronic search was conducted on scientific databases, reference lists of relevant papers, specific textbooks, and space agencies’ databases. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies related to dental medicine in microgravity or outer orbital space conditions. Results are presented through narrative format. RESULTS: Out of 23,686 studies identified, 467 were considered eligible and 80 (54 reviews and 26 human-based studies) were included. The latter were classified into three broad topics: microbiology, space physiology and medicine, and space dentistry. Among the studies involving human subjects, 17 involved individuals who had spent time in space. There are only a few studies about oral health modifications and issues during spaceflight and those have limited evidence. Dental emergencies in space are relatively rare events that tend to increase with mission duration. DISCUSSION: The impact of microgravity on oral health requires further investigation. Preflight and in-flight measures should focus on prevention and treatment protocols for various dental issues to ensure crew safety and mission success. Understanding and addressing factors affecting oral health in microgravity will enhance the well-being of astronauts and the success of human exploration missions in space.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: High-altitude hypoxia remains one of the primary causes endangering flight safety to this day. This study explores the correlation between pilots’ acute hypoxia endurance at high altitude and their comprehensive pulmonary function to help with pilot selection, training, and operations. METHODS: We selected 175 pilots (all men) at the Air Force Medical Center from January 2022 to March 2023. They underwent comprehensive pulmonary function tests and a simulated 22,965-ft (7000-m) hypoxia tests which were categorized into long-time (&gt;360 s) or short-time (180 −360 s) groups based on endurance time. A multivariate Cox proportional risk model analyzed the link between lung function and hypoxia endurance. RESULTS: All pilots completed the tests with a median hypoxia endurance time of 260 s. The long-time group consisted of 50.3% of the pilots and the short-time group consisted of 49.7%. The Cox model indicated that higher alveolar volume as a percentage of predicted and lower residual volume to total lung capacity ratio as a percentage of predicted significantly influenced hypoxia endurance time, while other variables showed no significant impact. DISCUSSION: Pilots with higher alveolar volume as a percentage of predicted and lower residual volume to total lung capacity ratio as a percentage of predicted in comprehensive lung function are likely to have better gas exchange efficiency and lung function, leading to longer acute high-altitude hypoxia endurance time.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pilot burnout significantly affects flight safety. Despite research on related factors, the intrinsic links between pilots’ emotion regulation and burnout are not thoroughly analyzed. The distinctive work environment necessitates advanced emotional regulation skills. Exploring these mechanisms is crucial for understanding and addressing pilot burnout effectively. METHODS: The study performed a path analysis on survey data from 106 Chinese civil aviation pilots to explore the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and job burnout. RESULTS: The findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal affects job burnout through perceived stress and psychological resilience while expressive suppression impacts it via perceived stress. Family-work conflict and organizational stress significantly contribute to burnout, with the model showing a high fit (Comparative Fit Index = 0.99) and an R 2 exceeding 0.5. DISCUSSION: This research pioneers an emotion regulation perspective in pilot job burnout analysis, suggesting innovative interventions. It emphasizes the need for holistic strategies, addressing psychological resilience enhancement and organizational culture issues to mitigate job burnout effectively.

On a mission to Mars, there will be as long as 22-min one-way communication delays between the ground and the crew, causing major changes to current communication infrastructures. METHODS: This exploratory study assessed the impact of a 20-min one-way communication delay on MCs’ task performance, workload, and stress levels under nominal and off-nominal conditions, conducted during a 21-d analog mission. RESULTS: Decrements in performance were noted on both nominal and off-nominal task completion in time-delay conditions [100% of real-time (rt) tasks complete, 16.7% of time-delay (td) tasks incomplete; 12.50% of nominal tasks and 33.33% of off-nominal tasks were incomplete]; more errors on task record forms (td = 6 forms, rt = 1 form); higher ratings of workload burden (nominal, td workload = 38.64; off-nominal, td workload = 58.72; nominal, rt workload = 34.00, off-nominal, rt workload = 52.78). No significant changes in MC stress levels were detected in rt compared to td, but MCs did report greater stress during off-nominal tasks compared to nominal tasks. The crew, however, were unable to detect these changes in MC stress levels. DISCUSSION: Overall, these findings point to the importance of future research focused on MC training and adapting MC’s operations for time-delayed missions.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In space, under weightlessness conditions, human brain activity is changed due to the shifting of body fluid and blood toward the cephalic region. This shifting leads to changes in cerebral hemodynamics and, consequently, neurophysiological function, which impacts mental functions like cognition and decision-making capabilities of space travelers. The present study reports the effect of acute exposure to simulated microgravity on cognitive functions and event-related potentials. METHODS: There were 18 healthy human subjects who participated in a 1-h 6° head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest to simulate physiological conditions during microgravity. Subjects were instructed to perform event-related potential tasks and cognitive tasks with a simulator sickness questionnaire to evaluate their performance, attention, and alertness during weightlessness, at baseline, after microgravity exposure, and after a recovery of 30 min. RESULTS: A significant change was found in the latency of P300 as compared to the baseline. The amplitude of the P300 wave was changed during HDT. The mean reaction time of contingent negative variation increased significantly as compared to the baseline. A significant increase in choice reaction time was observed during HDT vs. baseline. The values recovered partially after 30 min of exposure. DISCUSSION: It was concluded that simulated microgravity impacts mental functions as evidenced by alterations in choice reaction time and event-related potential latencies and reaction time. The study has applied value for understanding neurophysiological responses and optimization of cognitive performance in space conditions.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many questions are still being asked about the actual health effects of exposure to a fume event for airline crewmembers. To shed new light on this controversy about so-called aerotoxic syndrome, we undertook a large-scale epidemiological study. METHODS: We present a retrospective cohort study involving 14,953 crewmembers, including 2577 exposed to a fume event and 12,376 matched controls to estimate the hazard ratio of a subsequent sickness. RESULTS: Prevalence of diseases that could be related to the fume event based on “possible” or “probable” level and date of occurrence after the fume event was for exposed (controls): neurological 2.9% (2.9%), psychiatric 2.5% (2.4%), vegetative 1.8% (1.5%), irritative 5.1% (4.5%), and functional 2.8% (3.2%). Differences were not significant. Incidences of having any related disease are estimated at 1552 per 100,000 person-years for exposed and 1497 per 100,000 person-years for controls, with a nonsignificant hazard ratio of 1.04 (0.86–1.25) in the Cox model. A subset of 2577 matched pairs exposed/control allowing specific statistical tests for paired data confirmed the lack of difference between exposed and controls: matched-pair risk ratio for any fume event related disease was 1.07 (0.85–1.34). DISCUSSION: Our results clearly show that fume events are not associated with significant clinical consequences for cabin and cockpit crew. This work does not support the proposal of an “aerotoxic syndrome” in association with exposure to fume events. Klerlein M, Dubiez L.

    "abstract": "New computerized color vision tests are gaining popularity in the aviation community. These tests determine color vision status by measuring chromatic sensitivity and they can effectively classify color vision as normal vs. abnormal. However, little information is available regarding their repeatability. We evaluated the repeatability of two such tests: the Operational Based Visual Assessment Cone Contrast Test (OCCT) and the Rabin Cone Contrast Test (RCCT). A total of 56 subjects with normal color vision and 63 subjects with defective color vision completed both tests twice over 2 sessions. We determined the repeatability for a normal/abnormal result, between-eye differences in thresholds within a session, and between-session results for each eye. Both tests had excellent repeatability for normal vs. abnormal color vision (i.e., using a cutoff score of 75 Rabin Color Contrast Sensitivity Units). The OCCT also had excellent repeatability for acceptable vs. unacceptable color discrimination (i.e., a cutoff score of 55), whereas the RCCT repeatability was lower. The RCCT's lower repeatability was because the between-eye and between-session Limits of Agreement for the color-defective subjects were approximately ±40 relative sensitivity units. In contrast, the Limits of Agreement for the OCCT ranged from ±10 to ±15. These results reinforce the advantage of using a finer stimulus change when estimating cone thresholds in the clinical setting. Hovis JK, Almustanyir A, Glaholt M.

    "abstract": "The military aviation environment is inherently noisy, with occupational noise hazards from a variety of sources. At the same time, it demands good binaural auditory acuity and speech discrimination abilities for the safe and effective performance of flight duties. This study aimed to 1) examine the burden, characteristics, and severity of abnormal audiograms among military aircrew and ground-based aviation personnel in the Republic of Singapore Air Force; and 2) elicit the risk factors associated with abnormal audiograms. In this cross-sectional study, anonymized data (sociodemographic information, pure tone audiometry thresholds, anthropometric and physiological measurements, and biochemical investigations) were extracted from all consecutive unique annual certification examinations performed between January 1 and December 31, 2022. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify statistically significant risk factors associated with abnormal audiograms. Of the 1817 audiograms, 83 (4.6%) were abnormal based on the modified World Health Organization criteria. Abnormal audiograms featured an early bilateral high-frequency hearing loss pattern characteristic of noise-induced effects. The multivariable model retained only age and four vocations [i.e., Communication Equipment Specialist, Air Force Engineer (Flight Engineer), Air Warfare Officer (Air Battle Manager), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Pilot] as significant risk factors. Neither aircraft platforms nor specific engine types were associated with higher odds of developing abnormal audiograms. This study suggests that the modified World Health Organization criteria are useful in identifying at-risk subgroups within the military aircrew population and could be considered for use as a more sensitive screening threshold for early noise-induced hearing loss.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Novel ocular findings have been identified in spaceflight. We discuss their potential association with Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) and integrate them in a framework that may help explain the pathophysiology. METHODS: We reviewed literature using the Medline/PubMed database starting in October 2020. Search terms included ocular circulation, hyperopia, serous chorioretinopathy, pigment epithelial detachment, choroidal folds, choroidal thickening, pachychoroid disease, optic disc edema, venous overload choroidopathy. No date exclusions were placed on the search. Articles were reviewed for relevance. Articles relevant to the pathophysiology of choroidal thickening and choroidal venous overload as it applies to SANS were included. RESULTS: Terrestrial venous overload choroidopathy is thought to be due to impediment to choroidal venous outflow, resulting in dilation of choroidal veins, increased choroidal thickness, pigment epithelial detachments, and serous detachment of the retina. Serous detachment of the retina, pigment epithelial detachments, choroidal folds, and thickening of the choroid were identified on in-flight optical coherence tomography testing. Postflight findings include these, as well as globe flattening. During spaceflight, there is a cephalad displacement of both blood and cerebrospinal fluid. This may lead to pathological consequences in the eye. Remodeling of the choroidal venous vortex system may result in continuance of pathophysiological findings after return to Earth, suggesting the best strategy is prevention. DISCUSSION: Microgravity induced venous overload of the choroid may play a role in SANS pathophysiology, and a venous overload choroidopathy may help explain several SANS features that remain unexplained by an etiology of elevated intracranial pressure.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in medical technology, lung cancer metastasis remains a global health problem. The effects of microgravity on cell morphology, structure, functions, and their mechanisms have been widely studied; however, the biological effects of simulated microgravity on the interaction between cells and its eventual influence on the characteristics of cancer cells are yet to be discovered. We examined the effects of simulated microgravity on the metastatic ability of different lung cancer cells using a random positioning machine. METHODS: Human lung cancer cell lines of adenocarcinoma (A549) and squamous cell carcinoma (H1703) were cultured in a 3D clinostat system which was continuously rotated at 5 rpm for 36 h. The experimental and control group were cultured under identical conditions with the exception of clinorotation. RESULTS: Simulated microgravity had different effects on each lung cancer cell line. In A549 cells, the proliferation rate of the clinostat group (2.267 ± 0.010) after exposure to microgravity did not differ from that of the control group (2.271 ± 0.020). However, in H1703 cells, the proliferation rates of the clinostat group (0.534 ± 0.021) was lower than that of the control group (1.082 ± 0.021). The migratory ability of both A549 [remnant cell-free area: 33% (clinostat) vs. 78% (control)] and H1703 cells [40% (clinostat) vs. 68% (control)] were increased after exposure to microgravity. The results of the molecular changes in biomarkers after exposure to microgravity are preliminary.

    "abstract": "Zero-G parabolic flight reproduces the weightlessness of space for short periods. However, motion sickness may affect some fliers. The aim was to assess the extent of this problem and to find possible predictors and modifying factors.Airbus zero-G flights consist of 31 parabolas performed in blocks. Each parabola consisted of 20 s of 0 g sandwiched by 20 s of hypergravity of 1.5-1.8 g. The survey covered N = 246 person-flights (193 men, 53 women), ages (M ± SD) 36.0 ± 11.3 yr. An anonymous questionnaire included motion sickness rating (1 = OK to 6 = vomiting), Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ), antimotion sickness medication, prior zero-G experience, anxiety level, and other characteristics.Participants had lower MSSQ percentile scores (27.4 ± 28.0) than the population norm of 50. Motion sickness was experienced by 33% and 12% vomited. Less motion sickness was predicted by older age, greater prior zero-G flight experience, medication with scopolamine, lower MSSQ scores, but not gender or anxiety. Sickness ratings in fliers pretreated with scopolamine (1.81 ± 1.58) were lower than for nonmedicated fliers (2.93 ± 2.16), and incidence of vomiting in fliers using scopolamine treatment was reduced by half to a third. Possible confounding factors including age, sex, flight experience, and MSSQ could not account for this.Motion sickness affected one-third of zero-G fliers despite being intrinsically less motion sickness susceptible compared to the general population. Susceptible individuals probably try to avoid such a provocative environment. Risk factors for motion sickness included younger age and higher MSSQ scores. Protective factors included prior zero-G flight experience (habituation) and antimotion sickness medication.Golding JF, Paillard AC, Normand H, Besnard S, Denise P.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess changes in common carotid (CA) and superficial femoral (FA) arterial stiffness during long-duration spaceflight.Ultrasound imaging was used to investigate the CA and FA of 10 astronauts preflight (PRE), on flight day 15 (FD15), after 4-5 mo (FD4-5m), and 4 d after return to Earth (R+4). Arterial wall properties were assessed through the calculation of strain, stiffness (β), pressure-strain elastic modulus (Ep), and distensibility (DI). Stiffness indices were assessed for potential correlations to measurements of intima-media thickness (IMT).Significant effects of spaceflight were found for all CA stiffness indices, indicating an increase in arterial stiffness. CA strain was reduced by 34 ± 31% on FD15 and 50 ± 16% on FD4-5m and remained reduced by 42 ± 14% on R+4 with respect to PRE values. On FD4-5m, with respect to PRE values, DI was reduced by 46 ± 25% and β and Ep were increased by 124 ± 95% and 118 ± 92%, respectively. FA arterial stiffness indices appeared to show similar changes; however, a main effect of spaceflight was only found for strain. Correlation analysis showed weak but significant relationships between measurements of CA IMT and arterial stiffness indices, but no relationships were found for FA measurements.The observed change in CA and FA stiffness indices suggest that spaceflight results in an increase in arterial stiffness. That these changes were not strongly related to measurements of IMT suggests the possibility of different mechanisms contributing to the observed results.Arbeille P, Provost R, Zuj K.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Understanding the effects of microgravity on bone is essential, since humans are now considering long-distance spaceflight missions. It is well known that bone mineral density (BMD) decreases during long-duration spaceflight. While the risk of fracture in a microgravity environment is believed to be low, the potential risk for fracture increases upon re-entering a gravity environment. The objective of this study was to determine skeletal regions of high-risk for fracture after long-duration spaceflight and identify management protocols for those fractures. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on current fracture risk predictive models and suggestions for treatment. RESULTS: Exercise with the Advanced Resistance Exercise Device (ARED), T2 treadmill, and cycle ergometer with vibration isolation and stabilization (CEVIS) on the International Space Station (ISS) is part of a fundamental long-duration spaceflight strategy to mitigate BMD loss. Additionally, studies have shown that bisphosphonates have an additive effect for preventing bone loss. However, if a fracture were to occur, treatments that improve bone healing in space (in addition to standard management modalities such as splinting) include the use of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, electromagnetic field therapy, and intermittent subcutaneous injections of parathyroid hormone. In the event of a complicated fracture, surgical intervention with a universal external fixation device could be a viable option for management. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the best strategy for mitigating musculoskeletal injuries for deep-space missions will be a combination of BMD loss reduction coupled with improvements in management protocols for potential fractures.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study investigates the effects of seasonality and altitude on sleep in extreme Antarctic conditions. METHODS: During summer and winter periods, 24 h of actimetric recordings were obtained at two different research stations, Dumont d’Urville (sea level altitude) and Concordia (corrected altitude 12,467 ft or 3800 m). RESULTS: During daytime, there were no altitude- or season-related differences in time spent at work, energy expenditure, or number of walking steps. During the nighttime however, total sleep time was longer (m = 427.4; SD = 42.4), sleep efficiency higher (m = 90; SD = 4.8), and wake after sleep onset shorter (m = 42.2; SD = 28.7) at sea level. Additionally, sleep fragmentation episodes and energy expenditure were higher during summer than winter periods. DISCUSSION: Our results show that dramatic variations in light exposure are not the only main factor affecting sleep quality in Antarctica, as altitude also markedly impacted sleep in these conditions. The effect of altitude-induced hypoxia should be taken into account in future investigations of sleep in extreme environments.Collet G, Mairesse O, Cortoos A, Tellez HF, Neyt X, Peigneux P, Macdonald-Nethercott E, Ducrot Y-M, Pattyn N.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Living in an isolated, confined environment (ICE) can induce conflict, stress, and depression. Computer-based behavioral health countermeasures are appealing for training and treatment in ICEs because they provide confidentiality and do not require communication with the outside environment. We evaluated the Virtual Space Station (VSS), a suite of interactive computer-delivered psychological training and treatment programs, at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) III expedition. METHODS: Six subjects (3 male, 3 female) spent 8 mo in group-isolation and used the Conflict, Stress, and Depression modules in the VSS. Survey evaluations, data collected within the program, and postdeployment interviews were collected. RESULTS: This crew dealt with behavioral health issues common to ICEs. The VSS proved to be a valuable resource and was used both as intended, and in unanticipated ways, to help maintain behavioral health. The Conflict and Stress Modules were rated as highly acceptable (1.8 on a 7-point Likert scale). The crew identified a total of 13 stressors and worked on 9 problems through the VSS. Opinions about the modules were highly individualized. Crewmembers identified exercises in the VSS that were applicable and not applicable to their needs. Additional content to improve the program was identified.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) measures effects of fatigue from sleep loss and circadian misalignment on sustained vigilance performance. To promote PVT use in field environments, a 5-min PVT version has been implemented on a personal digital assistant (PDA) with a touch screen. The present laboratory study was conducted to validate this PVT against a standard 10-min laptop PVT across 38 h of total sleep deprivation (TSD). METHODS: Following a baseline sleep night, subjects underwent 38 h of TSD, during which they performed the PVT every hour, alternating between the two test platforms. The study concluded with a night of recovery sleep. RESULTS: The primary outcome was the number of PVT lapses (reaction times &gt; 500 ms). Both PVT platforms showed significant effects for the number of lapses across TSD test times involving an increase with time awake modulated by circadian rhythm. Laptop PVT lapses across test times exhibited a large effect size (f 2 = 0.36), whereas PDA PVT lapses exhibited a medium effect size (f 2 = 0.17). The laptop PVT showed a significant effect for the number of false starts during TSD similar to the temporal profile of lapses, while the PDA PVT had false starts throughout the TSD period. DISCUSSION: The 5-min PDA PVT provided performance testing functionality and results comparable to the 10-min laptop PVT. The number of PDA PVT lapses tracked fatigue similarly to the laptop PVT lapses, albeit with smaller average ranges and effect sizes.Honn KA, Riedy SM, Grant DA.

The aim of this study was to repeat the 2005 survey in order to evaluate the impact of those interventions.An anonymous questionnaire requesting details of G-LOC and A-LOC events was mailed to all RAF pilots (N = 1878) and weapons systems operators (WSOs) (N = 473), irrespective of aircraft currently flown.The questionnaire was returned by 809 aircrew (34.4% response rate). There were 120 (14.8%) aircrew who reported at least one episode of G-LOC and 260 (32.2%) reported at least one episode of A-LOC. The reported prevalence of G-LOC in the previous 2005 survey was 20.1% (N = 454). There was an increased reporting of G-LOC in the Hawk, Tucano, and Grob Tutor aircraft, with 5 G-LOC and 19 A-LOC events reported in the Grob Tutor compared to none in 2005.The prevalence of reported G-LOC has decreased in the surveyed populations, which may be due to the introduction of centrifuge training, but also may be influenced by patterns of G exposure and other factors. Scope for further reduction remains through correct execution of the anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) with centrifuge training early in flying training and use of a structured conditioning program to increase the general strength of muscles involved in the AGSM.Slungaard E, McLeod J, Green NDC, Kiran A, Newham DJ, Harridge SDR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fear of flying (FoF), a common phobia in the developed world, is usually treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, most efficiently when combined with exposure methods, e.g., virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). We evaluated FoF treatment using VRET in a large motion-based VR system. The treated subjects were seated on a moving platform. The virtual scenery included the interior of an aircraft and a window view to the outside world accompanied by platform movements simulating, e.g., takeoff, landing, and air turbulence. Relevant auditory stimuli were also incorporated. CASE REPORT: Three male patients with FoF underwent a clinical interview followed by three VRETs in the presence and with the guidance of a therapist. Scores on the Flight Anxiety Situation (FAS) and Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaires were obtained on the first and fourth visits. Anxiety levels were assessed using the subjective units of distress (SUDs) scale during the exposure. All three subjects expressed satisfaction regarding the procedure and did not skip or avoid any of its stages. Consistent improvement was seen in the SUDs throughout the VRET session and across sessions, while patients’ scores on the FAS and FAM showed inconsistent trends. Two patients participated in actual flights in the months following the treatment, bringing 12 and 16 yr of avoidance to an end. DISCUSSION: This VR-based treatment includes critical elements for exposure of flying experience beyond visual and auditory stimuli. The current case reports suggest VRET sessions may have a meaningful impact on anxiety levels, yet additional research seems warranted.Czerniak E, Caspi A, Litvin M, Amiaz R, Bahat Y, Baransi H, Sharon H, Noy S, Plotnik M.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a critical safety issue to U.S. Air Force (USAF) flight and ground crew. Nearly 15 yr of mishap reports were analyzed to determine how fatigue affects USAF operations with the goal of improving fatigue risk management policies and tools. METHODS: Summary data for 19,920 aviation mishap reports dating back to 2003 were collected from the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS). Fatigue-related mishaps were identified based on designations provided within AFSAS. Other metrics examined were characteristics such as timing, cost, and aircraft metrics, among others. Contingency tables built from these metrics were used to assess fatigue-related trends across the aviation community. RESULTS: While only 3.88% of all mishaps were identified as fatigue-related, they are associated with 2.1 billion of medical expenses and property damage, or 18% of the 11.7 billion total cost of all mishaps included in the study. Nearly a quarter of the fatigue-related mishaps fall into the most severe mishap category and more than half occurred between 0100 and 0700, local time. Fatigue-related mishaps tended to be more common for Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) and ground operations. DISCUSSION: Fatigue is very costly to the USAF despite the relatively low incidence rate of fatigue-related mishaps. This is because larger proportions of severe mishaps were found to be fatigue-related. RPA and ground maintenance operators might be especially susceptible to fatigue and potentially lack adequate fatigue mitigation support and training tailored to their unique operational environment, suggesting a need to improve upon fatigue mitigation tools and strategies.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND : Spatial disorientation (SD) remains a significant cause of accidents and near accidents. A variety of training methods have been used to assist pilots to anticipate the SD problem. The value of such training in the prevention of disorientation has been difficult to assess. METHODS: To study transfer of SD awareness training, we related reported incidents to the content and frequency of SD awareness training received. The questionnaire was completed by 368 out of 495 pilots; 189 currently flying fixed-wing, and 150 flying rotary-wing aircraft. On average, their age was 38, and they had 2466 flight hours on-type. RESULTS: Respondents gave high ratings for the importance of SD training and their awareness of SD, the latter being one of the training objectives. The amount of SD training received by respondents was positively correlated with ratings for appreciation and importance. Self-rated awareness was positively correlated with the number of reported SD experiences. Although the correlations were below 0.50, the results provide an indication that SD training is effective. In total, respondents reported 5773 SD experiences, 195 of them resulting in a serious risk for flight safety. Narratives of these serious events show that, in many cases, pilots managed their SD by carefully checking the flight instruments, and also by good crew coordination. DISCUSSION: The results of the survey provide some evidence, although based on subjective reports, for transfer of SD training. The results of the SD experiences can be used to improve the SD training in terms of content and frequency. Pennings HJM, Oprins EAPB, Wittenberg H, Houben MMJ, Groen EL.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This research was conducted to compare short haul (SH) and long haul (LH) pilots regarding sleep restrictions and fatigue risks on flight duty, stress, sleep problems, fatigue severity, well-being, and mental health. METHOD: There were 406 international SH and LH pilots who completed the cross-sectional online survey. Pilots sleep restrictions and fatigue-risk profiles (e.g., time pressure, late arrivals, minimum rest), sleep problems, fatigue severity, well-being, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and common mental disorders (CMD) were measured and compared for SH and LH pilots. RESULTS: Although SH and LH pilots were scheduled for only 51.465.4% of the legally allowed duty and flight hours, 44.8% of SH pilots reported severe fatigue (FSS 4 to 4.9), and an additional 31.7% high fatigue (FSS 5), compared with 34.7% and 37.3% LH pilots. Considerable sleep problems in 8 nights/mo were reported by 24.6% SH vs. 23.5% LH pilots. Positive depression screenings were reported by 18.1% SH and 19.3% LH pilots. Positive anxiety screenings were reported by 9.6% SH and 5% LH pilots. Of all investigated pilots, 20% reported significant symptoms of depression or anxiety, and 7.23% had positive depression and anxiety screenings. LH pilots reported significantly better well-being than SH pilots. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that even far less duty and flight hours than legally allowed according to flight time limitations lead to high levels of fatigue, sleep problems, and significant mental health issues among pilots. SH pilots were even more affected than LH pilots. Pilots fatigue should be considered an immediate threat to aviation safety and pilots fitness to fly by promoting fatigue and burnout.

METHODS: Cardiac monitoring in flights was carried out using a compact, mobile ECG recorder. A frequency analysis of the heart rate (HR) signal was performed to determine the ratio of low-frequency spectral power (LF) to high-frequency spectral power (HF). RESULTS: The LF/HF ratio observed in the zone (M = 1.047, SD = 0.059) was significantly different than the LF/HF calculated preflight (M = 0.877, SD = 0.043) and postflight (M = 0.793, SD = 0.037). There was no main effect of the flight type (unassisted zone flight vs. zone flight with an instructor) on the LF/HF parameter. However, greater psychophysiological load of a pilot was observed in the training zone flights when compared to simple circle flights (main effect of the flight type). CONCLUSIONS: As the LF/HF ratio turned out to be significantly higher in the zone than pre- and postflight, this parameter can be useful for predicting the risk of excessive stress and arousal of pilots during flights. Based on the LF/HF ratio we can also estimate difficulty level of flight tasks, because our research has shown higher values of this parameter in the training zone flights than in simple circle flights.Skibniewski FW, Dziuda Ł, Baran PM, Krej MK, Guzowski S, Piotrowski MA, Truszczyński OE.

This study seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of using solar energy to power a FDM 3D printer to manufacture medical resources at the Mars Desert Research Station and to design an ultra-portable solar-powered 3D printer for off-grid environments. METHODS: Six solar panels in a 3 × 2 configuration, a voltage regulator/capacitor improvised from a power adapter, and two 12V batteries in series were connected to power a FDM 3D printer. Three designs were printed onsite and evaluated by experts post analogue mission. A solar-powered 3D printer composed of off-the-shelf components was designed to be transported in airline carry-on luggage. RESULTS: During the analogue mission, the solar-powered printer could only be operated for &lt; 1 h/d, but was able to fabricate a functional dental tool, scalpel handle, and customized mallet splint over 2 d. Post analogue mission, an ultra-portable plug-and-play solar-powered 3D printer was designed that could print an estimated 16 dental tools or 8 mallet finger splints or 7 scalpel handles on one fully charged 12V 150Wh battery with a 110V AC converter.

    "abstract": "Using ultrasound imaging, vascular gas emboli (VGE) are observed after asymptomatic scuba dives and are considered a key element in the potential development of decompression sickness (DCS). Diving is also accompanied with vascular dysfunction, as measured by flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Previous studies showed significant intersubject variability to VGE for the same diving exposure and demonstrated that VGE can be reduced with even a single pre-dive intervention. Several preconditioning methods have been reported recently, seemingly acting either on VGE quantity or on endothelial inflammatory markers.Nine male divers who consistently showed VGE postdive performed a standardized deep pool dive (33 m/108 ft, 20 min in 33°C water temperature) to investigate the effect of three different preconditioning interventions: heat exposure (a 30-min session of dry infrared sauna), whole-body vibration (a 30-min session on a vibration mattress), and dark chocolate ingestion (30 g of chocolate containing 86% cocoa). Dives were made one day per week and interventions were administered in a randomized order.These interventions were shown to selectively reduce VGE, FMD, or both compared to control dives. Vibration had an effect on VGE (39.54%, SEM 16.3%) but not on FMD postdive. Sauna had effects on both parameters (VGE: 26.64%, SEM 10.4%; FMD: 102.7%, SEM 2.1%), whereas chocolate only improved FMD (102.5%, SEM 1.7%).This experiment, which had the same subjects perform all control and preconditioning dives in wet but completely standardized diving conditions, demonstrates that endothelial dysfunction appears to not be solely related to VGE.Germonpré P, Balestra C.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Future space exploration, such as a mission to Mars, will require space crews to live and work in extreme environments unlike those of previous space missions. Extreme conditions such as prolonged confinement, isolation, and expected communication time delays will require that crews have a higher level of interpersonal compatibility and be able to work autonomously, adapting to unforeseen challenges in order to ensure mission success. Team composition, or the configuration of member attributes, is an important consideration for maximizing crewmember well-being and team performance. METHODS: We conducted an extensive search to find articles about team composition in long-distance space exploration (LDSE)-analogue environments, including a search of databases, specific relevant journals, and by contacting authors who publish in the area. RESULTS: We review the team composition research conducted in analogue environments in terms of two paths through which team composition is likely to be related to LDSE mission success, namely by 1) affecting social integration, and 2) the team processes and emergent states related to team task completion. DISCUSSION: Suggestions for future research are summarized as: 1) the need to identify ways to foster unit-level social integration within diverse crews; 2) the missed opportunity to use team composition variables as a way to improve team processes, emergent states, and task completion; and 3) the importance of disentangling the effect of specific team composition variables to determine the traits (e.g., personality, values) that are associated with particular risks (e.g., subgrouping) to performance.Bell ST, Brown SG, Abben DR, Outland NB.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aerobic deconditioning may occur during International Space Station (ISS) flights. This paper documents findings from exercise testing conducted before, during, and after ISS expeditions. METHODS: There were 30 male and 7 female astronauts on ISS missions (48 to 219 d, mean 163 d) who performed cycle exercise protocols consisting of 5-min stages eliciting 25%, 50%, and 75% peak oxygen uptake (Vo 2peak ). Tests were conducted 30 to 90 d before missions, on flight day 15 and every 30 flight days thereafter, and on recovery (R) days +5 and +30. During pre- and postflight tests, heart rate (HR) and metabolic gas exchange were measured. During flight, extrapolation of the HR and Vo 2 relationship to preflight-measured peak HR provided an estimate of Vo 2peak , referred to as the aerobic capacity index (ACI). RESULTS: HR during each exercise stage was elevated ( P &lt; 0.05) and oxygen pulse was reduced ( P &lt; 0.05) on R+5 compared to preflight; however, no other metabolic gas analysis values significantly changed. Compared to preflight, the ACI declined ( P &lt; 0.001) on R+5, but recovered to levels greater than preflight by R+30 ( P = 0.008). During flight, ACI decreased below preflight values, but increased with mission duration ( P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic deconditioning likely occurs initially during flight, but ACI recovers toward preflight levels as flight duration increases, presumably due to performance of exercise countermeasures. Elevated HR and lowered oxygen pulse on R+5 likely results from some combination of relative hypovolemia, lowered cardiac stroke volume, reduced cardiac distensibility, and anemia, but recovery occurs by R+30.Moore AD Jr, Lynn PA, Feiveson AH.

The approach matches inspired oxygen partial pressure (P I o 2 ) at the desired altitude to that at site pressure (P B ) by reducing the inspired fraction of oxygen (F I o 2 ) to &lt;0.21 using the equation: P I o 2 = (P B – 47) × F I o 2 , where 47 mmHg is the vapor pressure of water at 37°C. The investigator then has at site pressure the equivalent P I o 2 as at altitude, i.e., the NH exposure is at an “equivalent air altitude.” Some accepted as fact identical signs and symptoms of hypoxia for both conditions. However, those that derived the alveolar air equation showed that the coupled alveolar oxygen (P A o 2 ) and carbon dioxide partial pressures (P A co 2 ) for NH and HH are not identical when P I o 2 is equivalent. They attribute the difference in alveolar gas composition under equivalent P I o 2 to a nitrogen dilution effect or, more generally, to the respiratory exchange effect. Those that use NH as a convenient surrogate for HH must concede that physiological responses to NH cannot be identical to the responses to HH given only equivalent hypoxic P I o 2 .Conkin J.

METHODS: Data were collected from 10 individuals at rest and during the first 2 h of dry immersion. Jugular vein (JV), portal vein (PV), and thyroid volume were measured using 3D echography. Middle cerebral vein velocity (MCVv) was determined using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. The cochlear response to audio stimulation was used to derive an estimate of intracranial pressure (dICP). RESULTS: After 2 h of DI, there was a significant increase (mean ± SD) in JV (2.21 ± 1.10 mL), PV (1.05 ± 0.48 mL), and thyroid (0.428 ± 0.313 mL) volume. MCVv was also significantly increased with DI (3.90 ± 5.03 cm · s −1 ). There was no change in dICP with DI in part due to large individual variability. The range of dICP changes appeared to be related to MCVv, with participants with the largest increase in MCVv also showing increased dICP. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that DI induces a significant cephalic fluid shift similar to what is observed with spaceflight. The increased thyroid volume suggests that cerebral tissue may also be subjected to similar fluid filtration, with implications for changes in intracranial pressure. However, despite all participants having an increase in JV and thyroid volume, only half showed an increase in dICP, suggesting that increased venous pooling alone is not sufficient to cause increased intracranial pressure.Arbeille P, Avan P, Treffel L, Zuj K, Normand H, Denise P.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Antarctica is a useful analog for spaceflight, as both environments are remote, isolated, and with limited resources. While previous studies have demonstrated increased asymptomatic viral shedding in both the Antarctic and spaceflight environments, clinical manifestations of reactivated viral disease have been less frequently identified. We sought to identify the incidence of clinical herpes zoster from viral reactivation in the Antarctic winter-over population. METHODS: Medical records from the 2014 winter season were reviewed for the incidence of zoster in U.S. Antarctic personnel and then compared to the age-matched U.S. population. RESULTS: Five cases of clinical herpes zoster occurred in the Antarctic Station population of 204 persons, for an incidence of 33.3 per 1000 person-years vs. 3.2 per 1000 person-years in the general population. Four cases were in persons under age 40, yielding an incidence of 106.7 per 1000 person-years in persons ages 30–39 compared to an incidence of 2.0 per 1000 person-years in the same U.S. age group. DISCUSSION: Immune suppression due to the stressful Antarctic environment may have contributed to the increased incidence of herpes zoster in U.S. Antarctic personnel during the winter of 2014. Working and living in isolated, confined, and extreme environments can cause immune suppression, reactivating latent viruses and increasing viral shedding and symptomatic disease. Such changes have been observed in other austere environments, including spaceflight, suggesting that clinical manifestations of viral reactivation may be seen in future spaceflight.Reyes DP, Brinley AA, Blue RS, Gruschkus SK, Allen AT, Parazynski SE.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study simultaneously quantified the effects of normobaric hypoxia (NH), hypobaric hypoxia (HH), exercise duration, and exposure time on acute mountain sickness severity (AMS-C). METHODS: Thirty-six subjects (27.7 ± 7.8 yr) participated in a partial repeated measures study, completing two of six conditions: normobaric normoxia (NN: 300 m/984 ft equivalent), NH or HH (Po 2 = 91 mmHg; 4400 m/14,436 ft equivalent), combined with moderate intensity cycling for 10 or 60 min. Subjects completed the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire and oxygen saturation (S p o 2 ) was measured before, 1.5 h, 4 h, and 6.5 h into an 8-h exposure, and 1.5 h post-exposure. We fit multiple linear regression models with cluster adjusted standard errors on the exposure times using NH, HH, and long exercise as indicator variables, and AMS-C as the outcome variable. The S p o 2 and pre-exposure AMS-C score were used as covariates. RESULTS: NH and HH led to substantial and progressively increasing AMS-C, but NN did not. The effect of HH on AMS-C was significantly different from NH, with AMS-C in HH being 1.6 times higher than in NH. HH led to significantly increasing AMS-C, regardless of the exercise duration, while NH only did so in combination with longer exercise. DISCUSSION: Increases in AMS-C were each independently related to NH, HH, and long duration exercise, with HH affecting AMS-C more severely. This suggests that hypobaria may affect AMS development above the level induced by hypoxia alone. This further suggests that NH and HH may not be interchangeable for studying AMS and that exercise duration may impact physiological responses.DiPasquale DM, Strangman GE, Harris NS, Muza SR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dietary supplement (DS) use is common among U.S. Army personnel to purportedly improve health, provide energy, and increase strength. However, a comprehensive analysis of DS use among U.S. Air Force (USAF) personnel has not been conducted using the same survey instrument, which would permit direct comparisons to DS use by Army personnel. METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was used to assess DS use, demographic factors, and reasons for use of DS by USAF personnel ( N = 1750). Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and rank were used to determine relationships among categories of DS (multivitamin and multimineral, individual vitamins and minerals, protein/amino acid supplements, combination products, herbal supplements, purported steroid analogs, and other) and demographic factors. Findings were compared to reports from other military services and civilian populations. RESULTS: DS were used by 68% of USAF personnel: 35% used 1–2 DS ≥ 1 time/wk, 13% 3–4 DS ≥ 1 time/wk, and 20% ≥ 5 DS ≥ 1 time/wk. There were 45% of personnel who used a multivitamin and mineral, 33% protein supplements, 22% individual vitamins/minerals, 22% combination products, and 7% herbals. Logistic regression demonstrated aerobic exercise duration and strength training were associated with increased DS use. Individuals who previously deployed were more likely to use DS. CONCLUSIONS: Like Army personnel, college students and athletes, USAF personnel use more DS than the general population and are more likely to use purported performance enhancing DS, such as protein supplements, and concurrently consume multiple DS.Austin KG, Price LL, McGraw SM, Leahy G, Lieberman HR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypoxia continues to present risks in military aviation. Hypoxia symptoms include sensory and cognitive effects; of these, it is important to identify which components of operator performance are most vulnerable to hypoxia-induced decline in order to determine which sensory modality is most effective for alerting an impaired aviator of an imminent hypoxic episode. METHODS: A study was performed in a hypobaric chamber to characterize deterioration of cognitive performance under moderate (MH) and severe (SH) hypoxia conditions, culminating in subjects’ inability to perform tasks. Subjects operated a synthetic workstation, performing multiple simultaneous tasks during hypobaric exposures equivalent to 5486 m (18,000 ft) MH and 7620 m (25,000 ft) SH ascents. Performance was compared across baseline, altitude exposure, and recovery periods within MH vs. SH altitude profiles. Ascents lasted until at least one of a list of termination criteria was met, at which point the chamber was returned to ground level pressure and the subject resumed workstation performance during recovery. RESULTS: SH conditions generated greater deficits than MH conditions, and these more severe effects hastened the termination of exposures (5 vs. 18 min mean duration, respectively). Workstation performance collapsed rapidly on SH exposure, with Mathematics and Auditory Monitoring tasks proving vulnerable to breakdown. In MH exposures, these tasks exhibited impaired accuracy (declining 11% and 9%, respectively) and speed, with declines in Auditory Monitoring lingering into recovery. DISCUSSION: The relative robustness of memory and visual monitoring vs. the vulnerability of mathematical and auditory processing suggest that care should be taken designing purely auditory cockpit hypoxia warning alerts.Beer JMA, Shender BS, Chauvin D, Dart TS, Fischer J.

The purpose of this study was to examine injury rates in foot-launched flying sports, i.e., sports in which a pilot foot-launches into flight with a wing already deployed.This paper is based on a retrospective analysis of the reports of incidents that occurred between 2000 and 2014 among the British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association members.The majority of the 1411 reported injuries were in the lower limb, followed by the upper limb. The most common lower limb injury was to the ankle and included fractures, sprains, and dislocations. The distribution of injures was different in each discipline. The calculated yearly fatality rate (fatalities/100,000 participants) was 40.4 in hang gliding, 47.1 in paragliding, 61.9 in powered hang gliding and 83.4 in powered paragliding; the overall value for foot-launched flight sports was 43.9.Significant differences in injury rates and injury patterns were found among different sport disciplines that can be useful to steer research on safety, and adopt specific safety rules about flying, protective clothing and safety systems in each of these sports.Feletti F, Aliverti A, Henjum M, Tarabini M, Brymer E.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Task complexity is regarded as an essential metric that is related to a pilot’s performance and workload. Normally, pilots follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during a flight. In this study, we developed a measurement named Task Complexity in Flight (TCIF) to represent the task complexity in the SOPs. METHODS: The TCIF measurement combined four complexity components into one index: actions logic complexity (ALC), actions size complexity (ASC), information control exchange complexity (ICEC), and control mode complexity (CMC).To verify the measurement, we calculated 11 tasks during the takeoff and landing phases from the SOPs, and invited 10 pilots to perform the same tasks in a flight simulator. After flight, the TCIF results were compared with two workload measurements: the Bedford scale and heart rate. RESULTS: The results of TCIF and the 4 components of the 11 tasks were calculated. Further, the TCIF results showed a significant correlation with the Bedford scores (R = 0.851) and were also consistent with the difference in heart rate (R = 0.816). Therefore, with the increased TCIF results, both the Bedford scale and the difference in heart rate increased. DISCUSSION: TCIF was proposed based on the flight operating conditions. Although additional studies of TCIF are necessary, the results of this study suggest this measurement could effectively indicate task complexity in flight, and could also be used to guide pilot training and task allocation on the flight deck.Zheng Y, Lu Y, Wang Z, Huang D, Fu S.

This study assessed the feasibility of FDM 3D printing ABS thermoplastic customized mallet splints on site for Mars analogue crewmembers. METHODS: Seven caliper measurements were taken of the right ring finger of 13 healthy Mars Desert Research Station mission crewmembers. These measurements were input into a free 3D modeling software program to create customized digital splint models. These digital files were uploaded to a desktop FDM 3D printer and custom splints were printed on site with ABS thermoplastic. Splint fit was assessed via subject feedback. Joint active range of motion was recorded when the splint was worn briefly. RESULTS: The time it took the software program to digitally render each splint model was less than 2 min and 30 s. The print duration for the splints ranged from 21 to 29 min. All 13 subjects reported that their 3D printed custom mallet splints fit securely and comfortably. All splints permitted full active range of motion of the proximal interphalangeal joint (0–100°) while maintaining the distal interphalangeal joint in extension.

As such, it is of profound significance to address the question of what characteristics are protective of mental health among pilots. The present study aimed to explore the indirect effects of emotional intelligence (EI) on depression and anxiety via proactive coping, and examine the moderating role of previous flight experience (PFE) in the conditional indirect effect of EI on depression through proactive coping.A cross-sectional regression design was used to measure EI (Trait Meta Mood Scale), proactive coping (Proactive Coping Scale), depression (The PHQ-9), and anxiety (The GAD-7) among 319 Chinese civil pilots from China Southern Airlines. Mediation and moderated mediation effects were explored using regression analyses and were confirmed by the bootstrapping approach.Pilots reported relatively low levels of depression (M = 0.39, SD = 0.24) and anxiety (M = 0.22, SD = 0.23). Married pilots had higher levels of depression (t = 2.46) and anxiety (t = 3.07) than single pilots. Proactive coping mediated the association between EI and depression (B = -0.25), as well as the relationship between EI and anxiety (B = -0.23). Moreover, conditional process analysis showed that PFE moderated the indirect effect of EI on depression through proactive coping (b3 = 0.005), in which simple slope analysis showed a stronger mediating effect for pilots with more PFE (simple slope = -0.14).The results showed that EI and proactive coping had protective potential in the prevention of depression and anxiety.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Behavioral health is essential for the safety, well-being, and performance of crewmembers in both human spaceflight and Antarctic exploration. Over the past five decades, psychiatric issues have been documented in orbital spaceflight. In Antarctica, literature suggests up to 5% of wintering crewmembers could meet criteria for a psychiatric illness, including mood disorders, stressor-related disorders, sleep-wake disorders, and substance-related disorders. Experience from these settings indicates that psychiatric disorders on deep space missions must be anticipated. An important part of planning for the psychological health of crewmembers is the onboard provision of psychotropic drugs. These medications have been available on orbital missions. A greater variety and supply of these drugs exist at Antarctic facilities. The size and diversity of a deep space psychiatric formulary will be greater than that provided on orbital missions. Drugs to be provisioned include anxiolytics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and hypnotics. Each drug category should include different medications, providing diverse pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and side effect profiles. The formulary itself should be rigorously controlled, given the abuse potential of some medications. In-flight treatment strategies could include psychological monitoring of well-being and early intervention for significant symptoms. Psychiatric emergencies would be treated aggressively with behavioral and pharmacological interventions to de-escalate potentially hazardous situations. On long-duration space missions, a robust psychiatric formulary could provide crewmembers autonomy and flexibility in treating a range of behavioral issues from depression to acute psychosis. This will contribute to the safety, health, and performance of crewmembers, and to mission success.Friedman E, Bui B. A psychiatric formulary for long-duration spaceflight .

    "abstract": "Virtual simulations offer nearly unlimited training potential for naval aviation due to the wide array of scenarios that can be simulated in a safe, reliable, and cost-effective environment. This versatility has created substantial interest in using existing and emerging virtual technology to enhance training scenarios. However, the virtual simulations themselves may hinder training initiatives by inducing simulator sickness among the trainees, which is a series of symptoms similar to motion sickness that can arise from simulator use. Simulator sickness has been a problem for military aviation since the first simulators were introduced. The problem has also persisted despite the increasing fidelity and sense of immersion offered by new generations of simulators. As such, it is essential to understand the various problems so that trainers can ensure the best possible use of the simulators. This review will examine simulator sickness as it pertains to naval aviation training. Topics include: the prevailing theories on why symptoms develop, methods of measurement, contributing factors, effects on training, effects when used shipboard, aftereffects, countermeasures, and recommendations for future research involving virtual simulations in an aviation training environment.Geyer DJ, Biggs AT.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypoxia-induced elevation in pulmonary artery pressure during air travel may contribute to the worldwide burden of in-flight medical emergencies. The pulmonary artery pressure response may be greater in older passengers, who are more likely to require flight diversion due to a medical event. Understanding these effects may ultimately improve the safety of air travel. METHODS: We studied 16 healthy volunteers, consisting of a younger group (aged &lt; 25 yr) and an older group (aged &gt; 60 yr). Using a hypobaric chamber, subjects undertook a 2-h simulated flight at the maximum cabin pressure altitude for commercial airline flights (8000 ft; 2438 m). Higher and lower altitudes within the aeromedical range were also explored. Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) was assessed by Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: There was a progressive increase in sPAP which appeared to be biphasic, with a small initial increase and a larger subsequent rise. Overall, sPAP increased by 5 ± 1 mmHg from baseline to 35 ± 1 mmHg at 8000 ft, an increase of 18%. The sPAP response to 8000 ft was greater in the older group than the younger group. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that pulmonary artery pressure increases during simulated air travel, and provides preliminary evidence that this response is greater in older people. Advancing age may increase in-flight susceptibility to adverse pulmonary vascular responses in passengers, aircrew, and aeromedical patients.Turner BE, Hodkinson PD, Timperley AC, Smith TG.

The right internal jugular (IJ) vein cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured at four intervals from the submandibular to the clavicular level and IJ volume was calculated. Further measurements of the IJ vein were made after ∼26 h of 12° HDT bed rest with either ambient air or 0.5% CO2 exposure, and plasma and blood volume were assessed after 4 h, 24 h, and 28.5 h HDT.IJ vein CSA and volume increased with progressively steeper HDT angles during baseline tilt table testing, with more prominent filling of the IJ vein at levels closer to the clavicle. Exposure to 26 h of 12° HDT bed rest with or without increased CO2, however, had little additional effect on the IJ vein. Further, bed rest resulted in a decrease in plasma volume and blood volume, although changes did not depend on atmospheric conditioning or correlate directly with changes in IJ vein CSA or volume.The hydrostatic effects of HDT can be clearly determined through measurement of the IJ vein CSA and volume; however, IJ vein dimensions may not be a reliable indicator of systemic fluid status during bed rest.Marshall-Goebel K, Stevens B, Rao CV, Suarez JI, Calvillo E, Arbeille P, Sangi-Haghpeykar H, Donoviel DB, Mulder E, Bershad EM, the SPACECOT Investigators Group.

This work developed and evaluated new metrics for quantifying fit and assessed metric sensitivity to changes in padding between the human and hip brief assembly (HBA).METHODS: Three subjects donned the Mark III (MKIII) spacesuit with three padding thicknesses between the lower body and HBA. Subjects performed a walking task with inertial measurement units on the thigh and shin of both the human and suit. For each step, cadence, human knee task range of motion (tRoM), difference in human and suit tROM (ΔtRoM), and the relative coordination metric (ρ) between the human-suit femur and tibia were computed.RESULTS: The MKIII significantly reduced user cadence by 20.4% and reduced tRoM by 16.5% during walking with subject-dependent changes due to added padding. In general, the addition of padding significantly altered ΔtRoM; however, variability did exist between subjects. Mixed-effect regressions of dynamic fit (ρ) reflect distinct positive spikes in ρ around heel strike (human-dominated motion) and negative dips following toe off (suit-dominated motion).DISCUSSION: There were mixed effects of padding on gait performance and dynamic fit measures. Differences in dynamic fit between subjects may be more reliant on alternate aspects of fit, such as suit component sizes and designs, than padding level. Subjective feedback supported quantitative observations, highlighting metric utility. Future work will explore the effects of suit sizing components on measures of fit and performance.Fineman RA, McGrath TM, Kelty-Stephen DG, Abercromby AFJ, Stirling LA.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mental fatigue and sleepiness are well recognized determinants of human-error related accidents and incidents in aviation. In Brazil, according to the Center for Investigation and Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents (CENIPA), the rate of accidents in the aerial modal is 1 per 2 d. Human factors are present in 90% of these accidents.CASE REPORT: This paper describes a retrospective study of the communication between a pilot and an air traffic control tower just before a fatal accident. The objective was the detection of fatigue and sleepiness of a pilot, who complained of these signs and symptoms before the flight, by means of voice and speech analysis. The in-depth accident analysis performed by CENIPA indicated that sleepiness and fatigue most likely contributed to the accident. Speech samples were analyzed for two conditions: 1) nonsleepy data recorded 35 h before the air crash (control condition), which were compared with 2) data from samples collected about 1 h before the accident and also during the disaster (sleepy condition). Audio recording analyses provided objective measures of the temporal organization of speech, such as hesitations, silent pauses, prolongation of final syllables, and syllable articulation rate.DISCUSSION: The results showed that speech during the day of the accident had significantly low elocution and articulation rates compared to the preceding day, also indicating that the methodology adopted in this study is feasible for detection of fatigue and sleepiness through speech analysis.de Vasconcelos CA, Vieira MN, Kecklund G, Yehia HC.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Loss-of-control (LOC) is the major cause of transport airplane mishaps. There have been many published reports and papers examining these accidents. While these studies did mention spatial disorientation (SD) as a cause or a factor, none of them analyzed it further. The present study uses transport and commuter airplane mishap data for a recent 35-yr period and examines the results of those mishaps involving spatial disorientation. METHOD: We identified LOC and SD accidents from five national aviation accident organizations and two independent groups. Only “normal” operations (air carrier, noncommercial transportation, ferry flights, and training) were considered. We reviewed transport and commuter airplane accidents using the published reports and identified 94 involving SD. RESULTS: We found the distribution of SD mishaps differs from LOC mishaps. During initial climb, there were relatively fewer SD mishaps (16%) than LOC mishaps (31%). During enroute climb SD has relatively more mishaps (18%) than LOC (11%). During go-around or missed approach phases, there were relatively more SD mishaps (21%) than LOC mishaps (4%). Perhaps the most significant observation was an increasing number of SD mishaps during the period reviewed. DISCUSSION: There are several possible reasons for the increasing numbers of SD mishaps over the study period from 1981 to 2016. Somatogravic illusion during go-around or missed approach accounts for only some of this increase. There is insufficient data to determine the reason for the remaining increase. Newman RL, Rupert AH.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Environmental and operational stressors commonly encountered in spaceflight can affect astronaut cognitive performance. It is currently unclear how performance decrements on test batteries that assess individual cognitive domains translate to complex operational performance.METHODS:N 30 healthy adults (mean SD age 33.5 7.1 yr, range 2548 yr; 16 men) with demographic characteristics similar to astronauts performed all 10 tests of the Cognition test battery as well as a simulated 6 degrees-of-freedom (6df) spacecraft docking task 15 times. Performance on 60 Cognition outcome variables was rank-correlated with 6df docking performance individually as well as in models containing up to 12 predictors after accounting for sex, age, and study design effects.RESULTS: Average response time on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)a measure of processing speed requiring complex scanning, visual tracking, and working memorywas the best individual predictor of 6df docking performance (unadjusted r 0.550; semipartial cross-validated R² 0.244). Furthermore, higher levels of spatial orientation efficiency and vigilant attention, lower levels of impulsivity, and faster response speed were associated with higher 6df performance, while sensorimotor speed, memory, and risk decision making were less relevant. After semipartial cross-validation, a model with three Cognition outcomes (DSST average response time, Abstract Matching accuracy, and conservative response bias on the Fractal 2-Back test) explained 30% of the variance in 6df performance.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates direct links between performance on tests designed to assess specific cognitive domains and complex operational docking performance.Basner M, Moore TM, Hermosillo E, Nasrini J, Dinges DF, Gur RC, Johannes B.

Pilots and passengers are already using these technologies, but their performance has not yet been established under conditions experienced in the flight environment such as environmental hypoxia and concurrent body motion. METHODS: An initial evaluation was conducted in 10 healthy subjects who were studied in a normobaric chamber during normoxia and at a simulated altitude of 15,000 ft (4572 m; 11.8% oxygen). S p o 2 was measured simultaneously using a standard pulse oximeter and four wearable devices: Apple Watch Series 6; Garmin Fēnix 6 watch; Cosinuss o Two in-ear sensor; and Oxitone 1000M wrist-worn pulse oximeter. Measurements were made while stationary at rest, during very slight body motion (induced by very low intensity cycling at 30 W on an ergometer), and during moderate body motion (induced by moderate intensity cycling at 150 W). RESULTS: Missed readings, defined as failure to record an S p o 2 value within 1 min, occurred commonly with all wearables. Even with only very slight body motion, most devices missed most readings (range of 12–82% missed readings) and the rate was higher with greater body motion (range 18–92%). One device tended to under-report S p o 2 , while the other devices tended to over-report S p o 2 . Performance decreased across the devices when oxygenation was reduced. DISCUSSION: In this preliminary evaluation, the wearable devices studied did not perform to the same standard as a traditional pulse oximeter. These limitations may restrict their utility in flight and require further investigation. Hearn EL, Byford J, Wolfe C, Agyei C, Hodkinson PD, Pollock RD, Smith TG.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prolonged exposure to microgravity is associated with a significant reduction in bone density, exposing astronauts to renal calculi in flight and osteoporotic fractures on return to Earth. While physical countermeasures and bisphosphonates may reduce demineralization, additional therapies are needed for future interplanetary missions. This literature review aims to understand the current background pertaining to denosumab (a monoclonal antibody therapy used in osteoporosis) and its potential use for long duration spaceflight. METHOD: A literature review was conducted using the following keywords: “osteoporosis”; “osteopaenia”; “microgravity”; “space flight”; “bed rest”; “denosumab”; “alendronate”; “bisphosphonates”; and “countermeasures”. Additional articles were identified through references. Included for discussion were 48 articles, including systemic reviews, clinical trials, practice guidelines, and textbooks. RESULTS: No previous bed rest or in-flight studies regarding denosumab were identified. In osteoporosis, denosumab is superior to alendronate in maintaining bone density with a lower rate of side-effects. Emerging evidence in reduced biomechanical loading state suggests denosumab improves bone density and decreases fracture risk. Concerns exists over vertebral fracture risk following discontinuation. The dosing regimen of denosumab offers practical advantages over bisphosphonates. Existing spaceflight studies with alendronate serve as a template for a study with denosumab and allow for a direct comparison of efficacy and safety. DISCUSSION: Denosumab has numerous potential advantages as a countermeasure to microgravity-induced osteopenia when compared to alendronate, including: improved efficacy; fewer side-effects: better tolerability; and a convenient dosing regimen. Two further studies are proposed to determine in-flight efficacy and the suitability of monoclonal antibody therapy in the spaceflight environment. Rengel A, Tran V, Toh LS.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Night vision goggles (NVG) are linked to increased neck muscle activation and pain. Counterweights (NVGcw) are hypothesized to mitigate these effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the muscular response to varying helmet loads and postures. METHODS: Volunteering from a representative squadron were 16 male helicopter aviators (pilots, N = 9; flight engineers, N = 7). Subjects performed head movements to assume nine different postures (three directions: left, center, and right, at three different levels: down, level, and up) with four different head loads (no helmet; helmet only; NVG; and NVGcw) in randomized order. Subjects were provided real time visual guidance and feedback while assuming the appropriate posture in a cockpit seat in a laboratory setting. Neck muscle activation was assessed with electromyography (EMG) of four different muscle groups, bilaterally, including the sternocleidomastoid, splenius capitis, and mid and lower trapezius. RESULTS: Two- to fourfold increases in muscle activation were observed in postures to the left (down, level, and up) while subjects wore either the NVG or NVGcw as compared to the baseline of no helmet. This was most prevalent in smaller muscle groups (i.e., the sternocleidomastoid and splenius capitis) as compared to larger muscle groups (i.e., the mid and lower trapezius). DISCUSSION: The use of NVGcw did not decrease neck muscle activity as compared to NVG only, particularly when the head posture moved the field of view below the horizon. This suggests interventions to decrease neck muscle activity and fatigue in military helicopter aircrew using NVG should focus on task specific guidelines with respect to countermeasures.Harrison MF, Forde KA, Albert WJ, Croll JC, Neary JP.

The experimental manipulation consisted of a set of five core strengthening exercises performed 4 d/wk for 12 wk. Self-reported pain severity and disability were ascertained at baseline and 12 wk using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) and Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (MODI), respectively. The NPRS was used to ascertain both daily pain (NPRS(daily)) and in-flight pain (NPRS(flight)). Self-reported improvement or deterioration in low back pain was measured using the Global Rating of Change Scale (GRCS).There were 12 subjects enrolled and 5 were randomized to the intervention group. The mean NPRS(flight) score decreased 1.8 points vs. increasing 0.1 points during the trial for the intervention and control groups, respectively. The mean MODI score decreased 4.8 points vs. increasing 1.7 points during the trial for the intervention and control groups, respectively. The mean GRCS score at the end of the trial was 4.0 vs. 0 for the intervention and control groups, respectively. There was no difference between groups in terms of mean NPRS(daily) scores.Core strengthening exercises were effective in reducing in-flight pain and led to a reduction in pain symptoms and disability over the 12-wk study period as compared to those subjects who maintained their regular exercise regimen.",

METHODS: Studied pre/post and over the 2-yr period of the investigation were 10 Danish military personnel deployed to stations in Greenland on a 26-mo staggered rotation. Subjects completed the NEO PI-R, Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, and Portrait Values Questionnaire, and participated in structured interviews. During deployment, questionnaires were completed biweekly and a cognitive function test once a month. RESULTS: Personality findings indicated a generally well-adjusted group, above average in positive personality traits [Conscientiousness T-score = 59.4 (11.41); Agreeableness T-score = 54.4 (9.36)] and boldness. Personal values of benevolence and self-direction were highly rated. The decision when to “pick sides” and intervene during disagreements between group members was viewed as an important component of conflict resolution. There were no changes in positive/negative affect or cognitive function over the annual light/dark cycle. DISCUSSION: The personal values of group members appear highly compatible for living in a small group ICE environment for an extended period. Disagreements between group members impact the functioning of the entire group, particularly in regard to decisions whether to support one of the individuals or let the argument run its course.

Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the effects of 24-h sleep deprivation on mood, fatigue, and airline pilot competencies. METHODS: Seven subjects attended two 24-h testing periods, one with an 8-h sleep opportunity, and the other with no sleep opportunity (i.e., sleep deprivation). Subjects were required to complete a battery of mood, fatigue, and analogue measures of pilot competency tasks every 8 h (0 h, 8 h, 16 h, 24 h) throughout each testing period. RESULTS: While total mood disturbance was found to significantly increase (83.42, SD = 25.7), both objective (352.71, SD = 42.00) and subjective (34.85, SD = 8.82) fatigue were found to significantly decrease following 24-h sleep deprivation. Cognitive flexibility (757.45, SD = 58.48) and hand-eye coordination (dominant hand only) (60.28, SD = 3.86) were also negatively impacted following 24-h sleep deprivation. However, working memory and situation awareness were not significantly negatively impacted by the bout of sleep deprivation. DISCUSSION: Some pilot-specific task-related factors such as subjective fatigue, cognitive flexibility, and working memory were found to be particularly susceptible to sleep loss, with significant declines in performance observed following 16-h continuous wakefulness, suggesting reductions in optimal functioning following this period of wakefulness. Further investigation using more regular testing time points, employing additional pilot competencies, and using more aviation-specific tasks is warranted.

Across each flight, crewmembers rated their fatigue (Samn-Perelli Crew Status Check) and sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) and completed a 5-min Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) at key times.Of crewmembers approached, 73% (N=134) agreed to participate and 41% (N=55) provided data of suitable quality for analysis. In the 24 h before departure, sleep averaged 7.0 h and 40% took a preflight nap. All crewmembers slept in flight (mean total sleep time=3.6 h outbound, 2.9 h inbound). Sleepiness and fatigue were lower, and performance better, on the longer outbound flight than on the inbound flight. Post-trip, crewmembers slept more on day 1 (mean=7.9 h) compared to baseline days, but there was no difference from day 2 onwards.The present study demonstrates that cabin crew fatigue can be managed effectively on a ULR flight and that FRMS data collection is feasible for cabin crew, but operational differences between cabin crew and flight crew need to be considered.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Passenger air transport has considerably increased in the past 50 yr. It is estimated that between 7 and 40% of the population of industrialized countries is currently afraid of flying. Programs treating the fear of flying have been developed to meet this problem. This study measures the effectiveness of one of these programs by focusing on flight-related anxiety before the program and after the first flight following the intervention. METHODS: There were 157 individuals recruited to participate in a 1-d intervention aiming at treating the fear of flying, and using both cognitive behavioral techniques and virtual reality. Anxiety was measured with the Flight Anxiety Situations (FAS) and the Flight Anxiety Modality (FAM) questionnaires. RESULTS: Statistical analyses were conducted on 145 subjects (69.7% female; ages from 14 to 64) after the exclusion of individuals with missing data. The results showed a decrease in flight-related anxiety for each subscale of the two questionnaires: the somatic (d = 2.44) and cognitive anxiety (d = 1.47) subscales of the FAM, and the general flight anxiety (d = 3.20), the anticipatory flight anxiety (d = 1.74), and the in-flight anxiety (d = 1.04) subscales of the FAS. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the treatment program using both cognitive behavioral techniques and virtual reality strategies for fear of flying reduced flight-related anxiety in the subjects in our study.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Long-duration spaceflight missions lead to the loss of muscle strength and endurance. Significant reduction in muscle function can be hazardous when returning from spaceflight. To document these losses, NASA developed medical requirements that include measures of functional strength and endurance. Results from this Functional Fitness Test (FFT) battery are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of in-flight exercise countermeasures. The purpose of this paper is to document results from the FFT and correlate this information with performance of in-flight exercise on board the International Space Station. METHODS : The FFT evaluates muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and agility and includes the following eight measures: sit and reach, cone agility, push-ups, pull-ups, sliding crunches, bench press, leg press, and hand grip dynamometry. Pre- to postflight functional fitness measurements were analyzed using dependent t -tests and correlation analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between functional fitness measurements and in-flight exercise workouts. RESULTS : Significant differences were noted postspaceflight with the sit and reach, cone agility, leg press, and hand grip measurements while other test scores were not significantly altered. The relationships between functional fitness and in-flight exercise measurements showed minimal to moderate correlations for most in-flight exercise training variables. DISCUSSION : The change in FFT results can be partially explained by in-flight exercise performance. Although there are losses documented in the FFT results, it is important to realize that the crewmembers are successfully performing activities of daily living and are considered functional for normal activities upon return to Earth.Laughlin MS, Guilliams ME, Nieschwitz BA, Hoellen D.

    "abstract": "Neck and back pain in fighter pilots remains a serious occupational problem. We hypothesized that recent advances such as the joint helmet mounted cueing system (JHMCS) in modern air combat might contribute to the development of spinal complaints in F-16 pilots.Surveyed were 59 F-16 pilots of the Royal Netherlands Air Force who were compared to 49 F-16 pilots who filled in a similar questionnaire in 2007. The prevalence of neck and back pain, work situations, and capacity of the pilot were analyzed.The self-reported 1-yr prevalence of regular or continuous neck and lower back pain in 2014 were 22% and 31%, respectively, compared to both being 12% in 2007. Age, military flying experience, total number of flying hours, flying hours on the F-16, and total number of hours flown with night vision goggles (NVG) were significantly higher in 2014. In 2014, 95% flew with JHMCS, compared to 0% in 2007. Flying with JHMCS (88%), NVG (88%), type of flight (63%), and sitting posture (50%) were the most reported causes of flight-related neck pain. Sitting posture (89%), duration of flight (56%), and seat (44%) were among the reported causes of back pain.The increasing trend of neck and lower back pain might be caused by multiple changes in both the work situation and capacity of the pilots since 2007. Future innovations will increase the load on the pilot's spine. To successfully address their spinal problems in the future, fighter pilots must be monitored continuously.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Interactions between frequency and amplitude of latency in head-mounted displays (HMDs) are thought to affect simulator sickness. Many studies have linked system latency to subjective sickness, but recent research has found that at least with the case of inertia-based head tracking technology, latency is not a constant; rather it varies systematically over time due to sensor errors and clock asynchronization. The purpose of this experiment was to further explore the relationship between frequency and amplitude of latency as they relate to subjective sickness experienced in an HMD. METHODS: In a 2 (frequency) × 2 (amplitude) design, 120 subjects were randomly assigned to 4 latency conditions. Frequency of latency was either 0.2 Hz or 1.0 Hz. Amplitude of latency was either 100 ms fixed or 20-100 ms varying. RESULTS: A main effect of frequency of latency was found. Subjects reported greater sickness in the 0.2-Hz frequency conditions (39.0 ± 27.8) compared to the 1-Hz conditions (30.3 ± 17.0). Additionally, 18 subjects withdrew their participation early in the 0.2-Hz conditions compared to 7 in the 1.0-Hz conditions. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, frequency of latency appears to play a role in the experience of sickness in HMDs in both subjective reporting of symptoms and subject performance. The current study confirms results of earlier studies, finding that real motion around a frequency of 0.2 Hz is more sickening than other frequencies. Future work should continue to parse the effects of frequency and amplitude of latency in head-tracked HMDs.Kinsella A, Mattfeld R, Muth E, Hoover A.

This study assessed the effect of sunlight exposure, work hours, and caffeinated beverage consumption on the daily sleep duration of crewmembers of a U.S. Navy ship during a 2-wk underway period.Working in an artificially lit area with no access to sunlight during work hours, U.S. Navy crew members (N = 91) used daily logs to report their daily activity, caffeinated beverage consumption, and exposure to sunlight while off-duty; sleep was assessed by wrist-worn actigraphy.Hours of sunlight exposure, work duration, and the amount of coffee/tea/soft drinks were statistically significant predictors of sleep duration. On average, crewmembers who reported more than one half-hour of sunlight each day slept on average ∼40 min (10%) less than their peers working the same shifts who received less than one half-hour of sunlight (on average 6.05 ± 0.90 h vs. 6.71 ± 0.91 h, respectively).Exposure to sunlight, work hours, and consumption of caffeinated beverages are important factors when planning watchstanding schedules at sea. Even though further research is needed, our results suggest that even brief exposure to sunlight may contribute to circadian misalignment that negatively affects sleep in the operational environment. Educating crewmembers about sleep hygiene, especially the important roles played by sunlight and caffeine, could potentially improve the sleep and fatigue levels of this population of maritime shiftworkers.Shattuck NL, Matsangas P.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In commercial spaceflight, anxiety could become mission-impacting, causing negative experiences or endangering the flight itself. We studied layperson response to four varied-length training programs (ranging from 1 h–2 d of preparation) prior to centrifuge simulation of launch and re-entry acceleration profiles expected during suborbital spaceflight. We examined subject task execution, evaluating performance in high-stress conditions. We sought to identify any trends in demographics, hemodynamics, or similar factors in subjects with the highest anxiety or poorest tolerance of the experience. METHODS: Volunteers participated in one of four centrifuge training programs of varied complexity and duration, culminating in two simulated suborbital spaceflights. At most, subjects underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d, including two +G z runs (peak +3.5 G z , Run 2) and two +G x runs (peak +6.0 G x , Run 4) followed by three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G x and +G z , peak +6.0 G x and +4.0 G z ). Two cohorts also received dedicated anxiety-mitigation training. Subjects were evaluated on their performance on various tasks, including a simulated emergency. RESULTS: Participating in 2–7 centrifuge exposures were 148 subjects (105 men, 43 women, age range 19-72 yr, mean 39.4 ± 13.2 yr, body mass index range 17.3–38.1, mean 25.1 ± 3.7). There were 10 subjects who withdrew or limited their G exposure; history of motion sickness was associated with opting out. Shorter length training programs were associated with elevated hemodynamic responses. Single-directional G training did not significantly improve tolerance. DISCUSSION: Training programs appear best when high fidelity and sequential exposures may improve tolerance of physical/psychological flight stressors. The studied variables did not predict anxiety-related responses to these centrifuge profiles.Blue RS, Bonato F, Seaton K, Bubka A, Vardiman JL, Mathers C, Castleberry TL, Vanderploeg JM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Back pain is a common complaint during spaceflight that is commonly attributed to intervertebral disc swelling in microgravity. Ultrasound (US) represents the only imaging modality on the International Space Station (ISS) to assess its etiology. The present study investigated: 1) The agreement and correlation of spinal US assessments as compared to results of pre- and postflight MRI studies; and 2) the trend in intervertebral disc characteristics over the course of spaceflight to ISS. METHODS: Seven ISS astronauts underwent pre- and postflight US examinations that included anterior disc height and anterior intervertebral angles with comparison to pre- and postflight MRI results. In-flight US images were analyzed for changes in disc height and angle. Statistical analysis included repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis, Bland-Altman plots, and Pearson correlation. RESULTS: Bland-Altman plots revealed significant disagreement between disc heights and angles for MRI and US measurements while significant Pearson correlations were found in MRI and US measurements for lumbar disc height (r 2 = 0.83) and angle (r 2 = 0.89), but not for cervical disc height (r 2 = 0.26) or angle (r 2 = 0.02). Changes in anterior intervertebral disc angle—initially increases followed by decreases—were observed in the lumbar and cervical spine over the course of the long-duration mission. The cervical spine demonstrated a loss of total disc height during in-flight assessments (∼0.5 cm). DISCUSSION: Significant disagreement but significant correlation was noted between US and MRI measurements of disc height and angle. Consistency in imaging modality is important for trending measurements and more research related to US technique is required.Harrison MF, Garcia KM, Sargsyan AE, Ebert D, Riascos-Castaneda RF, Dulchavsky SA.

Each RSAF aircrew member must undergo a ground test to exclude operationally relevant adverse drug effects prior to consuming the medication for operational reasons. This study describes the RSAF’s modafinil ground testing outcomes over a 7-yr period. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of 243 RSAF aircrew members who underwent modafinil 100-mg test dosing over the 7-yr period from September 2011 to September 2018. RESULTS: The median age was 31 yr (range, 21–53 yr) and mean age was 31.7 yr ± 6.19 yr. Of the aircrew members, 234 (96.3%) were men and all were of Asian ethnicity. Of the subjects, 237 (97.5%) were medically cleared for the operational use of modafinil. Among the six (2.47%) who failed modafinil ground testing, headache (cumulative incidence, 1.65%), anxiety (cumulative incidence, 0.41%), diarrhea (cumulative incidence, 0.41%), and insomnia (cumulative incidence, 0.41%) were reported as the side effects experienced. None of the aircrew members experienced major adverse drug events. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest a low occurrence of adverse drug effects among military aircrew members who undergo modafinil test dosing prior to using the drug operationally.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim was to study quadriceps muscle activation during resistance exercise using a flywheel device, developed as a gravity-independent resistance exercise device to be used during spaceflight, compared with traditional strength training exercises.METHODS: Eight healthy men experienced in resistance exercise performed the following exercises in random order: flywheel leg press (FW), knee extension isokinetic dynamometry (ID), barbell front squat (FS), weight stack leg press (LP), and weight stack knee extension (KE). They accomplished eight repetitions of coupled concentric and eccentric actions with simultaneous recordings of surface electromyography (EMG) from the three superficial quadriceps muscles and knee angles using electrogoniometry. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in knee extension was performed before and after these measurements.RESULTS: EMG averaged across muscles and angles and normalized to MVC was 99/76% in FW, 48/41% FS, 65/47% LP, 81/52% KE, and 93/84% ID in concentric/eccentric phases, respectively. FW and ID showed higher mean EMG activity than LP and FS concentrically and higher than all other exercises eccentrically. No difference in activity between FW and ID was found. Pre- and post-MVC torque was comparable.DISCUSSION: Quadriceps muscle activation was superior in FW and ID exercises compared to the other exercises. The difference was most pronounced in the eccentric phase, but even concentric activation was lower in traditional closed chain exercises. This data supports that FW is an effective training tool and should be considered when designing strength training programs for spaceflights and on Earth.Alkner BA, Bring DK-I.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Increased white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans of high altitude aircrew and altitude chamber workers indicate that exposure to low ambient pressure (hypobaria) promotes white matter injury. If associated with frequent decompression stress then experienced divers should also exhibit more WMH, yet published case-control studies are inconsistent. This meta-analysis evaluated the prevalence of WMH in healthy divers and controls. METHODS: Eligible studies compared experienced divers (or hyperbaric workers) without neurological decompression illness with nondiving controls, identified from multiple database searches and reference list reviews. Studies were scored for sample size, recruitment bias, control matching, MRI sensitivity, and confounding factors before grading as low, medium, or high quality. Meta-analysis of odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was conducted on all data using a random effects model and repeated after exclusion of low-quality studies. RESULTS: There were 11 eligible studies identified. After data adjustment to exclude diving accidents, these encompassed 410 divers and 339 controls, of which 136 (33%) and 79 (23%), respectively, exhibited WMH (OR 1.925, 95% CI 1.088 to 3.405). Excluding four low-quality studies eliminated meta-analysis heterogeneity, with 98 of 279 divers (35%) and 44 of 232 controls (19%) exhibiting WMH (OR 2.654, 95% CI 1.718 to 4.102). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that repeated hyperbaric exposure increases the prevalence of white matter injury in experienced healthy divers without neurological decompression illness. This is consistent with reports of increased WMH in asymptomatic altitude workers and an association with intensity of dysbaric exposure.Connolly DM, Lee VM.

The aim of this pilot study was to analyze the temperature distribution in masticatory and upper trapezius muscles in a sample of bruxist air force pilots, to evaluate whether an occlusal splint would be able to induce skin temperature variations in the stomatognathic apparatus using the technology of infrared thermography.A total of 11 male Italian Air Force pilots of high performance aircraft, ages from 27 to 40 yr (mean 34.91 ± 2.15 yr) with 1000-3000 flight hours, were enrolled in the study and analyzed using an infrared camera in order to evaluate the temperature of the masticatory muscles. All the recordings were taken on each subject using the same protocol with and without a temporary occlusal splint.The occlusal splint statistically increased each muscle temperature (0.10-0.20°C) on both the sides of the body. No statistically significant differences were found between the left and right muscles (asymmetries) before or after the wearing of the splint except for the anterior temporalis muscle. No significant improvement or variations in temperature symmetry of this muscle was found after the application of the splint.The use of an occlusal splint could help in increasing muscles temperatures in Air Force pilots with consequent relaxation of their facial muscular system.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A number of ophthalmic abnormalities, including optic disc edema, have been reported in several astronauts involved in long-duration spaceflights. An increased understanding of factors contributing to this syndrome, initially designated visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome and recently renamed spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, has become a high priority for ESA and NASA, especially in view of future long-duration missions, including trips to Mars. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome are still not well understood. In the present paper, we propose that optic disc edema in astronauts may occur, at least in part, as a result of retention of interstitial fluid in distended paravascular spaces at the prelaminar region of the optic nerve head. Preflight, in-flight, and postflight analysis of the optic nerve head and surrounding structures by optical coherence tomography in long-duration International Space Station crewmembers could provide important structural information in this respect.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recently, portable dry electroencephalographs (dry-EEGs) have indexed cognitive workload, fatigue, and drowsiness in operational environments. Using this technology this project assessed whether significant changes in brainwave frequency power occurred in response to hypoxic exposures as experienced in military aviation. METHODS: There were 60 (30 women, 30 men) student Naval Aviators or Flight Officers who were exposed to an intense (acute) high-altitude (25,000 ft) normobaric hypoxic exposure, and 20 min later, more gradual (insidious) normobaric hypoxic exposure up to 20,000 ft while flying a fixed-wing flight simulation and monitored with a dry-EEG system. Using MATLAB, EEG frequencies and power were quantified and analyzed. Cognitive performance was also assessed with a cognitive task validated under hypoxia. Normobaric hypoxia and O 2 saturation (Sp o 2 ) were produced and monitored using the Reduced Oxygen Breathing Device (ROBD2). RESULTS: Significant Sp o 2 decreases were recorded at acute 25K and insidious 20K simulated altitudes. Significant power decreases were recorded in all frequencies (alpha, beta, gamma, and theta) and all channels with acute 25K exposures. Gamma, beta, and theta frequency power were significantly decreased with insidious 20K exposures at most of the channels. The frequency power decreases corresponded to significant decreases in cognitive performance and flight performance. Most importantly, frequency power suppressions occurred despite 42% of the volunteers not perceiving they were hypoxic in the acute phase, nor 20% in the insidious phase. DISCUSSION: Results suggest EEG suppression during acute/insidious hypoxia can index performance decrements. These findings have promising implications in the development of biosensors that mitigate potential in-flight hypoxic physiological episodes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Circulating blood volume (BV) and maximal oxygen uptake (Vo 2max ) are physiological characteristics important for optimal human performance in aerospace and military operational environments. We tested the hypothesis that BV and Vo 2max are lower in older people independent of sex. METHODS: To accomplish this, a “data mining” effort of an historic database generated from NASA and U.S. Air Force experiments was conducted. BV, red cell volume, plasma volume, hematocrit, and Vo 2max were measured in 84 healthy individuals (24 women, 60 men) across an age range of 23 to 65 yr to assess the interrelationship between sex, age, BV, and Vo 2max . Subjects were classified in age groups by &lt; 40 yr and ≥ 40 yr; these groups identified women as pre- vs. postmenopausal. RESULTS: Consistent with our hypothesis, comparisons revealed that men had higher BV, red cell volume, hematocrit, and Vo 2max than women when standardized for body mass. Against expectations, BV was not different in older compared with younger men and women. Vo 2max was not different in older compared with younger women, while Vo 2max was lower in older men. CONCLUSION: We conclude that physiological mechanisms other than BV associated with aging appear to be responsible for a decline in Vo 2max of our older men. Furthermore, factors other than menopause may also influence the control of BV in the women. Our results provide evidence that aging may not compromise men or women in scenarios where BV can affect performance in aerospace and military environments.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The visual scanning techniques used by helicopter pilots are a critical skill to accomplish safe and correct landing. According to the human information processing theory, visual scanning techniques can be analyzed as a function of fixation location, number, and duration of fixations. METHODS: This study assessed these techniques in expert and novice pilots during an open sea flight simulation in a low-workload condition, consisting of a daylight and good weather simulation, and in a high-workload condition of night-time, low visibility, and adverse weather conditions. Taking part in the study were 12 helicopter pilots. Mental workload was assessed through psychological measures (NASA-TLX). The pilots performance was assessed and eye movements were recorded using an eye-tracker during four phases of the flight simulations. RESULTS: Overall, pilots made more fixations out of the window (OTW; 22.54) than inside the cockpit (ITC; 11.08), Fixations were longer OTW (830.17 ms) than ITC (647.97 ms) and they were shorter in the low-demand condition (626.27 ms). Further, pilots reported higher mental workload (NASA-TLX) in the high-demand condition compared to the low-demand condition, regardless of their expertise, and expert pilots reported a lower mental workload compared to novice pilots. DISCUSSION: Pilots performance and perceived mental workload varied as a function of expertise and flight conditions. Pilots rely on instrument support during the cruise phase and external visual cues during the landing phase. The implications for a new visual landing system design are discussed.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite the clear need for understanding how pilot sleep affects performance during long-range (LR; 12-16h) and ultra-long-range (ULR; 16+h) flights, the scientific literature on the effects of sleep loss and circadian desynchronization on pilots’ sleep in commercial aviation is sparse. METHODS: We assessed pilots’ sleep timing, duration, and post-trip recovery on two LR and two ULR nonstop California to Australasia routes. Pilot’s sleep/wake history was measured with actigraphy and verified by logbook across 8–9 d. RESULTS: Pilots averaged 8.210 ± 1.687 SD hours of sleep per 24 h across the study period. A logistic model of the circadian timing of sleep indicated that time of day and phase of trip are significant predictors of pilots being asleep. Significant two- and three-way interactions were found between time of day, phase of trip, and route. A significant difference in average sleep time was observed between baseline and recovery day 1 for one route. All other recovery days and routes were not significantly different from baseline. DISCUSSION: For the four routes, the average amount of sleep per 24-h period during the study period was within the normal range with the circadian rhythm aligned to home-base time pre- and post-trip. Flight segments and layover conditions were associated with a misalignment of sleep relative to circadian rhythm, with layover sleep appearing to shift toward the local night. Full post-trip sleep duration recovery appears to occur for all routes within 1–2 d. Lamp A, McCullough D, Chen JMC, Brown RE, Belenky G.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During flight, fast jet pilots frequently move their heads into extreme positions while withstanding large amounts of stress on their cervical spines. These factors are thought to contribute to episodes of neck pain.METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of previous neck pain prevalence data in fast jet pilots to determine an overall pooled prevalence. Subgroup analyses were performed according to when pilots complained about their neck pain, whether these same pilots sought treatment, and if they lost time from flying. Four research databases were searched. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were written in English, involved a group of fast jet pilots who were actively flying high performance aircraft, and reported quantitative prevalence data about neck pain in these pilots. These eligibility criteria were independently applied by two reviewers and risk of bias was evaluated. MetaXL software was used to conduct the meta-analysis.RESULTS: In total, 8003 fast jet pilots across 18 eligible studies were included in the review. The overall pooled prevalence of neck pain in fast jet pilots was 51%. It was found that 39% of subjects lost time from flying, while only 32% sought medical treatment.DISCUSSION: Neck pain in fast jet pilots adversely affects operational capabilities of defense forces. The prevalence of neck pain varies according to the definitions or thresholds of complaints used across the literature.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of the astronauts who spend extended periods in microgravity develop ophthalmic abnormalities, including optic disc edema, optic nerve sheath distention, globe flattening, chorioretinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts. A constellation of these neuro-ophthalmic findings has been termed spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome. An increased understanding of factors contributing to this syndrome is one of the top priorities for ESA and NASA because the length of missions is expected to increase substantially in the future. As discussed in the present article, the very recent discovery of an ocular glymphatic clearance system can potentially help to unlock mechanisms underlying microgravity-induced optic disc edema. Observations pertaining to the ocular glymphatic pathway provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis, originally proposed by our group, suggesting that the glymphatic outflow from the eye into the optic nerve may be impeded under prolonged microgravity conditions, leading to optic disc edema.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Isolated and confined environments (ICEs), such as spaceflight, are challenging psychologically. We have been evaluating self-directed tools to sustain and improve psychological well-being in these settings. The Expedition Application for Peak Psychological Performance (Expedition-APPP) is an interactive media-based set of self-directed tools that address conflict resolution, stress management, and depression treatment. Virtual reality (VR) of nature scenes is a tool to improve attention and relieve stress by providing users with an immersive nature experience. We evaluated both Expedition-APPP and VR in an ICE. METHODS: The Expedition-APP was evaluated during three, and nature VR during two, deployments at the HI-SEAS habitat, where crews of six were isolated for 812 mo. Participants used both the Expedition-APPP and VR and shared their feedback and experiences after the deployments in semistructured interviews. These interviews were evaluated using qualitative analysis techniques to gather generalizable insights into implementing autonomous mental health programs for people living and working in ICEs. RESULTS: Expedition-APPP modules provided a shared culture, language, and tools for working through challenges. VR allowed for access to emotions and experiences that were unavailable in the habitat. Suggestions for improvement included making refresher training easily available and providing a wider range of content to address different individuals coping styles. DISCUSSION: Both the Expedition-APPP and VR were appreciated and used, although a wider range of content and experiences was desired by participants.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Optic disc edema has been well documented in astronauts both during and after long-duration spaceflight and is hypothesized to largely result from increased pressure within the orbital subarachnoid space brought about by a generalized rise in intracranial pressure or from sequestration of cerebrospinal fluid within the orbital subarachnoid space with locally elevated optic nerve sheath pressure. In addition, a recent prospective study documented substantial spaceflight-associated peripapillary choroidal thickening, which may be a contributing factor in spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome. In the present article, based on the above, we offer a new perspective on the pathogenesis of microgravity-induced optic disc edema from a choroidal point of view. We propose that prolonged microgravity exposure may result in the transudation of fluid from the choroidal vasculature, which, in turn, may reach the optic nerve head, and ultimately may lead to fluid stasis within the prelaminar region secondary to impaired ocular glymphatic outflow. If confirmed, this viewpoint would shed new light on the development of optic disc edema in astronauts.Wostyn P, Gibson CR, Mader TH. Optic disc edema in astronauts from a choroidal point of view.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pilots’ mental health has received increased attention following Germanwings Flight 9525 in 2015, where the copilot intentionally crashed the aircraft into the French Alps, killing all on board. An investigation of this incident found that the pilot had a depressive disorder. METHODS: This systematic review investigated peer reviewed studies of pilot mental health published since 1980. A total of 58 papers were identified. RESULTS: Two main methodologies have been employed: questionnaires and database record searches. Anxiety, depression, and suicide were the most commonly investigated mental health conditions. There were almost an equal number of studies that found a higher prevalence of psychological symptoms in pilots as those that found a lower prevalence, relative to controls or the general population. Prevalence rates were higher in studies relying solely on questionnaires than in studies employing database record searches. DISCUSSION: Prevalence estimates are closely associated with methodology, so it is difficult to determine the true rate. Factors that might account for low prevalence estimates include under-reporting of symptoms by pilots and a reluctance to diagnose on the part of health professionals. Factors that might account for high prevalence estimates include anonymous assessment, the use of questionnaires that do not align with clinical disorders, and inconsistent cut-off scores. It is recommended that future studies on prevalence use well-validated clinical measures, and that more research be conducted on the effects of particular disorders on job performance.

The 1975 NASA Ames Design Study on Space Settlements demonstrated how human physiology constrains and determines human habitat design in space. Our scientific understanding about the risks of and standards for microgravity (and rotation rate if centrifugally generated), ionizing radiation, and atmosphere pressure and composition, remains inadequate a half century later. In addition, there are newly recognized physiological challenges to living safely in space, including spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), extravascular hemolytic anemia, and other factors that affect every human cell and organ system. A comprehensive review was conducted to establish what we have learned and what is still required to know about the pathophysiology of long-term space travel and living in space since my first report in 1978.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internal jugular vein (IJV) congestion occurs during spaceflight. Historically, IJV distension on the International Space Station (ISS) has been quantified using single slice cross-sectional images from conventional 2D ultrasound with remote guidance. Importantly, the IJV is an irregular shape and highly compressible. Consequently, conventional imaging is susceptible to poor reproducibility due to inconsistent positioning, insonation angle, and hold-down pressure, especially when controlled by novice sonographers (i.e., astronauts). Recently, a motorized 3D ultrasound was launched to the ISS that mitigates angulation errors and has a larger design, allowing for more consistent hold-down pressure and positioning. This short communication compares IJV congestion measured with 2D vs. 3D methods during spaceflight. METHODS: IJV was measured prior to and following a 4-h venoconstrictive thigh cuff countermeasure. Data were acquired from three astronauts approximately halfway through their 6-mo missions. RESULTS: The 2D and 3D ultrasound results were not congruent in all astronauts. 3D ultrasound confirmed that the countermeasure reduced IJV volume in three astronauts by approximately 35%, whereas 2D data were more equivocal. These results indicate that 3D ultrasound provides less error-prone quantitative data. DISCUSSION: These data are the first to compare 2D and 3D methods during spaceflight in the same participants by using a known countermeasure that reduces IJV congestion. The current results demonstrate that 3D ultrasound should be the preferred imaging method when trying to measure venous congestion in the IJV, and that 2D ultrasound results should be interpreted with caution.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During future interplanetary space missions, a number of health conditions may arise, owing to the hostile environment of space and the myriad of stressors experienced by the crew. When managing these conditions, crews will be required to make accurate, timely clinical decisions at a high level of autonomy, as telecommunication delays and increasing distances restrict real-time support from the ground. On Earth, artificial intelligence (AI) has proven successful in healthcare, augmenting expert clinical decision-making or enhancing medical knowledge where it is lacking. Similarly, deploying AI tools in the context of a space mission could improve crew self-reliance and healthcare delivery. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review to discuss existing AI applications that could improve the prevention, recognition, evaluation, and management of the most mission-critical conditions, including psychological and mental health, acute radiation sickness, surgical emergencies, spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, infections, and cardiovascular deconditioning. RESULTS: Some examples of the applications we identified include AI chatbots designed to prevent and mitigate psychological and mental health conditions, automated medical imaging analysis, and closed-loop systems for hemodynamic optimization. We also discuss at length gaps in current technologies, as well as the key challenges and limitations of developing and deploying AI for space medicine to inform future research and innovation. Indeed, shifts in patient cohorts, space-induced physiological changes, limited size and breadth of space biomedical datasets, and changes in disease characteristics may render the models invalid when transferred from ground settings into space.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The illusions of head motion induced by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) can be used to compromise flight performance of pilots in fixed-base simulators. However, the stimuli used in the majority of studies fail to mimic disorientation in realistic flight because they are independent from the simulated aircraft motion. This study investigated the potential of bilateral-bipolar GVS coupled to aircraft roll in a fixed-base simulator to mimic vestibular spatial disorientation illusions, specifically the “post-roll illusion” observed during flight. METHODS: There were 14 nonpilot subjects exposed to roll stimuli in a flight simulator operating in a fixed-base mode. GVS was delivered via carbon rubber electrodes on the mastoid processes. The electrical stimulus was driven by the high-pass filtered aircraft roll rate to mimic the semicircular canals’ physiological response. The post-roll test scenarios excluded outside visual cues or instruments and required subjects to actively maintain a constant bank angle after an abrupt stop following a passive prolonged roll maneuver. The anticipated outcome was an overshot in roll elicited by the GVS signal. RESULTS: The responses across subjects showed large variability, with less than a third aligning with the post-roll illusion. Subjective ratings suggest that the high-pass filtered GVS stimuli were mild and did not induce a clear sense of roll direction. However, uncontrolled head movements during stimulation might have obscured the intended effects of GVS-evoked illusory head movements. CONCLUSION: The mild and transient GVS stimuli used in this study, together with the uncontrolled head movements, did not convincingly mimic the post-roll illusion.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neonatal air transportation is a crucial means of moving critically ill or sick neonates to specialized neonatal intensive care units or medical centers for consultation, regardless of distance or geographical limits. Proper preparation and consideration of air transport can help alleviate medical emergencies and ensure safe delivery. However, crewmembers and neonates may face stress during transportation. To date, there are few studies on neonatal air transportation in Taiwan. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a late preterm neonate born with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and polycythemia, who was also diagnosed with patent ductus arteriosus and mild pulmonary arterial hypertension on echocardiography. Due to disease progression, the neonate underwent endotracheal intubation and was subsequently transported to a medical center in Taiwan via a rotary-wing aircraft at 3 d of age. During takeoff and landing, a temporary oxygen desaturation event occurred. The physiological changes in these patients have seldom been discussed. This case emphasizes the important considerations of neonatal transport in Taiwan. DISCUSSION: The air transport process could be influenced by both the patient’s medical condition and environmental factors. In preterm infants with cardiopulmonary conditions, thorough assessment is necessary for ensuring safe transportation. Li S-P, Hsu P-C, Huang C-Y, Wu P-W, Fang H-H.

We conducted this study to analyze the psychophysiological response of soldiers in two different high intensity interval training protocols (HIIT), resisted (RHIIT) and endurance (EHIIT), in order to determine which HIIT elicits a psychophysiological response similar to that in actual theaters of operation. METHODS: We recruited 21 professional soldiers from the Spanish Army. HIIT protocols were conducted in accordance with actual military scenarios, performed at 36–38°C. RESULTS: Both protocols, RHIIT and EHIIT, produced a significant increase in blood lactate (1.6 ± 0.3 to 6.4 ± 4.8 and 1.7 ± 0.6 to 11.2 ± 5.0, respectively), rate of perceived exertion, heart rate, and lower limb explosive strength; skin temperature and bodyweight presented significant decreases. Only EHIIT presented a significant increase on cortical arousal (35.9 ± 2.1 to 37.3 ± 2.8) and isometric hand-grip strength, achieving similar psychophysiological response as in previous simulated combat studies.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Medical Guidelines for Airline Travel provide information that enables healthcare providers to properly advise patients who plan to travel by air. Modern commercial aircraft are very safe and, in most cases, reasonably comfortable. However, all flights, short or long haul, impose stresses on passengers. Preflight stresses include airport commotion on the ground such as carrying baggage, walking long distances, getting to the gate on time, and being delayed. In-flight stresses include acceleration, vibration (including turbulence), noise, lowered barometric pressure, variations of temperature and humidity, and fatigue among others. Healthy passengers normally tolerate these stresses quite well; however, there is the potential for passengers to become ill during or after the flight due to these stresses, especially for those with pre-existing medical conditions and reduced physiological reserves.Thibeault C, Evans AD.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although the induction of vection (perception of illusory self-motion) has been studied for some decades, the effect of ground surface properties on vection remains to be assessed quantitatively. This study will be helpful for designing helicopter or airplane flight simulation, because pilots often perceive optic flow on the ground surface and perceive self-motion from such flows. METHOD: Vection stimuli of variable position, size, and optic flow speed were presented in a trapezoidal area on a ground surface. Body sway was also measured. RESULTS: Substantial vection was induced by stimuli on a ground surface. Increases in stimulus speed and size were each associated with stronger vection (e.g., the subjective strength increased by 50% as the speed increased from 0.375 m · s −1 to 1.5 m · s −1 ). When the stimulus occupied a more distant section of the visual field, vection was more efficiently induced than when the nearer section was occupied (e.g., the subjective strength decreased by 50% when the nearer half section of optical flow was removed). These properties of vection were similar to vection induced by upright vertical stimuli. Speed, size, and position of vection stimuli modified both length and direction of body sway significantly. Vection and body sway showed some correlations (e.g., r = 0.55). CONCLUSION: Stimuli on ground surfaces can induce substantial vection and vection strength can be modified by the stimulus properties of the ground surfaces.Tamada Y, Seno T.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate seven CV tests to determine an optimal CV test screener that potentially could be implemented by the U.S. Army.There were 133 subjects [65 Color Vision Deficits (CVD), 68 Color Vision Normal (CVN)] who performed all of the tests in one setting. CVD and CVN determination was initially assessed with the Oculus anomaloscope. Each test was administered monocularly and according to the test protocol. The main outcome measures were test sensitivity, specificity, and administration time (automated tests).Three of the four Pseudoisochromatic Plate (PIP) tests had a sensitivity/specificity > 0.90 OD/OS, whereas the FALANT tests had a sensitivity/specificity > 0.80 OD/OS. The Cone Contrast Test (CCT) demonstrated sensitivity/specificity > 0.90 OD/OS, whereas the Color Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test demonstrated sensitivity/specificity > 0.85 OD/OS. Comparison with the anomaloscope (\"gold standard\") revealed no significant difference of sensitivity and specificity OD/OS with the CCT, Dvorine PIP, and PIPC tests. Finally, the CCT administration time was significantly faster than the CAD test.The current U.S. Army CV screening tests demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity, as did the automated tests. In addition, some current PIP tests (Dvorine, PIPC), and the CCT performed no worse statistically than the anomaloscope with regard to sensitivity/specificity. The CCT letter presentation is randomized and results would not be confounded by potential memorization, or fading, of book plates.",

Working memory was assessed with the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. Peripheral oxygen saturation (Spo₂), heart rate (HR), and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded.Acute NH exposure induced a classical physiological response (i.e., decreased Spo₂and increased HR), but not identical to the well-described physiological response to acute hypobaric hypoxia. Acute NH also caused a strong impairment in working memory. Oxygen breathing following NH exposure induced a slowing in the EEG associated with a worsening of working memory performance.Acute NH exposure revealed a good surrogate for the classical hypobaric chamber for refresher hypoxia awareness training. Because the association between hypoxia and hyperoxia seems deleterious for the brain, we suggest that NH exposure should be surrounded by air breathing.",

It is considered a nonsedating antihistamine and might be recommended for use in pilots, pending research on the effects on flying-related performance under hypobaric conditions that prevail in an airliner. We assessed the effects of a single dose of bilastine 20 mg on alertness and complex task performance of healthy volunteers in a hypobaric chamber at 75.2 kPa (8000 ft/2438 m cabin altitude). METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 24 volunteers received a single dose of bilastine 20 mg, hydroxyzine 50 mg (active control), and placebo. Using the Vigilance and Tracking Task, Multi-Attribute Task Battery, and Stanford Sleepiness Scale, assessments were made before and up to 6 h after intake of the study medication. RESULTS: Bilastine 20 mg had no impairing effects on sleepiness levels, vigilance, or complex task performance for up to 6 h post-dose. Hydroxyzine 50 mg (active control) was associated with significant sleepiness and impaired performance across this time period, confirming the sensitivity of the tests. CONCLUSION: Bilastine 20 mg did not cause sleepiness or impaired performance on tasks related to flying. It is anticipated that a single dose of bilastine 20 mg will not affect flying performance. Bilastine may provide a safe therapeutic alternative for pilots suffering from allergic rhinitis or urticaria.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical fitness and dehydration are factors that may influence cardiac autonomic control. We aimed to verify the influence of these factors on cardiac autonomic control before, during, and after a flight. METHODS: At the same time of day, 11 healthy fighter pilots recorded several 1-h bouts of heart rate (HR) activity during a non- (control) and a training flight day. Autonomic control of HR was examined via time domain and non-linear heart rate variability (HRV) analyses. The level of dehydration during the flight was evaluated by changes in hematocrit, while aerobic capacity, muscular strength, and body fatness were the physical fitness components evaluated. RESULTS: The flight induced a significant reduction in most parameters of HRV during flight time when compared to the control day. However, no differences were found between the days before the flight, while the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of HR was the only parameter significantly reduced (11.05 ± 7.7%) after the flight. Significant correlations were observed between the sample entropy of HR during flight and aerobic capacity (r = 0.777) and body fatness (r = −0.617). Correlations between dehydration and changes in HRV (RMSSD and SD1) were also identified (r = −0.61 to −0.81). CONCLUSION: The current results demonstrated significant relationships between aerobic capacity, body fatness, and hydration status on autonomic control of HR during and after flights. No relationship to muscular strength was observed. Future studies may further elucidate the impact of these factors on pilot training in order to accommodate flight’s stressors and enhance performance.Oliveira-Silva I, Boullosa DA.

The use of bioreactors for cartilage tissue engineering is common, but the results are controversial. Some studies suggest that microgravity bioreactors are ideal for chondrogenesis, while others show that mimicking hydrostatic pressure is crucial for cartilage formation. A parallel study comparing the effects of loading and unloading on chondrogenesis has not been performed.The goal of this study was to evaluate chondrogenesis of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASC) under two different mechanical stimuli relative to static culture: microgravity and cyclic hydrostatic pressure (CHP). Pellets of hASC were cultured for 14 d under simulated microgravity using a rotating wall vessel bioreactor or under CHP (7.5 MPa, 1 Hz, 4 h · d-1) using a hydrostatic pressure vessel.We found that CHP increased mRNA expression of Aggrecan, Sox9, and Collagen II, caused a threefold increase in sulfated glycosaminoglycan production, and resulted in stronger vimentin staining intensity and organization relative to microgravity. In addition, Wnt-signaling patterns were altered in a manner that suggests that simulated microgravity decreases chondrogenic differentiation when compared to CHP.Our goal was to compare chondrogenic differentiation of hASC using a microgravity bioreactor and a hydrostatic pressure vessel, two commonly used bioreactors in cartilage tissue engineering. Our results indicate that CHP promotes hASC chondrogenesis and that microgravity may inhibit hASC chondrogenesis. Our findings further suggest that cartilage formation and regeneration might be compromised in space due to the lack of mechanical loading.Mellor LF, Steward AJ, Nordberg RC, Taylor MA, Loboa EG.

During driving of virtual automobiles in a video game, we separated chronological age from experience driving physical automobiles. METHODS: Subjects drove a virtual automobile in a driving video game. Drivers were young adults with several years of experience driving physical automobiles, while nondrivers were individuals in the same age group who did not have a driver’s license and had never driven an automobile. During virtual driving, we monitored movement of the head and torso. We collected independent measures of the incidence and severity of motion sickness. RESULTS: After virtual driving, motion sickness incidence did not differ between drivers (65%) and nondrivers (60%). Game performance and the severity of symptoms also did not differ between drivers and nondrivers. However, movement differed between subjects who later became motion sick and those who did not. In addition, physical driving experience influenced patterns of postural activity that preceded motion sickness during virtual driving. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the postural instability theory of motion sickness, and help to illuminate relationships between the control of physical and virtual vehicles.Chang C-H, Chen F-C, Kung W-C, Stoffregen TA.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We report what may be the first evidence-based report of a retinal laser injury to a pilot during commercial flight from a laser device on the ground. Given the significant subjective (blind spot) and objective evidence of focal retinal damage, coupled with the distance involved, we suspect the laser had a radiant power of several watts, known to be injurious to the human retina. CASE REPORT: An airline pilot presented to our department complaining of a blind spot in the upper left area of his visual field in the right eye (right supero-nasal scotoma) following exposure to a laser beam while performing a landing maneuver of a commercial aircraft. At around 1300 ft (396 m), a blue laser beam from the ground directly entered his right eye, with immediate flash blindness and pain. Spectral domain ocular coherence tomography highlighted a localized area of photoreceptor disruption corresponding to a well demarcated area of hypofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence, representing a focal outer retinal laser injury. Fundus examination a fortnight later revealed a clinically identifiable lesion in the pilot’s right eye commensurate with a retinal-laser burn. DISCUSSION: The case reports highlights the growing threat to the ocular health of airline crew and, potentially, passenger safety due to the lack of regulatory oversight of high powered laser devices obtained from the internet. We strongly believe high powered handheld laser devices should not be in the possession of the general public.Gosling DB, O’Hagan JB, Quhill FM.

METHODS: Thirty-eight subjects wearing anti-G suits were exposed to sustained high G forces using a centrifuge. The subjects exerted AGSM and decelerated the centrifuge when they reached the point of loss of peripheral vision. The G profile consisted of a +2.3 G onset rate, +7.3 G single plateau, and −1.6 G offset rate. Each subject’s G tolerance time was recorded and the relationship between the tolerance time and the subject's anthropometric and physiological factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean tolerance time of the 38 subjects was 31.6 s, and the min and max tolerance times were 20 s and 58 s, respectively. The correlation analysis indicated that none of the factors had statistically significant correlations with the subjects’ G duration tolerance. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that G duration tolerance was not dependent on any personal factors of the subjects. After the values of personal factors were simplified into 0 or 1, the t -test analysis showed that subjects’ heights were inversely correlated with G duration tolerance at a statistically significant level. However, a logistic regression analysis suggested that the effect of the height factor to a pilot's G duration tolerance was too weak to be used as a predictor of a pilot's G tolerance.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nonhypoxic hypobaric (low atmospheric pressure) occupational exposure, such as experienced by U.S. Air Force U-2 pilots and safety personnel operating inside altitude chambers, is associated with increased subcortical white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this discrete WMH change remain unknown. The objectives of this study were to demonstrate that occupational exposure to nonhypoxic hypobaria is associated with altered white matter integrity as quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA) measured using diffusion tensor imaging and relate these findings to WMH burden and neurocognitive ability. METHODS: There were 102 U-2 pilots and 114 age- and gender-controlled, health-matched controls who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. All pilots performed neurocognitive assessment. Whole-brain and tract-wise average FA values were compared between pilots and controls, followed by comparison within pilots separated into high and low WMH burden groups. Neurocognitive measurements were used to help interpret group difference in FA values. RESULTS: Pilots had significantly lower average FA values than controls (0.489/0.500, respectively). Regionally, pilots had higher FA values in the fronto-occipital tract where FA values positively correlated with visual-spatial performance scores (0.603/0.586, respectively). There was a trend for high burden pilots to have lower FA values than low burden pilots. DISCUSSION: Nonhypoxic hypobaric exposure is associated with significantly lower average FA in young, healthy U-2 pilots. This suggests that recurrent hypobaric exposure causes diffuse axonal injury in addition to focal white matter changes.McGuire SA, Boone GRE, Sherman PM, Tate DF, Wood JD, Patel B, Eskandar G, Wijtenburg SA, Rowland LM, Clarke GD, Grogan PM, Sladky JH, Kochunov PV.

The objective of the current research was to examine military pilots' attention distributions between chasing a moving target and a stationary target.In the current research, 37 mission-ready F-16 pilots participated. Subjects' eye movements were collected by a portable head-mounted eye-tracker during tactical training in a flight simulator. The scenarios of chasing a moving target (air-to-air) and a stationary target (air-to-surface) consist of three operational phases: searching, aiming, and lock-on to the targets.The findings demonstrated significant differences in pilots' percentage of fixation during the searching phase between air-to-air (M = 37.57, SD = 5.72) and air-to-surface (M = 33.54, SD = 4.68). Fixation duration can indicate pilots' sustained attention to the trajectory of a dynamic target during air combat maneuvers. Aiming at the stationary target resulted in larger pupil size (M = 27,105, SD = 6565), reflecting higher cognitive loading than aiming at the dynamic target (M = 23,864, SD = 8762).Pilots' visual behavior is not only closely related to attention distribution, but also significantly associated with task characteristics. Military pilots demonstrated various visual scan patterns for searching and aiming at different types of targets based on the research settings of a flight simulator. The findings will facilitate system designers' understanding of military pilots' cognitive processes during tactical operations. They will assist human-centered interface design to improve pilots' situational awareness. The application of an eye-tracking device integrated with a flight simulator is a feasible and cost-effective intervention to improve the efficiency and safety of tactical training.Li W-C, Yu C-S, Braithwaite G, Greaves M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether the unique environment of space affects astronaut risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is not known. On Earth, it is known that use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) doubles the risk of VTE. Since some female astronauts choose to use COCs, this retrospective study examined known risk factors associated with VTE risk to determine whether the available data suggested elevated VTE risk in female astronauts. METHODS: Longitudinal health data were requested for female astronauts who flew short and long duration missions between 2000 and 2014. Pre- and postflight hematological and biochemical blood markers were available and evaluated. Astronauts’ postflight measurements were compared to clinically relevant terrestrial high risk levels to determine any trend toward increased risk for VTE following spaceflight. Secondarily, a comparison of pre- and postflight changes was made, as well as an assessment of COC impact. RESULTS: A total of 38 astronaut-flights were included in this study and no VTE events were found. Analysis of potential VTE risk factors showed no evidence suggesting elevated VTE risk in female astronauts associated with spaceflight, regardless of contraceptive use. DISCUSSION: Arguably, all astronauts encounter many physiological stressors during spaceflight missions, but women using the combined contraceptive pill add a known risk factor for VTE. The risk factors analyzed within this study showed no trend toward an increased risk of VTE for female astronauts. This study provides an evidence base supporting the safety of COC use by female astronauts and also reinforces the importance of healthy lifestyle on VTE risk reduction.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Medical conditions occurring in spaceflight pose risks to the crew and the mission and these risks will be exacerbated during exploration-class missions. Probabilistic risk assessment is a method used at NASA to quantify this risk for low-Earth orbit operations. Informing Mission Planning via Analysis of Complex Tradespaces (IMPACT) is a next-generation tool suite that will perform these assessments for exploration-class missions. It will require a robust list of medical conditions of significant likelihood and/or consequence to exploration-class missions to accurately inform the tool suite. METHODS: The IMPACT 1.0 Medical Condition List (ICL 1.0) contains 120 conditions selected in the context of a 210-d cis-lunar, Mars analog design reference mission. The conditions were selected via a systematic process that preserved institutional knowledge from nine prior condition lists. Conditions were prioritized for inclusion in the ICL 1.0 based on history of occurrence in spaceflight, concurrence among the nine source lists, and concurrence among subject matter experts. DISCUSSION: The ICL 1.0 has notable advantages over its predecessor lists in that it is more specific to exploration-class missions, contains a greater number, breadth, and depth of conditions, and was derived via consensus across multiple medical specialties.

This double blinded, randomized trial was designed to see if the use of EANx could effectively improve cognitive performance while diving. METHODS: Eight volunteers performed two no-decompression dry dives breathing air or EANx for 20 min at 0.4 MPa. Cognitive functions were assessed with a computerized test battery, including MathProc and Ptrail. Measurements were taken before the dive, upon arrival and after 15 min at depth, upon surfacing, and at 30 min postdive. After each dive subjects were asked to identify the gas they had just breathed. RESULTS: Identification of the breathing gas was not possible on subjective assessment alone, while cognitive assessments showed significantly better performance while breathing EANx. Before the dives, breathing air, mean time to complete the task was 1795 ms for MathProc and 1905 ms for Ptrail. When arriving at depth MathProc took 1616 ms on air and 1523 ms on EANx, and Ptrail took 1318 ms on air and and 1356 ms on EANx, followed 15 min later by significant performance inhibition while breathing air during the ascent and the postdive phase, supporting the concept of late dive/postdive impairment. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that EANx could protect against decreased neuro-cognitive performance induced by inert gas narcosis. It was not possible for blinded divers to identify which gas they were breathing and differences in postdive fatigue between air and EANx diving deserve further investigation.Germonpré P, Balestra C, Hemelryck W, Buzzacott P, Lafère P.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recent research has postulated increased cardiovascular mortality for astronauts who participated in the Apollo lunar missions. The conclusions, however, are based on small numbers of astronauts, are derived from methods with known weaknesses, and are not consistent with prior research. METHODS: Records for NASA astronauts and U.S. Air Force astronauts were analyzed to produce standardized mortality ratios. Lunar astronauts were compared to astronauts who have never flown in space (nonflight astronauts), those who have only flown missions in low Earth orbit (LEO astronauts), and the U.S. general population. RESULTS: Lunar astronauts were significantly older at cohort entry than other astronaut group and lunar astronauts alive as of the end of 2015 were significantly older than nonflight astronauts and LEO astronauts. No significant differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality rates between astronaut groups was observed, though lunar astronauts were noted to be at significantly lower risk of death by CVD than are members of the U.S. general population (SMR = 13, 95% CI = 3–39). DISCUSSION: The differences in age structure between lunar and nonlunar astronauts and the deaths of LEO astronauts from external causes at young ages lead to confounding in proportional mortality studies of astronauts. When age and follow-up time are properly taken into account using cohort-based methods, no significant difference in CVD mortality rates is observed. Care should be taken to select the correct study design, outcome definition, exposure classification, and analysis when answering questions involving rare occupational exposures.Reynolds RJ, Day SM.

METHODS: Ten subjects performed simple and choice reaction time tests (SRT and CRT, respectively) at ground level for 40 min (20 min normoxic, 20 min hyperoxic, randomly assigned), 3048 m (10,000 ft) for 75 min (15 min hyperoxic, 60 min hypoxic), 4572 m (15,000 ft) for 60 min (15 min hyperoxic, 45 min hypoxic), and 6096 m (20,000 ft) for 35 min (15 min hyperoxic, 20 min hypoxic). SRT and CRT tests were also conducted at ground level 1 h after normoxic rest (recovery) to assess any recovery time effect on these psychomotor tasks. RESULTS: Total response time (TRT) significantly increased by 15 ms to 25 ms at all three altitudes for both the SRT and CRT tasks. At and below 4572 m, the performance changes were gradual over the duration of the exposures, whereas at 6096 m these changes were immediate. After 1 h, no performance decrement was measured. There was no statistical evidence that ground-level performance on these tasks was improved in hyperoxic vs. normoxic conditions.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and cephalad fluid shift are considered factors that affect intracranial pressure (ICP) during spaceflight. Increases in ICP were reported during cephalad fluid shift induced by head-down tilt (HDT), while little is known regarding the effect of additional CO 2 during HDT on ICP. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that this combination increases ICP more than HDT alone. METHODS: There were 15 healthy male volunteers who underwent 4 types of 10-min interventions consisting of Placebo/Supine (air and supine), CO 2 /Supine (3% CO 2 and supine, CO 2 alone), Placebo/HDT (air and −10° HDT, HDT alone), and CO 2 /HDT (3% CO 2 and −10° HDT, combination). Using arterial blood pressure (ABP) and cerebral blood flow velocity waveforms, ICP was estimated noninvasively before and during the four interventions. Two calculation methods were employed. One is based on the signal transformation from ABP to ICP with the intracranial component as a “black box” system (nICP_BB), and the other is based on the equation ICP = ABP − cerebral perfusion pressure, reflecting critical closing pressure (nICP_CrCP). RESULTS: Both nICP_BB and nICP_CrCP significantly increased during Placebo/HDT and CO 2 /HDT, although there was no statistically significant difference between the nICP indexes of these two interventions. DISCUSSION: Increases in ICP were observed during both Placebo/HDT and CO 2 /HDT. Contrary to our hypothesis, the combination of 3% CO 2 and −10° HDT did not increase ICP remarkably compared to −10° HDT alone. Therefore, the addition of 3% CO 2 is considered to have little effect on increasing ICP during cephalad fluid shift. Kurazumi T, Ogawa Y, Yanagida R, Morisaki H, Iwasaki K.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The advent of autonomous automobiles raises new challenges for maintaining passenger safety and comfort. The challenge addressed here is how to predict and mitigate motion sickness when passengers read in a moving vehicle. METHODS: We utilized a car equipped with a commercial active suspension system developed for attenuating the transmission of road surface fluctuations to passengers. The system was used to reproduce, in a parked car, either the vibrations that would be experienced in a moving car equipped with a conventional suspension system (unmitigated ride) or the attenuated vibrations that would occur on the road with the active cancellation system engaged (mitigated ride). We evaluated the consequences of these two simulated ride conditions for reading performance, comfort, and evocation of motion sickness. RESULTS: Both ride conditions reduced the 0 to 0.8 Hz vibrations to below threshold for evoking motion sickness during passive exposure. Only the mitigated ride condition attenuated frequencies in the 0.8 to 8 Hz band where visual suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex is known to break down, and this condition also reduced the motion sickness induced by reading and increased reading comprehension and comfort relative to the unmitigated ride. DISCUSSION: The palliative effects of 0.8 to 8 Hz attenuation are discussed in terms of the different mechanisms underlying motion sickness evoked by reading in a vehicle versus mere exposure to vehicle motion without reading. Implications for ISO-2631 standards for human exposure to vibration are also discussed. DiZio P, Ekchian J, Kaplan J, Ventura J, Graves W, Giovanardi M, Anderson Z, Lackner JR .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motion sickness remains a significant and unpredictable problem during spaceflight. One of the major difficulties in understanding the etiology of space motion sickness has been a lack of data at the time the symptoms occur, i.e., immediately after entry into space and during return to Earth; in these phases of the mission is when critical operational tasks are performed. CASE REPORT: We report here the case of a crewmember who experienced severe motion sickness symptoms immediately after launching into space and for several days into the mission. Verbal reports recorded during and immediately after the flight describe in detail the symptoms and their underlying causes. The prominent cause was oscillopsia that was induced by moving the head, wearing prescription eyeglasses, and translating the whole body. DISCUSSION: In this case, space motion sickness was sudden and induced by voluntary or involuntary head or body movements in any plane. These head movements caused a visual disturbance that induced the perception that the environment was oscillating. The exaggerated motion perceptions suggest an increased vestibular sensitivity and/or decreased pursuit-optokinetic mechanisms in orbit and immediately after landing. Reschke MF, Wood SJ, Clément GR.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study associations between the cockpit environment, psychosocial work environment, home environment, and medical symptoms in a cohort of commercial pilots followed over 3 yr. METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was mailed in February-March 1997 to all Stockholm-based pilots on duty in a Scandinavian flight company ( N = 622); 577 (93%) participated. During this time smoking was allowed on long haul flights, but not on shorter flights. Smoking was prohibited on all flights after September 1997. The same questionnaire was sent to the cohort of 577 pilots in February-March 2000; 436 participated (76%). The questionnaire contained questions on symptoms, the psychosocial work environment, and the home environment. Associations were investigated using multiple logistic and ordinal regression. RESULTS: Symptoms were common, especially eye symptoms (38.5%), nose symptoms (39.9%), and tiredness (29.9%). Pilots exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on long haul flights had more eye symptoms (odds ratio = 1.91) and tiredness (odds ratio = 2.73). These symptoms were reduced when no longer exposed to ETS. Those who started working on long haul flights developed more nose symptoms. Pilots reporting increased work demands developed more nose and dermal symptoms and tiredness and those with decreased work control developed more eye symptoms. Pilots living in new houses, multifamily houses, and in recently painted homes reported more symptoms. CONCLUSION: Eliminating ETS exposure on board reduced medical symptoms. Further work to reduce ETS exposure globally is needed. Psychosocial aspects of the work environment for commercial pilots should be considered, as well as the home environment.Fu X, Lindgren T, Norbäck D.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air traffic controllers (ATC) work shifts and their work schedules vary according to the characteristics of each airport. The human body adapts to shiftwork differently. These adjustments affect the health-disease process, predisposing ATC to risk conditions associated with sleep deprivation and lack of night sleep, which can lead to conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, mood disorders, anxiety, and obesity. This study investigated the characteristics of health, sleep, and quality of life of ATC exposed to 8-h alternate work shifts and 6-h rotational work shifts. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional with convenience samples consisting of 84 ATC from two international airports in Brazil. We applied questionnaires to collect data about socioeconomic conditions, quality of life, sleep, and physical activity levels. We also collected health data regarding nutritional status, body composition, and blood pressure. We analyzed the differences between ATC from the two airports considering the variables of sleep, quality of life, and health. RESULTS: Differences were found between the groups in terms of body fat percentage (30.7% and 27.8%), scores of overall quality of life (56.2 and 68), concentration (3.37 and 3.96), energy (3.12 and 3.62), and sleep time on working days (5:20 h and 6:15 h). CONCLUSION: ATC under 8-h alternate shifts showed lower scores for quality of life, higher body fat, and less sleep time on working days, which characterizes inadequate shiftwork for this population.Sonati J, De Martino M, Vilarta R, Maciel É, Moreira E, Sanchez F, De Martino G, Sonati R.

    "abstract": "Increased gravito-inertial acceleration, or hypergravity, such as produced in a centrifuge or in an aircraft coordinated turn, causes humans to systematically overestimate their roll tilt in the dark. This is known as the \"G-excess\" illusion. We have previously modified a mathematical observer model of dynamic orientation perception to replicate these illusory tilt perceptions. This modified model also made a novel, previously untested, prediction that humans would underestimate acute roll tilt in reduced gravitational environments (hypogravity).In the current study, we used aircraft parabolic flight to test this prediction in a single subject. Roll tilt perception was reported using a subjective visual vertical task in which the subject aligned an illuminated line, presented in a head mounted display, with their perceived direction of down. The same subject made reports during hypogravity parabolas (0.165 G and 0.38 G, corresponding to lunar and Martian gravity, respectively), hypergravity maneuvers (1.6 G during a pull out maneuver and 1.2 G during a coordinated turn), and 1-G control conditions (both on the ground and in straight and level flight). As hypothesized, the subject significantly underestimated roll tilt in the hypogravity environments by approximately 40% compared to 1-G reports while overestimating roll tilt in the hypergravity environments.The amount of underestimation observed was quantitatively consistent with that predicted a priori by the modified observer model. We propose the term \"G-shortage\" illusion for the underestimation of roll tilt in hypogravity. This illusion may have implications for aircraft pilots and astronauts.Clark TK, Young LR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prospective memory allows people to complete intended tasks in the future. Prospective memory failures, such as pilots forgetting to inform pattern traffic of their locations, can have fatal consequences. The present research examined the impact of system factors (memory cue salience and workload) and individual differences (pilot age, cognitive health, and expertise) on prospective memory for communication tasks in the cockpit. METHODS: Pilots ( N = 101) flew a Cessna 172 simulator at a non-towered aerodrome while maintaining communication with traffic and attending to flight parameters. Memory cue salience (the prominence of cues that signal an intended action) and workload were manipulated. Prospective memory was measured as radio call completion rates. RESULTS: Pilots’ prospective memory was adversely affected by low-salience cues and high workload. An interaction of cue salience, pilots’ age, and cognitive health reflected the effects of system and individual difference factors on prospective memory failures. For example, younger pilots with low levels of cognitive health completed 78% of the radio calls associated with low-salience memory cues, whereas older pilots with low cognitive health scores completed just 61% of similar radio calls. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that technologies designed to signal intended future tasks should target those tasks with inherently low-salience memory cues. In addition, increasing the salience of memory cues is most likely to benefit pilots with lower levels of cognitive health in high-workload conditions.Van Benthem KD, Herdman CM, Tolton RG, LeFevre J-A.

The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend a previous study on training pilots how and when to use these new weather technologies.This field study used a quasi-experimental design (pre- vs. post-test with a control group). There were 91 GA pilots from the Midwest, Northeastern, and Southeastern United States who participated in a 2-h short course or a control activity. The lecture-based short course covered radar basics, Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD), NEXRAD specifics/limitations, thunderstorm basics, radar products, and decision making.The pilots who participated in the course earned higher knowledge test scores, improved at applying the concepts in paper-based flight scenarios, had higher self-efficacy in post-training assessments as compared to pre-training assessments, and also performed better than did control subjects on post-test knowledge and skills assessments.GA pilots lack knowledge about real-time Datalink weather technology. This study indicates that a relatively short training program was effective for fostering Datalink weather-related knowledge and skills in GA pilots.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Helicopter pilots are involved in a complex multitask activity, implying overuse of cognitive resources, which may result in piloting task impairment or in decision-making failure. Studies usually investigate this phenomenon in well-controlled, poorly ecological situations by focusing on the correlation between physiological values and either cognitive workload or emotional state. This study aimed at jointly exploring workload induced by a realistic simulated helicopter flight mission and emotional state, as well as physiological markers. METHOD: The experiment took place in the helicopter full flight dynamic simulator. Six participants had to fly on two missions. Workload level, skin conductance, RMS-EMG, and emotional state were assessed. RESULTS: Joint analysis of psychological and physiological parameters associated with workload estimation revealed particular dynamics in each of three profiles. 1) Expert pilots showed a slight increase of measured physiological parameters associated with the increase in difficulty level. Workload estimates never reached the highest level and the emotional state for this profile only referred to positive emotions with low emotional intensity. 2) Non-Expert pilots showed increasing physiological values as the perceived workload increased. However, their emotional state referred to either positive or negative emotions, with a greater variability in emotional intensity. 3) Intermediate pilots were similar to Expert pilots regarding emotional states and similar to Non-Expert pilots regarding physiological patterns. DISCUSSION: Overall, high interindividual variability of these results highlight the complex link between physiological and psychological parameters with workload, and question whether physiology alone could predict a pilot's inability to make the right decision at the right time.Gaetan S, Dousset E, Marqueste T, Bringoux L, Bourdin C, Vercher J-L, Besson P.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Shoulder injuries due to working inside the space suit are some of the most serious and debilitating injuries astronauts encounter. Space suit injuries occur primarily in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) underwater training facility due to accumulated musculoskeletal stress. We quantitatively explored the underlying causal mechanisms of injury. METHODS: Logistic regression was used to identify relevant space suit components, training environment variables, and anthropometric dimensions related to an increased propensity for space-suited injury. Two groups of subjects were analyzed: those whose reported shoulder incident is attributable to the NBL or working in the space suit, and those whose shoulder incidence began in active duty, meaning working in the suit could be a contributing factor. RESULTS: For both groups, percent of training performed in the space suit planar hard upper torso (HUT) was the most important predictor variable for injury. Frequency of training and recovery between training were also significant metrics. The most relevant anthropometric dimensions were bideltoid breadth, expanded chest depth, and shoulder circumference. Finally, record of previous injury was found to be a relevant predictor for subsequent injury. The first statistical model correctly identifies 39% of injured subjects, while the second model correctly identifies 68% of injured subjects. DISCUSSION: A review of the literature suggests this is the first work to quantitatively evaluate the hypothesized causal mechanisms of all space-suited shoulder injuries. Although limited in predictive capability, each of the identified variables can be monitored and modified operationally to reduce future impacts on an astronaut’s health.Anderson AP, Newman DJ, Welsch RE.

    "abstract": "Many fighter pilots report cervical pain during their careers. Etiology likely relates to +Gz exposure, physical positioning with maneuvers, and varying load associated with headgear. We evaluated whether selected risk factors predicted cervical pain in this population.An Institutional Review Board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, controlled crossover study of the use of home cervical traction was undertaken with 20 male F-15C pilots. We recorded pilot age (mean 38 yr, range 34-49), total high-G hours (2338 h, range 1038-4645), and previous neck problems and measured cervical range of motion. For 12 wk, pilots logged pre- and postflight pain, whether the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) was employed, maximum +Gz experienced, and sortie duration. Pain with and without JHMCS was compared using paired t-tests and correlations assessed with Pearson or Spearman coefficients.Mean flight-related pain increased by 0.73 on the numerical rating scale with JHMCS and 0.52 without. Neck extension coupled with JHMCS use correlated negatively with increased pain (r = -0.551). Higher numbers of previously reported neck problems correlated with pain when using JHMCS (r = 0.629). Age, maximum +Gz per sortie, total high-Gz hours flown, and hours per sortie did not correlate.To our knowledge, this is the first prospective evaluation of risk factors for fighter pilots' cervical pain. Neck pain was significantly worse with JHMCS use and with flexed posture or history of prior neck problems combined with JHMCS use.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the United States, between 1995 and 2013, night-time visual flight rules (VFR) Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) fatal accidents mostly encountered adverse weather, and pilots with &lt;6 yr of HEMS experience showed higher likelihood of a night operational accident. One adverse weather indicator is cloud-ceiling likelihood indicated by temperature dew point spread (TDPS). This study investigated the relationship between TDPS and HEMS pilot years of experience. It was hypothesized pilots with &lt;6 yr HEMS experience were associated with fatal outcomes encountered at lower TDPS. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2013, 32 single pilot night VFR HEMS fatal accidents occurring in the United States, caused by controlled flight into terrain or loss of control, were analyzed. Using Federal Aviation Administration weather guidance, the 0–4°C TDPS was selected as an indicator of cloud ceiling. Each flight’s TDPS was analyzed with pilots’ HEMS domain task experience. RESULTS: There were 27 flights which entered the 0–4°C TDPS range; 20 (74%) were significantly associated with adverse weather. A significant negative linear relationship was found between TDPS of each mission and years of pilot HEMS experience ( r = −0.423, P = 0.028). Pilots with &lt;6 yr of experience were significantly associated with fatal outcomes ( P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Pilots’ incremental years of HEMS experience were associated with a TDPS decrement. Fatal outcomes were over nine times higher for pilots with &lt;6 yr of HEMS experience in night VFR operational accidents in those conditions. Interventions for &lt;6-yr pilots are recommended during experience building to prevent likelihood of operational accidents. Aherne BB, Zhang C, Chen WS, Newman DG.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of eight color vision tests to screen for and accurately measure hereditary color-deficiency in order to improve color vision assessment methods for aircraft pilots. METHODS: This prospective study included 29 color-deficient subjects and 23 healthy subjects. All performed the following tests: Ishihara plates, Farnsworth D15, Lanthony desaturated 15 Hue, Munsell 100 Hue, Beyne and Fletcher-Evans CAM lanterns, Nagel anomaloscope, and the Color Assessment and Diagnosis (CAD) test. The sensitivity and specificity of color-deficiency diagnosis were evaluated for each test, as well as the test’s relevance for assessing aircraft pilots. RESULTS: The Ishihara plate test demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 1.00 for color-deficiency screening. The CAD test and anomaloscope showed both a sensitivity and specificity of 1.00. The Beyne lantern, Fletcher lantern, Farnsworth D15, and the Lanthony 15 Hue tests all showed a specificity of 1.00 and sensitivities of, respectively, 0.69, 0.97, 0.58, and 0.79. During aircraft pilot selection tests, the CAD test classified 10% of color-deficient subjects as safe to fly, the anomaloscope 17%, and the Beyne and Fletcher lantern tests, respectively, 31% and 3%. DISCUSSION: The discrepancy in results confirms that current color vision test protocols need to be reassessed. The CAD test could be an interesting alternative to the series of tests used to assess flight crew, but it seems more selective than current tests.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flight crew fatigue is an important factor in aviation, leading organizations to implement fatigue risk management programs to reduce risk. The U.S. Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC) has implemented the Aviation Operational Risk Management (AvORM) program to aid mission schedulers and flight crews in mitigating flight risks and identifying appropriate levels of risk. The AvORM program uses a scheduling tool and underpinning biomathematical fatigue model. This study examined self-reported fatigue-related incidents within AMC, which provides some indirect and anecdotal evidence as to the effectiveness of the scheduling tool. METHODS: Archival data from the AMC Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) Safety Reporting System was examined. Report content themes were created through an inductive approach in terms of fatigue prevalence, antecedents, and consequences. RESULTS: Fatigue was estimated as a factor in 4% of the reports. The two most commonly referenced fatigue antecedents were associated with mission/duty length and mission scheduling/planning factors. Factors associated with aircraft operation violations were the most cited consequences of fatigue. Fatigue was almost twice as likely to be reported as a secondary rather than primary contributing factor. Aircrew reported both positive and negative aspects of AvORM resources in mission planning and fatigue mitigation. DISCUSSION: Examination of ASAP reports suggests that fatigue is a contributing factor to safety incidents. Although the AvORM program highlights potential flight risks by utilizing a scheduling tool built upon an underlying biomathematical fatigue model, human fatigue continues to impact safety, suggesting an ongoing need for improved fatigue risk management and mitigation.

Focusing on risk mitigation, NASA conducted investigations that addressed spaceflight health hazards to varying degrees. This pilot mission was initiated to gain further knowledge and monitor the physiological, psychological, and medical effects of long-duration exposure to spaceflight.METHODS: NASA's Human Research Program and the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Biomedical Problems identified more than 20 biomedical risk-reduction research investigations to be conducted on the two crewmembers before, during, and after their yearlong expedition. A database of results, as well as observations on programmatic resources, was collected to understand essential elements for future spaceflight health studies.RESULTS: Statistical rigor requires additional testing at a length of 1 yr to demonstrate the presence or absence of unacceptable deleterious effects, and to permit extrapolation to longer durations in space. Review of experimental procedures from this mission suggests potential efficiencies for future investigations.DISCUSSION: The Kelly-Kornienko 1-yr mission demonstrated the importance of continuing joint investigations with the adoption of standard measures for rigorous comparisons across disparate populations. It identified improvements to collaborative processes across national and international scientific research programs.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Changes of visual function/neuro-opthalmic structures during spaceflight have been described as visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP)/spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). Although theories are suggested, the mechanism is unknown. Only indirect measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP) have been performed in spaceflight. Direct determination of in-flight ICP is crucial to understanding VIIP. Current “gold standard” is lumbar puncture (LP). The only direct evaluation has occurred with postflight LP. In-flight measurements would allow correlation of opening pressures/possible contributing factors. The only imaging modality on the International Space Station (ISS) is ultrasound. With appropriate methodology, remotely guided ultrasound-guided lumbar puncture (USGLP) may allow safe performance in flight. Therefore, we sought to develop a novel ultrasound approach for definitive placement of an LP needle, and to show this can be achieved with remote guidance by those without training. METHODS: Literature review and round-table discussions with multiple medical fields was performed. Volunteers were scanned with ultrasound for optimizing technique. A cadaver was used to perform this technique by a radiologist, then taught to volunteers not experienced in image guided procedures, and finally was repeated multiple times by volunteers with simulated remote guidance. RESULTS: Optimal visualization was in the fetal and seated lordotic positions. Technical success was achieved by the radiologist in all attempts and achieved in 9 of 11 attempts by the trainees. DISCUSSION: Given ultrasound experience at NASA and the ability to educate non-image-guided trained personnel, these could make this technique feasible and aid in direct in-flight measurements to further research VIIP.

This effort directly addressed in-mission medication use and also informed open questions regarding spaceflight-associated changes in pharmacokinetics (PK) and/or pharmacodynamics (PD). METHODS: An iOS application was designed to collect medication use information relevant for research from volunteer astronaut crewmembers: medication name, dose, dosing frequency, indication, perceived efficacy, and side effects. Leveraging the limited medication choices aboard allowed a streamlined questionnaire. There were 24 subjects approved for participation. RESULTS: Six crewmembers completed flight data collection and five completed ground data collection before NASA’s early study discontinuation. There were 5766 medication use entries, averaging 20.6 ± 8.4 entries per subject per flight week. Types of medications and their indications were similar to previous reports, with sleep disturbances and muscle/joint pain as primary drivers. Two subjects treated prolonged skin problems. Subjects also used the application in unanticipated ways: to note drug tolerance testing or medication holiday per research protocols, and to share data with flight surgeons. Subjects also provided usability feedback on application design and implementation. DISCUSSION: The volume of data collected (20.6 ± 8.4 entries per subject per flight week) is much greater than was collected previously (&lt;12 per person per entire mission), despite user criticisms regarding app usability. It seems likely that improvements in a software-based questionnaire application could result in a robust data collection tool that astronauts find more acceptable, while simultaneously providing researchers and clinicians with useful data.

Recent research shows that while the odds of a trauma patient’s survival increase with helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS), they may not increase to the extent necessary to make HEMS cost effective. This study offers an analytic tool to objectively quantify the patient travel time advantage that HEMS offers compared to ground emergency medical services (GEMS). METHODS: Using helicopter dispatch data from the Maryland State Police from 2000–2011, we computed transport time estimates for HEMS and GEMS, compare these results to a reference transport time of 60 min, and use geospatial interpolation to extrapolate the total response times for each mode across the study region. RESULTS: Mapping the region’s trauma incidents and modeling response times, our findings indicate the GIS framework for calculating transportation time tradeoffs is useful in identifying which areas can be better served by HEMS or GEMS. DISCUSSION: The use of GIS and the analytical methodology described in this study present a method to compare transportation by air and ground in the prehospital setting that accounts for how mode, distance, and road infrastructure impact total transport time. Whether used to generate regional maps in advance or applied real-time, the presented framework provides a tool to identify earlier incident locations that favor HEMS over GEMS transport modes.Widener MJ, Ginsberg Z, Schleith D, Floccare DJ, Hirshon JM, Galvagno S.

We examined the issue of distinct environmental factors, isolation vs. confinement, which may have different or similar impacts on crews’ behavioral manifestations for long-term adaptation, such as on a Mars mission. The Tara expedition was a 507-d polar drift of the Tara schooner embedded in the Arctic ice with two successive periods of summer and winter-over in an isolated environment. The Mars-500 experiment took place in Moscow and was a 520-d simulation of a trip to Mars, the Mars landing, and the return trip to Earth in a confined environment. METHODS: We used the ethological method based on observation, description, and quantification of individual and interindividual behaviors. These events were scored from video recordings made during daily life activities and aggregated according to the summer period and to the outgoing trip for the whole crew ( N = 6) for each situation, respectively. RESULTS: We did not observe differences in the frequency of facial expressions and in the duration of body interactions. Conversely, there were differences in the frequency of collateral acts and in the duration of personal actions with the highest levels during the Mars-500 experiment (0.52 /min and 41,799 s); the highest level of visual interactions was observed during the Tara expedition (33,167 s). DISCUSSION: We found that confinement generates stress manifestations vs. isolation, that isolation enhances social relashionships vs. confinement, and that the crew adapted positively to both environments.Tafforin C.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Human navigation is a very complex ability that encompasses all four stages of human information processing (sensory input, perception/cognition, selection, and execution of an action), involving both cognitive and physical requirements. During flight, the pilot uses all of these stages and one of the most critical aspect is interference. In fact, spatial tasks competing for the same cognitive resource cause greater distraction from a concurrent task than another task that uses different resource modalities. METHODS: Here we compared and contrasted the performance of pilots and nonpilots of both genders performing increasingly complex navigational memory tasks while exposed to various forms of interference. We investigated the effects of four different sources of interference: motor, spatial motor, verbal, and spatial environment, focusing on gender differences. RESULTS: We found that flight experts perform better than controls (Pilots : 6.50 ± 1.29; Nonpilots : 5.45 ± 1.41). Furthermore, in the general population, navigational working memory is compromised only by spatial environmental interference (Nonpilots : 4.52 ± 1.50 ) ; female nonpilots were less able than male nonpilots. Also, the flight expert group showed the same interference, even if reduced (Pilots: 5.24 ± 0.92); moreover, we highlighted a complete absence of gender-related effects. DISCUSSION: Spatial environmental interference is the only interference producing a decrease in performance. Nevertheless, pilots are less affected than the general population. This is probably a consequence of the need to commit substantial cognitive resources to process spatial information during flight.Verde P, Boccia M, Colangeli S, Barbetti S, Nori R, Ferlazzo F, Piccolo F, Vitalone R, Lucertini E, Piccardi L.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In jet pilots, the neck is stressed by dynamic loading and there is growing concern about possible neck damage in pilots of new agile aircraft. Jet pilots often report neck pain after flight so intense that their operational capability may be affected. However, there is no clear evidence of structural damage related to the operational exposure. METHODS: We compared 35 F-16 pilots with 35 age-matched Eurofighter Typhoon pilots. All subjects completed an anonymous questionnaire on their flight activity and neck pain. RESULTS: The incidence of neck pain in the F-16 group was 48.6% compared with 5.7% of the Typhoon group, significantly higher. In F-16 pilots, there was a significant association between neck pain and age over 30 yr, total flight hours, and flight hours exceeding 600. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that the risk of neck pain after flight is higher among F-16 pilots compared with Typhoon pilots. This could be due to several reasons, including the backward reclined seat of the F-16, which exposes the neck to the load in an unfavorable posture while moving the head during maneuvers at sustained high-G.Verde P, Trivelloni P, Angelino G, Morgagni F, Tomao E.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of neck pain in air force pilots; however, the causes are not clear and are considered work-related. Kyphotic changes in the cervical spine have been known to cause neck pain. In this study, we investigated the association between neck pain and cervical kyphosis in air force pilots. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 63 Republic of South Korea Air Force pilots. We examined the C2-7 absolute rotation angle (ARA) using the posterior tangent method and other radiologic parameters on whole spine lateral radiographs. We divided the participants into a neck pain group ( N = 32) and no neck pain group ( N = 31), and subsequently analyzed the difference in radiographic parameters and clinical data between the two groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences found in age, body mass index, total flight time, or aerobic or anaerobic exercise between the neck pain and control groups. The fighter pilots had higher 1-yr prevalence of neck pain than nonfighter pilots (84.4% vs. 15.6%). The lower C2-7 ARA (OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.846, 0.979) and fighter type aircrafts (OR = 3.93, 95% CI 1.104, 13.989) were associated with neck pain. CONCLUSIONS: Fighter pilots experienced neck pain more frequently than the nonfighter pilots. Those fighter pilots suffering from neck pain were shown to have more kyphotic changes in the cervical spine than control pilots through evaluation of whole spine lateral radiographs using the posterior tangent method. These key findings suggest that the forces involved in flying a fighter type aircraft may affect cervical alignment and neck pain.Moon BJ, Choi KH, Yun C, Ha Y.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND : Elevated ambient Pco 2 in the International Space Station (ISS) has been cited as a potential contributor to the vision impairment intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP), a significant health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. The elevation in ambient Pco 2 is rather modest and normal respiratory compensation could minimize the impact on arterial Pco 2 . METHODS: In nine male astronauts, breaths measured prior to a rebreathing maneuver were examined to assess inspired and end-tidal Pco 2 during upright seated preflight and in-flight conditions. RESULTS: Inspired Pco 2 increased from preflight baseline (0.6 ± 0.1 mmHg) to in flight (3.8 ± 0.4 mmHg). End-tidal Pco 2 also increased from preflight baseline (36.0 ± 3.2 mmHg) to in flight (42.1 ± 3.7 mmHg). The difference between end-tidal Pco 2 comparing in flight to preflight (6.1 ± 1.6 mmHg) was greater than the difference between inspired Pco 2 comparing preflight to in flight (3.3 ± 0.5 mmHg). DISCUSSION: The greater increase in end-tidal vs. inspired Pco 2 might reflect alveolar hypoventilation due to differences in ventilatory control with spaceflight. These data suggest that further studies should focus on arterial Pco 2 and acid-base balance to determine if CO 2 dilates cerebral and retinal vessels and might contribute to the incidence of VIIP in astronauts.Hughson RL, Yee NJ, Greaves DK.

We assessed the validity of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to detect changes in ICP.Subjects were eight patients undergoing medically necessary diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infusion testing for hydrocephalus. DPOAE measurements were obtained with an FDA-approved system at baseline and six controlled ICP levels in ∼3 mmHg increments in random order, with a range from 10.8 ± 2.9 mmHg (SD) at baseline to 32.3 ± 4.1 mmHg (SD) at level 6.For f2 frequencies between 800 and 1700 Hz, when ICP was ≥ 12 mmHg above baseline ICP, DPOAE angles increased significantly and DPOAE magnitudes decreased significantly, but less robustly.Significant changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude are seen when ICP is ≥ 12 mmHg above a subject's supine baseline ICP during CSF infusion testing. These results suggest that the changes in DPOAE angle and magnitude seen with change in ICP are physiologically based, and suggest that it should be possible to detect pathological ICP elevation using DPOAE measurements. To use DPOAE for noninvasive estimation of ICP during spaceflight will require baseline measurements in the head-up, supine, and head-down positions to obtain baseline DPOAE values at different ICP ranges.

An alternative way of classifying night FDPs was also examined to reveal possible subcategories that warrant special attention. METHODS: A total of 392 aircrew members (96 women) representing 24 airlines participated in the study. Their FDPs were measured by a diary, sleep by the diary and wrist-actigraphy, and fatigue by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) over 14 consecutive days. The KSS ratings given at top of descent (TOD) served as the main outcome. RESULTS: The probability of high fatigue (KSS ≥ 7) at TOD was 0.41 and 0.32 during long (&gt;10 h) and short night (≤10 h) FDPs, respectively. The corresponding value was 0.19 for early starts, 0.31 for late finishes, 0.34 for night FDPs, and 0.15 for day FDPs (reference). The main predictors of high fatigue were FDP’s encroachment on the window of circadian low (WOCL, 02:00 h–05:59 h) and prior sleep. Within the night category, FDPs fully covering the WOCL showed the highest probability of high fatigue at TOD (0.42). DISCUSSION: Late finish and night FDPs warrant special attention in fatigue management. Within the night category, the same holds for FDPs that fully cover the WOCL. To manage fatigue, adjustments of the FTLs seem to be a limited strategy and therefore other measures, including maximizing preflight sleep, are needed.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The dose-effect relationships between different levels of hypergravity (&gt; +1.0 G z ) and steady-state hemodynamic parameters have been reported in several studies. However, little has been reported on the dose-effect relationship between hypergravity levels and estimates of autonomic circulatory regulation, such as heart rate variability, arterial pressure variability, and spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity. We investigated dose-effect relationships between hypergravity levels from +1.0 G z to +2.0 G z (0.5 G z ) and autonomic circulatory regulation to test our hypothesis that autonomic circulatory regulation has a linear relationship with hypergravity levels. METHODS: Using a short-arm human centrifuge, 10 healthy seated men were subjected to +1.0 G z , +1.5 G z , and +2.0 G z hypergravity. We evaluated steady-state hemodynamic parameters and autonomic circulatory regulation indices. Heart rate variability, arterial pressure variability, and spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity between arterial pressure and R-R interval variabilities were assessed by spectral analysis, sequence analysis, and transfer function analysis. RESULTS: Steady-state heart rate, stroke volume, and sequence slope (indicating spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity in response to rapid changes in arterial pressure) showed linear correlations with increases in gravity (from +1.0 G z to +2.0 G z ). On the other hand, steady-state cardiac output, steady-state systolic arterial pressure, and low-frequency power of diastolic arterial pressure (indicating peripheral vasomotor sympathetic activity) remained unchanged with gravity increases. CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, the present study suggested that autonomic circulatory regulations show complex changes with hypergravity levels. Spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity reduces in a dose-dependent manner from +1.0 G z to +2.0 G z , whereas peripheral vasomotor sympathetic activity seems to be maintained.Ueda K, Ogawa Y, Yanagida R, Aoki K, Iwasaki K.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During hypoxia an operators cognitive performance may decline. This decline is linked to altered brain metabolism, resulting in decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Ketone bodies are an alternative substrate to glucose for brain metabolic requirements; previous studies have shown that the presence of elevated ketone bodies in the blood maintains brain ATP levels and reduces cerebral glycolysis during hypoxia. Thus, ketones may be a strategy to mitigate cognitive decline in hypoxia. Ketone ester (KE) consumption allows rapid elevation of blood ketone levels; therefore, we investigated the effects of consuming a KE drink on cognitive performance during hypoxia. Here, we report results of a pilot study. METHODS: There were 11 subjects who completed a cognitive performance test battery under conditions of normoxia and hypoxia following consumption of a KE drink and a placebo control drink. RESULTS: Significant hypoxia effects (O 2 saturation minimum was found to range between 63 and 88 in subjects) were found for blink duration (Ph2 0.665) and blink rate (Ph2 0.626), indicating that the hypoxia condition was associated with longer blink durations and lower blink rates. Significant hypoxia effects were likewise observed for a code substitution task (Ph2 0.487), indicating that performance on the task was significantly disrupted by the hypoxia stressor. KE consumption had a significant effect on blink duration (Ph2 0.270) and the code substitution task (Ph2 0.309). DISCUSSION: These finding suggest that some effects of acute hypoxia can be mitigated by nutritional ketosis. Coleman K, Phillips J, Sciarini M, Stubbs B, Jackson O, Kernagis D.

This exploratory, correlational survey study was designed to evaluate the presence of patterns and relationships that may require further examination to understand causal factors. METHODS: The study population consisted of U.S. Army aviation crewmembers. Subjects (467) completed an anonymous survey, including questions regarding demographics, airframes, experience, pain history and severity, ergonomics, mitigation strategies, and duty limitations. RESULTS: Overall, 84.6% of participants reported back pain at some time during their flying career, with 77.8% reporting back pain in the last calendar year. Age was found to significantly correlate with earlier time to pain during flight, higher pain rating after flight, and occurrence of grounding. A stepwise linear regression model was used to explore the relationships between age, flight hours, and years of aviation experience, demonstrating age to be the significant variable accounting for the observed variance. Aircrew reported wear of combat-related survival equipment and poor lumbar support to be the most notable contributors. DISCUSSION: Back pain rates were consistent with previous studies. The relationship of age to back pain in this study may highlight unique pathophysiological pathways that should be further investigated within an occupational context to better understand the etiologic role. Enhanced seated lumbar support and combat-related survival equipment remain relatively low-cost/high-yield topics worthy of further investigation for exploiting efficient means to improve health, safety, and operational performance.Kelley AM, MacDonnell J, Grigley D, Campbell J, Gaydos SJ.

Flight performance of the pilots, pilot's alertness level, Spo2, heart rate (HR), minute ventilation (VE), and breathing frequency (BF) were measured.A significant difference was found in Flight Profile Accuracy (FPA) between the three altitudes. Post hoc analysis showed no significant difference in performance between 91 m and 3048 m. A trend was observed at 4572 m, suggesting a decrease in flight performance at that altitude. Significantly lower alertness levels were observed at the start of the flight at 4572 m compared to 91 m, and at the end of the flight at 4572 m compared to the start at that altitude. Spo2 and BF decreased, and HR increased significantly with altitude.The present study did not provide decisive evidence for a decrease in flight performance during exposure to simulated altitudes of 3048 and 4572 m. However, large interindividual variation in pilots' flight performance combined with a gradual decrease in alertness levels observed in the present study puts into question the ability of pilots to safely fly an aircraft while exposed to these altitudes without supplemental oxygen.Steinman Y, van den Oord MHAH, Frings-Dresen MHW, Sluiter JK.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The auditory system is not as heavily involved in the pilot’s spatial orientation as the visual and vestibular systems; however, it plays a significant role in the cockpit for communication and warning information. The aim of this research was to investigate the combined effect of selective auditory attention and simulator-induced spatial disorientation (SD) cues on pilots’ flight performance. We hypothesized that the flight performance in both disoriented and oriented flight profiles would be impaired by selective auditory attention. METHODS: Using an SD simulator, 40 male military pilots ( M = 31.9; SD = 7.41) were exposed to 12 flight sequences, where 6 contained a SD-conflict, 3 with motion illusions and 3 with visual illusions. The pilots performed a duration discrimination task (DDT) involving sound stimuli while completing these profiles under SD-conflict and nonconflict conditions. RESULTS: In five flight profiles tested, the DDT and SD cues increased the pilots’ cognitive workload, adversely affecting their flight performance. In the approach and landing profiles involving visual illusions, significant differences between the control and DDT groups were found for both nonconflict and SD-conflict flight sequences, whereas differences were only significant between nonconflict and SD-conflict flights for the two vestibular SD profiles. DISCUSSION: The results obtained partially support our hypothesis that performing the DDT, even in the absence of SD-conflict, significantly affects pilots’ flight performance. In some cases, despite the large increase in cognitive workload, pilots did not activate the “posture first” principle. Pilots should be trained not to respond to auditory stimuli until they have recovered their spatial orientation. Lewkowicz R, Stróżak P, Bałaj B, Francuz P, Augustynowicz P.

Even though flight traffic has increased, there are new fears. Valid studies are needed to answer whether there have been changes in the prevalence of flight anxiety, are there sex differences in relation to fear of flying, use of alcohol, and tranquilizers, which situations cause the most flight anxiety, and whether the above factors have changed compared to a similar study from 1986. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to a representative random sample of the Norwegian population ( N = 5500), where 36% answered. To assess flight anxiety across the time period, we used similar instruments to those we used in 1986. RESULTS: The prevalence of an assumed flight phobia decreased from 8% in 1986 to 3% in 2015. The percentage of those reported to never fly had decreased from 5% in 1986 to 0.5% in 2015. There were 11.0% who always used alcohol in 1986 and 7.5% in 2015 and 3% and 2%, respectively, always used tranquillizers. More women reported being afraid of both flying and other situations compared to men. Turbulence, unknown sounds, and fear of terror attacks caused the most anxiety.

However, in spite of methodology, people are significantly less afraid of flying than in 1986. Grimholt TK, Bonsaksen T, Schou-Bredal I, Heir T, Lerdal A, Skogstad L, Ekeberg Ø.

Studies have also illustrated a link between long-term low-level organophosphate pesticide exposure and depression.A questionnaire containing the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 depression screener was e-mailed to 52,080 aircraft maintenance workers (with N = 4801 complete responses) in a cross-sectional study to determine prevalence and severity of depression and descriptions of their occupational exposures.There was no significant difference between reported depression prevalence and severity in similar exposure groups in which aircraft maintenance workers were exposed or may have been exposed to organophosphate esters compared to similar exposure groups in which they were not exposed. However, a dichotomous measure of the prevalence of depression was significantly associated with self-reported exposure levels from low (OR: 1.21) to moderate (OR: 1.68) to high exposure (OR: 2.70) and with each exposure route including contact (OR: 1.68), inhalation (OR: 2.52), and ingestion (OR: 2.55). A self-reported four-level measure of depression severity was also associated with a self-reported four-level measure of exposure.Based on self-reported exposures and outcomes, an association is observed between organophosphate exposure and depression; however, we cannot assume that the associations we observed are causal because some workers may have been more likely to report exposure to organophosphate esters and also more likely to report depression. Future studies should consider using a larger sample size, better methods for characterizing crew chief exposures, and bioassays to measure dose rather than exposure.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates personality traits as potential factors for success in an astronaut selection by comparing personality profiles of unsuccessful and successful astronaut candidates in different phases of the ESA selection procedure. It is further addressed whether personality traits could predict an overall assessment rating at the end of the selection.In 2008/2009, ESA performed an astronaut selection with 902 candidates who were either psychologically recommended for mission training (N = 46) or failed in basic aptitude (N = 710) or Assessment Center and interview testing (N = 146). Candidates completed the Temperament Structure Scales (TSS) and the NEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO-PI-R).Those candidates who failed in basic aptitude testing showed higher levels of Neuroticism (M = 49.8) than the candidates who passed that phase (M = 45.4 and M = 41.6). Additionally, candidates who failed in basic testing had lower levels of Agreeableness (M = 132.9) than recommended candidates (M = 138.1). TSS scales for Achievement (r = 0.19) and Vitality (r = 0.18) showed a significant correlation with the overall assessment rating given by a panel board after a final interview.Results indicate that a personality profile similar to Helmreich's \"Right Stuff\" is beneficial in astronaut selection. Influences of test anxiety on performance are discussed. Mittelstädt JM, Pecena Y, Oubaid V, Maschke P. Psychometric personality differences between candidates in astronaut selection.

    "abstract": "Flight-induced neck pain is common in high performance jet pilots, with incidents frequently attributed to high Gz flight maneuvers. The additional load of helmet-mounted night vision goggles (NVG) is believed to increase the risk, possibly from neck muscle strain in counteracting muscles. Hence, the aim was to investigate the effect of NVG on neck muscle strain as well as on the activity level distribution through a simulated flight session in air force pilots.In this post hoc randomized crossover trial, four senior air force pilots each completed two identical 1.5-h dynamic flight simulations in a human centrifuge: one with a standard helmet and NVG, and one with a standard helmet only. Simulations included repeated exposure to 3-7 Gz, during which neck muscle activity was recorded bilaterally from the anterior neck, the upper and lower posterior neck, and the upper shoulders. The number of muscle activities surpassing 50% of maximum voluntary electrical activity (MVE) and total time of activity at each MVE percentile were compared between NVG and control flights.There was no overall effect in number of neck strain activities between NVG and control flights; however, significantly more activities emerged in the anterior neck. In addition, MVE percentile data showed a tendency of higher activity in the lower posterior neck during NVG flights.The results showed that the additional load of helmet-mounted NVG increases neck muscle strain in anterior stabilizing muscles, indicating that the inertia of head-worn NVG elevates the risk of flight-related neck pain.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aviation is a classic example of a high reliability organization (HRO)—an organization in which catastrophic events are expected to occur without control measures. As health care systems transition toward high reliability, aviation practices are increasingly transferred for clinical implementation. METHODS: A PubMed search using the terms aviation, crew resource management, and patient safety was undertaken. Manuscripts authored by physician pilots and accident investigation regulations were analyzed. Subject matter experts involved in adoption of aviation practices into the medical field were interviewed. RESULTS: A PubMed search yielded 621 results with 22 relevant for inclusion. Improved clinical outcomes were noted in five research trials in which aviation practices were adopted, particularly with regard to checklist usage and crew resource-management training. Effectiveness of interventions was influenced by intensity of application, leadership involvement, and provision of staff training. The usefulness of incorporating mishap investigation techniques has not been established. Whereas aviation accident investigation is highly standardized, the investigation of medical error is characterized by variation. DISCUSSION: The adoption of aviation practices into clinical medicine facilitates an evolution toward high reliability. Evidence for the efficacy of the checklist and crew resource-management training is robust. Transference of aviation accident investigation practices is preliminary. A standardized, independent investigation process could facilitate the development of a safety culture commensurate with that achieved in the aviation industry.Powell-Dunford N, McPherson MK, Pina JS, Gaydos SJ.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective assessment of psychophysiological arousal during challenging flight maneuvers is of great interest to aerospace medicine, but remains a challenging task. In the study presented here, a vector-methodological approach was used which integrates different psychophysiological variables, yielding an integral arousal index called the Psychophysiological Arousal Value (PAV). METHODS: The arousal levels of 15 male pilots were assessed during predetermined, well-defined flight maneuvers performed under simulated and real flight conditions. RESULTS: The physiological data, as expected, revealed inter- and intra-individual differences for the various measurement conditions. As indicated by the PAV, air-to-air refueling (AAR) turned out to be the most challenging task. In general, arousal levels were comparable between simulator and real flight conditions. However, a distinct difference was observed when the pilots were divided by instructors into two groups based on their proficiency in AAR with AWACS (AAR-Novices vs. AAR-Professionals). AAR-Novices had on average more than 2000 flight hours on other aircrafts. They showed higher arousal reactions to AAR in real flight (contact: PAV score 8.4 ± 0.37) than under simulator conditions (7.1 ± 0.30), whereas AAR-Professionals did not (8.5 ± 0.46 vs. 8.8 ± 0.80). DISCUSSION: The psychophysiological arousal value assessment was tested in field measurements, yielding quantifiable arousal differences between proficiency groups of pilots during simulated and real flight conditions. The method used in this study allows an evaluation of the psychophysiological cost during a certain flying performance and thus is possibly a valuable tool for objectively evaluating the actual skill status of pilots.Johannes B, Rothe S, Gens A, Westphal S, Birkenfeld K, Mulder E, Rittweger J, Ledderhos C.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There are limited data on cardiac dysrhythmias in laypersons during hypergravity exposure. We report layperson electrocardiograph (ECG) findings and tolerance of dysrhythmias during centrifuge-simulated suborbital spaceflight. METHODS: Volunteers participated in varied-length centrifuge training programs of 2–7 centrifuge runs over 0.5–2 d, culminating in two simulated suborbital spaceflights of combined +G z and +G x (peak +4.0 G z, +6.0 G x , duration 5 s). Monitors recorded pre- and post-run mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), 6-s average heart rate (HR) collected at prespecified points during exposures, documented dysrhythmias observed on continuous 3-lead ECG, self-reported symptoms, and objective signs of intolerance on real-time video monitoring. RESULTS: Participating in the study were 148 subjects (43 women). Documented dysrhythmias included sinus pause ( N = 5), couplet premature ventricular contractions ( N = 4), bigeminy ( N = 3), accelerated idioventricular rhythm ( N = 1), and relative bradycardia (RB, defined as a transient HR drop of &gt;20 bpm; N = 63). None were associated with subjective symptoms or objective signs of acceleration intolerance. Episodes of RB occurred only during +G x exposures. Subjects had a higher post-run vs. pre-run MAP after all exposures, but demonstrated no difference in pre- and post-run HR. RB was more common in men, younger individuals, and subjects experiencing more centrifuge runs. DISCUSSION: Dysrhythmias in laypersons undergoing simulated suborbital spaceflight were well tolerated, though RB was frequently noted during short-duration +G x exposure. No subjects demonstrated associated symptoms or objective hemodynamic sequelae from these events. Even so, heightened caution remains warranted when monitoring dysrhythmias in laypersons with significant cardiopulmonary disease or taking medications that modulate cardiac conduction.Suresh R, Blue RS, Mathers CH, Castleberry TL, Vanderploeg JM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Over 500 people from different countries have been to space since the first manned spaceflight in 1961. Factors of space and spaceflights might cause functional and somatic disorders, leading to increased mortality. Our research goal was to assess cause-specific risk of death among Soviet and Russian cosmonauts who had at least one spaceflight. METHODS: The epidemiological cohort study included 115 male cosmonauts. The observation period was 54 yr (January 1, 1961–December 31, 2014) and 2707 person-years of follow-up were obtained. By the end of the period, 84 cosmonauts were still alive and 31 were deceased. The reference groups were the male population of Russia and of the Moscow Region, where Zvezdny City (Star City) is located. Mortality risk was assessed by standardized mortality ratio (SMR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Death risk in the cohort was significantly lower than that in both reference groups: for all causes (А00–Y98; SMR = 40), for diseases of the circulatory system (I00–I99; SMR = 37 and 35 compared to Russia and the Moscow Region, respectively), and for other causes, i.e., all causes except circulatory diseases, cancer, and accidents, (SMR = 8). Death risk for accidents (V01–Y98) in the cohort was 1.8–1.9 times lower than that in both reference groups: SMR = 52 (95% CI 19–139) and 56 (21–151), but was not statistically significant. SMR for cancer (C00–C97) was also below 100 (71 and 66), but insignificant. DISCUSSION: Our findings mainly characterize mortality among the first cosmonauts who have flown to space from 1961 through the 1970s, which indicates the necessity of continuing research.Ushakov IB, Voronkov YI, Bukhtiyarov IV, Tikhonova GI, Gorchakova TYu, Bryleva MS.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fatigue plays a critical role in mission success due to its effect on a number of performance variables. The purpose of this study was to gauge the extent to which U.S. Army aviators experience subjective fatigue on a regular basis presently as well as their perceptions of their own sleep quality, quantity, and daytime sleepiness. This information is valuable for prioritizing future research lines with respect to injury prevention and fatigue management as well as updating policy. METHODS: An anonymous, 125-item questionnaire was completed by 214 U.S. Army aviators. A subset of those items (15 questions related to fatigue) are reported in this study. Subjects were primarily male and the mean age was 33 yr. RESULTS: Results suggest that the majority of subjects sleep less than the recommended 8 h per night and nearly half of them report sleeping less than their own preferred amount of sleep. Approximately 40% of the sample indicated that they believed fatigue to be a widespread problem in the U.S. Army aviation community. DISCUSSION: Overall, the findings identified factors contributing to fatigue and performance degradation currently experienced by those sampled in this study. Specifically, inconsistent shiftwork, less than optimal levels of rest, and poor sleep quality in the field were identified. Compared to past research, the extent to which fatigue is perceived to be a widespread problem is significantly lower than reported 15 yr prior. Kelley AM, Feltman KA, Curry IP.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clinical accuracy of pulse oximeters (giving S p o 2 ) is routinely tested down to an S a o 2 of 70%, but lower oxygen saturations are often experienced during hypobaric hypoxia. Cerebral (S c o 2 ) and peripheral tissue (S t o 2 ) oxygen saturations can be measured using near infra-red spectroscopy. In a project simulating oxygen system failure during high altitude-high opening parachuting (HAHO), S a o 2 , S p o 2 , S c o 2 , and forearm S t o 2 were measured. The aim of the present analysis was to explore the agreement between S a o 2 and the three noninvasive measurements of hypoxemia (S p o 2 , S c o 2 , and S t o 2 ). METHODS: Healthy volunteers from the Norwegian Special Operations Commando were studied in a hypobaric chamber as supplemental oxygen was removed at 301 hPa ambient pressure (30,000 ft) and recompressed at 25 hPa · min -1 (1000 ft · min -1 ) to ground level simulating a HAHO parachute flight. S a o 2 was compared with S p o 2 , S c o 2 , and S t o 2 in scatterplots and Bland-Altman plots, calculating bias and limits of agreement (LOA). RESULTS: The bias ± LOA were: S a o 2 vs. S p o 2 : −5.8% ± 16, S a o 2 vs. S c o 2 : −3.4% ± 11, and S a o 2 vs. S t o 2 : 17% ± 30. The bias for S a o 2 vs. S p o 2 was dependent on the range of values, and correcting for this with a sloped bias line reduced the LOA to ± 8.2%. DISCUSSION: There were wide limits of agreement between S a o 2 and S p o 2 . S a o 2 and S c o 2 agreed better, whereas S a o 2 and forearm S t o 2 had wide LOA. The agreement between S a o 2 and S p o 2 improved when correcting for the underestimation of S p o 2 at low values.

The aim of the study was assessment of the effect of an extended day of flight duty and a compressed work week with regard to recovery, cumulative fatigue, and neurobehavioral performance. METHODS: We followed 18 pilots and 41 cabin crewmembers during four consecutive days of flight duty, comprising a total of ≥ 39 h, where the first day was ≥ 10 h. Information on demographics, work characteristics, health status, and physical activity was collected at baseline. Subjects completed logs for the first and fourth workday, including the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Checklist at three time points during these workdays. Two computer-based neurobehavioral tests were completed the evening prior to the first shift, and after the first and the fourth day of the work period. RESULTS: Number of flight sectors during the work period was 10–20. Self-reported fatigue levels increased during the workdays. Neurobehavioral test-scores did not deteriorate. The effects of each additional flight sector during the work period was elevated reaction times (RT) both among cabin crewmembers (B = 5.05 ms, 95% CI 0.6, 9.5) and pilots (B = 4.95 ms, 95% CI 0.4, 9.5). Precision was unaffected. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots and cabin crewmembers seem to obtain satisfactory sleep before and during the period of 4 consecutive days.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Actual studies in military training support the use of new methodological approaches such as high intensity interval training and inverse periodization training rather than conventional approaches. However, the application and analysis of success of these new methodologies are as yet unknown.METHODS: The military adapted the civil reverse periodization training system, composed of 6 wk and five sessions per week. For the first 3 wk soldiers performed two sessions with the objective of increasing the maximal strength of the upper and lower body muscles, and three sessions of short high-intensity interval training (HIIT). In the following 3 wk they combined two endurance HIIT and two resistance HIIT sessions with military equipment while conducting a military task.RESULTS: After the training a significant body mass index decrease was found, along with an increase in lower limb muscular strength, aerobic and anaerobic performance, resilience, stress tolerance, and psychological flexibility. Regarding the ratio of acceptance there was an increased ratio compared to previous years of 7%. In addition, married soldiers with children presented greater resilience, stress tolerance, psychological flexibility, and a higher ratio of success.DISCUSSION: Accepted soldiers presented greater psychological status and stress tolerance, highlighting the importance of the work of the unit psychologists to reinforce and monitor the psychometric profile of the soldiers as well as their intrinsic characteristics of personality and emotionality. The greater baseline physical condition and higher performance in all physical tests proves how reverse periodization training models are a great stimuli and training approach in soldiers.Tornero-Aguilera JF, Gregório Pelarigo J, Clemente-Suarez VJ.

Gynecologic considerations constitute one facet of medical risk for female astronauts. This manuscript will review the preflight, in-flight, and postflight clinical evaluation, management, and prevention considerations for reducing gynecologic and reproductive risks in female astronauts.METHODS: Relevant gynecological articles from databases including Ovid, Medline, Web of Science, various medical libraries, and NASA archives were evaluated for this review. In particular, articles addressing preventive measures or management of conditions in resource-limited environments were evaluated for applicability to future long-duration exploration spaceflight.RESULTS: Topics including abnormal uterine bleeding, anemia, bone mineral density, ovarian cysts, venous thromboembolism, contraception, fertility, and health maintenance were reviewed. Prevention and treatment strategies are discussed with a focus on management options that consider limitations of onboard medical capabilities.DISCUSSION: Long-duration exploration spaceflight will introduce new challenges for maintenance of gynecological and reproductive health. The impact of the space environment outside of low-Earth orbit on gynecological concerns remains unknown, with factors such as increased particle radiation exposure adding complexity and potential risk. While the most effective means of minimizing the impact of gynecologic or reproductive pathology for female astronauts is screening and prevention, gynecological concerns can arise unpredictably as they do on Earth.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sea travel leads to well-known changes in gait, but these effects have not been evaluated using quantitative data obtained through controlled experiments. We obtained quantitative data on step-timing patterns as experienced maritime crewmembers walked on a ship at sea. METHODS: Using a within-subjects design, crewmembers walked back and forth along straight line paths (11 m long) that were parallel with the ship’s long (i.e., fore-aft) and short (i.e., athwart) axes. Using contact switches attached to the feet, we measured temporal parameters of gait, including stride time, the variability of stride time, and the coefficient of variation. We also evaluated the temporal dynamics of stride times using detrended fluctuation analysis. RESULTS: The variability of stride time differed between walking fore-aft (mean = 0.10 s) and walking athwart (mean = 0.28 s). The coefficient of variation also differed between walking fore-aft (mean = 11%) and walking athwart (mean = 43%). CONCLUSIONS: We obtained direct evidence that ship motions in roll and pitch differentially affect the timing of stepping patterns in human gait.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep deprivation is known to be a common problem in the U.S. Navy and has been documented using wrist-worn actigraphy in various operational studies that typically span 2 to 4 wk in duration. However, sleep patterns over an extended period of time have not been objectively measured. CASE REPORT: This 6-mo study used actigraphy and the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST) to quantify the sleep patterns of a 39-yr-old Commanding Officer (CO) of an Arleigh Burke class destroyer while the ship was forward-deployed. On average, the CO received 5.2 h of sleep daily and averaged 6 h time in bed each day. The participant received more than 8 h of sleep for only 2% ( N = 3) of the study days; for 17% ( N = 27) of the days, he received less than 4 h of daily sleep. For 15% of waking time, the CO had a predicted effectiveness of less than 70% on the FAST scale, equating to a blood alcohol equivalent of 0.08%—or legally drunk. The CO’s predicted effectiveness was below 65% approximately 10% of waking time. DISCUSSION: Results from this study are aligned with earlier research showing that crewmembers on U.S. Navy ships suffer from chronic sleep restriction. During a typical deployment, personnel accrue a considerable sleep debt even during normal operations. Should critical events with additional sleep restriction occur, the ship has limited reserve capacity, potentially placing her crew and their mission in grave jeopardy.Shattuck NL, Matsangas P.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study investigated pilots’ ability by examining the effects of flight experience and task demand on physiological reactions, and analyzing the diagnostic meanings underlying correlated parameters. METHOD: A total of 12 experienced pilots and 12 less experienced pilots performed 4 simulated flight tasks, including normal and emergency situations. Fixation duration (FD), saccade rate (SR), blink rate (BR), heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and respiration amplitude (RA) were measured during the tasks. RESULTS: More experienced pilots adapted their SR flexibly to changing task demands and had significantly lower SR than less experienced pilots during emergency tasks (29.6 ± 20.0 vs. 70.1 ± 67.1 saccades/min). BR, HR, and RR were affected by pilot experience but not by task demand. More experienced pilots had lower BR, HR, and RR than less experienced pilots during both normal tasks (BR: 14.3 ± 13.0 vs. 32.9 ± 25.8 blinks/min; HR: 72.7 ± 7.9 vs. 83.2 ± 7.2 bpm; RR: 15.4 ± 2.1 vs. 19.5 ± 5.2 breaths/min) and emergency tasks (BR: 10.2 ± 5.0 vs. 32.3 ± 20.8 blinks/min; HR: 73.3 ± 7.3 vs. 82.2 ± 11.6 bpm; RR: 15.6 ± 1.9 vs. 18.0 ± 3.2 breaths/min). FD and RA were not sensitive to either flight experience or task demand. CONCLUSIONS: Physiological reactions have the potential to reflect pilots’ ability from different aspects. SR and BR could indicate pilots’ differences in information access strategy. HR and RR could reflect a pilot’s physical fitness.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A case of unilateral optic neuropathy secondary to barotrauma following a medial orbital wall fracture is presented. CASE REPORT: A 41-yr-old U.S. Air Force aviator presented for a routine periodic health assessment. Evaluation uncovered a suspected acquired color deficiency in the right eye (OD). Subsequent discussions with the patient revealed a history of eye pain, redness, and proptosis during a flight overseas several years earlier. Local ocular examination demonstrated asymmetric optic nerve cupping, optic nerve pallor OD, a mild asymmetric color deficit, and a significant visual field defect OD. Evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging revealed findings consistent with an old medial orbital wall fracture OD and optic nerve findings consistent with optic neuropathy. Follow-up evaluation by neurology and otorhinolaryngology demonstrated only extensive sinus pathology. Based upon these findings, it is postulated that the member suffered a medial orbital wall fracture at altitude during ascent caused by expanding ethmoid sinus gases due to abnormal sinus anatomy with subsequent right optic nerve injury leading to an optic neuropathy and subsequent visual sequelae. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates one possible complication of active sinus disease while working in the aerospace environment. Several case reports have been published demonstrating the potential link between eye injuries and working in an environment with fluctuating atmospheric pressure. However, literature addressing the specific in-flight environment causing such complications is lacking. Furthermore, the case supports the need for versatility and a broad knowledge base in practicing flight surgeons to evaluate ocular pathology.Powell MR, Hurley LD, Richardson TC.

The subjective vertical (SV) conflict theory postulates that all motion sickness provoking situations are characterized by a condition in which the SV sensed from gravity and visual and idiotropic cues differs from the expected vertical. This theory has been successfully used to predict motion sickness in different vehicles on Earth. METHOD: We have summarized the most outstanding and recent studies on the illusions and characteristics associated with spatial disorientation and SMS during weightlessness, such as cognitive map and mental rotation, the visual reorientation and inversion illusions, and orientation preferences between visual scenes and the internal z-axis of the body. RESULTS: The relationships between the SV and the incidence of and susceptibility to SMS as well as spatial disorientation were addressed.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Future commercial spaceflight participants (SFPs) with conditions requiring personal medical devices represent a unique challenge. The behavior under stress of cardiac implanted devices (CIDs) such as pacemakers is of special concern. No known data currently exist on how such devices may react to the stresses of spaceflight. We examined the responses of two volunteer subjects with CIDs to G forces in a centrifuge to evaluate how similar potential commercial SFPs might tolerate the forces of spaceflight. CASE REPORT: Two subjects, 75- and 79-yr-old men with histories of atrial fibrillation and implanted dual-lead, rate-responsive pacemakers, underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d. Day 1 consisted of two +G z runs (peak = +3.5 G z , run 2) and two +G x runs (peak = +6.0 G x , run 4). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G x /+G z ). Data collected included blood pressures, electrocardiograms, pulse oximetry, neurovestibular exams, and postrun questionnaires regarding motion sickness, disorientation, greyout, and other symptoms. Despite both subjects’ significant medical histories, neither had abnormal physiological responses. Post-spin analysis demonstrated no lead displacement, damage, or malfunction of either CID. DISCUSSION: Potential risks to SFPs with CIDs include increased arrhythmogenesis, lead displacement, and device damage. There are no known prior studies of individuals with CIDs exposed to accelerations anticipated during the dynamic phases of suborbital spaceflight. These cases demonstrate that even individuals with significant medical histories and implanted devices can tolerate the acceleration exposures of commercial spaceflight. Further investigation will determine which personal medical devices present significant risks during suborbital flight and beyond.Blue RS, Reyes DP, Castleberry TL, Vanderploeg JM.

This study investigated whether FAs are at higher risk for sleep disturbance compared to teachers, as assessed by questionnaire, diary, and activity monitors. METHODS: Sleep/wake cycles of 45 FAs and 25 teachers were studied. For one menstrual cycle, participants wore an activity monitor and kept a daily diary. Sleep metrics included total sleep in the main sleep period (MSP), sleep efficiency (proportion of MSP spent sleeping), and nocturnal sleep fraction (proportion of sleep between 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. home time). Relationships between sleep metrics and occupation were analyzed with mixed and generalized linear models. RESULTS: Both actigraph and diary data suggest that FAs sleep longer than teachers. However, several actigraph indices of sleep disturbance indicated that FAs incurred significant impairment of sleep compared to teachers. FAs were more likely than teachers to have poor sleep efficiency [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for lowest quartile of sleep efficiency = 1.9, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.2 – 3.0] and to have a smaller proportion of their sleep between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. home time (adjusted OR for lowest quartile of nocturnal sleep fraction = 3.1, CI 1.1 -9.0).

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed among 911 aviators who filled out the lifestyle questionnaire and underwent medical examinations at the ROK Air Force Aerospace Medical Center. Clinical markers of aviators with MetS were investigated and odds ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Among the 911 aviators, 90 (9.9%) were found to have MetS and the prevalence of subcomponents were: 31.7% elevated blood pressure, 25.3% elevated waist circumference, 19.0% impaired glucose tolerance, 16.6% elevated triglycerides, 7.9% reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Among aviators, a significant statistical association was found between the diagnosis of MetS with the highest quartile of uric acid, white blood cell (WBC) count, and alanine transaminase (ALT) level. Adjusted odds ratio of MetS was 8.88 (3.16 ∼24.99) if all three clinical markers were at highest quartile range. DISCUSSION: Despite the relatively low prevalence of MetS in ROK Air Force aviators, further preventive measures are required as the prevalence is expected to increase in the future. Aviators with high levels of WBC count, uric acid, and ALT should be examined for MetS. Further comprehensive cohort study is required to link the elevation of clinical markers and development of MetS.Rhee C, Kim J, Kim J-Y, Chang E, Park S, Lee W, Kang H.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bed rest studies have shown that high load (HL) resistance training can mitigate the loss of muscle size and strength during musculoskeletal unloading; however, not all individuals are able to perform HL resistance exercise. Blood flow restricted (BFR) resistance exercise may be a novel way to prevent maladaptation to unloading without requiring HL exercise equipment. This study evaluated the muscular training adaptations to HL and BFR resistance training during unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), a human limb unloading model. ULLS allows for evaluation of exercise training in both weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing legs within the same individual. METHODS: There were 13 participants who completed 25 d of ULLS and were counterbalanced to: 1) HL, N = 6; or 2) BFR, N = 7, training groups. During ULLS, HL and BFR performed unilateral leg press and heel raise exercise (3 d/wk). RESULTS: In weight-bearing legs, both HL and BFR increased knee extensor muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and strength. In nonweight-bearing legs, knee extensor CSA and strength increased only in HL and decreased with BFR. CONCLUSION: HL and BFR resistance exercise were both effective exercise programs for the weight-bearing leg. However, BFR exercise was not as effective as HL resistance exercise in the nonweight-bearing leg. These data show that exercise that improved muscle CSA and strength in ambulatory weight-bearing conditions was not sufficient to maintain muscle function during unloading. For the preservation of muscle CSA and strength, BFR exercise should be considered an adjunct but not a primary exercise countermeasure for future space missions.Hackney KJ, Downs ME, Ploutz-Snyder L.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A number of space activities (e.g., extravehicular astronaut rescue, cooperation in satellite services, space station supplies, and assembly) are implemented directly or assisted by remote robotic arms. Our study aimed to reveal those individual characteristics which could positively influence or even predict teleoperation performance of such a space robotic arm. METHODS: There were 64 male volunteers without robot operation experience recruited for the study. Their individual characteristics were assessed, including spatial cognitive ability, cognitive style, and personality traits. The experimental tasks were three abstracted teleoperation tasks of a simulated space robotic arm: point aiming, line alignment, and obstacle avoidance. Teleoperation performance was measured from two aspects: task performance (completion time, extra distance moved, operation slips) and safety performance (collisions, joint limitations reached). The Pearson coefficients between individual characteristics and teleoperation performance were examined along with performance prediction models. RESULTS: It was found that the subjects with relatively high mental rotation ability or low neuroticism had both better task and safety performance (| r| = 0.212 ∼ 0.381). Subjects with relatively high perspective taking ability or high agreeableness had better task performance ( r = −0.253; r = −0.249). Imagery subjects performed better than verbal subjects regarding both task and safety performance (| r| = 0.236 ∼ 0.290). Compared with analytic subjects, wholist subjects had better safety performance ( r = 0.300). Additionally, extraverted subjects had better task performance ( r = −0.259), but worse safety performance ( r = 0.230). CONCLUSIONS: Those with high spatial cognitive ability, imagery and wholist cognitive style, low neuroticism, and high agreeableness were seen to have more advantages in working with the remote robotic arm.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aerospace orthostatic intolerance garments (OIG) have historically been pneumatic (e.g., NASA’s antigravity suit), an approach that inhibits mobility and requires connection to an air supply. Elastic compression garments, an alternative technology, are difficult to don/doff and cannot be worn in a noncompressive state, resulting in discomfort and usability challenges. This research evaluates a novel technology—contractile shape memory alloy (SMA) knitted actuators—that can enable low-profile, dynamic compression for an aerospace OIG. METHODS: To characterize the functional capabilities of SMA knitted actuators, displacement control testing was conducted on 10 actuator samples with a range of geometric design parameters. Inactive ( F I ) and actuated forces ( F A ) were observed by repeatedly thermally cycling each sample at 0%, 15%, 30%, and 45% structural strain. Compression capabilities were approximated using medical compression hosiery standards and anthropometric data from a representative aerospace population (ANSUR 2012). RESULTS: Dynamic compression predictions reached 52 mmHg (single layer fabric) and 105 mmHg (double layer fabric) at the ankle. Low, inactive pressures ( p &lt; 20 mmHg) demonstrate that compression is controllable and can be dynamically increased upon actuation up to 33 mmHg in a single layer system and up to 67 mmHg in a double layer system. DISCUSSION: The results highlight the potential of SMA knitted actuators to enable low-profile, dynamic compression garments that can reach medically therapeutic pressures on an aerospace population to counteract OI symptoms. In addition to astronautic applications, this technology demonstrates widespread terrestrial medical and high-performance aircraft applicability.

The present study aimed to evaluate cognitive performance in pilot trainees who were exposed to acute normobaric (NH) and hypobaric hypoxia (HH). Of relevance for military pilots, we also aimed to assess cognitive performance in hypobaric normoxia (HN). METHODS: A total of 16 healthy pilot trainees were exposed to 4 randomized conditions (i.e., normobaric normoxia, NN, altitude level of 440 m; HH at 5500 m; NH, altitude simulation of 5500 m; and HN). Subjects performed a cognitive assessment (KLT-R test). Cerebral oxygen delivery (cDO 2 ) was estimated based middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) and pulse oxygen saturation (S p o 2 ) monitored during cognitive assessment. RESULTS: Percentage of errors increased in NH (14.3 9.1%) and HH (12.9 6.4%) when compared to NN (6.5 4.1%) and HN (6.0 4.0%). Number of calculations accomplished was lower only in HH than in NN and HN. When compared to NN, cDO 2 decreased in NH and HH.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During spaceflight missions, astronauts work in an extreme environment with several hazards to physical health and performance. Exposure to microgravity results in remarkable deconditioning of several physiological systems, leading to impaired physical condition and human performance, posing a major risk to overall mission success and crew safety. Physical exercise is the cornerstone of strategies to mitigate physical deconditioning during spaceflight. Decades of research have enabled development of more optimal exercise strategies and equipment onboard the International Space Station. However, the effects of microgravity cannot be completely ameliorated with current exercise countermeasures. Moreover, future spaceflight missions deeper into space require a new generation of spacecraft, which will place yet more constraints on the use of exercise by limiting the amount, size, and weight of exercise equipment and the time available for exercise. Space agencies are exploring ways to optimize exercise countermeasures for spaceflight, specifically exercise strategies that are more efficient, require less equipment, and are less time-consuming. Blood flow restriction exercise is a low intensity exercise strategy that requires minimal equipment and can elicit positive training benefits across multiple physiological systems. This method of exercise training has potential as a strategy to optimize exercise countermeasures during spaceflight and reconditioning in terrestrial and partial gravity environments. The possible applications of blood flow restriction exercise during spaceflight are discussed herein.Hughes L, Hackney KJ, Patterson SD.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Consistent blood biomarkers of hypobaric (altitude) decompression stress remain elusive. Recent laboratory investigation of decompression sickness risk at 25,000 ft (7620 m) enabled evaluation of early pathophysiological responses to exertional decompression stress. METHODS: In this study, 15 healthy men, aged 20–50 yr, undertook 2 consecutive (same-day) ascents to 25,000 ft (7620 m) for 60 and 90 min, breathing 100% oxygen, each following 1 h of prior denitrogenation. Venous blood was sampled at baseline (T0), immediately after the second ascent (T8), and next morning (T24). Analyses encompassed whole blood hematology, endothelial microparticles, and soluble markers of cytokine response, endothelial function, inflammation, coagulopathy, oxidative stress, and brain insult, plus cortisol and creatine kinase. RESULTS: Acute hematological effects on neutrophils (mean 72% increase), eosinophils (40% decrease), monocytes (37% increase), and platelets (7% increase) normalized by T24. Consistent elevation (mean five-fold) of the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) at T8 was proinflammatory and associated with venous gas emboli (microbubble) load. Levels of C-reactive protein and complement peptide C5a were persistently elevated at T24, the former by 100% over baseline. Additionally, glial fibrillary acidic protein, a sensitive marker of traumatic brain injury, increased by a mean 10% at T24. CONCLUSIONS: This complex composite environmental stress, comprising the triad of hyperoxia, decompression, and moderate exertion at altitude, provoked pathophysiological changes consistent with an IL-6 cytokine-mediated inflammatory response. Multiple persistent biomarker disturbances at T24 imply incomplete recovery the day after exposure. The elevation of glial fibrillary acidic protein similarly implies incomplete resolution following recent neurological insult.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Preselection of pilot candidates in the military is critical and determines the quality of subsequent selection. The Aero Medical Institute in Belgrade uses the following centrifuge endpoints: peripheral vision loss, heart rate above 180 bpm, cardiac arrhythmias, and G-induced loss of consciousness to assess relaxed +G z tolerance. The aim of this study was to evaluate heart rate variability (HRV) associated with cardiovascular adaptability to different types of stress as a predictor of +G z tolerance. METHODS: Thirty-six candidates were exposed to centrifuge runs, consisting of the following +G z -acceleration phases: a 2-G plateau followed by an increase to 5.5 G, a decrease to 2 G, and ending with a plateau. Time-domain HRV indices were calculated for candidates, for a 60-s 2-G plateau, and for the entire test. The correlation was made between the groups that did (Group 1) and did not meet the criteria (Group 2). RESULTS: The results show significantly lower values in all time domain HRV indices, namely standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences, in Group 2. Mean SDNN values were 45.98 ± 24.80 ms (2-G plateau) and 109.99 ± 39.64 ms (entire test) in Group 1, while the SDNN were 22.99 ± 12.04 ms and 69.70 ± 33.45 ms in Group 2. Root mean square of successive differences was higher in Group 1 for the 2-G plateau and for the entire test. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that HRV is positively correlated with +G z -tolerance and can be used as an additional selection tool for military aircrew.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exertional heatstroke (EHS) is a life-threatening condition that requires quick recognition and cooling for survival. Experts recommend using cooling modalities that reduce rectal temperature (T REC ) faster than 0.16°C/min though rates above 0.08°C/min are considered “acceptable.” Hyperthermic individuals treated in body bags filled with ice water (∼3°C) have excellent cooling rates (0.28 ± 0.09°C/min). However, clinicians may not have access to large amounts of ice or ice water when treating EHS victims. The purpose of this study was to determine if using a body bag filled with water near the upper limits of expert recommendations for EHS treatment would produce acceptable (&gt;0.08°C/min) or “ideal (&gt;0.16°C/min)” T REC cooling rates or different nadir values. METHODS: A total of 12 individuals (9 men, 3 women; age: 21 ± 2 yr; mass: 74.6 ± 10.2 kg; height: 179.5 ± 9.6 cm) exercised in the heat until T REC was 39.5°C. They lay supine while 211.4 ± 19.5 L of 10°C (Ten) or 15°C (Fifteen) water was poured into a body bag. Subjects cooled until T REC was 38°C. They exited the body bag and rested in the heat for 10 min. RESULTS: Subjects exercised in similar conditions and for similar durations (Ten = 46.3 ± 8.6 min, Fifteen = 46.2 ± 7.8 min). T REC cooling rates were faster in Ten than Fifteen (Ten = 0.18 ± 0.07°C/min, Fifteen = 0.14 ± 0.09°C/min). T REC nadir was slightly higher in Fifteen (37.3 ± 0.2°C) than Ten (37.1 ± 0.3°C). DISCUSSION: Body bag cooling rates met expert definitions of acceptable (Fifteen) and ideal (Ten) for EHS treatment. This information is valuable for clinicians who do not have access to or the resources for ice water cooling to treat EHS. Miller KC, Amaria NY.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cabin decompression presents a threat in high-altitude-capable aircraft. A chamber study was performed to compare effects of rapid (RD) vs. gradual decompression and gauge impairment at altitude with and without hypoxia, as well as to assess recovery. METHODS: There were 12 participants who completed RD (1 s) and Gradual (3 min 12 s) ascents from 2743–7620 m (9000–25000 ft) altitude pressures while breathing air or 100% O 2 . Physiological indices included oxygen saturation (S P o 2 ), heart rate (HR), respiration, end tidal O 2 and CO 2 partial pressures, and electroencephalography (EEG). Cognition was evaluated using SYNWIN, which combines memory, arithmetic, visual, and auditory tasks. The study incorporated ascent rate (RD, gradual), breathing gas (air, 100% O 2 ) and epoch (ground-level, pre-breathe, ascent-altitude, recovery) as factors. RESULTS: Physiological effects in hypoxic “air” ascents included decreased S P o 2 and end tidal O 2 and CO 2 partial pressures (hypocapnia), with elevated HR and minute ventilation ( E ); S P o 2 and HR effects were greater after RD (−7.3% lower and +10.0 bpm higher, respectively). HR and E decreased during recovery. SYNWIN performance declined during ascent in air, with key metrics, including composite score, falling further (−75% vs. −50%) after RD. Broad cognitive impairment was not recorded on 100% O 2 , nor in recovery. EEG signals showed increased slow-wave activity during hypoxia. DISCUSSION: In hypoxic exposures, RD impaired performance more than gradual ascent. Hypobaria did not comprehensively impair performance without hypoxia. Lingering impairment was not observed during recovery, but HR and E metrics suggested compensatory slowing following altitude stress. Participants’ cognitive strategy shifted as hypoxia progressed, with efficiency giving way to “satisficing,” redistributing effort to easier tasks.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Spatial disorientation (SD) remains the leading contributor to Class A mishaps in the U.S. Navy, consistent with historical trends. Despite this, SD training for military aircrew is largely confined to the classroom and experiential training replicating SD illusions is limited and infrequent. Static flight simulators are most commonly used for training but offer no vestibular stimulation to the flight crew, omitting the source of vestibular-mediated SD. BACKGROUND: We first cover vestibular-mediated SD illusions which may be replicated through galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in a static environment. GVS is a safe, reliable, low-cost avenue for providing vestibular sensory stimulation. We review the underlying mechanisms of GVS such as the excitement and inhibition of the afferent neurons innervating the vestibular system, particularly in the binaural bipolar electrode montage. APPLICATIONS: Two approaches for how GVS may be used to enhance SD training are examined. The first is a means for providing unreliable vestibular sensory perceptions to pilots, and the second details how GVS can be leveraged for replicating vestibular-mediated SD illusions. DISCUSSION: We recommend GVS be pursued as an enhancement to existing SD training. The ability to disorient aircrew in the safe training environment of a static flight simulator would allow for aircrew familiarization to SD, serving as an opportunity to practice life-saving checklist items to recover from SD. A repeatable training profile that could be worn by military aircrew in a static flight simulator may afford a low-cost training solution to the number one cause of fatalities in military aviation.

    "abstract": "Pilots have an increased incidence of cutaneous melanoma compared to the general population; occupational exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is one of several potential risk factors. Cockpit windshields effectively block UVB (280-315 nm) but further analysis is needed for UVA (315-400 nm). The objective of this observational study was to assess transmission of UVA through cockpit windshields and to measure doses of UVA at pilots' skin under daytime flying conditions. A spectrometer was used to measure in-flight spectral transmission through each of the 6 cockpit windshields in 15 Airbus A320/A321 jets, across 39 flights, most originating in or destined for Auckland, New Zealand. UVA- and UVA1-weighted dose rates were calculated from the recorded data. All front windshields blocked UVA effectively. Several cockpit side and rear windshields allowed transmission of UVA above approximately 350 nm. Diffuse, scattered light in the cockpit contributed negligible levels of UVA, but direct light through a poorly attenuating windshield allowed UVA1 (340-400 nm) doses of up to 2.29 mW · cm-2 on exposed skin. The use of shielding blinds on side windshields blocked UVA transmission effectively. Aircraft windshield manufacturers should ensure consistent UVA blocking capability of all cockpit windshields. Pilots should be encouraged to wear sunscreen on exposed skin and use side windshield visors if skin is in the direct light beam. Given the variable performance of cockpit windshields, and increased rates of skin cancer among pilots, further research on other commercial jet aircraft types is recommended.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Astronauts undergo CO 2 exposure training to recognize their symptoms that can arise acutely both on the ground and in spaceflight. This article describes acute CO 2 exposure training at NASA and examines the symptoms reported by astronauts during training. METHODS: In a controlled training environment, astronauts are exposed to up to 8% CO 2 (60 mmHg) by a rebreathing apparatus. Symptoms are reported using a standard form. RESULTS: Symptom documentation forms between April 1994 and February 2012 were obtained for 130 astronauts. The number of symptoms reported per session out of the possible 24 was related to age and sex, with those older slightly more likely to report symptoms. Women reported more symptoms on average than men (men: 3.7, women: 4.7). Respiratory symptoms (90%), flushing sensation/sweating (56%), and dizziness/feeling faint/lightheadedness (43%) were the top symptoms. Only headache reached statistical significance in differences between men (13%) and women (37%) after adjustment for multiple testing. Among those with multiple training sessions, respiratory symptoms were the most consistently reported. DISCUSSION: CO 2 exposure training is an important tool to educate astronauts about their potential acute CO 2 symptoms. Wide interindividual and temporal variations were observed in symptoms reported during astronaut CO 2 exposure training. Headache could not be relied on as a marker of acute exposure during testing since fewer than half the subjects reported it. Our results support periodic refresher training since symptoms may change over time. Further study is needed to determine the optimal interval of training to maximize symptom recognition and inform operational decisions.Law J, Young M, Alexander D, Mason SS, Wear ML, Méndez CM, Stanley D, Meyers Ryder V, Van Baalen M.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Knee injuries are common among paratroopers and skydivers during landing maneuvers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dropping height and the use of protective knee braces on parachute landing biomechanics. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 30 male elite paratroopers with formal parachute landing training and more than 2 yr of parachute jumping experience. Each participant was instructed to jump off a platform at two different heights (40 and 80 cm, respectively) and land on force plates in a half-squat posture. All participants tested three different knee brace conditions (no-brace, elastic brace, and semi-rigid brace) at each height. RESULTS: With an increase in dropping height, peak vertical ground reaction forces (GRF), peak flexion angle, peak flexion angular displacement, peak abduction angle, peak abduction angular displacement, peak extorsion angle, and peak extorsion angular displacement of the knee joint all increased. As compared without the use of a brace, use of an elastic or semi-rigid knee brace significantly reduced peak flexion angle, peak flexion angular displacement, peak abduction angular displacement, and peak extorsion angle, while there were no significant differences in peak vertical GRF or peak extorsion angular displacement. The semi-rigid brace provided the greatest restriction against peak abduction angle (3–6°). DISCUSSION: The elastic and semi-rigid knee braces both effectively restricted motion stability of the knee joint in the sagittal and coronal planes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adequate instrument scanning is considered an important countermeasure against spatial disorientation (SD). Remarkably, literature on the relation between SD and pilots’ visual scanning is scarce. The objective of this simulator study was to investigate the influence of SD on pilots’ visual scanning and flight performance. METHODS: In a ground-based SD simulator, 10 novice military pilots were asked to manually fly 3 circuits. Unknowingly to the pilots, the final circuit contained one visual and four vestibular SD events. Simulator motion, flight performance, pilots’ gaze direction, and control inputs were recorded and analyzed. Afterwards the pilots filled in a questionnaire about their recognition of events. RESULTS: Three of the five SD events significantly affected pilots’ flight performance and gaze behavior. First, the false horizon during the cloud leans induced an unintended roll rate, 0.41 ± 0.36° · s −1 , when the pilots were looking out the window. Second, the Coriolis illusion caused a 0.44 ± 0.18 s delay in the first glance to the attitude indicator and triggered an unintended roll rate, 1.25 ± 1.33° · s −1 , and bank angle deviation of 3.4 ± 3.7° during the coordinated turn. Third, the somatogravic illusion affected pilots’ pitch inputs on the stick, but this seems to be confounded by inaccurate simulation of the illusion. DISCUSSION: This study provides direct experimental evidence that SD can evoke inappropriate control inputs and can influence the pilots’ scanning behavior, even when SD is not recognized. We conclude that gaze tracking provides useful feedback on the pilot’s instrument scan during SD simulator training when using appropriate scenarios and simulator motion. Ledegang WD, Groen EL.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In order to determine the minimum flight crew number and show compliance with airworthiness regulations, the workload of flight crew should be measured in various flight scenarios both in a simulator and in flight tests demonstrating compliance. However, the complexity, environment, and safety considerations of flight tests require pilots to take more responsibility and be more careful with decisions and actions with higher stress, and it might be inappropriate to carry out flight tests in a high-risk abnormal situation. Therefore, it is necessary to assess workload measures in a simulator to predict workload experienced during a flight test. METHODS: Two subjective workload measurements and three psychophysiological measurements were compared both in a simulator and in a flight test among three flight scenarios. The scenarios were carried out in an ARJ21-700 full-flight simulator and a corresponding aircraft, and a total of 17 pilots participated. RESULTS: Both flight scenarios and flight environment had a significant influence on NASA-TLX, eye blink rate, and heart rate. Additionally, the NASA-TLX (R = 0.864) and heart rate differences (R = 0.840) presented strong correlations between the simulator and flight test. DISCUSSION: NASA-TLX and heart rate could be used in simulators and flight tests as consistent measures of workload. Furthermore, in order to reduce the quantity and risk of compliance during a flight test, the best strategy is to combine the results of the NASA-TLX scales and HR-D together in a flight simulator to predict workload experienced in a flight test.

However, little is known about factors relating to the work ability status of flight attendants. The aim of this study was to investigate the physical, mental, and work-related factors that affect flight attendants’ work ability. METHODS : A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study and simple random sampling was conducted with participants employed at a Taiwan-based airline for longer than 1 yr. Analysis of variance and Pearson correlation tests were carried out to analyze work ability according to the flight attendants’ social demographics, physical and mental health, and work-related factors. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict the flight attendants’ work abilities. RESULTS: A total of 472 flight attendants were recruited and the response rate was 78.67%. The work ability of the flight attendants ranged from ‘moderate’ to ‘excellent’ (WAI score, 34.1 ± 1.8 to 45.1 ± 1.5). In a regression analysis, work ability was positively associated with gender, age, and good eating habits; in contrast, insomnia and work-related burnout were negatively associated with work ability (R 2 = 32.4%). DISCUSSION: Insomnia, work-related burnout, and eating habits had a significant impact on flight attendants’ work abilities. Hence, it is important to address insomnia and high workloads and maintain a healthy lifestyle in the workplace. Hu C-J, Hong R-M, Yeh G-L, Hsieh I-C.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: High-gravity (G) training is used to educate trainee pilots about anti-G straining maneuvers (AGSM) in an environment similar to that of a real fighter aircraft, and to enhance their G tolerance. The success or failure of high-G training could be multifactorial, but most previous studies have only focused on the effect of pilots' physical condition.METHODS: A total of 138 male trainee pilots participated in this study. All trainee pilots had received AGSM training from experienced instructors and then underwent centrifuge high-G training. Participants completed questionnaire surveys about body size, lifestyle, self-reported AGSM proficiency, resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC), and depression level (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D).RESULTS: Of the 138 subjects, 100 (72.5%) successfully completed high-G training without experiencing G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) within two trials; these were allocated to the success group. The remaining 38 (27.5%) subjects who completed the training after three or more attempts, or who failed to complete the training at all, were allocated to the failure group. Multivariate analyses revealed that the success of centrifuge training was positively associated with age and self-reported AGSM proficiency, and negatively associated with depression level.DISCUSSION: The success of high-G training was significantly associated with self-reported AGSM proficiency and depression level. Instructors should emphasize the importance of AGSM proficiency and offer practice-based learning to trainee pilots. In addition, they should pay attention to not only trainee pilots' physical condition, but also their psychological status.Yun C, Oh S, Shin YH.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to estimate noise exposure and hearing impairments in Swedish military pilots. It also aimed to analyze possible relations between noise exposure and hearing impairments. METHODS: The study group was an open cohort of 337 male pilots. They were longitudinally followed with pure tone audiograms every fifth year from the beginning of flight service until discharge. Outcome measures were prevalence of thresholds &gt;20 dB HL and &gt;40 dB HL at different ages, and incidence of impairments &gt;20 dB HL, 30 dB HL, and 40 dB HL. Exposure variables were individual flight data and noise dose measurements. The ISO 1999 Database A was used for reference data. RESULTS: At 50 yr of age, 41% of the pilots were exposed to an equivalent noise dose exceeding the EU action level of Leq 80 dB(A). We observed significant elevated prevalence values of thresholds &gt;20 dB HL in all age classes compared to the ISO 1999 Database A. These elevations were most pronounced at ages 30 and 40 yr and at 4 and 6 kHz in the left ear. Significantly elevated prevalence values of thresholds &gt;40 dB HL compared to the ISO 1999 Database A were observed at age 40 and 50 yr at 4 and 6 kHz. In a Cox analysis we observed elevated hazard ratios of deteriorating thresholds with longer flight time/year in fast jet pilots. DISCUSSION: Military pilots had elevated prevalence values of hearing impairment. Of the subjects, 41% had been exposed to noise exceeding the EU risk limit. Increased flight time/year and flying fast jets were associated with elevated risk of hearing deterioration. Muhr P, Johnson A-C, Selander J, Svensson E, Rosenhall U.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine the characteristics of cervical muscle activity in different head movements when using helmet mounted display in air combat maneuvering. METHODS: Cervical EMG was measured with eight F/A-18 pilots using the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) during air combat maneuvering. In-flight G z acceleration and continuous head position were recorded. Muscular activity was compared between head movements in isolation and combined with torso movement. In addition, the effect of the direction of head movements and the use of head support of the ejection seat on muscle activity was determined. RESULTS: Muscular loading increased in the cervical flexors and extensors when using the torso during targeting beyond the field of vision in the neutral sitting posture; the difference was significant in the flexors, but activity levels were higher in the extensors. Cervical muscles are loaded to a lesser extent if the head is kept in a stable position during G z loading. Muscular activity in the neck muscles was higher when the pilot was moving the head out of neutral posture rather than toward neutral posture. The use of the headrest as a support decreased muscle activity in the extensors, but resulted in higher activity in the flexor muscles. DISCUSSION: All analyzed conditions were significantly affected by an increase in G z . An increase of muscle activity with torso movements is considered as a positive factor as it reflects maintained muscular support for the cervical spine. Presented results may be helpful when specific conditioning programs and cockpit ergonomics are developed for fighter pilots. Sovelius R, Mäntylä M, Huhtala H, Oksa J, Valtonen R, Tiitola L, Leino T.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During commercial air travel passengers are exposed to a low ambient cabin pressure, comparable to altitudes of 5000 to 8000 ft (1524 to 2438 m). In healthy passengers this causes a fall in partial pressure of oxygen, which results in relative hypoxemia, usually without symptoms. Patients with congenital heart or lung disease may experience more severe hypoxemia during air travel. This systematic review provides an overview of the current literature focusing on whether it is safe for patients with congenital heart or lung disease to fly. METHODS: The Pubmed database was searched and all studies carried out at an (simulated) altitude of 5000–8000 ft (1524–2438 m) for a short time period (several hours) and related to patients with congenital heart or lung disease were reviewed. RESULTS: Included were 11 studies. These studies examined patients with cystic fibrosis, neonatal (chronic) lung disease and congenital (a)cyanotic heart disease during a hypoxic challenge test, in a hypobaric chamber, during commercial air travel, or in the mountains. Peripheral/arterial saturation, blood gases, lung function, and/or the occurrence of symptoms were listed. DISCUSSION: Based on the current literature, it can be concluded that air travel is safe for most patients. However, those at risk of hypoxia can benefit from supplemental in-flight oxygen. Therefore, patients with congenital heart and lung disease should be evaluated carefully prior to air travel to select the patients at risk for hypoxia using the current studies and guidelines.Spoorenberg ME, van den Oord MHAH, Meeuwsen T, Takken T.

    "abstract": "The aim of this investigation into the performance and reliability of Russian cosmonauts in hand-controlled docking of a spacecraft on a space station (experiment PILOT) was to enhance overall mission safety and crew training efficiency. The preliminary findings on the Mir space station suggested that a break in docking training of about 90 d significantly degraded performance.Intensified experiment schedules on the International Space Station (ISS) have allowed for a monthly experiment using an on-board simulator. Therefore, instead of just three training tasks as on Mir, five training flights per session have been implemented on the ISS. This experiment was run in parallel but independently of the operational docking training the cosmonauts receive.First, performance was compared between the experiments on the two space stations by nonparametric testing. Performance differed significantly between space stations preflight, in flight, and postflight. Second, performance was analyzed by modeling the linear mixed effects of all variances (LME). The fixed factors space station, mission phases, training task numbers, and their interaction were analyzed. Cosmonauts were designated as a random factor. All fixed factors were found to be significant and the interaction between stations and mission phase was also significant.In summary, performance on the ISS was shown to be significantly improved, thus enhancing mission safety. Additional approaches to docking performance assessment and prognosis are presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Airline carriers have equipment, procedures, and protocols in place to handle in-flight medical events (IFMEs). Community physicians may be asked for aid during IFMEs. Cross-Sectional Survey of Physicians on Providing Volunteer Care for In-Flight Medical Events surveyed self-assessed awareness and knowledge, perceived barriers, and suggestions for improving responses to IFMEs. METHODS: We composed a survey regarding clinicians’ self-assessed understanding of in-flight resources, procedures, flight environmental issues, and Good Samaritan protections. The survey was distributed primarily via electronic mail to medical staff list serves to a total of approximately 1300 physicians representing 2 health networks that serve urban, suburban, and rural areas in both inpatient and outpatient settings. RESULTS: Total number of responses was 418. Physician response rate was 29.2% (379/1300). In 3% (39/1300), the responder either failed to indicate their background or was another type of health care professional (e.g., dentist, medical student, physician assistant). Of the physicians, 37.5% (142/379) were primary care and 42% (177/418) of responders reported at least one experience of being asked to volunteer. When asked how well they understand the protocols with which medical events are handled, 64% (262/412) responded “not at all” and 23% (94/412) reported “a little” knowledge. Only 56% (223/397) answered that 75% or more of U.S. flights have ground medical support available. There were 73% (298/411) who believed airlines were required to have medical supplies, but 54% (222/410) reported no knowledge of supplies available. A total of 69% (279/403) believed or were sure that the U.S. has a Good Samaritan law that applies to IFMEs. DISCUSSION: Many physicians lack basic knowledge about IFMEs. Responders may assist more effectively if better informed about protocols and the availability of ground medical support.

In 2015 a mission on the International Space Station that continued for 340 d, 8 h, and 47 min was successfully accomplished. It was a joint U.S./Russian mission completed by Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko (KM). METHODS: The intensity of in-flight physical exercises and postflight motor changes were measured in KM and in the six cosmonauts who made shorter flights (173.3 ± 13.8 d) on ISS while using similar countermeasures against the adverse effects of microgravity. RESULTS: It was found that both parameters varied similarly in spite of the difference in the duration of ISS missions. KM maintained adequate physical performance throughout the entire flight; moreover, the level of postflight changes he displayed was comparable to that recorded in the group of cosmonauts who completed 6-mo missions on ISS.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Layovers are critical for pilot recovery between flights and minimum layover durations are required by regulation. However, research on the factors affecting layover sleep and safety performance indicators (SPIs) before subsequent flights is relatively sparse. The present project combined data from 6 studies, including 8 long-range and 5 ultra-long range out-and-back trips across a range of different layover destinations (299 pilots in 4-person crews, 410 layovers, 1–3 d layover duration). METHODS: Sleep was monitored via actigraphy from 3 d pre-trip to at least 3 d post-trip. Pilots rated their sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS) and fatigue (Samn-Perelli scale, SP) at duty start for the inbound flight. Mixed model ANOVAs identified independent associations between fatigue and sleepiness SPIs and operational factors (domicile time of duty start for the inbound flight in six 4-h bins, layover duration, and total sleep time (TST) in the 24 h prior to inbound duty start). RESULTS: TST was greatest on layovers ending between 1200–1559 domicile time (time in the city from which the outbound flight departed) and TST was a significant predictor of both KSS and SP ratings at duty start for the inbound flight. DISCUSSION: TST in the 24 h prior to the inbound flight was greatest when duty start time allowed for the inclusion of a full domicile night time period. In this dataset, circadian end-time of layovers is a key determinant of pilot fatigue status at the beginning of the inbound duty period.Cosgrove J, Wu LJ, van den Berg M, Signal TL, Gander PH.

The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability, within-subject variability, and systematic bias associated with the PACT. METHODS: There were 16 subjects (men/women = 9 / 7; age = 27.8 ± 3.6 yr) who completed 4 identical testing sessions. The PACT requires subjects to make judgements on whether a virtual ball could fit into an aperture. For each session, subjects completed nine cycles of the PACT, with each cycle lasting 5 min. Judgement accuracy and reaction time parameters were calculated for each cycle. Systematic bias was assessed with repeated-measures ANOVA, reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and within-subject variability with coefficients of variation (CV TE ). RESULTS: Initiation time (Mean = 0.1065 s) showed the largest systematic bias, requiring the elimination of three cycles to reduce bias, with all other variables requiring, at the most, one. All variables showed acceptable reliability (ICC &gt; 0.70) and within-subject variability (CV TE &lt; 20%) with only one cycle after elimination of the first three cycles.

In Colombia there are no epidemiological data on low back pain in aviation. This study aimed to characterize lower back pain in pilots and maintenance technicians in a Colombian commercial airline. METHODS: Information was collected from the total population in a Colombian commercial airline in Bogota during the period from 2011 to 2013 using a voluntary survey which requested demographics, occupational (LEST survey) factors, back pain, and chronic pain (chronic pain grade scale). RESULTS: The prevalence rate of LBP in pilot respondents was 71% and the factors associated previously have belonged to the military forces: occupational exposure to physical load and work time. Chronic low back pain was at a prevalence of 49%. The prevalence of LBP in maintenance technicians was 65%. Associated factors were again similar to military forces and included mental workload. Chronic pain had a prevalence of 65%. Factors associated with chronic low back pain were the technicians’ time in office and physical load. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of lower back pain in pilots is similar to that presented in the airline world population. In the case of maintenance technicians, the prevalence was higher than those found in other similar groups, but very similar to prevalences presented in different business industries, including the transport sector.Fajardo Rodriguez HA, Ortiz Mayorga VA.

The aim of the study was to determine the degree of changes in selected coordination motor abilities in the course of a 36-h military survival training of Naval Academy cadets.METHODS: There were 14 Polish Naval Academy cadets, ages 20-27 yr, who were examined 4 times: pretraining, after 24 h, posttraining, and after a 12-h rest. Tests related to the following issues were carried out: divided attention, shooting performance, strength of forearm muscles and ability of its differentiations, body balance, and running motor adjustment. During the training soldiers had to perform the following tasks: first aid in the battlefield, building, water crossing to the enemy base, marching to the azimuth, operations in the recon team, and conducting observations.RESULTS: The maximum strength of forearm muscles during the training decreased from 7-10% during each and every measurement. The ability to differentiate the strength of the forearm muscles after the night part of the training deteriorated (about 9%). There was a systematic deterioration of the ability to maintain balance (between P1 and P4 by 24%).CONCLUSION: A 36-h training at a survival school varied the selected coordination motor abilities. Training should include exercises that develop an ability to differentiate muscle strength, motor adjustment, and balance. These exercises fall within the scope of coordination exercises that can be performed during obligatory physical education classes.Tomczak A, Różański P, Jówko E.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The incidence of hypoxia-like symptoms in military aviators is on the rise. Cases can be related to On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS) malfunction, air contamination, loss of cabin pressurization, hyperventilation, or a combination of these issues simultaneously. Normobaric hypoxia training in tactical fighter simulations has been conducted in the Finnish Air Force since 2008. This training helps aviators to recognize their individual hypoxia symptoms and refreshes hypoxia emergency procedures in a realistic cockpit.METHODS: A flight mission included three set-ups and a return to base (RTB) after the third set-up. In a tactical Hawk simulator, different concentrations of oxygen were used (8%, 7%, and 6% oxygen in nitrogen) to create normobaric hypoxia exposures. During the RTB, the flight instructor evaluated the subjects' flight performance (N = 16) in order to estimate cognitive functions after hypoxia. A control flight was evaluated before or after the flight with normobaric hypoxia exposure.RESULTS: Instrumental flight rule performance during RTB decreased significantly from 4.81 to 3.63 after normobaric hypoxia and emergency procedures. Some pilots reported fatigue, headache, memory problems, and cognitive impairment as adverse effects up to 12 h after normobaric hypoxia training.DISCUSSION: Hypoxia has a significant effect on flight performance during RTB, even 10 min after hypoxia emergency procedures. Since 100% oxygen was used as emergency oxygen, as in a real aircraft, the oxygen paradox may decrease flight performance. Hypoxia training in tactical fighter simulations provides an opportunity for pilots to also understand the effects of the \"hypoxia hangover\" on their flight performance.Varis N, Parkkola KI, Leino TK.

Logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors independently associated with making an error at work due to tiredness.RESULTS: Respondents obtained on average 7.0 h sleep and nearly half (45%) reported that they had felt close to falling asleep while driving home from work in the past 12 mo. Most respondents (70%) had received no education on strategies for coping with shift work. Among respondents, 22% agreed/strongly agreed with the statement \"During the last month, I have made an error in my work due to tiredness.\" Unexpected roster changes independently predicted the likelihood of reporting an error in work due to tiredness and for certain groups of aircraft maintenance personnel, < 6.5 h sleep increased the odds of an error in work due to tiredness fivefold, whereas > 7.5 h sleep almost halved the odds of reporting such an error.DISCUSSION: These findings indicate the importance of stable and predictable work patterns to minimize the risk of fatigue-related errors in this safety critical environment, and also the need for education on coping with shift work to ensure the workforce are best placed to manage their sleep away from work.Signal TL, van den Berg MJ, Mulrine HM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rapid travel over multiple time zones usually results in transient de-synchronization between environmental time and the biological clock of the individual. Common symptoms are increased daytime sleepiness, reduced sleep duration and quality, and performance impairments. Exposure to ocular bright light is known to alleviate jet lag symptoms and facilitate adaptation to a new time zone. Recently, transcranial bright light (TBL) via the ear canals has been shown to have antidepressant, anxiolytic, and psychomotor performance-enhancing effects. In this case we studied whether intermittent TBL exposure can alleviate jet lag symptoms in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. METHODS: Intermittent light exposures (4 × 12 min; day 0: 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00; days 1-6: 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00) were administered during the 7-d post-travel period after an eastward transatlantic flight. The symptoms of jet lag were measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). RESULTS: We found a significant reduction of overall jet lag symptoms (VAS), subjective sleepiness (KSS), and the fatigue, inertia, and forgetfulness subscales of the POMS when comparing the active TBL treatment group ( N = 30) to the placebo group ( N = 25). For example, the normalized values of VAS in the TBL, but not the placebo, group returned to pre-travel levels by the final post-travel day (6.16 vs. 15.34). DISCUSSION: Results suggest a cumulative effect of TBL, as the effects emerged on post-travel days 3-4. Intermittent TBL seems to alleviate jet lag symptoms.Jurvelin H, Jokelainen J, Takala T.

The aim of this study was to assess ocular UVR exposure of pilots in airline and off-shore helicopter operations on different aircraft types and to compare with exposure in a typical office environment. METHOD: In-flight data were captured on equipment including a CCD array spectroradiometer on five return sector European airline flights and one transatlantic flight from London Gatwick in addition to four helicopter flights from Aberdeen Dyce airport. Further data were collected in an office environment from three workstations during summer and winter months. RESULTS: A wide variation in ocular UVA dose was found during flights. The main factor influencing exposure was the UVR transmission of the windshield, which fell into two distinct profile types. In an aircraft with good UVA blocking properties, ocular exposure was found to be equivalent to office exposure and did not exceed international guideline limits regardless of external conditions or flight time. Most aircraft assessed had poor UVA blocking windshields which resulted in an ocular exposure to the unprotected eye in excess of international guideline limits (up to between 4.5 to 6.5 times greater during one flight). No significant UVB dose was found. DISCUSSION: Pilots should be warned of the potential high UVA exposure during flight and advised on the use of sunglasses. A windshield labeling system would allow the pilot to tailor their eye protection practices to that particular aircraft.Chorley AC, Baczynska KA, Benwell MJ, Evans BJW, Higlett MP, Khazova M, O’Hagan JB.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND : Although several exercise systems have been developed to mitigate the physiological deconditioning that occurs in microgravity, few have the capacity to positively impact multiple physiological systems and still meet the volume/mass requirements needed for missions beyond low Earth orbit. The purpose of this study was to test the gravity-independent Multi-Mode Exercise Device (M-MED) for both resistance (RE) and aerobic (AE) training stimuli. METHODS: Eight men and nine women (mean age 22.0 ± 0.4 yr) completed 5 wk of training on the M-MED: RE 4 × 7 squats 2 d/wk, and AE 4 × 4-min rowing bouts at ∼90% Vo 2max 3 d/wk. Pre- and post-training data collection included an aerobic capacity test, MR imaging, strength testing, and vastus lateralis muscle biopsy. RESULTS: Vo 2max increased 8%, 3RM strength 18%, and quadriceps femoris cross-sectional area (CSA) 10%. Knee extensor strength increased at all isokinetic speeds tested. Subjects also demonstrated improved fatigue resistance in knee extension. At the cellular and molecular level, the biopsy revealed increases in mixed myofiber CSA (13%), citrate synthase activity (26%), total RNA concentration (24%), IGF-I mRNA (77%), and Type IIa myosin heavy chain (MHC) mRNA (8%), and a concomitant decrease in Type IIx MHC mRNA (−23%). None of the changes were gender-specific. DISCUSSION: Both the functional outcomes and biomarker changes indicate that a very low volume of M-MED exercise results in robust adaptation in the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. The M-MED has the potential to provide a wide range of countermeasure exercises and should be considered for testing in ground-based spaceflight simulation.Owerkowicz T, Cotter JA, Haddad F, Yu AM, Camilon ML, Hoang TN, Jimenez DJ, Kreitenberg A, Tesch PA, Caiozzo VJ, Adams GR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The neural mechanisms underlying the influence of chronic exposure to high altitude on performance monitoring are not clear. We investigated performance monitoring in the context of chronic exposure to high altitude. METHODS: A go/no-go task was used to obtain event-related potentials (ERP). The error-related negativity (ERN), correct-related negativity (CRN), and error positivity (Pe) components were measured in high-altitude and low-altitude groups. The high-altitude group had lived at high altitude for 3 yr, but were born and raised at low altitude, whereas the low-altitude group had lived at low altitude only. RESULTS: The ERN amplitudes were larger in the high-altitude group compared with the low-altitude group (−14.00 ± 8.34 μV vs. −7.82 ± 8.42 μV, respectively). Moreover, the CRN amplitudes were larger in the high-altitude group (3.51 ± 4.50 μV vs. 8.65 ± 3.23 μV, respectively). Group differences were not significant for the Pe component. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that chronic exposure to high altitude can cause overactive performance monitoring in the high-altitude group, but the later stage of error monitoring was not influenced.Ma H, Wang Y, Wu J, Liu H, Luo P, Han B.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Hypobaric Decompression Sickness (DCS) Treatment Model links a decrease in computed bubble volume from increased pressure (P), increased oxygen (O 2 ) partial pressure, and passage of time during treatment to the probability of symptom resolution [P(SR)]. The decrease in offending volume is realized in two stages: 1) during compression via Boyles law; and 2) during subsequent dissolution of the gas phase via the oxygen window. METHODS: We established an empirical model for the P(SR) while accounting for multiple symptoms within subjects. The data consisted of 154 cases of hypobaric DCS symptoms with ancillary information from tests on 56 men and 18 women. RESULTS: Our best estimated model is P(SR) 1/(1exp((ln(P) 1.510 0.795 AMB 0.00308 Ts)/0.478)), where P is pressure difference (psid); AMB 1 if ambulation took place during part of the altitude exposure, otherwise AMB 0; and Ts is the elapsed time in minutes from the start of altitude exposure to recognition of a DCS symptom. DISCUSSION: Values of P as inputs to the model would be calculated from the Tissue Bubble Dynamics Model based on the effective treatment pressure: P P2 P1 | P1 V1/V2 P1, where V1 is the computed volume of a bubble at low pressure P1 and V2 is computed volume after a change to a higher pressure P2. If 100% ground-level oxygen was breathed in place of air, then V2 continues to decrease through time at P2 at a faster rate.Conkin J, Abercromby AFJ, Dervay JP, Feiveson AH, Gernhardt ML, Norcross JR, Ploutz-Snyder R, Wessel JH III.

    "abstract": "Divers are vulnerable to barodontalgia (atmospheric pressure change related dental pain), which may jeopardize diving safety and mission completion. Our aim was to investigate the experience of barodontalgia among western military divers.French Armed Forces diving personnel were asked to answer a structured questionnaire including questions regarding their oral health, diving and career features, and barodontalgia while diving. For analysis, the participants were divided into commando/clearance divers (Group A) and ship divers (Group B).All the requested 1389 divers agreed to participate in the study (100%) and 1317 divers (94.8%) who fully completed the questionnaire were included in the analysis. Of these 1317 individuals, 96 (7.3%) suffered from at least 1 episode of barodontalgia while diving, with a total of 119 episodes of barodontalgia. Barodontalgia was more frequent in the upper (62.2%) than the lower dentition (37.8%) (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6-4.5) and appeared more common during descent (77.3%) than ascent (22.7%) (OR = 11.6; 95% CI, 6.3-31.3). Barodontalgia experience was higher in divers who have an examination less than once per year (14.5%) in comparison to divers who usually have a dental examination once a year or more (6.3%) (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2).Barodontalgia mostly appeared in the maxilla and during descent; therefore, a great role for barosinusitis in the etiology of oral pain while diving may be suggested. The infrequent experience of barodontalgia in divers who routinely visit the dentist once a year or more suggests that the risk of barodontalgia might decrease with the maintenance of a good oral status.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : The assessment of individuals on abilities or other characteristics is based on comparison to a representative sample. General population norms provide an appropriate reference group when the distribution of scores in the sample can be expected to be similar to those for the general population (e.g., comparing high school students at a particular school to national high school norms on a college entrance test). Specialized norms are needed, however, when subsets of the population differ from the population at large. Military pilot trainees represent a special population; they are highly screened on cognitive ability and other characteristics thought to be related to job performance. Other characteristics (e.g., personality) are thought to be “self-selected,” resulting in distinctive profiles. Normative tables were developed for U.S. Air Force pilot trainees for two widely used tests, the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery-II (MAB-II) and NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). METHODS: The MAB-II and NEO PI-R were administered to large samples of USAF cadets, ROTC students, and officers selected for pilot training. RESULTS: The mean MAB-II full-scale IQ was about 1.5 SD above the adult population norm and was much less variable, supporting the need for specialized norms. Tables showing the percentile equivalents are provided for use by clinicians. DISCUSSION : Use of these tables, in addition to, or in lieu of, commercially published norms, will prove helpful when clinical psychologists perform assessments on pilots; in particular when evaluating them for return-to-duty status following a disqualifying condition that may have affected cognitive functioning or emotional stability.Carretta TR, King RE, Ree MJ, Teachout MS, Barto E.

    "abstract": "Long-duration space explorations will involve significant communication delays that will likely impact individual and team outcomes. However, the extent of these impacts and the appropriate countermeasures for their mitigation remain largely unknown. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing the International Space Station (ISS) as a research platform to assess the impacts of communication delays on individual and team behavior and performance.For this study, 3 ISS crewmembers and 18 mission support personnel performed 10 tasks identified by subject matter experts as meeting study criteria, 6 tasks without a delay in communication and 4 tasks with a 50-s one-way delay. Assessments of individual and team performance and behavior were obtained after each task. The completion rate of posttask assessments and postmission interviews with astronauts were used to assess feasibility and acceptability.Posttask assessments were completed in 100% of the instances where a crewmember was assigned to a task and in 83% where mission support personnel were involved. Qualitative analysis of postmission interviews found the study to be important and acceptable to the three astronauts. However, they also reported the study was limited in the number and type of tasks included, limitations in survey questions, and preference for open-ended to scaled items.Although the ISS is considered a high fidelity analog for long-duration space missions, future studies of communication delays on the ISS must take into considerations the constraints imposed by mission operations and subject preferences and priorities.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Preflight body weight is a strong predictor of visual changes in spaceflight. To understand the effect of body weight on the eye, we examined the effect of increased body mass index on intraocular pressure on Earth. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to summarize the relationship between weight parameters (including body mass index (BMI) and obesity indices), and intraocular pressure (IOP). Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate using EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL, from database inception to the second week of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 66 individual studies were included for qualitative analysis from the 1364 studies eligible for title and abstract screening. A total of 39 studies were available for quantitative analysis. The average BMI was 25.9 (range, 20.1–48.8) and the average IOP was 14.9 mmHg (range, 11.6–27.8). The overall pooled RR between BMI and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.04–1.07), meaning for each unit increase in BMI one is 6% more likely of having higher IOP than baseline. Two studies assessed the effects of bariatric surgery, and both showed significant decreases in IOP postoperatively. CONCLUSION: A higher BMI was associated with increased IOP in ground-based studies. IOP also decreased with weight loss. These data support the idea that alterations in body weight affect intraocular pressures. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between body weight, IOP, and microgravity-induced visual changes. This finding may also be useful clinically.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the aviation industry. While reduced flying capacity may intuitively translate to reduced fatigue risk by way of fewer flights and duty hours, the actual impact of the pandemic on pilot fatigue is unknown.METHODS: We surveyed U.S. commercial airline pilots in late 2020 (N = 669) and early 2021 (N = 156) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on schedules and fatigue during the pandemic.RESULTS: Overall, pilots reported reduced flight and duty hours compared to prepandemic. Average sleep on workdays was slightly shorter in late 2020 (6.87 ± 1.14 h) and recovered to prepandemic levels in early 2021 (6.95 ± 1.11 h). Similarly, the frequency of sleepiness on days off and in-flight increased in late 2020, with 54% of pilots reporting an increase in in-flight sleepiness, then returned to prepandemic levels in early 2021. The use of in-flight sleepiness countermeasures remained the same across assessed time points. Pilots highlighted several factors which impacted their sleep and job performance, including limited access to nutritional food during duty days and layovers, reduced access to exercise facilities during layovers, increased stress due to job insecurity and health concerns, increased distractions and workload, and changes to scheduling.DISCUSSION: Despite a reduction in flights and duty days, COVID-19 led to increased sleepiness on days off and in flight, potentially due to the negative impact of lack of access to essential needs and heightened stress on sleep. Operators need to monitor the change in these COVID-19 related risks as the industry returns to full service.Hilditch CJ, Flynn-Evans EE.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many questions are still being asked about the actual health effects of exposure to a fume event for airline crewmembers. To shed new light on this controversy about so-called aerotoxic syndrome, we undertook a large-scale epidemiological study. METHODS: We present a retrospective cohort study involving 14,953 crewmembers, including 2577 exposed to a fume event and 12,376 matched controls to estimate the hazard ratio of a subsequent sickness. RESULTS: Prevalence of diseases that could be related to the fume event based on “possible” or “probable” level and date of occurrence after the fume event was for exposed (controls): neurological 2.9% (2.9%), psychiatric 2.5% (2.4%), vegetative 1.8% (1.5%), irritative 5.1% (4.5%), and functional 2.8% (3.2%). Differences were not significant. Incidences of having any related disease are estimated at 1552 per 100,000 person-years for exposed and 1497 per 100,000 person-years for controls, with a nonsignificant hazard ratio of 1.04 (0.86–1.25) in the Cox model. A subset of 2577 matched pairs exposed/control allowing specific statistical tests for paired data confirmed the lack of difference between exposed and controls: matched-pair risk ratio for any fume event related disease was 1.07 (0.85–1.34). DISCUSSION: Our results clearly show that fume events are not associated with significant clinical consequences for cabin and cockpit crew.

By investigating predictors of fatalities after helicopter emergency medical service crashes through the application of machine learning techniques, we updated existing data sets and sought to uncover patterns that traditional analysis might not reveal. METHODS: Using the National Transportation Safety Board database, the authors analyzed a dataset of 267 helicopter emergency medical service accidents between 1991–2022. We first calculated fatalities odds ratios for each condition. We then plotted geospatial locations of all reported accidents. Finally, we used XGBoost regression to understand the most important features contributing to fatality after an accident. RESULTS: The findings reaffirm previous research and identify significant predictors of fatalities in helicopter emergency medical service accidents. Key factors such as adverse flight conditions (weather), the absence of a copilot, and postcrash fires are highlighted as critical to understanding and mitigating risks of fatality. DISCUSSION: These findings emphasize the utility of machine learning in extracting meaningful insights from accident data, suggesting that such techniques offer a more nuanced understanding of the conditions leading to fatalities. It points out the potential of these methods to not only enhance aviation safety but also to be applied across other sectors. We conclude by underlining the significant potential of techniques like XGBoost in advancing safety measures within helicopter emergency medical service and possibly other aviation sectors.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Republic of Singapore Air Force started its corneal refractive surgery (CRS) Program in 2005 through the introduction of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) to expand its recruitment pool of aviators. This study evaluates short- and long-term occupational outcomes of PRK on young Asian eyes with low-moderate myopia. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of aircrew who underwent PRK under the CRS program over 12 yr. Data collected included demographic characteristics, preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) refraction, pachymetry, keratometry, pre- and postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), best-corrected distance visual acuity, and SE refraction. Outcome measures included long-term survival rates (i.e., achieving UDVA of 20/20 and flying without optical aids), short-term SE refractive accuracy/UDVA, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Included for analysis were 274 eyes of 141 patients. Of these, 82.1% of eyes had UDVA of 20/20 at last follow-up. Cumulative survival rates were 99.8%, 96.5%, 92.9%, 84.7%, and 62.2% at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 yr of follow-up, respectively. At the 3-mo mark, 98.2% and 70.4% of eyes had SE refraction within ±0.50 D and ±0.13 D of intended correction, respectively, and 95.2% of eyes met standards for returning to flying duties. Postoperative complications included corneal haze (1.5%), steroid-induced intraocular pressure elevation (0.7%), and PRK-enhancement (0.7%). Higher preoperative myopia was the only risk factor for failure from multivariate analysis. DISCUSSION: PRK as a structured CRS program is effective both short- and long-term to enable flying without optical aids among young Asian aviators with low-moderate myopia.

Crews must be prepared for medical emergencies due to longer mission durations, increased travel distance, communication delays, and higher levels of isolation. This study aimed to systematically review the existing literature and knowledge gaps that could be related to the management of medical emergencies during long-duration space missions. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. Electronic databases, including ARC, Embase, IEEE Xplore, Medline Ovid, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, were searched from inception to June 1, 2023. Empirical study designs published in English or French were eligible for inclusion provided they described the management of at least 1 of 10 prioritized potentially mission-critical medical conditions. RESULTS: A total of 484 full-text studies were assessed for eligibility, with 99 included in this review. Conditions with the highest representation were spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome ( N = 23), herniated disk ( N = 22), and nephrolithiasis ( N = 22). Conditions with the least representation were cerebrovascular accidents ( N = 4), eye penetration ( N = 3), and retinal detachment ( N = 2). The duration of missions varied between 5 and 438 d for studies conducted in space. The data reflected the scarcity of evidence concerning prolonged deep-space exposure beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere. DISCUSSION: Substantial medical autonomy is essential for the success of long-duration space missions, when medical support and even communication will be limited. Future research should prioritize knowledge gaps to improve preparedness and medical autonomy for space exploration activities.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Women continue to remain a minority among Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) operational pilots, equaling &lt;2% in 2000 and &lt;6% in 2022. Limited sex- and gender-specific research on aeromedical support needs has been completed on this population. This initial manuscript examines aircrew life support equipment (ALSE) and musculoskeletal issues within a larger data set. METHODS: This hypothesis-generating, mixed-methods, epidemiological study used a community-based participatory research approach, involving semi-structured interviews with women who were current CAF members and had ever served as operational pilots. Interviews included aviation occupational interest and medical questionnaires, as well as medical record reviews, which were analyzed descriptively and thematically. RESULTS: Demographics included 51 of 88 (58%) of CAF operational women pilots from 15 different platforms, with a mean service time of 20 yr (range from 8–41 yr) and mean total flying hour estimation of 2400 h (range of 500–8500 h). At least one piece of ALSE did not fit properly in 82% of subjects, and 52% of this group reported prolonged health impacts. Almost all subjects had musculoskeletal issues, with 35% resulting in a flying impairment. DISCUSSION: This snapshot looks at sex- and gender-specific aeromedical experiences of operationally trained CAF women pilots, which can be used to guide research, policy, training, and education to improve their aeromedical experiences specifically with ALSE. Sex- and gender-based analysis and optimization could help improve equipment procurement and prevent unnecessary injury and illness in female pilots due to their ALSE. Thorgrimson J, Breeck K.

Here we report a presumed pulmonary barotrauma caused by pulmonary cyst rupture as barometric pressure reduced during a commercial flight, with tragic consequences. CASE REPORT: A 71-yr-old woman with a history of a large pulmonary cyst lost consciousness on a commercial domestic flight (1.15-h flight time). This period of reduced level of consciousness was undetected and may have caused hypoxic brain injury. Subsequent hospital investigations revealed a large cavitating lesion in the left lung and free gas in the brain, suggestive of pulmonary barotrauma and cerebral arterial gas embolism. Progression of the hypoxic brain injury caused death. DISCUSSION: The likely cause of death was speculated to be caused by the preexisting pulmonary cyst, which was ruptured by either Valsalva, cough suppression, change in barometric pressure, or a combination of all three, causing fatal air emboli.

Diabetes risks incapacitation through hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events. Limited analog data exist regarding tolerance of spaceflight in diabetics; here we evaluated diabetic tolerance of centrifuge-simulated spaceflight. METHODS: Aggregated data from diabetic volunteers in prior studies of centrifuge-simulated spaceflight were compared to nondiabetic subjects. There were 20 (3 women) diabetic volunteers, with glycemic control methods including diet, oral medications, and insulin, who met screening criteria for inclusion and participated in up to 7 centrifuge profiles. Heart rate data collected prior to and during centrifuge spins and subjective postspin symptom questionnaires were analyzed. RESULTS: Diabetic layperson subjects demonstrated similar hypergravity tolerance compared to nondiabetic laypersons. Two diabetic subjects did not complete all available profiles: one for nausea and one for scheduling constraints. Glycemic control methods (insulin vs. noninsulin) were not associated with differences in tolerance. There were no statistical differences in vital signs or symptoms. One subject had transient symptoms possibly related to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake. DISCUSSION: Diabetes poses a risk of incapacitation in high performance environments. Even so, these data suggest that, with appropriate screening and stratification, diabetic individuals can successfully tolerate spaceflight hypergravity exposures. Further research may allow for inclusion of diabetic individuals in future spaceflight. King SA, Blue RS. Tolerance of centrifuge-simulated spaceflight in individuals with diabetes mellitus .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the basic screening tests used in assessing fitness for military service and in periodic examinations of professional soldiers. Its purpose is to reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease by early detection of cardiac pathologies predisposing to sudden cardiac arrest. Commonly used electrocardiographic standards do not perform well in screening, accounting for the recognition of a large number of abnormalities unrelated to structural heart disease. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed using electronic databases such as PubMed ® , Google Scholar, and relevant aerospace medical journals. The search focused on keywords, including “screening ECG,” “electrocardiographic criteria,” “military aircrew,” and “aviation medicine.” Articles that discussed ECG interpretation rules and the implementation of screening protocols in military aircrew were included. The review also involved an examination of guidelines and policies from major aviation regulatory bodies. RESULTS: This review includes information on topics relevant to the application of 12-lead ECG in screening diagnostics, such as general ECG interpretation criteria, limitations of ECG as a screening tool, objectives of ECG-based screening, and past experiences with the use of screening ECG in athletes within the context of military medicine. DISCUSSION: We discuss various criteria for the interpretation of screening ECG in athletes and soldiers to increase the specificity of this test. We also present a proposal for a system of criteria for interpreting ECGs in aircrew of the Polish Air Force, which may help improve the detection of cardiac pathologies in this professional group.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The space sector is growing remarkably fast. Its value is expected to increase from $447 billion in 2022 to $2.7 trillion by 2040. The demand for astronauts and astro-civilians is growing, and there will be an increased need for experts who understand the effects of spaceflight on the neuromusculoskeletal (NMSK) system. Orthopedic specialists in space medicine are sparsely reported in the literature, and standards of care for astro-civilians are not well established. This review discusses the current prevalence of peri-flight NMSK injuries in astronauts, the role of orthopedic specialists, and considerations for standards of care for astro-civilians. METHODS: A systematic review using PubMed, MEDLINE, and NASA Technical Report Server was performed to identify original research containing NMSK injuries in astronauts. RESULTS: There were 29 studies included in the review. In 2388 documented injuries, the prevalence of injuries during preflight is 46.5%, in flight is 37.0%, and postflight is 16.5%. In 2081 documented injury locations, the prevalence of injuries in the upper extremity is 32.4%, in the shoulder is 31.4%, in the back is 26.4%, in the lower extremity is 5.5%, and in the neck is 2.3%. DISCUSSION: Common peri-flight injuries involve the shoulder, back, and hand, such as shoulder tendonitis, space adaptation back pain, and herniated nucleus pulposus. It is critical to consider NMSK injuries for the growing space sector. As public interest grows, costs related to space are expected to decrease. Decreased costs increase accessibility to space and, consequently, the risk of NMSK injuries, increasing the demand for medical standards and experts in orthopedics and space medicine.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aviation is a high-risk activity, particularly in pilots with cardiovascular (CV) disease. The occurrence of acute clinical events during flight may have catastrophic implications, justifying the relevance of cardiological evaluation in aviation medicine. However, evidence of the impact of CV diseases in this population is scarce. The aim of this study was to analyze the cardiac causes of disqualification among pilot candidates and pilots of the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) over a period of 20 yr. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cardiac causes of disqualification between 1999–2018, both in PoAF candidates and pilots. RESULTS: In this period, the overall number of candidates was 2529 and the number of PoAF pilots was 760. Among the candidates, 41% ( N = 1047) were considered unfit, of which 4% ( N = 39) were due to cardiac causes (all men aged 17–25), namely valvular diseases ( N = 27) and conduction/heart rhythm disturbances ( N = 12). Among the pilots, 2% ( N = 18) were considered unfit, mainly due to cardiac disease (50%; N = 9)—all men with mean age of 47 ± 9 (30–60) yr old, all unfit due to acute myocardial infarction, none occurring during flight. DISCUSSION: Cardiac diseases were an uncommon cause of disqualification among the pilot aviator candidates, but it was the main cause among the pilots of the PoAF over two decades, all due to acute myocardial infarction. Cardiac evaluation in aviation medicine is essential, focusing on CV risk stratification and preclinical detection of coronary artery disease. Certo Pereira J, Monge J, Baptista A, Reis P, Dores H.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Spaceflight impairs muscle size, strength, recruitment, and aerobic capacity. Flywheel-based inertial training (FIT) has been used as a countermeasure to preserve muscle strength and size. The objective of this study was to determine how submaximal FIT squats with varying moments of inertia (MOI) affects lower extremity muscle recruitment. METHODS: Subjects (7 men, 7 women) completed FIT squats with various MOI: 0.000, 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, and 0.020 kg · m −2 (stages 1–5, respectively) at a pace of 50 squats/min for 3 min each. Electromyography (EMG) of the vastus lateralis, gluteus maximus (GM), biceps femoris, and soleus (SOL) were measured and normalized to maximal effort. Data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Peak EMG amplitude [effect size (ES): 0.75–1.43] and integrated EMG activity (ES: 0.73–1.24) for all muscles increased linearly across MOI. Mean eccentric EMG amplitude was greater than concentric for the vastus lateralis (19–63% greater; ES: 1.58). A significant phase × MOI interaction was noted for the GM and SOL (ES: 1.27 and 2.08, respectively) where greater MOI preferentially increased eccentric EMG amplitude. DISCUSSION: Increasing MOI increases EMG amplitude of hip extensors, knee extensors, and plantarflexors during submaximal FIT squats in the concentric and eccentric phases. At higher MOI, EMG amplitude is preferentially increased in GM and SOL, especially in the eccentric phase. Submaximal FIT squats can be performed for up to 3 min continuously with active concentric and eccentric phases. This training modality may concomitantly preserve muscle and cardiorespiratory fitness during unloading but this remains to be tested. Mitchinson CJ, Caruso J, Best S, Bollinger L.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Future high-altitude military operations and spaceflight will require new procedures to protect crews from decompression sickness while limiting the operational impact. It is hypothesized that the current prediction models do not accurately reflect actual inert gas dynamics, making them unsuitable for the risk estimation of new hypobaric exposure profiles. METHODS: A biophysical gas exchange model was created, allowing modification of various physiological parameters. Predicted nitrogen (N 2 ) volume flows were compared with an experimental study by the Swedish Aerospace Physiology Centre. Bubble growth predictions, made using the Tissue Bubble Dynamics Model, were compared with measured venous gas emboli (VGE). RESULTS: While the simulated washout curves captured the general trends, some important discrepancies were observed when using the nominal model parameters. The new biophysical gas exchange model, incorporating changes in cardiac output and individual anthropometric variations, improved the predictions and approximated the experimentally observed N 2 washout. The standard bubble growth predictions did not match measured VGE. Using weighing factors based on the N 2 gas flow components predicted by the new biophysical model, the bubble growth pattern agrees much better with the measured VGE scores. DISCUSSION: Traditional decompression models do not account for variations in physiological and environmental factors, leading to incorrect estimates of N 2 washout and bubble growth predictions. Using an adaptive biophysical gas exchange model significantly improves the predictions for various altitude exposure profiles. We therefore strongly recommend incorporating adaptive physiological parameters in any model to be used for estimating decompression sickness risk and designing mitigation procedures.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Space agencies will embark on manned journeys to Mars on smaller vehicles than those used previously. In-flight exercise on those flights must abate the adverse effects microgravity (μG) has on humans. Due to space constraints on these vehicles, a single exercise device must address multiple fitness needs. Exercise and μG individually cause body heat accrual. During in-flight exercise they conspire to exacerbate heat gain. Given the duration of Mars missions and volume of exercise they entail, excess heat accrual must be addressed. METHODS: This review presents data on μG, thermoregulation, and exercise. Since their relationships are impacted by other variables, energy balance, body water, and cerebral and vascular physiology are discussed. Data are integrated to acknowledge the challenges long-term missions, and the in-flight exercise that accompanies them, impose on thermoregulation. Strategies to limit heat accrual are discussed. RESULTS: Current in-flight exercise and hardware will not address heat accrual mitigation or operational performance needs for Mars missions. DISCUSSION: This review suggests for future missions, crewmembers: 1) consume beverages with high sodium contents; 2) employ palm cooling for conductive heat transfer; and 3) perform plyometric exercise on gravity-independent hardware. Research should continue to evaluate these treatments to abate heat gain in μG. Maguire K, Wydotis M, Bollinger L, Caruso J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With the increasing use of aeromedical transport for critically ill patients, it is essential to understand the impact of pressure changes on drug infusion delivery systems. As airplanes ascend and descend, gases/bubbles are released from solutions when ambient pressure decreases and dissolves when pressure increases. This may affect mechanical fluid delivery systems and cause clinically significant changes, especially within a critical care setting. We aimed to evaluate the impact of pressure changes on volumetric pumps and syringe drivers. METHODS: An in vitro study of six volumetric pumps and eight syringe drivers was conducted in a hypobaric chamber to mimic pressure changes during flights. Infusion devices were set to deliver water at 0.2 ml ⋅ h −1 and infused volumes were measured. There were 15 open-ended syringes also studied. RESULTS: During ascent, syringe drivers and volumetric pumps over-delivered 173 µL and 38 µL of fluid. During descent, syringe drivers under-delivered by 166 µL, whereas volumetric pumps under-delivered by 9 µL. Syringe drivers experienced statistically significant changes in fluid delivery during both ascent and descent. In volumetric pumps, only the descent phase infusion differed significantly from other phases. The volume of fluid expansion is dependent on volume and the mechanical properties of the fluid. DISCUSSION: Decreasing ambient pressure causes bubble formation, which displaces fluid, and increasing ambient pressure causes bubble reabsorption in mechanical infusion devices. Hence, atmospheric pressure changes during air travel may alter fluid delivery from medical fluid delivery systems and affect critically ill patients who require both aeromedical evacuation and accurate infusion of drugs.

This study examined trends in insomnia and SA incidence rates in U.S. military aviators from 2006–2022 and examined associated demographic and operational factors. METHODS: Data on incidence cases of outpatient insomnia and SA, aviator demographics, and operational factors were obtained from the Defense Medical Epidemiological Database, a comprehensive online archive of military medical data. Insomnia and SA cases were identified using specific International Classification of Diseases codes. RESULTS: For the entire military aviator population ( N = 331,992 ± 1649, mean ± SD) overall rates of insomnia and SA were 10.2 and 24.9 cases/1000 person-years, respectively. Compared to the entire U.S. military nonaviator population, aviators had lower incidence of insomnia, but higher incidence of SA. Insomnia rates among aviators increased up to 2015 and declined afterwards, while SA rate generally rose over the period. Insomnia and SA rates among aviators increased with age, were higher among those of black and other nonwhite races, were highest among Army personnel (compared to other services) and were highest among helicopter pilots (compared to fixed-wing aircraft pilots). Insomnia rates were similar among male and female aviators, but SA rates were higher among men. DISCUSSION: These data indicate that insomnia and SA are prevalent within the military aviation population; however, the incidence of insomnia appears to have fallen as the tempo of military operations has decreased while the incidence of SA continues on an upward trajectory, possibly associated with the growing problem of obesity.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Assessment of fitness for flight constitutes one of the core tasks of aeromedical professionals. The value of such evaluations depends on the decision to be based on complete medical information, valid risk methodology, and genuine flight safety indicators. To achieve these goals, the aeromedical practitioner should ensure an evidence-based approach. METHODS: This article describes a pragmatic and evidence-based methodology for aeromedical fitness assessments, grounded on already validated principles within scientific epistemology and evidence-based clinical medicine. RESULTS: The aeromedical assessment should integrate both individual variables of the particular applicant, deductive reasoning by relevant experts, and the best available scientific evidence. Each of these three pillars includes a set of specific aspects based on knowledge of precision medicine, flight environment, risk methodology, statistics, metacognition, and scientific method. DISCUSSION: Despite evidence-based approach being the benchmark, the aeromedical practitioner should be aware of limitations and potential pitfalls. The conclusion should be based on both functional performance and future risk of medical incapacitation using a transparent and objective risk matrix. Saehle T.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In-flight medical incapacitation jeopardizes flight safety. To reduce such breakdown episodes, airlines have implemented a sick leave system. This study aimed to examine the association of total flight hours and health status with sick leave use among civilian pilots in South Korea and to identify the demand for a health promotion program. METHODS: For data collection, an online survey was conducted between August–November 2018, involving pilots of nine civil airlines in South Korea. A total of 456 pilots responded, of which data from 6 were excluded due to missing items; 450 pilots were included in the final analysis. The SPSS WIN 26.0 software was used for analysis, and a logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The factors influencing sick leave were 7.39 times higher in the case of 1000–4999 h of total flight time than in the case of less than 1000 h, and 2.19 times higher for those with pre-existing conditions than for those without. DISCUSSION: Future research is needed to focus on the relationship between sick leave use and chronic diseases and between sick leave use and health-promoting behaviors among pilots. In addition, health promotion programs may be more effective if they are tailored to the job characteristics of pilots. Furthermore, counseling and education programs regarding the numerous harms of high-risk drinking must be strengthened. This may include emphasizing the negative effects of drinking on flight safety and personal health. Han B-S, Choi E-H, Kim M-S.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Metaphoric signs, which refer to a resemblance to something absent, are, like pareidolia, strong cognitive tools that help us understand abstract concepts by relating them to concrete, sensory experiences, and these have not been studied in student pilots. Evaluating the characteristics of students in aviation, including sensory experiences such as stress, decision-making, and pattern recognition, is important for safe flight. This study aims to investigate the cognitive and emotional impacts of face pareidolia among pilot students by using the digital Pareidolia Test (PT). METHODS: Subjects were 86 students from the Professional Pilot B.Sc. Program. PT includes 10 face and 10 pareidolia images. The number of European Aviation Safety Agency flight and simulator training hours, stress levels, and perceiving emotion in the pareidolia and face images were assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to test normality, and the Chi-squared test was used to analyze differences. RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences in perceiving emotion in facial images based on stress levels from flight training from faculty courses ( N = 42/86, 49.9%), and perceiving faces in pareidolia images related to flight simulator training hours. Perceiving emotions in pareidolia images varied significantly based on the number of European Aviation Safety Agency tests, but perceiving faces on pareidolia images did not show significant differences. DISCUSSION: We claim that incorporating pareidolia in aviation training enhances pilots’ pattern recognition abilities, facilitating more accurate decision-making. The research recommends using the new digital PT in professions that require attention, such as pilots, to evaluate these parameters. Akdeniz G, Yilmaz HE, Geza H.

The analysis estimates that due to the combined transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and Influenza A aboard commercial aircraft in the United States over the 3 yr through May 2023, there were on the order of 10,000 annual deaths, declining to 3,000/yr going forward, with an estimated annual economic burden of $200 billion. Up to 80% of the deaths and economic burden might be saved by supplementing the typical 30 air changes per hour of the aircraft ventilation system with a presently available 120 air changes per hour, using a UV-C disinfection system. The risks due to accidental overexposure to UV-C are orders of magnitude lower than the benefits. The 0.00003% risk of acute (one-time) overexposure for any given passenger may (or may not) result in a 1-2-day skin or eye irritation, with no long-term effects or risks, compared to the 15,000 times greater risk, at 0.5%, of contracting coronavirus disease 19 or Influenza A that persists for several days to weeks, and carries a risk of hospitalization or death.

The model was based on chronic inflammation as the source of continued bone resorption. We asked whether other forms of resorptive bone loss such as microgravity (disuse) might also be associated with bone calcium accumulation in coronary arteries. We analyzed a de-identified database provided by NASA consisting of 52 astronauts who had flown a space mission around two determinations of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores at 5-yr intervals and bone density determinations in the year prior to and 10 d and 1 yr following a space mission. We found that in 38.5% of the astronauts, their CAC scores changed between pre- and postflight, with 95% of the CAC scores increasing. These astronauts were significantly older than the 61.5% whose CAC scores did not change, although the mission length was not different between the groups. Both groups lost bone acutely but had partial recovery over the year postflight. Due to lack of uniform sampling times, we could not correlate changes in CAC score with bone loss and would advocate for synchronous determinations of CAC and bone density pre- and postflight.

    "abstract": "The original spacecraft maximum allowable concentrations (SMACs) for 2-propanol were established by NASA in 1996. 2-propanol is an irritant that may also cause central nervous system effects at high concentrations. Limits for 1 and 24 h were set at 400 and 100 ppm based on human exposure data. Limits for 7, 30, and 180 d were set at 60 ppm using the same human data but further accounting for the small number of subjects. A literature search was conducted using keywords \"isopropyl alcohol\" and further narrowed with keywords \"toxicity\" and \"inhalation.\" Additionally, studies cited in the development of occupational and acute exposure limits were assessed. While no new toxicity studies were identified since the SMACs were established, a study that was not previously discussed in the existing documentation was identified. The data suggest that the original SMACs remain relevant, and we chose only to increase the 24-h limit from 100 to 200 ppm, the current occupational limit. We also determined that it is appropriate to apply the existing nominal SMAC of 60 ppm to missions of 1000 d. NASA is committed to ensuring that spacecraft limits for chemicals in air and water are based on the most recent evidence and risk assessment methodologies. As such, we periodically review historical limits to ensure they are both adequately protective and not overly restrictive.

    "abstract": "Fiber-reinforced composites are widely used in the aircraft industry, including in helicopters. When exposed to fire, airborne fibers can be released from the composite and pose a risk to exposed humans-the fear being that it may pose a similar health hazard as asbestos fibers, particularly the pulmonary damage. A systematic literature review was performed in the PubMed database. Four search strings were made deliberately extensive to find relevant articles on the narrow subject. The search resulted in a total of 330 titles. Of these, 73 abstracts were found relevant, of which 28 articles and finally 18 articles were included. The health hazards of the different fiber types were found to be as follows: fiberglass has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as: \"Not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity in humans\", with no later studies indicating that decision as being inaccurate. Studies on p-aramid have found a transient pulmonary inflammatory response which is not present 1 mo after exposure. Carbon/graphite has not been thoroughly investigated, but temporary lung inflammation, reversible after 10 d, has been described. Studies have not agreed on the number of fibers released in a fire, but many factors play an important role as to how many are produced, such as high temperatures (>600-850°C), turbulence, and situations like pool fire and a flashover. The knowledge on long-term outcomes after short-term exposures of fibers is scarce, and studies following up victims from aircraft incidents and firefighters as well as next-in-line helpers would be highly relevant.

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in aerospace engineering and safety protocols over the last decade, U.S. Naval mishap rates have remained essentially unchanged. This paper explores how researchers may leverage current artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance aviation safety. A critical review was performed identifying aviation research protocols which have incorporated machine learning (ML) to enhance the accuracy of detecting common aviation hazards leading to cognitive decrements. The review proposes a three-step methodology for creating protocols to identify cognitive decrements in aviators: 1) sensor selection; 2) preprocessing techniques; and 3) ML algorithm development. Natural language processing was utilized to assist with the development of aviation-related denoising and ML algorithm tables. Several psychophysiological biosensors, enhanced by ML modeling, show promise in identifying cognitive deficits secondary to fatigue, hypoxia, and spatial disorientation. The most cited biosensors integrated with ML models include electroencephalographic, electrocardiographic, and eye-tracking devices. The application of preprocessing techniques to biosensor data is a critical methodological step prior to applying ML algorithms for data training and classification. ML algorithms utilized were categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised types, often used in combination for more accurate predictions. Current literature suggests that AI, when used in conjunction with various psychophysiological sensors, can predict and potentially mitigate common aeromedical hazards such as fatigue, spatial disorientation, and hypoxia in simulated settings. The miniaturization of preprocessing and ML algorithmic hardware is the next phase of transitioning AI to operational environments for real-time continuous monitoring. Rice GM, Linnville S, Snider D.

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate changes in risky behavior in a sample of 36 healthy men during a 90-d head-down bed rest (HDBR) experiment and examined whether psychological factors-general self-efficacy, stress, and recovery-could influence these changes. Subjects completed the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) and two psychological scales once during the acclimation period, six times during the HDBR period, and twice during the recovery period. During the HDBR period, subjects were required to maintain a -6° head-down position for most daily activities and only permitted to change positions around the longitudinal axis of their bodies. The results demonstrated that subjects' risk-taking behaviors were significantly affected by bed rest, with an increased propensity to engage in risky activities during the head-down stage. In addition, BART scores did not return to baseline when subjects entered the recovery stage. In terms of psychological variables, the results indicated that scores of general self-efficacy and recovery were negatively correlated with BART indicators, while stress levels were positively correlated with risky behaviors. Compared to other psychological variables, the perceived physical stress, including fatigue, somatic complaints, and sleep quality, exhibited the strongest correlations with BART indicators. The findings of this study implied that prolonged exposure to a simulated microgravity environment and confined isolation conditions may have a sustained impact on risk-taking tendencies, with changes in risky behaviors in the head-down state more closely associated with physiological symptoms.

This study evaluated simulated hearing loss on performance and cognitive workload among Army aviators. A mixed-effects linear regression study design was used. A total of 21 aviators underwent clinical audiological testing and simulated flight performance assessments. Simulated hearing loss and workload were manipulated to investigate their effects on speech recognition, flight performance, and subjective workload. Flight simulator routes included normal hearing and simulated hearing loss conditions for both high and low workloads. Task load questionnaires were administered for subjective workload assessments and compared across conditions. Speech recognition scores decreased with increasing levels of hearing loss. In-flight speech intelligibility declined in high workload conditions, with a 26% decrease for mild hearing loss and a 40% decrease for severe hearing loss. High workload conditions degraded flight performance and response times to a secondary task which was exacerbated by simulated hearing loss. Workload scores validated increased workload with simulated hearing loss. No significant findings were observed on the hearing assessment. Findings suggest hearing loss negatively impacts speech recognition and flight performance, especially under high workloads. These results support the importance of addressing hearing loss in aviators. Further research is needed to determine if the clinically adapted Modified Rhyme Test can reflect the impact of hearing loss on aviator performance.

    "abstract": "Facial hair is prohibited for most airline pilots because of the widespread belief that the seal on oxygen masks might be rendered ineffective, preventing aircrew from performing their duties during emergencies. Continuous oximetry recordings were made every second from 24 volunteers wearing a standard commercial airline mask in 1 of 3 beard conditions: no beards, short beards (<10 mm in length), and long beards (>10 mm in length) in a normobaric hypoxia chamber at 30,000 ft (10,000 m). Masks were worn in the chamber for about 10 min before being removed for about 2 min to experience hypoxia. Once returned to normoxia, volunteers were exposed to smelling salts held directly under the chin. None of the beard conditions differed in the time to don the masks. There were no differences in the arterial saturation percent of oxygen (Spo2) between beard conditions for either mask-on or mask-off segments in the chamber. There were significant differences in Spo2 between the mask-on segment and the mask-off segment, indicating that hypoxemic conditions would have been detected had the masks been ineffective. Using a current on-demand airline oxygen mask, Spo2 levels were never compromised by any of the beard conditions. Because the highly volatile smelling salts were imperceptible through the masks, smoke and other noxious irritants would not be perceived. These results support the contention that airline pilots with beards of any length would not be impaired by hypoxia or smoke while dealing with an in-flight emergency. French J, Wagner SD.

    "abstract": "Operators of rotary wing aircraft and high-performance jet aircraft often face musculoskeletal pain and cervical spine injury risks due to flight-related factors, including heavy vibrational and g-loading, abrupt head maneuvering, and a large number of flight hours. This study explores the use of a portable lightweight resistance band exercise device (PLED) to strengthen and stretch neck musculature, potentially mitigating these risks. A multi-aircraft study building on an initial pilot study of 10 high-performance jet aircraft aviators involved both active-duty aviators and civilians. Over 6 wk, subjects engaged in targeted PLED-based exercises. Baseline and endpoint measurements were obtained. Quantitative measurements assessed range of motion (ROM) and endurance, while Visual Analog Scale reports tracked pain. A total of 47 subjects consented, with 26 completing the protocol. There were 21 subjects who were either lost to follow-up or withdrew due to scheduling conflicts. Analysis of this interventional study showed significant ROM improvement, increased muscular endurance, and reductions in pain magnitude. Subjects reported improvements in flexibility, strength, stiffness, and pain relief. Active-duty aviators noted improved ROM, quicker postflight recovery, and reduced in-flight pain. This collaborative Department of Defense-academia-Department of Veterans Affairs research highlights the effectiveness of regular PLED-based cervical musculature exercises in enhancing ROM and endurance. While promising, further research with larger datasets is needed to support definitive recommendations. Moreover, the study's findings may benefit a broad population engaging in activities that stress the cervical spine and surrounding musculature.

    "abstract": "Spatial disorientation and stress pose significant threats to flight safety. The attitude indicator (AI) is crucial for pilots to maintain spatial orientation. This study aims to investigate pilot performance with the original and a modified AI under stress and nonstress conditions. There were 52 pilots recruited and divided into a control group and a stress group. The stress group underwent the Trier Social Stress Test to induce acute stress, while the control group performed a nonstress task. Both groups then completed flight attitude recovery tasks using the original and a modified AI. The modified AI featured two white bars added around the original AI to enhance the display of the aircraft's attitude. The stress group exhibited significantly higher heart rates (88.01 ± 14.03 bpm) and subjective anxiety scores (35.82 ± 9.41) compared to the control group (83.22 ± 6.57 bpm; 32.26 ± 5.81). In the control group, accuracy with the modified AI (94.9% ± 5.1%) was significantly higher than with the original AI (91.8% ± 6.6%). Additionally, the modified AI reduced pitch reversal errors and roll reversal errors. In the stress group, the modified AI increased accuracy for smaller initial pitch and bank angles and reduced roll reversal errors. The addition of visual cues in the periphery of the AI improved performance under nonstressed conditions. Under stress, the visual cues enhanced accuracy for smaller pitch and bank angles and reduced roll reversal errors. These findings provide insights for the ergonomic design of cockpit instruments.

    "abstract": "Warning information is mainly transmitted to pilots through visual and auditory forms in flight, with only a small portion transmitted through vibration. Poorly designed flight deck warnings have negative effects on pilot performance and safety. This study aimed to give insights into how different encoding forms of warnings act on pilot performance from a cognitive modeling perspective. Four encoding forms were designed using voice prompts and flashing messages. An Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational based model was built to simulate the perception process. Flight simulator tests were carried out with four types of warnings triggered randomly for comparison with simulation results and thereby performed model validation. Statistical tests were performed to examine the significant differences and effect sizes. Both cognitive models (response time 0.82 ± 0.06 s with voice vs. 1.37 ± 0.09 s without voice in static forms; 1.35 ± 0.56 s with voice vs. 1.83 ± 0.32 s without voice in flashing forms) and subjects' response time (1.42 ± 0.37 s with voice vs. 1.53 ± 0.42 s without voice in static forms; 1.43 ± 0.44 s with voice vs. 1.65 ± 0.43 s without voice in flashing forms) suggest the benefits of using voice prompts to improve performance, while flashing forms of warnings may impose an extra burden on cognition even though they bring the benefit of attracting attention. By carrying out a joint analysis with cognitive modeling and flight simulator tests, this work shows that designers can make use of alternative sensory channels for achieving a timely transfer of attention, but with a risk of increasing cognitive load.

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major health concern in military aviation, representing one of the leading causes of flight disqualification. Traditional screening methods for CAD in military pilots include resting electrocardiograms and exercise stress tests, but these methods have limited sensitivity and specificity. This has prompted the search for more effective tools to assess cardiovascular risk and identify pilots at risk for CAD. One of the most promising tools in this regard is the Coronary Artery Calcium Score (CACS). A comprehensive literature review was conducted using electronic databases, such as PubMed® and Google Scholar, focusing on the use of CACS in cardiovascular risk assessment, particularly in military populations. Relevant studies discussing the application of CACS in pilot screening protocols and clinical recommendations from aerospace medical regulatory bodies were included. The review highlights the advantages of using CACS over traditional screening tools, including its higher precision in evaluating cardiovascular risk and its ability to detect atherosclerotic lesions at an earlier stage. The findings also explore the potential of CACS to reduce the incidence of CAD-related flight disqualifications by improving early detection of disease among pilots. We discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the use of CACS in cardiovascular screening of military pilots and its potential to complement existing screening protocols. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm for incorporating CACS into the routine assessment of Polish Air Force pilots will be included, which may enhance the early detection of cardiac pathologies and improve flight safety.

    "abstract": "Expeditions in remote locations are becoming increasingly commonplace. As the composition of teams change, understanding team dynamics is important to inform subsequent expeditions in challenging environments. Eight individuals (five men, three women; five military, three civilians) completed a ski expedition from the Ronne Ice Shelf to the South Pole over 47 d. A mixed methods observational cohort study was undertaken, involving completing pre-expedition Multidimensional Personality Questionnaires and Portrait Values Questionnaires. During the expedition individuals completed the Isolated and Confined Environments Questionnaire and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at 7-d intervals. Subsequent semistructured interviews using a topic guide informed by Goffman's \"total institution\" were conducted and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire and Portrait Values Questionnaire responses were similar between participants. The Isolated and Confined Environments Questionnaire results showed significant variation with no clear trend. Statistical significance was seen in social and emotional domains between sex and occupations. Positive and Negative Affect Scale scoring demonstrated higher positive affect (mean ± SD; 38.9 ± 1.5) to negative (13.1 ± 1.3). Subgroup analysis demonstrated significance for negative affect between sexes (one result skewed the data). The interviews highlighted that individuals found the routine and lack of personal space challenging. Interpersonal relationships were a source of support but also friction. Despite similar initial questionnaires and experiences during the expedition, subjects used a diverse range of coping strategies. Interpersonal factors remain the most important aspect in ensuring a successful team and pre-expeditionary work should be carried out focusing on this.

    "abstract": "Neck pain during military flight is well documented. Characterizing operationally relevant, specific pain location(s), severity, character, and exacerbating or relieving conditions is needed to develop musculoskeletal neck pain prediction models. An anonymous, web-based questionnaire and weighted numerical response index was developed with the help of an expert clinical panel. The questionnaire was reviewed, approved, and disseminated to military pilots. Respondents reported their current neck and upper back musculogenic and neurogenic pain with a 5-level severity at 14 locations, pain onset time, duration, and relief measures, and three-axis neck mobility. Of 222 fixed and rotary wing pilot respondents, 117 completed questionnaires were used for index calculation. Bilateral moderate musculogenic and neurogenic pain in the 10 posterior muscle areas was most common. Flexor muscles were infrequently indicated. Typically, neck pain started within 30 min of flight or pilots were already in pain, pain duration was less than 7 d, and pain was relieved by rest with over-the-counter medications or by a chiropractor or physical therapist. Neck motion limitations were equally rated as very limited, slight, or no restriction. The normalized index was divided into five ranges where 78% were very mild to mild severity. This new approach differentiates between musculogenic and neurogenic pain by discrete location and severity, addressing pain pattern, structural involvement, and neck mobility changes beyond pain absence or presence. This information can help define necessary model complexity to simulate neck pain biomechanics. The index has potential medical use in tracking pain progression and treatment progress.

    "abstract": "Post-COVID-19, 10-20% of individuals may experience long-term symptoms (some having cognitive deficits), even after mild or nonsymptomatic infection. A sufficiently sensitive screening test of cognitive function, based on the typical cognitive effects of COVID-19 and skills considered most relevant to pilot performance, would be highly beneficial to be used alongside other performance checks. This study aimed to identify appropriate screening tests for post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. Initially, a systematic search and narrative review identified 13 screening tools that are likely to be effective in screening pilots for post-COVID-19 neurocognitive impairment. Following a more in-depth evaluation of the identified tools, five tests including the Trail Making Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Color Word Test, Psychomotor Vigilance Test, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were chosen for a Delphi evaluation exercise. A two-round modified Delphi process was undertaken with international aviation medicine and psychology experts to obtain a consensus on which of the identified tests would be appropriate to screen for cognitive dysfunction in pilots. Based on evaluation of literature review findings and Delphi consultation with subject matter experts, the Trail Making Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test were identified as quick and suitable screening tests likely to detect post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction. These tools are objective, have good utility, are available in multiple versions, and assess cognitive abilities relevant to pilot performance. Their use for screening in aeromedical examinations would be further supported by confirming their ability to reliably detect neurocognitive impacts associated with COVID-19.

    "abstract": "Long-duration space missions introduce stressors that can disturb the affective states of astronauts (e.g., isolation, workload). However, studies in space or in space-analog environments struggle to find a consensus on the affective impact of these stressors. Also, there is a lack of research using multiple measures to assess affective states in these conditions (e.g., positive and negative measures and physiological parameters). More research is needed to understand the psycho-physiological mechanisms during long-duration space-like missions. Our study was conducted during a space-analog confinement (SIRIUS-19). Throughout the mission, we assessed variations of affective states using subjective and physiological parameters. We expected interindividual variability, with transitory and chronic changes on the psychological and physiological dimensions of affective states. Six subjects (three men/three women; four Russians/two Americans; age = 33.83 ± 6.37) performed the protocol once a month during the 4-mo confinement. Subjects completed various psychometric scales about their affective states (Self-Assessment Manikin, Positive and Negative Affective Schedule) and provided hair cortisol samples. Due to the small sample size, only individual values and descriptive statistics were used. Psychometric measures remained positive and stable. Hair cortisol levels increased at the beginning of the mission (from 31.79 ± 18.05 pg · mg-1 to 62.25 ± 31.99 pg · mg-1). Most of the measurements showed interindividual variability. The subjective affective states remained positive and relatively stable throughout the mission. The initial increase of hair cortisol is attributed to an adaptation phase of the crew. No affective variation seems to be related to this phase. Our results indicate effective affective adaptation to the confinement. Pauly J, Langlet C, Hainaut J-P, Yusupova A, Bolmont B.

    "abstract": "Fighter pilots face unique occupational challenges, including exposure to high G-forces in suboptimal seating postures and wearing heavy equipment around neck and head. These factors contribute to a high prevalence of neck and back complaints, which can impair flight performance and prevent deployment of pilots. A cross-sectional survey was performed on the self-reported prevalence of neck and back pain among F-16 and F-35 pilots in the Royal Netherlands Air Force. Of the 121 pilots who were invited to participate, 50% (N = 61) were included. The questionnaire was based on prior research and adapted for military pilots. Differences between F-16 and F-35 pilots were analyzed. The subjects were 36 yr (IQR 30.0-46.0) of age and had 1900 flight hours (IQR 1000-2800). We observed a statistically significant higher prevalence of back pain among F-35 pilots compared to F-16 pilots (46% vs. 8%), whereas neck pain was higher but not statistically significant among F-35 pilots (51% vs. 38%). Contributing factors included seat angle, heavy (helmet-mounted) equipment, and specific flight maneuvers. A majority (83%) reported a negative impact on flight performance, with 38% stating it affected flight safety. Suggested preventive strategies include a multidisciplinary approach as well as adjustments of equipment. This study represents the first investigation into neck and back pain among F-35 pilots and shows a higher rate of both back and neck pain compared to F-16 pilots. Equipment and seat angle appear to be the main contributing factors. Targeted interventions are needed to prevent structural injuries, improve performance, and increase deployability. den Bult-van Wieren GB, van Rijswijk A, Kuypers MI, Steinman Y, Wingelaar TT, Nelissen RGHH.

Pilots from a major Japanese airline reaching age 60 between 2008-2013 were studied for the subsequent 5 yr (\"senior pilots\"). Disqualifying diseases, application for Aviation Medical Review Board (AMRB), disposition, and grounding periods during the 5 yr were compared with those of a pilot cohort reaching age 55 during the same period (\"non-senior pilots\"). There were 263 senior and 202 non-senior pilots. For AMRB cases, cardiovascular diseases were significantly more common in senior pilots compared with non-senior pilots (10.3 vs. 4.0%, respectively). Senior pilots were less likely to apply for AMRB (9.9 vs. 3.5%) or return to work, i.e., the sum of those who were denied by and who did not apply for AMRB (12.2 vs. 5.0%) and also had a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases (4.6 vs. 1.0%). The grounding period of those not returning to work within the 5-yr study period was significantly longer than the temporary grounding period in both groups of pilots (senior: 22.3 ± 15.7 vs. 6.3 ± 4.7 mo; non-senior: 24.2 ± 17.2 vs. 7.5 ± 8.6 mo, as mean ± SD, respectively). Medical disqualification in senior pilots is more frequent than with younger pilots and may have a greater impact on crew availability. Looking at ways of increasing the number of older pilots returning to work would benefit crew availability as would a focus on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Takazoe K, Gomi H.

    "abstract": "Real-time monitoring of pilots through physiological responses may provide a means of identifying onset of degraded states. This could potentially be used to introduce methods of preventing negative impacts to performance. However, few studies to date have examined whether quantitative physiological data can successfully be recorded in actual flight, with even fewer during extreme maneuvering. An observational study was completed where physiological data was collected from three Army aviators while they completed an upset prevention and recovery training. The training was through a private company not affiliated with the Department of Defense. Subjects completed multiple flights within a small, acrobatic fixed-wing aircraft. Physiological data [electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography] were recorded continuously in flight. The physiological data were evaluated for signal loss and signal quality. The electrocardiography signals were determined as excellent quality based on the metrics proposed previously, with minimal signal loss. Similarly, the EEG recordings had near zero loss of data, except for one of the participant's flights. The EEG quality was determined to be acceptable. This study demonstrates an important step in real-time monitoring. It was demonstrated that qualitative physiological data can successfully be recorded in flight during extreme maneuvering. Further research is needed to determine the utility of such data in relation to pilot state and performance. Demonstration that this type of data can be successfully collected in flight while pilots undergo extreme maneuvers provides promise for using these types of measures across a variety of flight scenarios where a pilot's cognitive states may become degraded.

    "abstract": "Fighter pilots endure significant physical stress due to elevated gravitational forces, leading to a high prevalence of neck pain. The biomechanical loads and operational demands of high-gravitational maneuvers highlight the need for targeted interventions. Exercise training has been proposed to mitigate neck pain and enhance musculoskeletal resilience. This review examines the effectiveness of exercise interventions and identifies research gaps requiring further exploration. A PRISMA-guided systematic review examined randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies on fighter pilot neck pain exercise interventions. Databases searched included PubMed, Cochrane Library, Defense Technical Information Center, and Web of Science, with search terms such as \"fighter pilot,\" \"aircrew,\" \"exercise,\" \"neck pain,\" \"cervical,\" \"Gz,\" and \"conditioning.\" Two independent reviewers selected studies based on population, intervention, outcomes, and design. There were 5 studies that met the inclusion criteria, involving 199 participants. The findings were mixed regarding the effectiveness of exercise interventions in reducing neck pain. Three studies reported significant pain reduction, while two found no significant changes. Programs incorporating deep cervical muscle training and supervised sessions demonstrated more consistent positive outcomes. Improvements in neck muscle strength and endurance were observed across all studies. Training compliance was higher in supervised (58-77%) than unsupervised (28-41%) programs. Exercise interventions, particularly strength and endurance training, show the potential to improve neck muscle function in fighter pilots. However, mixed results on pain reduction, small sample sizes, and varied methodologies limit generalizability. Future research should employ standardized definitions of flight-related neck pain and robust methods to develop tailored exercise protocols. Acevedo A, Zeigler Z.

    "abstract": "Patients with lung disease can experience hypoxemia on commercial aircraft, which can usually be corrected with supplementary oxygen. In some cases, combinations of medical conditions and inability to deliver oxygen via simple methods can complicate assessment and delivery of flight oxygen. A 53-yr-old woman with multiple comorbidities planned a 4-h commercial flight. She has end-stage obstructive lung disease, hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring home oxygen, and previous laryngeal cancer treated by total laryngectomy, resulting in a neck stoma. She is prescribed 28% oxygen therapy via a stoma Venturi mask requiring 4 L · min-1. An airline-approved oxygen concentrator was necessary for flight, providing a maximum 3 L · min-1, so we could not assess flight oxygen without changing the delivery method, although a direct stoma oxygen connection or the use of heat and moisture exchangers (HME) had been contraindicated for normal use. Hypoxic challenge testing with various delivery methods showed that 3 L · min-1 was sufficient to maintain oxygenation safely with little risk of hypercapnia. Fitting a stoma HME with integral oxygen attachment caused accumulation of secretions and minor desaturation, although the patient could clear them spontaneously. Ultimately HME use was approved for flight only, although other methods were successfully evaluated. Patients with respiratory conditions are often dissuaded from flying by healthcare professionals, especially in complex cases where guidelines do not address all combinations of medical conditions. With tailored assessment and advice, surgically altered airway anatomy should not preclude commercial air travel, even if supplementary oxygen is required. Spurling KJ, Loft J, Ottun S, Moonsie I.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The remote tower system is a new mode of air traffic control operation that solves many prominent problems in civil aviation operations. The most important concern is the safety of the remote tower. Therefore, to effectively evaluate the safety of remote tower system operations, this paper discusses and analyzes the workload of controllers in remote towers from the perspective of human factors. METHODS: Front-line controllers were selected as subjects to conduct control command under two control modes, traditional physical and remote tower. Heart rate variability and NASA-Task Load Index data were obtained from controllers and analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that there were no significant differences in standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) between adjacent NN intervals, percentage of successive RR intervals that differ by more than 50 ms (PNN50) indexes, and NASA-Task Load Index data between the two control modes. The SDNN index had a significant positive correlation with the RMSSD index. There was a significant positive correlation between the SDNN index and the PNN50 index. The RMSSD index was positively correlated with the PNN50 index. DISCUSSION: Compared with traditional physical tower control, controllers in this study had no extra workload increase when carrying out remote tower control. Based on the analysis of objective heart rate variability indexes and subjective workload estimates of controllers in this study, it can be preliminarily judged that the operational safety of remote towers appears to be comparable to that of traditional physical towers.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: From Mars, the Earth will appear as an insignificant dot in the heavens and two-way communication with family and mission control can take up to 44 min. The resulting impact of these restrictions on crewmembers may be termed the Earth-disconnect phenomenon. The literature suggests that seeing the Earth as a beautiful orb in space is an awe-inspiring experience (the Overview Effect), the loss of which may produce isolation and loneliness. Not being able to communicate with family and mission control in real time may produce emotional distress and impaired performance. Strategies to help crewmembers deal with these issues include using a telescope or virtual reality to better experience the Earth and suggesting future response topics and using more formal messaging techniques to improve communication efficiency. More study needs to be done using simulators, a space station, or the far side of the Moon to better understand this phenomenon. Kanas N.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Given the unpredictability of personnel, equipment, and the aerospace environment, the alarm interface serves as a crucial tool for providing operators with diagnostic, predictive, or guiding information to enhance aerospace safety. The specific relationship between color attributes such as hue, brightness, and saturation of interface warning colors and human stress responses remains unclear. METHODS: A simulated space station warning interface color experiment was conducted with 80 volunteers possessing normal color vision using a head-down position. The selected 27 red warning colors were evaluated based on response time and performance accuracy metrics. RESULTS: The findings revealed that each individual variable (hue, brightness, and saturation) significantly affected reaction time, although they did not significantly influence response accuracy. Further analysis of reaction times under simulated microgravity conditions showed optimal reaction performance at a hue of H = 0 and a brightness level of 75%. Additionally, increased saturation was associated with improved color reaction performance. DISCUSSION: This research provides new empirical evidence regarding the effects of different warning color attributes on human performance in microgravity conditions, offering valuable insights for the design of warning systems in future spacecraft environments.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) activity, leading to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and resulting in a wide spectrum of systemic symptoms, including neurological, renal, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular manifestations. While the disease affects approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals, its incidence may be underreported, and no cases in aviators have previously been documented. CASE REPORT: A 30-yr-old U.S. Air Force C-5 pilot with a family history of FD was diagnosed with a pathogenic galactosidase alpha gene variant after genetic testing. Initial evaluations revealed proteinuric kidney disease and an otherwise normal neurological workup indicating early FD, prompting initiation of lisinopril, clopidogrel for stroke prevention, and the newly Food and Drug Administration-approved chaperone therapy migalastat. The patient tolerated treatment well with appropriate response to therapy as demonstrated by improved biochemical parameters (alpha-Gal A activity and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine levels) and clinical stability. After 8 mo of multidisciplinary monitoring and comprehensive evaluation, he was granted a time-limited aeromedical waiver and successfully returned to flying duties. DISCUSSION: FD is a rare, progressive genetic disorder caused by galactosidase alpha gene variants, resulting in alpha-Gal A deficiency and glycosphingolipid accumulation, leading to neurological, renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications. Despite higher aeromedical risks, especially due to stroke and cerebrovascular issues, FD patients may qualify for restricted flight duties under close monitoring and multidisciplinary care. Continued evaluation of novel therapies and individualized aeromedical waivers can support aviators with FD while balancing safety and operational requirements.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Military aviators have long undergone enhanced medical screening to minimize accidents and deaths. U.S. Army aviators undergo a rigorous initial screening process followed by annual medical evaluations governed by published standards of medical fitness which are updated periodically. An aeromedical summary is submitted for disqualifying conditions, resulting in either a waiver of the standard or suspension of flight status. This study aimed to identify the most common disqualifying medical conditions in U.S. Army aviators in recent years and analyze trends over time. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed using 5 yr of data from the U.S. Army’s Aeromedical Epidemiological Data Repository. Incidence rates for the 10 most common disqualifying conditions, and the waiver approval rate for those conditions, were calculated. Annual incidence was calculated for hypertension aeromedical summary submissions. RESULTS: Lumbar and cervical spinal disorders (101.55 and 39.26 per 10,000 aviator-years, 81.6% and 79.1% waived, respectively), obstructive sleep apnea (62.00 per 10,000 aviator-years, 93.4% waived), hearing loss (27.96 per 10,000 aviator-years, 98.0% waived), and hypertension (26.13 per 10,000 aviator-years, 97.3% waived) were the most common conditions submitted. Psychological diagnoses were also common, with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and phobias, adjustment disorder, and mood disorders having a cumulative incidence of 44.20 per 10,000 aviator-years and a waiver rate of 45.4%. Submissions for hypertension substantially decreased starting in 2019. DISCUSSION: Spine disorders are among the leading disqualifying conditions in U.S. Army aviators and metabolic conditions were submitted less often than previously reported, likely due to changes in aeromedical policy with respect to hypertension.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Airsickness (AS) affects many aviators and has been associated with hormonal and other biomarker variations. An analysis of hormones and biomarkers potentially predicting an individual’s adaptation to AS was performed. METHODS: Plasma levels of vasopressin, cortisol, ghrelin, C-reactive protein, substance P, antioxidant capacity, and 15-F2t-isoprostane were analyzed in seven student pilots (five men and two women) affected with incapacitating AS and undergoing a rehabilitation program. Peripheral blood was sampled before and after a nauseogenic Coriolis Stress Test (CST) at the beginning and end of rehabilitation. RESULTS: All individuals were sensitive and vomited upon initial CST, while no symptoms were provoked by the final one. No significant differences between men and women were observed. After return to real flight activity, one man was still affected with AS (fail case). Higher levels of vasopressin and ghrelin were detected in this individual before the initial CST, with respect to the rest of the sample. A cortisol peak was observed in all subjects after the initial CST (average from 6288–29,861 pg · mL −1 ), but only in the fail case at the final CST (from 10,040–63,050 pg · mL −1 ). No relevant changes were observed for C-reactive protein, substance P, and antioxidant capacity, but 15-F2t-isoprostane was significantly reduced after rehabilitation in all subjects with respect to the first recording. DISCUSSION: Although various hormonal/biomarker changes can be observed during rehabilitation from AS, cortisol plasma levels were noted as a potentially promising parameter for predicting the success of desensitization.

The objectives of this study, undertaken by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Aviation Pulmonology Working Group (RTG299), were to determine: 1) the prevalence of asthma among trained NATO pilots; 2) agency screening procedures and policies for candidates with a history of asthma; and 3) aeromedical disposition of trained pilots diagnosed with asthma, including allowable medications. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to each participating NATO agency to retrieve information related to each of the above questions. RESULTS: Data were received from 7 agencies spanning over half a million pilot years (520,369). The prevalence of asthma among serving NATO pilots was surprisingly low at 0.04%, an order of magnitude lower than the general U.S. military (1–2%) and U.S. population in general (approx. 8%). The reported prevalence in U.S. Air Force pilots was inexplicably low at 0.007%. All agencies, apart from the U.S. Air Force, include pulmonary function screening for pilot candidates. Most agencies accept candidates with a history of childhood asthma if full and sustained remission is confirmed with enhanced screening. In trained pilots, most agencies permit the use of medications to control asthma, including inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists. DISCUSSION: The incidence of asthma in NATO pilots was very low. Most NATO pilots diagnosed with asthma were retained on flying status, with some agencies imposing restrictions (generally from high-performance aircraft).

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pilots often experience acute stress during flights, potentially affecting flight safety. The effect of acute stress on instrument-based tasks remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influence of acute stress on subjects’ performance in two crucial tasks: the attitude recovery task and the landing judgment task. METHODS: A total of 91 student pilots were divided into a control group and a stress group. Both groups completed a square task, with the stress group exposed to high-intensity noise to induce acute stress. Subsequently, 42 subjects performed an attitude recovery task using two formats of the attitude indicator: moving horizon and moving aircraft. The remaining 49 subjects performed a landing judgment task with three complexity levels using a landing instrument. Heart rates, trait-state anxiety scores, response times, and accuracy of the tasks were analyzed. RESULTS: Heart rates and state anxiety scores increased following stress induction. In the attitude task, the stress group responded faster than the control group in the moving-horizon format (467.55 ms vs. 491.45 ms) but had lower accuracy (98.65% vs. 99.73%). In the moving-aircraft format, response times (stress: 454.15 ms, control: 474.73 ms) and accuracy (stress: 98.55%, control: 99.38%) showed no significant differences between the two groups. In the low-complexity landing task, the stress group (1015.79 ms) responded faster than the control group (1168.17 ms). DISCUSSION: The impact of acute stress on performance depends on task complexity and stress intensity. While stress impairs performance in complex tasks by increasing errors, it enhances performance in simpler tasks by accelerating responses without compromising accuracy.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The transition to exploration missions places a heightened risk on behavioral health in spaceflight. Although serious psychiatric emergencies during spaceflight have been rare, longer duration missions increase the possibility of emergence in latent mental health disorders due to genetic predisposition, increased autonomy, isolation, helplessness, loss of family member, or catastrophic events. Complicated grief and bereavement have the highest rate of suicidal ideation. Recently, ketamine has been used as an emergent intervention for acute suicidality, promoting its stability, ease of administration, favorable safety profile, and outcomes for reduction of suicidal intent. The goal of this study was to review current literature and collate the understanding of ketamine as a safe, effective pharmacological adjunct for acute suicidality in spaceflight. METHODS: This literature review was conducted to collate data on ketamine use for acute suicidality and inform on stability, limitations, and utilization of ketamine within extreme environments. RESULTS: There were 122 publications reviewed for relevance, including 23 randomized-control trials for ketamine use in behavioral emergencies. DISCUSSION: Ketamine is a diverse pharmaceutical with multiple advantageous indications, including acute suicidality, pain, and sedation. Terrestrial use of ketamine suggests a rapidly efficacious medication for reduction in acute suicidality. As behavioral stressors expand related to extended missions, contingencies for behavioral emergencies become increasingly important. Although this review is not intended to redevelop current International Space Station protocols, it is the first to discuss the benefits of ketamine in spaceflight as a potential safe, effective, multifaceted tool for exploration missions and treatment for acute suicidal ideation.

A quantitative means of exploring the risks and benefits of inclusion or exclusion of onboard medical capabilities may help to inform the development of an appropriate medical system. A pilot project was designed to demonstrate the utility of an early tradespace analysis tool for identifying high-priority resources geared toward properly equipping an exploration mission medical system. METHODS: Physician subject matter experts identified resources, tools, and skillsets required, as well as associated criticality scores of the same, to meet terrestrial, U.S.-specific ideal medical solutions for conditions concerning for exploration-class spaceflight. A database of diagnostic and treatment actions and resources was created based on this input and weighed against the probabilities of mission-specific medical events to help identify common and critical elements needed in a future exploration medical capability. RESULTS: Analysis of repository data demonstrates the utility of a quantitative method of comparing various medical resources and skillsets for future missions. Directed database queries can provide detailed comparative estimates concerning likelihood of resource utilization within a given mission and the weighted utility of tangible and intangible resources. DISCUSSION: This prototype tool demonstrates one quantitative approach to the complex needs and limitations of an exploration medical system.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motion sickness is a serious issue for many individuals, but the problem is particularly important among military personnel who may regularly experience unusual or extreme motion profiles as a part of their duties. As such, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms that contribute to motion sickness, which in turn can lead to new and more effective countermeasures. The current study investigated causal etiology by examining the predictions of postural instability theory. Subjects experienced multiple motion profiles while reporting their sickness symptoms. METHODS: Postural instability was directly manipulated by including both an active and passive condition. In the active condition, subjects could actively adapt their posture to the motion profile. In the passive condition, subjects had their feet affixed in place and could not effectively adapt their posture to the motion profiles. Subjects completed both conditions to control for individual differences in motion sickness susceptibility. RESULTS: Active condition subjects had greater postural stability as measured by sample entropy ( M = 0.179 Active, M = 0.136 Passive), and sickness symptoms increased with time. Both results provide a methodological check against our manipulation. However, there were no differences in symptoms between active or passive conditions as measured by the simulator sickness questionnaire ( M = 16.56 and M = 18.25, respectively), and no relationship between our measure of postural instability and symptomology. DISCUSSION: These results do not support postural instability as the primary causal factor in motion sickness; however, more research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of motion sickness etiology.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a need to develop noninvasive methods to monitor intracranial pressure (ICP). Pupillary reactivity decreases in patients with elevated ICP with demonstrated cerebral edema. We sought to determine whether pupillary reactivity is affected when ICP is elevated in the absence of brain edema. METHODS: Healthy subjects and individuals with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) underwent pupillometry in different positions (upright, supine, and head-down tilt) and during different physiological maneuvers. A separate group of healthy subjects were tested in the upright resting position only. The pupillary dynamics were measured with a pupillometer. RESULTS: Healthy and IIH subjects were enrolled. In the healthy subjects the change from upright to head-down tilt led to a Neurological Pupil Index (NPI) decrease from 4.30 to 4.12, while maximum pupil size and minimum pupil size increased from 4.74 to 5.19 and 3.04 to 3.44, respectively. In the IIH group the maximum pupil size, minimum pupil size, and latency increased in magnitude with a decline in head tilt. The mean NPI of IIH subjects, 4.37, was greater than the healthy mean, 4.25. Also, the mean IIH Max and Min, 5.02 and 3.25, were greater than the healthy mean, 4.62 and 2.92. DISCUSSION: We observed changes in the pupillary reactivity in all subjects based on changes in position and task. There were also differences between the healthy and IIH subjects. This is consistent with our hypothesis that elevated intracranial pressure may result in decreased pupillary reactivity even in the absence of brain edema.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postural control is adversely affected by mental and physical fatigue, but its validity in fatigue assessment has not been investigated systemically among pilots. We explored the correlations of posturographic balance with physiological and psychological signals among cadet pilots. METHODS: In experiment 1, 37 cadet pilots performed a posturographic balance test, heart rate variability (HRV), and profile of mood states (POMS) during 40 h of sleep deprivation. For experiment 2, physiological signals of 60 subjects, including breathing rate (BR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (HR) were measured under the effects of physical fatigue. Then correlations with a mental and physical fatigue index based on effective posturographic parameters with those subjective and objective methods were analyzed by linear regression. RESULTS: The mental fatigue index correlated linearly with the depression score of the POMS (r = 0.212), standard deviation of normal to normal beats (r = 0.286), and square root of the mean differences of successive beat intervals (r = 0.207). Meanwhile, linear correlations with frequency-domain parameters of HRV such as total power, low frequency power, and high frequency power were also statistically significant. With the increase in the physical fatigue index, physiological signals such as SBP (r = 0.300), HR (r = 0.349), and BR (r = 0.266) increased linearly. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of postural stability can reflect the aggravation of mental and physical fatigue among cadet pilots, which provides a potential method for assessing fatigue level before flight tasks and preventing errors by pilots.

CT coronary angiography (CTCA) potentially offers a more accurate assessment of CAD, but has not been formally assessed in military aircrew. This retrospective cohort study is designed to compare the theoretical differences in downstream investigations and occupational outcomes in aircrew with suspected CAD comparing CTCA with existing CACS pathways. METHOD: A 2-yr retrospective cohort study of consecutive UK military patients who underwent a CTCA and CACS was undertaken. Patient demographics, CTCA and CACS results, and initial and final occupational restrictions were analyzed comparing current UK, Canadian, and U.S. pathways. RESULTS: There were 44 patients who underwent CACS and CTCA. The commonest indication for a CTCA was a positive exercise ECG. Increasing CACS, stenosis severity, and stenosis burden were associated with significantly greater likelihood of occupational restriction ( P = &lt; 0.01). Following CTCA, 26/44 (59%) patients were found to have evidence of CAD, with 13/44 (30%) having at least a single vessel stenosis ≥50%. All of these patients had subsequent occupational restrictions. Two patients with a calcium score ≤10 had at least 1 single vessel stenosis ≥50%. DISCUSSION: A CTCA pathway is potentially a better discriminator of CAD burden in aircrew when compared with CACS and may reduce downstream testing, allowing a more efficacious approach to CAD assessment in military aircrew.Parsons I, Pavitt C, Chamley R, d’Arcy J, Nicol E.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypoxic environments increase the physiological demands of exercise. Inspiratory muscle training can reduce the demands of exhaustive exercise in this environment. This study examined the impact of inspiratory muscle training on moderate intensity hypoxic cycling exercise. METHODS: There were 17 healthy adult men who undertook 4 wk of inspiratory muscle training ( N = 8) or 4 wk of sham inspiratory muscle training ( N = 9). Subjects completed four fixed intensity (100 W) and duration (10 min) cycle ergometry tests. Two were undertaken breathing normoxic ambient air and two breathing a hypoxic gas mixture (14.6% oxygen, balance nitrogen). One normoxic and hypoxic test occurred before, and one after, inspiratory muscle training. RESULTS: Inspiratory muscle training increased maximal inspiratory mouth pressure by 21 ± 16 cmH 2 O. Arterial oxygen saturation and its ratio to minute ventilation also increased after inspiratory muscle training during hypoxic exercise from 83 ± 4% to 86 ± 3% (approximately 3%) and 2.95 ± 0.48 to 3.52 ± 0.54% · L · min −1 (approximately 21%), respectively. In addition, minute ventilation and carbon dioxide output fell by 12–13% after inspiratory muscle training during hypoxic exercise. DISCUSSION: Inspiratory muscle training reduced the physiological demand of moderate intensity exercise during acute hypoxic, but not normoxic, exercise. It may therefore be of benefit in adults exercising in a hypoxic environment.Lomax M, Massey HC, House JR. Inspiratory muscle training effects on cycling during acute hypoxic exposure .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Mark III (MIII) space suit assembly (SSAs) implements a multibearing, hard-material hip brief assembly (HBA). We hypothesize that: 1) the MIII HBA restricts operator mobility and agility which manifests in effects to gait parameters; 2) the waist bearing provides rotational motion, partially alleviating the restrictions; and 3) there are resistive, speed-dependent torques associated with the spinning bearings which further diminish mobility and agility. METHODS: A subject (Suited and Unsuited) performed two planetary tasks—walking forward (WF) and backward (WB). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc comparisons were performed to determine interaction effects. Motion capture data was processed to obtain gait parameters: static base (m), dynamic base (m), step length (m), stride length (m), cadence (steps/min), center of mass speed (m · s −1 ), foot clearance (toe and heel) (m), and bearing angular velocities (° · s −1 ). RESULTS: The static base when Suited (0.355 m) was larger than Unsuited (0.263 m). The Suited dynamic base (pooled, 0.200 m) was larger than both Unsuited WF (0.081 m) and WB (0.107 m). When Suited, the operator had lower clearance heights. The waist bearings provided about 7.2° of rotation when WB and WF. The maximum torque, while WF, in the right upper and mid bearings was 15.6 ± 1.35 Nm and 16.3 ± 1.28 Nm. DISCUSSION: This study integrated suit component properties and the emergent biomechanics of the operator to investigate how biomechanics are affected. The human hip has three collocated degrees of freedom (DOFs), whereas the HBA has a single DOF per bearing. The results can inform requirements for future SSA and other wearable system designs and evaluations.Cullinane CR, Rhodes RA, Stirling LA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Analysis of historical solar particle events (SPEs) provides context for some understanding of acute radiation exposure risk to astronauts who will travel outside of low-Earth orbit. Predicted levels of radiation exposures to exploration crewmembers could produce some health impacts, including nausea, emesis, and fatigue, though more severe clinical manifestations are unlikely. Using current models of anticipated physiological sequelae, we evaluated the clinical challenges of managing radiation-related clinical concerns during exploration spaceflight. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify terrestrial management standards for radiation-induced illnesses, focusing on prodromal symptom treatment. Terrestrial management was compared to current spaceflight medical capabilities to identify gaps and highlight challenges involved in expanding capabilities for future exploration spaceflight. RESULTS: Current spaceflight medical resources, such as those found on the International Space Station, may be sufficient to manage some aspects of radiation-induced illness, although effective treatment of all potential manifestations would require substantial expansion of capabilities. Terrestrial adjunctive therapies or more experimental treatments are unavailable in current spaceflight medical capabilities but may have a role in future management of acute radiation exposure. DISCUSSION: Expanded medical capabilities for managing radiation-induced illnesses could be included onboard future exploration vehicles. However, this would require substantial research, time, and funding to reach flight readiness, and vehicle limitations may restrict such capabilities for exploration missions. The benefits of including expanded capabilities should be weighed against the likelihood of significant radiation exposure and extensive mission design constraints.

CASE REPORT: During parabolic flight, the spinal stiffness of the L3 vertebra of a healthy 37-yr-old man was measured in normal Earth gravity (1.0 g), hypergravity (1.8 g), and microgravity (0.0 g) conditions induced in the prone and upright positions. Differences in spinal stiffness were significant across all three gravity conditions in the prone and upright positions. Most effect sizes were large; however, in the upright posture, the effect size between Earth gravity and microgravity was medium. Significant differences in spinal stiffness between the prone and upright positions were found during Earth gravity and hypergravity conditions. No difference was found between the two postures during microgravity conditions. DISCUSSION: Based on repeated measurements of a single individual, our results showed detectable changes in posterior-to-anterior spinal stiffness. Spinal stiffness increased during microgravity and decreased during hypergravity conditions. In microgravity conditions, posture did not impact spinal stiffness. More data on spinal stiffness in variable gravitational conditions is needed to confirm these results. Swanenburg J, Meier ML, Langenfeld A, Schweinhardt P, Humphreys BK.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In-flight medical emergencies require healthcare providers to operate in confined spaces with limited resources and delayed access to definitive care. These emergencies are common, with an estimated frequency of 1 per 100 to 1000 flights. Despite this, training for medical response in these environments is limited. We hypothesize that integrating such education into a pre-existing medical student elective course would improve knowledge and ability to respond appropriately to in-flight medical emergencies. METHODS: The available literature surrounding in-flight medical emergencies was reviewed. Syncope, respiratory distress, allergic reaction, and cardiac arrest were identified as common and potentially life-threatening complaints. Simulation cases were designed for each of these complaints and a simulation room was modified to mimic an airplane cabin. These simulation cases and accompanying relevant didactic lectures were incorporated into an existing wilderness and extreme environmental medicine course, with multiple-choice tests completed by the students at the beginning and end of the 2-wk course. RESULTS: Participating in this study were 18 students. The pretest average was 76%, which improved to 87% on the posttest. Qualitative feedback regarding this type of training was overwhelmingly positive. DISCUSSION: Simulation-based training for in-flight medical emergencies can significantly improve medical students’ knowledge. This training was very well received by the students. Opportunities for training to manage in-flight medical emergencies remain limited; incorporating such training into existing curricula could provide a means by which to improve provider knowledge. Such a curriculum could be adapted for use by flight crews and other populations. Padaki A, Redha W, Clark T, Nichols T, Jacoby L, Slivka R, Ranniger C, Lehnhardt K.

The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the rate of barodontalgia among military and civilian divers and aircrews based on previous reports. METHODS: We analyzed the data of 4894 aircrew/divers reported in the literature. Barodontalgia rates (flight vs. diving, military vs. civilian, pressurized vs. non-pressurized aircrafts) were analyzed. The Chi-squared test was used to compare between groups. RESULTS: Of the 4894 individuals, 402 (8.2%) suffered from barodontalgia. Divers (9.8%) were more vulnerable than aircrews (5.8%). Barodontalgia experience rate was 5.4% and 6.5% in military and civilian aircrews, respectively, and 7.3% and 12.8% in military and civilian scuba divers, respectively. Barodontalgia was more common among aircrews of pressurized than non-pressurized aircrafts (7.3% vs. 3.2%, respectively). DISCUSSION: The greater amplitude of barometric pressure changes explains the higher rate of barodontalgia in divers than aircrew. The higher rate during pressurized flights is possibly because intracabin pressure in the pressurized cabin is still routinely higher than in nonpressurized aircrafts. Improved oral care and mandatory annual dental checkups may be the reason for the significantly lower rate of barodontalgia experienced among military aircrews and divers compared to their civilian counterparts. These results emphasize the essential role of atmospheric pressure change in the generation of pain during flight or diving and the importance of proper dental care. Nakdimon I, Zadik Y.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although a space suit is a technological feat sustaining human life outside the spacecraft, working in the space suit environment can lead to musculotendon and soft tissue injuries in astronauts. In this literature review, we consider the injury risk mechanisms for human-space suit interactions. We first present a review of space suit injury risk founded in empirical, statistical, and experimental studies. We then review efforts in computational modeling of a human and space suit. As the interpretation of models for injury risk has not previously been defined, a review is presented of biomechanical considerations of injury risk to the tissue and joints based on previously observed space suit injuries. A review of risk assessment in occupational health in the workplace is then presented, an adjacent area that informs relevant measures of consideration for human-space suit applications. Finally, we discuss how the work-to-date can inform continued efforts in minimizing risk of musculoskeletal injury to the human when using a space suit. From the literature, this review concludes space suits cause biomechanical alterations, inducing musculoskeletal injury. Combining occupational health kinematic constraints with computational models could enable a trade space evaluation on space suited biomechanics to reduce risk mechanisms. Future work, though, is required to enable computational models to be predictive of individual injury risk. Our findings show there are significant gaps in our current knowledge on tissue injuries that preclude biomechanical models from being used directly as an injury risk assessment model. This review identifies how risk factor monitoring and modeling will enable improved space suit design and evaluation.Stirling L, Arezes P, Anderson A.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine the characteristics of cervical muscle activity in different head postures when using helmet-mounted display in one fighter vs. two aircraft air combat within visual range (WVR).METHODS: Cervical EMG was measured with eight F/A-18 pilots using the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) during air combat maneuvering. In-flight Gz acceleration and continuous head position were recorded. EMG activity is divided and presented in a matrix with three-class rotation and five-class flexion-extension postures.RESULTS: The mean muscle activity in sternocleidomastoids and cervical extensors was 28.9% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and 44.8% MVC, respectively. Cervical flexor and extensor muscles are subjected to loading over MVC during high Gz sorties. Cervical rotation combined with extension exceeded muscle force-producing capacity during high Gz, resulting in a decline in muscle activity.DISCUSSION: Awkward postures, especially rotational ones, are more prone to increase loading over muscles' capacity. Overloading of muscles increases the risk of muscular and ligamentous injury. In addition, the lack of muscular support potentially leads to the Gz loading being transferred to spinal structures via intervertebral discs and the vertebral column. The JHMCS helmet seems to change the pattern of most loading muscles toward the extensor (posterior) neck muscles.Sovelius R, Mäntylä M, Heini H, Oksa J, Valtonen R, Tiitola L, Leino T.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the involved predictive factors of motion sickness screened with uniform samples of Chinese college students and to verify the individual susceptibility difference in marine navigation.METHODS: A total of 1051 college students (719 men, 332 women; mean age: 18.32 ± 0.65 yr) completed the MSSQ. Another 42 men (mean age: 21.12 ± 1.10 yr) took part in 2 separate voyages. MSSQ data were collected before sailing and Graybiel motion sickness questionnaire (GMSQ) data were collected within 24 h after sailing and 24 h before landing.RESULTS: The internal consistency of the MSSQ was 0.685. The mean subscore of the MSSQ-A (18.47 ± 19.49) was significantly higher than that of the MSSQ-B (12.69 ± 14.97). Women had significantly higher MSSQ scores (38.29 ± 33.49) than men (27.87 ± 30.27). The mean MSSQ score of the inland subjects (33.97 ± 33.35) was significantly higher than that of the coastal subjects (27.81 ± 29.24). Nearly 93% of new seafarers experienced seasickness during their first navigation. The MSSQ score was positively correlated with seasickness symptoms (r = 0.706).CONCLUSION: Gender, age, and birthplace appear to be important predictors of motion sickness for Chinese college students. Specifically, women, younger people, and people who were born in inland China seem more prone to the syndrome. A high MSSQ score is a risk factor for seasickness. However, long-term voyages can lead to habituation, which reduces the occurrence of seasickness.Zhang X, Sun Y.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A visual stimulus change detection is an extremely important pilot’s cognitive process. This is especially true when pilot errors caused by perceptual failures have a negative effect on his/her spatial orientation. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of the change detection flicker task (CDFT) on pilots’ response to spatial disorientation (SD) events. We hypothesized that the additional cognitive processing, based on CDFT, produces more deterioration of the pilots’ spatial orientation. METHODS: Using an SD flight simulator, 50 male military pilots (M = 27.2; SD = 6.68) were exposed to 12 flight sequences. Of the 12 flight profiles, 6 involved an SD conflict, with 3 involving motion illusions and 3 with visual illusions. We measured and compared pilots’ flight performance in response to visual and motion illusion conflicts across two simulations (CDFT vs. control) and SD conditions (nonconflict vs. conflict). RESULTS: Of the six applied illusions, significant differences in pilot flight performance were found for three visual and one vestibular illusion (Coriolis). The differences were observed between control and CDFT groups for both nonconflict and conflict flight sequences, associated with the approach and landing maneuvers. DISCUSSION: The CDFT increased the pilots’ cognitive workload, affecting their flight performance and susceptibility to SD, especially in the approach and landing maneuvers. This partially supports our hypothesis that performing the CDFT leads to greater deterioration of pilots’ spatial orientation. We recommend that when problems in maintaining proper flight performance arise, pilots should not respond to external stimuli until they have recovered their spatial orientation.

METHODS: There were 16 pilots who were classified into two levels of aviation expertise depending on the flight hours, and required to fly an Instrument Landing System approach. Their visual scanning behaviors were recorded through an eye tracker and analyzed based on fixation number and dwell time. RESULTS: The results revealed that the pilot experience level, instrument panel and autopilot mode all had significant impact on the fixation time ratio and dwell time. The pilots fixated most often on the PFD and had shorter dwell time. Furthermore, they had a lower fixation number and shorter dwell time on the PFD and MFD when the autopilot was off that they should allocate visual resources to the others (e.g., out-of-the-window) and obtain more information to maintain overall situation awareness under higher time pressure. Compared to pilots with more expertise, pilots with less expertise had an increased fixation number and decreased dwell time on the airspeed after turning off the autopilot. DISCUSSION: The present study indicated that the pilots had different visual scanning modes according to the flight mode and their experience. We expect that pilots’ visual scanning behaviors during tasks will help the training and the design of the human-machine interaction. Lu Y, Zheng Y, Wang Z, Fu S.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With commercial spaceflight comes the possibility of spaceflight participants (SFPs) with significant medical conditions. Those with previously untested medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and the use of indwelling medical devices, represent a unique challenge. It is unclear how SFPs with such devices will react to the stresses of spaceflight. This case report describes two subjects with Type I DM using insulin pumps who underwent simulated dynamic phases of spaceflight via centrifuge G force exposure. CASE REPORT: Two Type I diabetic subjects with indwelling Humalog insulin pumps, a 23-yr-old man averaging 50 u of Humalog daily and a 27-yr-old man averaging 60 u of Humalog daily, underwent seven centrifuge runs over 48 h. Day 1 consisted of two +G z runs (peak = +3.5 G z , run 2) and two +G x runs (peak = +6.0 G x , run 4). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G x and +G z ). Data collected included blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, neurovestibular evaluation, and questionnaires regarding motion sickness, disorientation, greyout, and other symptoms. Neither subject experienced adverse clinical responses to the centrifuge exposure. Both maintained blood glucose levels between 110–206 mg · dl −1 . DISCUSSION: Potential risks to SFPs with insulin pump dependent DM include hypo/hyperglycemia, pump damage, neurovestibular dysfunction, skin breakdown, and abnormal stress responses. A search of prior literature did not reveal any previous studies of individuals with DM on insulin pumps exposed to prolonged accelerations. These cases suggest that individuals with conditions dependent on continuous medication delivery might tolerate the accelerations anticipated for commercial spaceflight.Levin DR, Blue RS, Castleberry TL, Vanderploeg JM.

There are limited data available on the effects of restricted activity on skeletal muscles. Thus the effects of restricted activity on the properties of the slow soleus and fast plantaris muscles in rats were examined. METHODS: Eight-week-old rats were housed for 21 d in normal-sized (control group) or in small-sized (restricted group) cages. RESULTS: Decreased mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (81 and 85% of control values) and reduced succinate dehydrogenase activity (85 and 88% of control values) were observed in the soleus and the plantaris muscles of the restricted group, respectively. Increased mRNA levels of forkhead box-containing protein O1 (128% of control values), decreased muscle weight (74% of control values), and reduced cross-sectional areas of type IIA (89% of control values) and type IIB (80% of control values) fibers were observed in the plantaris muscle of the restricted group. DISCUSSION: Restricted activity decreased the mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α and increased the mRNA levels of forkhead box-containing protein O1, which are associated with reduced oxidative capacity and atrophy, respectively, in the muscles. The plantaris muscle was more affected by restricted activity than the soleus muscle, most likely reflecting a greater relative change in the normal activity pattern in the fast than slow plantarflexor muscle.Takemura A, Roy RR, Edgerton VR, Ishihara A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A space mission’s crewmembers are the most important group of people involved and, thus, their emotions and interpersonal interactions have gained significant attention. Because crewmembers are confined in an isolated environment, the aim of this study was to identify possible changes in the emotional states, group dynamics, displacement, and leadership of crewmembers during an 80-d isolation period. METHODS: The experiment was conducted in an analogue space station referred to as Lunar Palace 1 at Beihang University. In our experiment, all of the crewmembers completed a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire every week and two group climate scales questionnaires every 2 wk; specifically, a group environment scale and a work environment scale. RESULTS: There was no third-quarter phenomenon observed in Lunar Palace 1. However, fluctuations in the fatigue and autonomy subscales were observed. Significant displacement effects were observed when Group 3 was in the analogue. Leader support was positively correlated with the cohesion, expressiveness, and involvement of Group 3. However, leader control was not. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that time effects, displacement, and leadership roles can influence mood states and cohesion in isolated crew. These findings from Lunar Palace 1 are in agreement with those obtained from Mir and the International Space Station (ISS).Wang Y, Wu R.

The possibility of increased prostate cancer incidence and mortality among pilots is a subject of debate. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize the supporting evidence and determine the magnitude of association. METHODS: All studies reporting prostate cancer incidence and mortality in pilots compared to the general population were included regardless of language or size. The comprehensive search included multiple databases and manual search. A random effect model was used to pool relative risks (RR) across studies. RESULTS: The final search yielded nine studies with good methodological quality. Four studies reported the incidence of prostate cancer while six reported on mortality. Pilots had a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of developing prostate cancer [RR 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.33], but not in prostate cancer mortality (RR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.91-1.60).

METHODS: Participating in the study were 75 color-normals and 47 subjects with red-green color vision defects. Color vision was classified by an anomaloscope. The HRR (4 th edition), Ishihara 38-plate edition, and PIPIC tests are printed color vision tests, whereas mColorDx test figures were displayed on a calibrated computer desktop monitor. All tests were repeated in about 1 wk. RESULTS: The kappa level of agreement (κ) values with the anomaloscope for screening for each test was 0.96 or greater. The values were statistically identical. Specificity for each test was at least 0.99 and sensitivity was at least 0.95. The repeatability of the screening sections for all tests was very good with κ values greater than 0.95. Deutans tended to miss the tritan screening plates on the HRR and mColorDx tests. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients between the severity of the defect and anomaloscope range was moderate with r = 0.45 for the mColorDx and r = 0.6 for the HRR. Both the mColorDx and HRR had perfect agreement with the anomaloscope in classifying the defects as either protan or deutan. CONCLUSION: The validity of the four tests for color vision screening was statistically identical; however, the HRR may be preferred because it had the highest sensitivity of 0.99, a specificity of 1.0, and a reasonable correlation between the severity rating of the defect and the anomaloscope range.Almustanyir A, Hovis JK.

Herein, we examined the impact of sustained (180 min) 30° head-up (HUT) and head-down (HDT) tilt on brain perfusion, as determined by MCA BFV and blood flow in the extracranial arteries.In 10 healthy male subjects, arterial diameters, BFVs, and blood flows were determined in the left internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral (VA) arteries using duplex Doppler ultrasound in supine rest, and 5, 20, 60, 120, and 180 min following 30° HUT and HDT. MCA BFV was recorded throughout with transcranial Doppler ultrasound.ICA as well as VA diameters and blood flows were unaltered during HUT. Likewise, brain blood flow and MCA BFV were preserved with HUT. In the HDT protocol, ICA and VA diameters were gradually increased, although ICA, VA, and brain blood flows were preserved. MCA BFV was progressively reduced during HDT. In addition, MCA BFV was positively associated with ICA BFV (β = 0.9) and negatively associated with ICA diameter (β = -125.5). MCA BFV was positively associated with brain blood flow during HUT (β = 0.2) but not HDT.Brain perfusion is preserved whereas MCA BFV is progressively decreased and associated with extracranial arterial BFV during sustained 30° HDT.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study examined whether subjective measurements of in-flight sleep could be a reliable alternative to actigraphic measurements for monitoring pilot fatigue in a large-scale survey. METHODS: Pilots (3-pilot crews) completed a 1-page survey on outbound and inbound long-haul flights crossing 1–7 time zones ( N = 586 surveys) between 53 city pairs with 1-d layovers. Across each flight, pilots documented flight start and end times, break times, and in-flight sleep duration and quality if they attempted sleep. They also rated their fatigue (Samn-Perelli Crew Status Check) and sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) at top of descent (TOD). Mixed model ANCOVA was used to identify independent factors associated with sleep duration, quality, and TOD measures. Domicile time was used as a surrogate measure of circadian phase. RESULTS: Sleep duration increased by 10.2 min for every 1-h increase in flight duration. Sleep duration and quality varied by break start time, with significantly more sleep obtained during breaks starting between (domicile) 22:00–01:59 and 02:00–05:59 compared to earlier breaks. Pilots were more fatigued and sleepy at TOD on flights arriving between 02:00–05:59 and 06:00–09:59 domicile time compared to other flights. With every 1-h increase in sleep duration, sleepiness ratings at TOD decreased by 0.6 points and fatigue ratings decreased by 0.4 points. DISCUSSION: The present findings are consistent with previous actigraphic studies, suggesting that self-reported sleep duration is a reliable alternative to actigraphic sleep in this type of study, with use of validated measures, sufficiently large sample sizes, and where fatigue risk is expected to be low.van den Berg MJ, Wu LJ, Gander PH.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Most fighter pilots report cervical pain during their careers. Recommendations for remediation lack evidence. We sought to determine whether regular use of a home cervical traction device could decrease reported cervical pain in F-15C pilots. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, controlled crossover study was undertaken with 21 male F-15C fighter pilots between February and June 2015. Of the 21 subjects, 12 completed 6 wk each of traction and control, while logging morning, postflying, and post-traction pain. Pain was compared with paired t -tests between the periods, from initial pain scores to postflying, and postflying to post-traction. RESULTS: In the traction phase, initial pain levels increased postflight, from 1.2 (0.7) to 1.6 (1.0) Subsequent post-traction pain levels decreased to 1.3 (0.9), with a corresponding linear decrease in pain relative to pain reported postflight. The difference in pain levels after traction compared to initial levels was not significant, indicating that cervical traction was effective in alleviating flying-related pain. Control pain increased postflight from 1.4 (0.9) to 1.9 (1.3). Daily traction phase pain was lower than the control, but insignificant. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study of home cervical traction to address fighter pilots’ cervical pain. We found a small but meaningful improvement in daily pain rating when using cervical traction after flying. These results help inform countermeasure development for pilots flying high-performance aircraft. Further study should clarify the optimal traction dose and timing in relation to flying.Chumbley EM, O’Hair N, Stolfi A, Lienesch C, McEachen JC, Wright BA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The effects of long-duration (213.0 ± 30.5 d) stays aboard the orbital station Mir and short-term (∼10 d) spaceflights aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on the joint torques of various muscles and work capacity of knee extensors were studied in male cosmonauts. METHODS: Joint torque and muscle endurance testing was performed 30 d before and 3–5 d after a spaceflight, using a LIDO ® Multi-Joint Isokinetic Rehabilitation System (USA). RESULTS: Greater postflight changes in maximal joint torque were observed for back, knee, and ankle extensors compared with flexors, and the difference was especially clearly seen after long-term spaceflights. The decrease in maximal joint torque of hip extensors substantially varied, being the greatest in voluntary concentric movements in a low-velocity high-force mode at angular velocities of 30 and 60° · s −1 (by 16 and 13%, respectively) and the lowest in high-velocity modes at velocities of 120 and 180° · s −1 (by 9 and 11%, respectively). Muscle work capacity was inferred from the gradient of declining muscle force produced in a series of rhythmic voluntary concentric movements and was found to decrease after both short- and long-term spaceflights. The area under the muscle contraction curve decreased to a greater extent and in all regions of the curve after long-term spaceflights. The fatigue index averaged 0.90 ± 0.03 at baseline and remained much the same, 0.90 ± 0.04, after a short-term spaceflight. However, after a long-duration spaceflight, the fatigue index increased 14.1%. DISCUSSION: The finding that the contractile functions and work capacity of muscles decrease more after long-term than after short-term spaceflights in spite of the physical training program of a certain type gave grounds to assume that physical training employed in long-term spaceflights were insufficient to simulate the daily mechanical load that the cosmonauts had before a spaceflight.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Studies have identified a great number of physiological conditions, including venous thromboembolism and hypoxia, that may give rise to medical disqualifications and in-flight incapacitations that can be costly to individuals and organizations. Over the past three decades, much attention has been focused on venous thromboembolism among passengers. However, studies on venous thromboembolism among commercial airline pilots are very scarce. With this consideration in mind, differently from the literature, this study set out to examine pilots' awareness of venous thromboembolism signs, symptoms, risk factors, and countermeasures . METHODS: For this purpose, a venous thromboembolism questionnaire was developed and applied to collect data. There were 427 airline pilots who participated in the questionnaire. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique was used to analyze the results of the questionnaire. RESULTS: According to the results of this study, approximately one-half (57.1%) of the participants had just heard of this particular health issue and 63.9% of the participants were unaware of flight-associated venous thromboembolism. Airline pilots between 20 and 40 yr of age were much less aware of venous thromboembolism in comparison to pilots 41 yr or older, and pilots flying more than 90 h/mo were at a greater risk. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots between 20 and 40 yr have less knowledge about venous thromboembolism and preventive measures against it in comparison to older pilots. Therefore they may be more vulnerable to possible risk factors. The findings of this study will contribute to increasing pilots’ awareness on flight-related venous thromboembolism and can improve the overall safety of civil aviation . Kilic B, Soran S.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caffeine-containing products and dietary supplements are widely used by military populations, but little is known about their use by aviation personnel. This study assessed self-reported sleep, fitness, work-schedules, and caffeine/energy drink use. METHODS: A standardized survey was conducted in person by study personnel using tablet computers. A total of 188 aircrew members from the Combat Aviation Brigade at Fort Campbell, KY, participated in the survey. Focus groups were conducted with a subset of 47 subjects. RESULTS: The majority of subjects reported their physical fitness, health, and diets were good. They reported sleeping about 6 h per day and stated they needed additional sleep to feel fully rested. Their caffeine consumption averaged 346 ± 23 mg · d −1 with most derived from coffee (139 ± 12 mg · d −1 ) and energy drinks (110 ± 13 mg · d −1 ). About half (55%) of participants used energy drinks at least once per week and they consumed greater amounts of caffeine than nonusers. Focus group data indicated crewmembers primarily consumed energy drinks to enhance performance degraded by variations in work schedules and lack of sufficient sleep. Participants expressed a desire for additional education on diets and energy drinks as well as on aeromedical policies governing energy drink and supplement use. CONCLUSIONS: Caffeinated products, including coffee and energy drinks, are routinely used by Army aircrews to increase alertness. Aircrew personnel consider them generally safe, but would like to receive education about these beverages, other dietary issues, and Army policies governing their use in aircrew.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flight-associated neck pain (FANP) is a serious problem in fighter pilots. Despite the high impact of FANP there is little evidence for effective management. However, self-kinematic training showed a positive effect in the general population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a self-kinematic training program using virtual reality in improving neck pain in fighter pilots. METHODS: There were 45 pilots with FANP who were randomized to a control group ( N 23) or a training group ( N 22). Training participants were instructed to exercise using a personalized self-training program, for 20 min/wk, for 4 wk. Primary outcome measures were neck disability (NDI%) and mean velocity ( s 1 ), and secondary were pain, health status, accuracy, and isometric strength. Assessments were conducted by a blinded assessor and intention-to-treat analysis by a blinded statistician. RESULTS: There were 40 pilots who completed the postintervention assessments, and 35 completed the 6-mo follow-up. Baseline measurements showed mild pain and disability (mean VAS 43 22.73, NDI 17.76 9.59%) and high kinematic performance. Compliance with self-training was poor. No differences were observed in self-reported measures and strength. Exercise duration was correlated with NDI% improvement. DISCUSSION: This self-kinematic training promoted kinematic performance, but was ineffective in engaging the pilots to exercise, and consequently did not improve pain and disability. Poor compliance was previously reported in self-training for FANP, suggesting further studies should prioritize supervised training. Considering the high baseline kinematic performance, kinematics does not seem to be a key factor in FANP, and future exercise research should aim for intense strengthening to increase endurance to the high G z pilots experience.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In their working life, airline pilots are exposed to particular risk factors that promote nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Because of the varying incidence internationally, we evaluated the point prevalences of acute, subacute, and chronic nonspecific LBP, as well as the current prevalences in German airline pilots. Furthermore, we compared the prevalence to the general German population and to European counterparts. METHODS: An anonymous online survey of 698 participating German airline pilots was evaluated. The impairment between groups was analyzed. Prevalences from our data were compared to existing data. RESULTS: The following point prevalences were found: 8.2% acute, 2.4% subacute, 82.7% chronic LBP; 74.1% of all individuals were suffering from current LBP when answered the questionnaire. A total time spent flying greater than 600 h within the last 12 mo was significantly related to acute nonspecific LBP. Individuals with any type of LBP were significantly impaired compared to those unaffected. It was found that German airline pilots suffer more often from current LBP than the general population and have a higher point prevalence of total LBP than their European counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation showed a surprisingly high, previously unidentified, prevalence of nonspecific LBP in German airline pilots. Why German airline pilots suffer more often from LBP remains uncertain. The number of flying hours appears to have a negative effect on developing acute low back pain, but causation cannot be concluded. Other risk factors could not be confirmed.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the 1990s, Canada, member states of the European Space Agency, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States entered into an international agreement Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station. Among the many unique infrastructure challenges, partners were to develop a comprehensive international medical system and related processes to enable crew medical certification and medical support for all phases of missions, in a framework to support a multilateral space program of unprecedented size, scope, and degree of integration. During the Shuttle/Mir Program, physicians and specialized experts from the United States and Russia studied prototype systems and developed and operated collaborative mechanisms. The 1998 NASA Memoranda of Understanding with each of the other four partners established the Multilateral Medial Policy Board, the Multilateral Space Medicine Board, and the Multilateral Medical Operations Panel as medical authority bodies to ensure International Space Station (ISS) crew health and performance. Since 1998, the medical system of the ISS Program has ensured health and excellent performance of the international crewsan essential prerequisite for the construction and operation of the ISSand prevented mission-impacting medical events and adverse health outcomes. As the ISS is completing its second decade of crewed operation, it is prudent to appraise its established medical framework for its utility moving forward in new space exploration initiatives. Not only the ISS Program participants, but other nations and space agencies as well, concomitant with commercial endeavors in human spaceflight, can benefit from this evidence for future human exploration programs.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a common problem in aviation. The identification of efficacious fatigue countermeasures is crucial for sustaining flight performance during fatigue-inducing operations. Stimulants are not recommended for consistent use, but are often implemented during flight operations with a high risk of fatigue. As such, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of approved stimulants for sustaining flight performance, alertness, and mood. METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science) were systematically searched to identify research on the effects of caffeine, dextroamphetamine, and modafinil during simulated or in-flight operations. RESULTS: There were 12 studies identified that assessed the effects of at least 1 stimulant. Overall, dextroamphetamine and modafinil were effective for sustaining flight performance and pilot mood during extended wakefulness. Results with caffeine were inconsistent. DISCUSSION: Dextroamphetamine and modafinil appear to sustain flight performance and mood during extended wakefulness. However, most studies have used flight simulators and short operation durations. Additional research is needed in realistic settings and during longer duration operations. Caffeines effects were inconsistent across studies, possibly due to differences in study methodology or individual caffeine responses. Despite fatigue being a common problem in civilian aviation as well, only one study in this review included civil aviators. More research should be conducted on the effects of caffeine during civil operations. CONCLUSION: Dextroamphetamine and modafinil appear to be effective fatigue countermeasures but should be further evaluated in more ecologically valid settings. The effects of caffeine are unclear at this time and should continue to be evaluated. Ehlert AM, Wilson PB. Stimulant use as a fatigue countermeasure in aviation .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypoxia is an ever-present threat in tactical aviation and gained recent attention due to its putative role in physiological episodes. Previous work has demonstrated that hypoxia negatively impacts a variety of sensory, cognitive, and motor systems. In particular, the visual system is one of the earliest systems affected by hypoxia. While the majority of previous studies have relied on self-report and behavioral testing, the use of event-related potentials as a novel tool to monitor responses to low oxygen in humans has recently been investigated. Specifically, ERP components that are evoked passively in response to unattended changes in background sensory stimulation have been explored. METHOD: Subjects ( N 28) completed a continuous visuomotor tracking task while EEG was recorded. During the tracking task, a series of standard color checkerboard patterns were presented in the periphery while occasionally a deviant color checkerboard was presented. The visual mismatch negativity (MMN) component was assessed in response to the deviant compared to the standard stimuli. Subjects completed two sessions in counterbalanced order that only differed by the oxygen concentration breathed (10.6% vs. 20.4%). RESULTS: Results demonstrated a significant reduction in the amplitude of the visual MMN under hypoxic compared to normoxic conditions, showing a 50% reduction in amplitude during hypoxia. Our results suggest that during low-oxygen exposure the ability to detect environmental changes and process sensory information is impaired. DISCUSSION: The visual MMN may represent an early and reliable predictor of sensory and cognitive deficits during hypoxia exposure, which may be of great use to the aviation community.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue of air force pilots has become an increasing concern due to changes in mission characteristics. In the current study we investigated fatigue, emotions, and cognitive performance in a simulated 11-h mission in the 39 Gripen fighter aircraft. METHODS: A total of 12 subjects were evaluated in a high-fidelity dynamic flight simulator for 12 consecutive hours. Perceived fatigue was measured by the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Index (SPFI). Emotions were assessed with the Circumplex Affect Space. Cognitive performance was assessed by five cognitive tasks. RESULTS: Significant increase in self-reported fatigue, general decrease in two positive emotional states, as well increase of one negative emotional state occurred after approximately 7 h into the mission. Self-reported fatigue negatively correlated with enthusiasm and cheerfulness (r 0.75; 0.49, respectively) and positively correlated with boredom and gloominess (r 0.61; r 0.30, respectively). Response time in the low-order task negatively correlated with enthusiasm, cheerfulness and calmness (r 0.44; r 0.41; r 0.37, respectively) and positively correlated with boredom and anxiousness (r 0.37; r 0.28, respectively). Mission duration had an adverse impact on emotions in these environmental conditions, particularly after 7 h. DISCUSSION: These results contribute to the understanding of fatigue development in general and of emotion-cognition relationships. These findings emphasize that both emotional states and the type of cognitive tasks to be performed should be considered for planning long-duration missions in single-piloted fighter aircrafts as to increase the probability of missions success.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Commercial airline travel poses a recognized risk to patients with respiratory disease, including in those with asthma. Hypoxic challenge testing (HCT) is typically employed to mitigate this risk by dictating in-flight oxygen requirement. METHODS: The role of HCT has not been formally studied in patients with severe asthma and we therefore evaluated HCT assessment in a cohort of patients with severe asthma ( N = 37). RESULTS: Over half (57%) of patients had a positive HCT. Baseline oxygen saturation (S p o 2 ) was poorly predictive of a recommendation for supplementary oxygen in flight; two-thirds of those deemed to require oxygen had a baseline S p o 2 &gt; 95%. A combination of any two of: P a o 2 ≤ 10.5 kPa, FEV 1 ≤ 60% predicted, and PEF ≤ 350 L · min −1 predicted the need for in-flight oxygen with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 69%. Furthermore, no patient with an S p o 2 &gt; 95% and FEV 1 &gt; 85% predicted had a positive HCT. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings indicate that HCT should be considered for all patients with severe asthma, regardless of resting oxygen saturation level.George PM, Orton C, Ward S, Menzies-Gow A, Hull JH.

    "abstract": "Climbing and trekking at altitude are common recreational and military activities. Physiological effects of altitude are hypoxia and hyperventilation. The hyperventilatory response to altitude may cause respiratory muscle fatigue and reduce sustained submaximal exercise. Voluntary isocapnic hyperpnea respiratory muscle training (VIHT) improves exercise endurance at sea level and at depth. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that VIHT would improve exercise time at altitude [3600 m (11,811 ft)] compared to control and placebo groups.Subjects pedaled an ergometer until exhaustion at simulated altitude in a hypobaric chamber while noninvasive arterial saturation (Sao2), ventilation (VE), and oxygen consumption (Vo2) were measured.As expected, Sao2 decreased to 88 ± 4% saturation at rest and to 81 ± 2% during exercise, and was not affected by VIHT. VIHT resulted in a 40% increase in maximal training VE compared to pre-VIHT. Exercise endurance significantly increased 44% after VIHT (P = <0.001). Vo2 (30 ± 3 ml · kg(-1) · min(-1)) and heart rate (177 ± 10 bpm) did not change during exercise and were not affected by VIHT (P = 0.531). Pre-VIHT VE increased 21-27% during the initial 12 min of exercise, after which it decreased 17% at 17.7 ± 6.0 min. VE at altitude post-VIHT increased more (49%) for longer (21 min) and decreased less (11% at 25.4 ± 6.7 min).VIHT improved exercise time at altitude and sustained VE. This suggests that VIHT reduced respiratory muscle fatigue and would be useful to trekkers and military personnel working at altitude. Helfer S, Quackenbush J, Fletcher M, Pendergast DR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In-flight cardiac arrest (IFCA) is a relatively rare but challenging event. Outcomes and prognostic factors are not entirely understood for victims of IFCAs in commercial aviation. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of airline passengers who experienced IFCA. Demographic and operational variables were studied to identify association in a multivariate logistic regression model with the outcome of survival-to-hospital. In-flight medical emergencies were processed by a ground-based medical center. Subsequent comparisons were made between reported shockable-rhythm (RSR) and reported non-shockable-rhythm (RNSR) groups. Logistic regression was also used to identify predictors for shock advised and flight diversions using a case control study design. Significant predictors for survival-to-hospital were RSR and remaining flight time to destination. RESULTS: The percentage of RSR cases was 24.6%. The survival to hospital admission was 22.7% (22/97) for passengers in RSR compared with 2.4% (7/297) in the RNSR group. The adjusted odds ratio for survival-to-hospital for the RSR group compared to the RNSR group was 13.6 (5.5–33.5). The model showed odds for survival to hospital decreased with longer scheduled remaining flight duration with adjusted OR = 0.701 (0.535–0.920) per hour increase. No correlation between diversions and survival for RSR cases was found. CONCLUSIONS: Survival-to-hospital from IFCAs is best when an RSR is present. The percentage of RSR cases was lower than in other out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) settings, which suggests delayed discovery. Flight diversions did not significantly affect resuscitation outcome. We emphasize good quality cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation as key factors for IFCA survival.Alves PM, DeJohn CA, Ricaurte EM, Mills WD.

    "abstract": "Anxiety may present challenges for commercial spaceflight operations, as little is known regarding the psychological effects of spaceflight on laypersons. A recent investigation evaluated measures of anxiety during centrifuge-simulated suborbital commercial spaceflight, highlighting the potential for severe anxiousness to interrupt spaceflight operations.To pave the way for future research, an extensive literature review identified existing knowledge that may contribute to formation of interventions for anxiety in commercial spaceflight. Useful literature was identified regarding anxiety from a variety of fields, including centrifugation, fear of flying, motion sickness, and military operations.Fear of flying is the most extensively studied area, with some supportive evidence from centrifugation studies. Virtual reality exposure (VRE) is as effective as actual training flight exposure (or analog exposure) in mitigation of flight-related anxiety. The addition of other modalities, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or biofeedback, to VRE improves desensitization compared to VRE alone. Motion sickness-susceptible individuals demonstrate higher trait anxiety than nonsusceptible individuals; for this reason, motion sickness susceptibility questionnaires may be useful measures to identify at-risk individuals. Some military studies indicate that psychiatric history and personality classification may have predictive value in future research. Medication countermeasures consisting of benzodiazepines may quell in-flight anxiety, but do not likely improve anxiety on repeat exposure.The scarce available literature addressing anxiety in unique environments indicates that training/repeated exposure may mitigate anxiety. Anxiety and personality indices may be helpful screening tools, while pharmaceuticals may be useful countermeasures when needed. Mulcahy RA, Blue RS, Vardiman JL, Castleberry TL, Vanderploeg JM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that can affect civilian pilots’ health. Its prevalence and the correlation with periodontal disease (PD) among pilots had not been previously reported. The aim of the study was to determine MetS and PD status, and to reveal their relationship in a representative sample of Chinese civilian pilots. METHODS: We investigated 303 civilian pilots (mean age 34.92 ± 7.66 yr). General information as well as blood and saliva samples were collected. Diagnostic criteria for MetS were based on the joint interim statements of several medical organizations. Periodontal status was evaluated by Community Periodontal Index (CPI). Measurements included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure (BP), concentration of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), saliva matrix metalloproteinase-8, and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). RESULTS: Of the subjects, 38.28% showed MetS and 23.10% showed periodontitis. Significant differences were found between the MetS and non-MetS pilots in total flying hours, CPI, WC, BP, TG, HDL-C, FPG, BMI, and TIMP-1. Significant relationships were found between MetS and CPI, BMI, and TIMP-1. The odds ratios were 3.378 (95%CI: 1.889–5924) for CPI, 1.269 (95%CI: 1.101–1.463) for BMI, and 0.600 (95%CI: 0.399–0.904) for TIMP-1. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MetS was sufficiently high to be a matter of medical concern, and was associated with PD among civilian pilots.Chen X, Xie L, Liu Y, Chen D, Yu Q, Gan X, Yu H.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biomathematical modeling software like the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness (SAFTE) model and Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST) help carriers predict fatigue risk for planned rosters. The ability of a biomathematical model to accurately estimate fatigue risk during unprecedented operations, such as COVID-19 humanitarian ultra-long-range flights, is unknown. Azul Cargo Express organized and conducted five separate humanitarian missions to China between May and July 2020. Prior to conducting the missions, a sleep-prediction algorithm (AutoSleep) within SAFTE-FAST was used to predict in-flight sleep duration and pilot effectiveness. Here we compare AutoSleep predictions against pilots' sleep diary and a sleep-tracking actigraphy device (Zulu watch, Institutes for Behavior Resources) from Azul's COVID-19 humanitarian missions.METHODS: Pilots wore Zulu watches throughout the mission period and reported sleep duration for their in-flight rest periods using a sleep diary. Agreement between AutoSleep, diary, and Zulu watch measures was compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Goodness-of-fit between predicted effectiveness distribution between scenarios was evaluated using the R² statistic.RESULTS: A total of 20 (N = 20) pilots flying across 5 humanitarian missions provided sleep diary and actigraphy data. ICC and R² values were >0.90, indicating excellent agreement between sleep measures and predicted effectiveness distribution, respectively.DISCUSSION: Biomathematical predictions of in-flight sleep during unprecedented humanitarian missions were in agreement with actual sleep patterns during flights. These findings indicate that biomathematical models may retain accuracy even under extreme circumstances. Pilots may overestimate the amount of sleep that they receive during extreme flight-duty periods, which could constitute a fatigue risk.Devine JK, Garcia CR, Simoes AS, Guelere MR, de Godoy B, Silva DS, Pacheco PC, Choynowski J, Hursh SR.

Flight performance, secondary task performance, and electrogastrogram were measured during VR flight simulation. The standardized simulator sickness and presence questionnaires were administered.RESULTS: Electrogastrogram measures such as dominant power instability coefficient (DPIC) and percentages of bradygastric waves (%B) were lower in the GVS session than the control session in the flight simulation (DPIC: 0.44 vs. 0.54; %B: 21.2% vs. 30.5%) and postflight (DPIC: 0.38 vs. 0.53; %B: 22.8% vs. 31.4%) periods.

The high-altitude (HA) group comprised 22 college student immigrants who were born and raised at low altitudes and had lived at a HA (11,975 ft/3650 m) for 26 mo (tests were conducted when they returned to HA for 3 mo). The low-altitude (LA) group comprised 23 college students who had never visited HA areas before.RESULTS: Compared with the LA group, the HA group had a higher pulse rate, lower oxygen saturation level, and decreased alerting and orienting effects in the behavioral results. The ERP results of the HA group showed a smaller P1 in the occipital area, a larger N1 both in the parietal and occipital areas of the alerting network, and a smaller P1 and larger N1 in the orienting network than the LA group. In the executive control network, the N2 amplitude of the HA group was more negative and the P3 amplitude of the HA group decreased in incongruent conditions.DISCUSSION: Together, these findings suggest that high-altitude migrants are less effective at alerting and orienting than low-altitude residents.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Inhalation of hydrazine or hydrazine-derivative (for example, monomethylhydrazine) vapors during spaceflight operations remains a risk to crew and ground support personnel. Here we sought to provide an evidence-based approach to inform acute clinical treatment guidelines for inhalational exposures during a noncatastrophic contingency spaceflight recovery scenario. METHODS: A review of published literature was conducted concerning hydrazine/hydrazine-derivative exposure and clinical sequelae. Priority was given to studies that described inhalation though studies of alternative routes of exposure were additionally reviewed. Where possible, human clinical presentations were prioritized over animal studies. RESULTS: Rare human case reports of inhalational exposure and multiple animal studies provide evidence of varied clinical sequelae, including mucosal irritation, respiratory concerns, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hemotoxicity (including Heinz body development and methemoglobinemia), and longitudinal risks. In an acute timeframe (minutes to hours), clinical sequelae are likely to be limited to mucosal and respiratory risk; neurological, hepatotoxic, and hemotoxic sequelae are unlikely without recurrent, longitudinal, or noninhalational exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Acute clinical management should focus on likely clinical concerns as supported by existing data; recovery medical personnel should be prepared to manage mucosal irritation and respiratory concerns, including the potential need for advanced airway management. There is little evidence supporting the need for acute interventions for neurotoxicity and there is no evidence that acute hemotoxic sequelae would drive the need for on-scene management of methemoglobinemia, Heinz body development, or hemolytic anemia. Training that overemphasizes neurotoxic or hemotoxic sequelae or specific treatments for such conditions potentially raises the risk for inappropriate treatment or operational fixation.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Assessment of fitness for flight constitutes one of the core tasks of aeromedical professionals. The value of such evaluations depends on the decision to be based on complete medical information, valid risk methodology, and genuine flight safety indicators. To achieve these goals, the aeromedical practitioner should ensure an evidence-based approach. METHODS: This article describes a pragmatic and evidence-based methodology for aeromedical fitness assessments, grounded on already validated principles within scientific epistemology and evidence-based clinical medicine. RESULTS: The aeromedical assessment should integrate both individual variables of the particular applicant, deductive reasoning by relevant experts, and the best available scientific evidence. Each of these three pillars includes a set of specific aspects based on knowledge of precision medicine, flight environment, risk methodology, statistics, metacognition, and scientific method. DISCUSSION: Despite evidence-based approach being the benchmark, the aeromedical practitioner should be aware of limitations and potential pitfalls. The conclusion should be based on both functional performance and future risk of medical incapacitation using a transparent and objective risk matrix. Saehle T.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In space, under weightlessness conditions, human brain activity is changed due to the shifting of body fluid and blood toward the cephalic region. This shifting leads to changes in cerebral hemodynamics and, consequently, neurophysiological function, which impacts mental functions like cognition and decision-making capabilities of space travelers. The present study reports the effect of acute exposure to simulated microgravity on cognitive functions and event-related potentials. METHODS: There were 18 healthy human subjects who participated in a 1-h 6° head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest to simulate physiological conditions during microgravity. Subjects were instructed to perform event-related potential tasks and cognitive tasks with a simulator sickness questionnaire to evaluate their performance, attention, and alertness during weightlessness, at baseline, after microgravity exposure, and after a recovery of 30 min. RESULTS: A significant change was found in the latency of P300 as compared to the baseline. The amplitude of the P300 wave was changed during HDT. The mean reaction time of contingent negative variation increased significantly as compared to the baseline. A significant increase in choice reaction time was observed during HDT vs. baseline. The values recovered partially after 30 min of exposure. DISCUSSION: It was concluded that simulated microgravity impacts mental functions as evidenced by alterations in choice reaction time and event-related potential latencies and reaction time. The study has applied value for understanding neurophysiological responses and optimization of cognitive performance in space conditions.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mission Controllers (MCs) are the main point of contact for space crews and are vital for successful human spaceflight. On a mission to Mars, there will be as long as 22-min one-way communication delays between the ground and the crew, causing major changes to current communication infrastructures. METHODS: This exploratory study assessed the impact of a 20-min one-way communication delay on MCs’ task performance, workload, and stress levels under nominal and off-nominal conditions, conducted during a 21-d analog mission. RESULTS: Decrements in performance were noted on both nominal and off-nominal task completion in time-delay conditions [100% of real-time (rt) tasks complete, 16.7% of time-delay (td) tasks incomplete; 12.50% of nominal tasks and 33.33% of off-nominal tasks were incomplete]; more errors on task record forms (td = 6 forms, rt = 1 form); higher ratings of workload burden (nominal, td workload = 38.64; off-nominal, td workload = 58.72; nominal, rt workload = 34.00, off-nominal, rt workload = 52.78). No significant changes in MC stress levels were detected in rt compared to td, but MCs did report greater stress during off-nominal tasks compared to nominal tasks. The crew, however, were unable to detect these changes in MC stress levels. DISCUSSION: Overall, these findings point to the importance of future research focused on MC training and adapting MC’s operations for time-delayed missions. Further studies of time-delayed analog missions could help determine additional solutions focused on technology advances. Diamond M, Leon GR, de León P.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Metaphoric signs, which refer to a resemblance to something absent, are, like pareidolia, strong cognitive tools that help us understand abstract concepts by relating them to concrete, sensory experiences, and these have not been studied in student pilots. Evaluating the characteristics of students in aviation, including sensory experiences such as stress, decision-making, and pattern recognition, is important for safe flight. This study aims to investigate the cognitive and emotional impacts of face pareidolia among pilot students by using the digital Pareidolia Test (PT). METHODS: Subjects were 86 students from the Professional Pilot B.Sc. Program. PT includes 10 face and 10 pareidolia images. The number of European Aviation Safety Agency flight and simulator training hours, stress levels, and perceiving emotion in the pareidolia and face images were assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to test normality, and the Chi-squared test was used to analyze differences. RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences in perceiving emotion in facial images based on stress levels from flight training from faculty courses ( N = 42/86, 49.9%), and perceiving faces in pareidolia images related to flight simulator training hours. Perceiving emotions in pareidolia images varied significantly based on the number of European Aviation Safety Agency tests, but perceiving faces on pareidolia images did not show significant differences. DISCUSSION: We claim that incorporating pareidolia in aviation training enhances pilots’ pattern recognition abilities, facilitating more accurate decision-making. The research recommends using the new digital PT in professions that require attention, such as pilots, to evaluate these parameters. Akdeniz G, Yilmaz HE, Geza H.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In-flight medical incapacitation jeopardizes flight safety. To reduce such breakdown episodes, airlines have implemented a sick leave system. This study aimed to examine the association of total flight hours and health status with sick leave use among civilian pilots in South Korea and to identify the demand for a health promotion program. METHODS: For data collection, an online survey was conducted between August–November 2018, involving pilots of nine civil airlines in South Korea. A total of 456 pilots responded, of which data from 6 were excluded due to missing items; 450 pilots were included in the final analysis. The SPSS WIN 26.0 software was used for analysis, and a logistic regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: The factors influencing sick leave were 7.39 times higher in the case of 1000–4999 h of total flight time than in the case of less than 1000 h, and 2.19 times higher for those with pre-existing conditions than for those without. DISCUSSION: Future research is needed to focus on the relationship between sick leave use and chronic diseases and between sick leave use and health-promoting behaviors among pilots. In addition, health promotion programs may be more effective if they are tailored to the job characteristics of pilots. Furthermore, counseling and education programs regarding the numerous harms of high-risk drinking must be strengthened. This may include emphasizing the negative effects of drinking on flight safety and personal health. Han B-S, Choi E-H, Kim M-S.

This study examined trends in insomnia and SA incidence rates in U.S. military aviators from 2006–2022 and examined associated demographic and operational factors. METHODS: Data on incidence cases of outpatient insomnia and SA, aviator demographics, and operational factors were obtained from the Defense Medical Epidemiological Database, a comprehensive online archive of military medical data. Insomnia and SA cases were identified using specific International Classification of Diseases codes. RESULTS: For the entire military aviator population ( N = 331,992 ± 1649, mean ± SD) overall rates of insomnia and SA were 10.2 and 24.9 cases/1000 person-years, respectively. Compared to the entire U.S. military nonaviator population, aviators had lower incidence of insomnia, but higher incidence of SA. Insomnia rates among aviators increased up to 2015 and declined afterwards, while SA rate generally rose over the period. Insomnia and SA rates among aviators increased with age, were higher among those of black and other nonwhite races, were highest among Army personnel (compared to other services) and were highest among helicopter pilots (compared to fixed-wing aircraft pilots). Insomnia rates were similar among male and female aviators, but SA rates were higher among men. DISCUSSION: These data indicate that insomnia and SA are prevalent within the military aviation population; however, the incidence of insomnia appears to have fallen as the tempo of military operations has decreased while the incidence of SA continues on an upward trajectory, possibly associated with the growing problem of obesity.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Incidental neuroanatomical findings are commonly identified during brain MRI completed clinically, for research, or for other purposes, including aircrew screening. Such findings range from benign to pathological and some may be disqualifying for flight duties. We present a series of cases with incidental neuroanatomical findings identified in Royal Canadian Armed Forces (RCAF) aircrew during the Canadian White Matter Hyperintensity research study, and the subsequent aeromedical evaluation undertaken to manage them. Our study group performed 48 brain MRI scans on 42 RCAF pilots and 6 aviation physiology technicians and parajumpers. Participants were men ages 25–70 with a mean age of 39. CASE SERIES: Incidental neuroanatomical findings were detected in four pilots, with six distinct findings (four vascular abnormalities, one arachnoid cyst, and one nonspecific nodule). All cases were asymptomatic. After evaluation of the findings of each case by a medical consortium, including an aeromedical neurologist, all pilots were cleared for ongoing duties with no restrictions. DISCUSSION: The rate and nature of incidental findings in RCAF members in the White Matter Hyperintensity Study is consistent with that found in both the general population and in other military pilot populations. There is no international standard for screening or management of incidental findings; therefore, we recommend an approach that involves a case-by-case evaluation of the findings by a multidisciplinary medical team, with careful identification and consideration for high-risk features.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Through the Artemis program, space agencies and astronauts are preparing for extended durations in space and on planetary surfaces, expanding their occupational tasks. Although standardized laboratory tests are effective in assessing health and mitigating deconditioning, their reliability in forecasting occupational performance is uncertain. Consequently, a recent shift in exercise testing has emerged, shifting focus from health-oriented criteria to operational performance. This involves identifying the physical demands associated with components of an astronaut’s tasks and determining a minimum level of performance, referred to as Physical Employment Standards. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an updated overview of the scientific literature on astronaut occupational tasks and physiological requirements. METHODS: A search was conducted spanning from 1970 to October 2023. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria underwent screening using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for an evidence-based systematic review. RESULTS: There were 10 studies selected for inclusion in the current review and pertinent information was extracted. There were 14 tasks physiologically assessed: ambulation on various terrains, physical abilities field, device operations/activity board, re-entry and landing, hatch opening, capsule egress, recovery from fall, jump down, ladder climb, material transfer, emergency crewmember drag, hand drilling, construction wrenching, and upper-limb weighted tasks. DISCUSSION: Physical Employment Standards for astronauts have yet to be established; however, certain tasks have been identified, enabling tailored occupational assessments for astronauts, increasingly recognized as tactical athletes. The results of this literature review lay the foundations for scientific task analysis and the development of operational physical tests for astronauts.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In private aviation, procedures for collecting feedback have been established to gather information about unsafe situations related to aircraft use. The REX FFA system, which stands for “Feedback from the French Aeronautical Federation,” allows French private pilots to report accidents, incidents, and hazardous events to increase flight safety. METHODS: This study explores feedback from the REX FFA system to understand the human factors influencing flight safety. We retrospectively analyzed, using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System, 150 reports submitted between September 2023 and February 2024. Key lessons were also extracted from each report. RESULTS: Most incidents (64%) involved human factors. Using the HFACS model, we identified 99 unsafe acts, 150 preconditions for unsafe acts, 21 instances of unsafe supervision, and 24 organizational failures. Skill-based errors were the most common unsafe act. Key lessons emphasized the importance of proactive visual scanning, thorough flight preparation, and strict adherence to checklists. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the predominance of human error in general aviation incidents. The data collected through the REX FFA system suggest it could be an effective educational tool, enabling pilots to share and learn from their experiences and providing valuable data for proactive corrective measures. Promoting similar systems dedicated to recreational private aviation could further benefit general aviation safety worldwide. Demoulin R, Stalars C.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meningocele results from a defect in the skull base bone, causing meningeal prolapse. Clinical manifestations of meningocele are often nonspecific and prone to misdiagnosis. Inadequate treatment may lead to severe complications, including cerebrospinal fluid leakage, meningitis, or, in rare cases, epilepsy, thereby posing significant risks to patients involved in aerospace operations. Historically, meningocele cases have predominantly been reported in fetuses and infants, with limited analysis and documentation focused on adults, particularly aviation pilots. CASE REPORT: During a routine annual physical examination, a male student pilot was found to have an enlarged right foramen ovale accompanied by meningocele. Imaging via 3T magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans revealed a tubular, beaded cystic formation in the right parapharyngeal space, indicating meningocele with an enlarged right foramen ovale and confirming its location at the right middle cranial base. Given the structural abnormality, it was assessed that the pilot is unsuitable for exposure to high acceleration forces. Consequently, he was restricted to operating non-high-performance aircraft, such as bombers, helicopters, and carrier-based aircraft. DISCUSSION: Treatment and flight duty determinations for affected pilots must consider individual case specifics. In this instance, the absence of pre-examination symptoms suggested minimal clinical severity, negating the need for surgical intervention. To ensure both flight safety and pilot health, thorough pre-enlistment physical screenings and ongoing assessments throughout a pilot’s career are crucial for accurately evaluating physical readiness.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ebullism is the pathophysiological process that occurs as a result of exposures to extremely low ambient pressures, traditionally below 47 mmHg (&lt;0.9 psi, ∼63,000 ft/19,202 m equivalent). However, this field of research has made minimal progress since the 1940s–1960s, when the physiology of high altitude/space operations was being explored. This lack of progress is in part because it is thought of as invariably lethal and also because it requires unique facilities to simulate these environments. As a result, no standardized time/pressure profiles or animal models have been established. METHODS: A rodent animal model ( N = 20) was exposed to rapid depressurization as low as 0.3 mmHg for up to 2 min; controls were placed in the chamber but not exposed to a pressure change. Autopsies were performed to characterize the pathophysiology of ebullism at extreme altitudes. RESULTS: A three-tiered pressure approach was developed that allows for varying degrees of exposure (pressure and time). Although previous studies focused on exposures above or below the Armstrong Line (∼63 kft), we noted significant thermal impacts due to exceeding the water triple point (∼120 kft). DISCUSSION: This initial study highlights the different pathophysiological regimes that exist beyond Armstrong’s line and subdivides ebullism exposures into two different classes, which can be operationally associated with cabin vs. suit depressurization events.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There are various motion sickness (MS) simulators in the laboratory, but the conditions under which they induce MS symptoms are different from real-life conditions. This study aimed to design a seasickness simulator, close to ecological conditions, easy to set up, at a modest cost, and capable of rapidly inducing MS symptoms, to evaluate the effect of anti-motion sickness devices. The hypothesis was that this simulator would induce MS, reflecting the susceptibility of subjects in real-life conditions, meaning the more susceptible individuals were to MS in real conditions, the more severe and rapid their symptoms would be in the simulator. METHODS: A total of 65 subjects with varying degrees of MS susceptibility (MS Susceptibility Questionnaire Short form) were exposed to a seasickness simulator for a maximum of 10 min. Measurements of subjective symptoms (Visual Analog Scale and time to onset of first symptoms) and physiological variables (heart rate and temperature) were taken. RESULTS: Subjects covered the full range of MS susceptibility (from 0–100%). The average time in the simulator before the first symptoms of MS was 7.41 min ± 2.56 min. The time to onset of the first symptoms, the intensity of the symptoms, and heart rate were significantly correlated with the degree of susceptibility of subjects in real-life conditions. DISCUSSION: The simulator induced varying intensity of MS depending on the subjects’ susceptibility. It thus replicates real-life conditions and can serve as a useful tool for facilitating the research of devices, techniques, and medications to combat MS. de Thierry de Faletans C, Misericordia M, Vallier J-M, Duché P, Watelain E.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cochlear implants (CIs) have revolutionized the management of deafness. Combined with newborn screening, children are being identified earlier and rehabilitated with CIs, allowing them to be mainstreamed in the education system. The aviation community has begun to see a new generation of pilots who are now seeking careers in aviation with the use of CI. METHODS: A literature review using the Ovid Medline database was conducted. A search for airmen within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airman Medical Certification System with a diagnostic code for CIs was reviewed up to the year 2021. RESULTS: There are no studies to date documenting airmen with CIs. The FAA has certified 42 airmen with Cis, including 10 with First Class Medical Certificates. Airmen with CIs have been able to successfully pursue careers in aviation from general aviation to commercial airline pilot in the United States. DISCUSSION: CIs are used for both bilateral and single-sided deafness and are becoming more prevalent within the general population. Applicants with CIs are now seeking careers in aviation in increasing numbers. The FAA has successfully certified airmen from Class III to Class I airline pilots. It requires appropriate evaluation and screening, including a medical flight test to document adequate communication, recognition of alarms within the cockpit, and the ability to communicate with air traffic control.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A study of fatigue in British military rotary-wing pilots was conducted to determine the utility of actigraphy-driven fatigue modeling in the military rotary-wing environment. METHODS: A total of 48 pilots were recruited across the 3 military services of the United Kingdom. Objective fatigue was predicted using wearable actigraphy and the Sleep Activity Fatigue Task Effectiveness (SAFTE) fatigue model. Subjective data were collected from daily questionnaires completed by the study subjects, including an assessment of their own fatigue level using Samn-Perelli Scale scores. The relationship between these two data sets was then assessed with correlation and linear regression modeling. RESULTS: There were 38 men and 2 women recruited. The mean age was 36.4 yr (standard deviation ± 6.5, range 26–52 yr). In total, 200 flights were undertaken, with a mean flight time of 156 min (± 77.1, range 15–480); the mean landing time of these flights was 18:45 (range 11:00–02:30). The data included 37 d of pilots deployed on exercise. SAFTE scores were shown to decline for night flying, especially if landing after 22:00. With increasing subjective levels of fatigue, the relationship between SAFTE and Samn-Perelli Scale scores in subjects weakened. DISCUSSION: Actigraphy-driven modeling has a role in specific aspects of military rotary-wing aviation. Consideration should be given to its use in specific scenarios, including night-flying and flights undertaken when deployed on exercise. Pelham A, Van Tongeren M, Arnold H, Cocco P.

    "abstract": "Female aviators and aircrew face unique occupational exposures, including noise, whole-body vibrations, toxic chemicals, intermittent hypoxia, and high gravitational forces. We evaluated associations between maternal occupations as aviators and aircrew during pregnancy and adverse pediatric health outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children born to female U.S. military officers from October 2002 to December 2019. Exposure was defined as the mother serving in an aviation or aircrew occupation at time of birth. Adverse health outcomes were identified by International Classification of Diseases codes. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed, adjusting for maternal age at delivery, maternal race and ethnicity, and marital status. A post hoc power analysis was performed. The study included 18,637 female officers. There were 1144 children of fixed-wing aviation officers and 25,889 children of non-aviation officers. There was decreased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes [hazard ratio (HR), 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.68-0.95], speech delay (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.89), and other and unspecified congenital anomalies (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.90) for children of aviators. There was no increased risk for any of the adverse pediatric outcomes. Five outcomes had sufficient sample size to detect significance. Although this study suggests that children of military officers in aviation careers do not have an increased risk for adverse pediatric outcomes, it was underpowered and cannot conclusively imply safety of maternal aviation occupational exposures during pregnancy. Further research must evaluate how prenatal exposure to flight affects subsequent pediatric health outcomes.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Long-duration spaceflight and isolated, confined, and extreme environments present various challenges to crewmembers. One less-frequently discussed challenge is altered sensory inputs and how they can adversely affect cognition and performance. Maintaining psychological and performance outcomes is crucial for mission success, and simple sensory-based countermeasures (CMs) can be surprisingly effective. This scoping review examines the impact of altered sensory inputs in these extreme environments, assesses current sensory-based CMs, and compares their effectiveness across sensory modalities to guide future strategies. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through comprehensive searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Science Direct, ProQuest, and the NASA Technical Reports Server. Searches included keywords related to the sensory modalities under investigation and potential outcomes. This review focused on English-language publications, with no date restrictions for sensory alterations and a focus on studies published after 2019 for countermeasure research. RESULTS: Spaceflight leads to sensory changes that affect health and performance. These alterations are highlighted, finding particularly prominent changes in lighting and auditory modalities. These changes result from altered sensory inputs and environmentally driven physiological alterations. Sensory input modulation can influence cognitive and psychological states, affecting performance. Sensory-based CMs were examined for their impact on psychological and performance domains. A total of 285 articles on sensory alterations and 180 on CMs were reviewed, with 52 and 59 articles included, respectively. DISCUSSION: Sensory-based CMs offer promising approaches to maintain or improve performance. Modulating sensory inputs can mitigate spaceflight-related challenges. Personalized, multisensory approaches appear particularly promising. The review highlights research gaps and suggests avenues for enhancing sensory CMs. White BM, Stankovic A, Thoolen S, Kosmyna N, Ivkovic V, Strangman G.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sinus barotrauma, or aerosinusitis, occurs during rapid atmospheric changes in aviation, primarily affecting the frontal sinus. Mucosal swelling from a cold or allergic rhinitis (AR) can obstruct pressure equalization, leading to mucosal tears, cranial pain, and nasal bleeding. Despite its significance in aerospace medicine, high-quality imaging, nasal endoscopy, long-term outcomes, and the impact of AR management on sinus barotrauma remain inadequately documented in the literature. CASE REPORT: A 29-yr-old healthy male healthcare provider experienced severe frontal sinus barotrauma during aircraft descent, presenting with intense frontal headache, ocular pain, and left epistaxis, with head computed tomography revealing a fully opacified left frontal sinus. Despite experiencing persistent severe AR symptoms daily, he had never been diagnosed or treated for AR, and his symptoms worsened during the flight. The clinical presentations and image findings suggested a diagnosis of frontal sinus barotrauma. His initial treatment included oral decongestants, antihistamines, and acetaminophen. Remarkably, follow-up computed tomography/magnetic resonance images over 2 wk, 1 mo, and 1 yr demonstrated the spontaneous resorption of the submucosal hemorrhage in the frontal sinus. Furthermore, though concurrently diagnosed with perennial AR due to house dust mite and cat fur sensitization, the patient’s effective pharmacological management of AR symptoms led to an uneventful flight 1 yr later. DISCUSSION: This case demonstrates that submucosal hemorrhages in the affected sinus generally resolve spontaneously within a year. Also, it highlights the critical need for diagnosing and managing sinonasal disorders in symptomatic individuals before flights to prevent sinus barotrauma. Park MJ, Kang SJ, Kim GT, Kim S.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to pressure changes can result in barotrauma in gas-filled cavities when volume expansion exceeds tissue strength, leading to local disruption. While few cases have been reported, we present a case of pulmonary barotrauma developed postflight in a pilot without underlying disease, and the most likely reason is improper pressure-breathing in flight. CASE REPORT: A 25-yr-old healthy male fighter pilot experienced slight chest pain 3 h after a 1-h flight training mission, during which the peak G was 6 G. The symptoms worsened during eating and were accompanied by chest tightness and shortness of breath. Chest CT scans showed pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema. Symptoms improved after oxygen inhalation and the pilot resumed flying duties (no high-G dynamic flight maneuvers) after 1 mo of observation on the ground. DISCUSSION: The case revealed pulmonary barotrauma in an experienced pilot with no disease history due to inappropriate positive pressure-breathing, suggesting the importance of fully training in positive pressure-breathing for G. We recommend pilots who experience unusual respiratory symptoms after landing report to medical for urgent review and the flight surgeon should, at that time, consider flight-related factors leading to barotrauma.

This Extended Minimum Crew Operations (eMCO) concept raises important aeromedical concerns: 1) a two-pilot cockpit is considered a main safety risk-mitigating factor and eMCO would therefore necessitate a new aeromedical risk assessment concept; 2) sensors and algorithms for monitoring physical and/or cognitive incapacitation are not available or insufficiently reliable; 3) scientific data of augmented long-haul flights is not valid for predicting effects of monotony and boredom or in-flight sleep and sleep inertia on alertness during eMCO cruise-flight; and 4) medical conditions regarding urination, defecation, or menstruation may cause an unscheduled visit to the toilet of the single pilot flying during cruise flight, who then has to request the resting pilot to take over the controls.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a morbid disease that potentially has lethal results, with even further professional ramifications in the aviation community. There are only a few reported cases on outcomes of fliers who developed DVT. As such, more research is needed to assist the aeromedical community in identifying high-risk individuals so that counseling and preventative measures are administered to avoid harmful outcomes. CASE REPORT: We present a 34-yr-old woman with several pre-existing comorbidities who developed ipsilateral DVTs in her lower extremity while in Oman that required medical evacuation back stateside. Days prior to her long-haul flight overseas, she presented to the local emergency department with right lower extremity DVT similar to a prior one she experienced. A week later, while departing the continental United States, she was evaluated by Emergency Medical Technicians for painful ambulation. After being symptomatic for over a week in country, she was admitted to a local hospital where formal diagnosis was made. DISCUSSION: Aviators are not as familiar with the risks and consequences of thrombus formation. This case highlights several key points, such as a thorough medical clearance process in conjunction with closed loop communication. A history of DVT with additional susceptibilities requires in-depth education prior to long distance travel. A thorough record review should be conducted on a high-risk servicemember to ensure medical optimization. When making the decision to use medical evacuation, risk stratification must be implemented early to ensure safe return. Cheng MT, Middel BL, Anderson KD.

SP effects have been studied only with confounding differences in regulator design. We compared a CRU-103 SP regulator to a CRU-103 with SP removed. The hypothesis was that SP does not alter breathing, only shifts pressure more positive. METHODS: Inspiratory flows and mask and hose pressures were measured in 24 subjects (29 for speech at rest, 31 for lung volumes) who breathed in counterbalanced order from both regulators while blind to SP condition. RESULTS: Both were easy to breathe. Neither was preferred overall. Between regulators, end-expiratory lung volume did not differ. SP stabilized hose pressure and favored inspiration: without speech, hose pressure swings were significantly lower (rest: 25%, exercise: 33%), as were inspiratory work of breathing at rest (33%) and peak inspiratory flow magnitude (rest: 14%; exercise: 11%). Waveforms showed interactions of mask valves and SP at the start and end of expiration. Mask leaks with SP activated the regulator during speech. DISCUSSION: SP as implemented in the CRU-103 causes mostly subtle differences in pressures and flows. The sensed difference during expiration may result from the initial large pressure gradient for expiratory flow. Shykoff BE, French DC, Warkander DE, Robinson FE.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With future manned missions that extend beyond low Earth orbit, it would be wise to anticipate all risks to astronaut health, including those relevant to ophthalmology and the ocular surface. Corneal edema has been documented among mice experiments conducted onboard the Space Transportation System mission, STS-133, owing to increased stress response gene expression. METHODS: A targeted, relevant search of the literature on topics relating to ocular surface and spaceflight was conducted with scholarly databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to July 2024. RESULTS: From our search results we identified 12,742 articles, 485 of which met the scope of our initial literature search criteria. Following refinement, 99 articles were included in our review paper. The most frequently mentioned mechanisms of corneal edema related to spaceflight included contact lens related hypoxia (24%). Regarding treatments for corneal edema, surgical grafts (16.9%) were most common. From our data, central corneal thickness measurements in astronauts with prior refractive surgery showed no significant differences pre- and postflight: right eye mean preflight, 492 µm vs. postflight, 493.3 µm; left eye, 499 µm pre- and postflight. DISCUSSION: This knowledge may contribute to our understanding of the increased risk of ocular surface symptoms reported among astronauts. This review discusses the current literature on corneal endothelial transport physiology and the detriments of corneal edema to astronaut visual function. We also describe the diagnostic modalities we can apply to spaceflight, such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and offer convenient countermeasures to spaceflight-related ocular surface anomalies. In doing so, we aim to make future missions safer for human exploration. Lee R, Ong J, Sampige R, Panzo N, Memon H, Suh A, Waisberg E, Mader T, Berdahl J, Chévez-Barrios P, Lee AG.

    "abstract": "This study investigated pilot cognitive engagement patterns across diverse flight conditions using electroencephalography (EEG)-based measurements in a high-fidelity rotary-wing simulation environment. A total of 8 experienced U.S. Army test pilots completed 24 flights across 3 distinct route designs using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Vertical Motion Simulator, with airspeeds ranging from 120 to 240 kn. Analysis focused on EEG Beta/(Alpha + Theta) ratios as indicators of changing cognitive engagement over time. Analyses revealed distinct cognitive engagement patterns across routes: highly variable individual responses in routes with changing navigation demands, more consistent cognitive engagement in systematic route designs, and intermediate variability in mixed-demand routes. Airspeed effects on cognitive engagement became particularly pronounced above 200 kn, though these effects varied significantly by route and individual pilot. Temporal analysis demonstrated evolving patterns of cognitive adaptation, with routes eliciting different progression patterns over extended flight periods. Regression analysis showed that EEG Beta/(Alpha+Theta) values increased significantly during all three routes, with mean increases ranging from 0.0051-0.0146. These findings provide quantifiable metrics for optimizing route design, developing personalized training approaches, and implementing real-time monitoring systems for enhanced aviation safety and performance.

    "abstract": "A 264-d isolation simulation, SFINCSS-99, was conducted in Moscow to replicate typical scenarios on an orbital space station. One long-term group of four Russian crewmembers occupied the isolation complex for most of the duration (240 d), while two international groups of four each spent 110 d successively at the complex. Additionally, there were several short visits by medical personnel. The main objective of this paper is to investigate group and individual behavioral dynamics, particularly the intercultural challenges faced during long-duration isolation, using insights from crewmembers' diaries. A variety of instruments and training activities, employed before, during, and after the mission, formed this multifaceted experiment. One key component, crewmembers' diaries, is the primary data source for this analysis. While unstructured instruments can be challenging to analyze, these diaries proved especially useful for studying group dynamics and identifying behavioral and intercultural issues. The crewmembers found our unstructured formats, such as these journals and post-mission interviews, to be a more effective means of expressing themselves compared to structured instruments. Personal journals, open-ended questions, and the freedom from constraints typically imposed by feedback instruments used for quantitative analysis are invaluable for observing and expressing crewmembers' psychological status, as well as inter-crew and intercultural dynamics. Personal journals can also provide a basis for constructive intervention by ground personnel, researchers, or psychologists. Insights from this study can be applied to current challenges, such as the adoption of self-isolation as prevention against spread of COVID-19. Kass JR, Kass R.

    "abstract": "Military fast jet pilots face significant physical challenges, including high Gz accelerations during dynamic maneuvers. The objectives of this study were threefold: 1) to record pilot movements during real flights, 2) to quantify head and trunk movements under standardized Gz conditions and during basic fighter maneuvers (BFMs), and 3) to categorize compensatory strategies used to mitigate physical strain. A total of 20 Eurofighter pilots (mean age: 28.2 ± 1.4 yr, all men) with >500 h EF2000 flight experience participated in the study. Video footage collected during the execution of a standardized mission card, including predetermined head movements and jet parameters (5, 7, 9 Gz), and free basic fighter maneuvers were analyzed. During scripted high-Gz maneuvers, 38.5% of pilots prepositioned their head for the up-max movement at 9 Gz. During check six, coping strategies were applied in 35.7% (5 Gz), 30.8% (7 Gz), and 33.3% (9 Gz) of the flights. During basic fighter maneuvers, an average of 63.6 ± 32.1 head movements per session and 27.2 ± 13.7 per set were performed by the pilots. It was observed that end-range movements (e.g., check six) were associated with a greater usage of coping strategies. The most commonly included strategies were the use of support points such as canopy rails. This real-flight study reveals frequent use of anticipatory head positioning and compensatory strategies under high Gz loads, especially during end-range movements. These behaviors appear to serve the purpose of reducing cervical strain and injury risk. The findings underscore the necessity for targeted training and the optimization of ergonomic design in pilot equipment. Lingscheid R, Albracht K, Goell F, Nuesse R, Rein R, Braunstein B.

    "abstract": "The rapidly expanding commercial spaceflight (CSF) market has fueled increasing interest in spaceflight experiences among individuals without professional astronaut qualifications. Such individuals may present with a range of medical conditions that add uncertainties to medical preparation and risk assessment for spaceflight. As the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) working group of the Aerospace Medical Association Ad Hoc Committee on Commercial Spaceflight, we conducted a scoping review to assess the available biomedical literature for ENT and neuro-vestibular conditions and physiology pertinent to spaceflight for nonprofessional space travelers. The scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. The initial database search produced 3232 articles. This set was reduced to 142 relevant publications through a rigorous two-reviewer filtering process using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Motion sickness and spatial disorientation were the most common topics of the final set of articles. In contrast, there was limited material on other relevant ENT topics such as hearing loss, sino-nasal dysfunction, and conditions of the pharynx. It becomes clear from this scoping review that the path forward in providing guidance for optimal medical management of CSF passengers will involve the integration of modern biomedical research findings with the accumulated clinical expertise in the civil and military aeromedical communities. We recommend building an industry-wide CSF medical database to address care gaps and improve specialized aerospace medical knowledge. Panic H, Wexler D, Stephanian B, Correia JP, Sides M, Hoffman T.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There has been long-standing interest in the physiological and psychological effects of mild hypoxia on aircrew, but to date there is no psychometrically valid self-report measure of subjective symptoms. METHODS: To address this gap, we developed a self-report scale along three dimensions of impairment: cognitive, sensory and affective. We administered this scale to active and retired aircrew ( N = 354) with on average 25.04 yr (SD = 11.27) of military service and subjected their responses to exploratory factor analysis using Maximum Likelihood Estimation, followed by reliability analysis to determine cohesiveness of associated items. RESULTS: We provide initial psychometric validation for our 12-item scale’s three-dimensional structure. The internal consistency reliability of the cognitive, sensory, and affective factors was 0.90, 0.75, and 0.85, respectively. DISCUSSION: Going forward, the consistent use of this instrument will likely reduce the methodological variability in measuring the symptoms of mild hypoxia in the literature.

Aeromedical concerns regarding WPW pattern include risk of dysrhythmia or sudden cardiac death (SCD), thus affecting the safety of flight. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and outcomes of aviators with asymptomatic WPW pattern and assess for risk factors that contribute to progression to dysrhythmia or symptoms. METHODS: The U.S. Air Force (USAF) ECG library database containing over 1.2 million ECGs collected over the past 68 yr was used to identify 638 individual aviators with WPW pattern. Demographic, medical history, and outcome data were obtained by medical record review. Aviators who developed high risk features defined as symptoms, arrhythmia, or ablation of a high risk pathway, were compared to those who remained asymptomatic. RESULTS: Prevalence of WPW pattern was 0.30% among all USAF aviators. Of the 638 individuals, 64 (10%) progressed to the combined endpoint of SCD, arrhythmia, and/or ablation of a high risk pathway over 6868 patient years, with average follow-up of 10.5 yr. There were two sudden cardiac deaths (0.3%). Annual risk of possible sudden incapacitation was 0.95% and of SCD 0.03%. Those that progressed to high risk were significantly younger, had lower diastolic blood pressure, lower total cholesterol, and better physical fitness testing scores.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning and/or development. ADHD occurs in about 2.5% of adults. ADHD can be an excluding medical condition among pilots due to the risk of attentional degradation and therefore impact on flight safety. Diagnosis of ADHD is complex, which complicates aeromedical assessment. This study highlights fatal accident cases among pilots with ADHD and discusses protocols to detect its presence to help to assess its importance to flight safety. METHODS: To identify fatal accidents in aviation (including airplanes, helicopters, balloons, and gliders) in the United States between the years 2000 to 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database was searched with the terms ADHD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and attention deficit disorder (ADD). RESULTS: The NTSB database search for fatal aviation accidents possibly associated with ADHD yielded four accident cases of interest in the United States [4/4894 (0.08%)]. Two of the pilots had ADHD diagnosed by a doctor, one was reported by a family member, and one by a flight instructor. An additional five cases were identified searching for ADD [5/4894 (0.1%)]. Altogether, combined ADHD and ADD cases yielded nine accident cases of interest (0.18%). DISCUSSION: It is generally accepted by aviation regulatory authorities that ADHD is a disqualifying neurological condition. Yet FAA and CASA provide specific protocols for tailor-made pilot assessment. Accurate evaluation of ADHD is essential because of its potential negative impact on aviation safety.Laukkala T, Bor R, Budowle B, Sajantila A, Navathe P, Sainio M, Vuorio A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The rate of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is influenced by environmental factors. Extracellular matrix (ECM) destruction and apoptosis of intervertebral disc cells are major characteristics of IVDD. ECM degradation is closely linked to up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP). This study aimed to elucidate the molecular biological changes during IVDD under conditions of weightlessness and hypergravity. METHODS: A total of 120 rabbits were divided randomly into four groups: control group, weightlessness group, hypergravity group, and mixed (hypergravity + weightlessness) group. Tail-suspension was used to simulate a weightless environment, and an animal centrifuge (+7 G z three times for 60 s) was used to mimic hypergravity conditions. After exposure to the above conditions for 30, 60, and 90 d, respectively, 10 rabbits were selected from each group for immunohistochemical determination of MMP-1, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 expression. TUNEL staining was also carried out to detect apoptotic cells in each group at each time point. RESULTS: MMP-1, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 were rarely expressed in the control group, but were positively expressed in the other three groups. The strongest expression was in the mixed group at every time point, followed by the hypergravity group, and then the weightlessness group. Cell apoptosis index followed a similar trend to MMPs and TIMP-1 expression. DISCUSSION: The results suggested that weightlessness and hypergravity may both aggravate IVDD over time, with hypergravity having a particularly marked effect.Wu D, Zheng C, Wu J, Huang R, Chen X, Zhang T, Zhang L.

However, no studies about EHFA were conducted on civilian pilots. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of EHFA as an assay to evaluate civilian pilots' hearing status.An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on 134 civilian pilots (case group) and 101 subjects without noise exposure (control group). All of the subjects underwent CA (0.25-8 kHz) and EHFA (9-20 kHz). The potential of EHFA for identifying early changes in hearing was assessed.The two audiometric tools both showed significantly higher hearing thresholds in the case group for most of the frequencies tested, but the differences were more obvious for EHFA. Compared with the control group, the average thresholds in the case group increased 3.15 dB at CA and 7.83 dB at EHFA for age 20-29. The number was 2.37 dB and 9.90 dB for age 30-39; 3.80 dB and 8.19 dB for age 40-49; and 10.84 dB and 16.86 dB for age 50-59. There were 74.6% of pilots who had hearing loss in at least in one ear and at one frequency in CA and 94.8% at EHFA. Significant differences in EHFA were observed also between pilots and their controls with normal hearing thresholds at CA.EHFA is more sensitive than CA and could be useful in detecting subclinical changes of hearing in civilian pilots.Ma F, Gong S, Liu S, Hu M, Qin C, Bai Y.

The potential for an in-flight medical event deserves the attention of certification authorities. Cardiac emergencies are among the most common serious events. The primary focus of this study was to examine whether the proportions of pilots with reported cardiac conditions could be used to identify those who had inflight medical incapacitations. METHODS: The Civil Aerospace Medical Institute Inflight Incapacitation Registry was searched to identify airline pilots with a cardiac history and an inflight medical event between 1995 and 2015. The Federal Aviation Administration's Decision Support System was searched for airline pilots without an inflight medical event. The cardiovascular history of incapacitated pilots was then compared to that of airline pilots without incapacitation events. RESULTS: Although a significantly greater proportion of airline pilots with cardiac events had pacemakers than a control group with the same cardiac history who did not have inflight events, no significant difference was found in the proportions of other markers of cardiac health. CONCLUSION: The proportions of airline pilots with identified cardiac conditions could not be reliably used to identify which pilots had inflight incapacitations.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although cardiac arrest during airline flights is relatively uncommon, the unusual setting, limited resources, and the variability of the skills in medical volunteers present unique challenges. Survival in patients who suffer a witnessed arrest with a shockable rhythm who are treated promptly has improved since the advent of widely available automated external defibrillators (AEDs). In general, the chances of survival from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are greater when ventricular fibrillation (VF) is seen as the initial rhythm or if there is return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Not all in-flight cardiac arrests are witnessed because cabin crew or fellow passengers might simply assume that the victim is sleeping. Based upon a review of the literature on resuscitation after OHCA, we recommend that automatic external defibrillators be carried on all commercial airline flights, regardless of duration. Patients presenting with shockable rhythm (e.g., VF, unstable ventricular tachycardia) have the best prognosis for survival and usually require diversion of the aircraft for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Because diversion may require interruption of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and may impact flight safety, the volunteer rescuer, cabin crew, flight crew, and medical consultation services should discuss the possible outcome and operational considerations before recommending a diversion for a patient with a nonshockable rhythm. The recommendations in this article were developed by members of the Air Transport Medicine and Aerospace Human Performance Committees and approved by the Council of the Aerospace Medical Association.

    "abstract": "PERCLOS is a metric that has been primarily studied in the domain of driver fatigue to predict performance decrements, but there is comparatively less research applying it to aviation, where hypoxia is a safety concern. Hypoxic exposure was expected to increase blink activity, possibly by means of impairing blink inhibition behavior, thereby leading to increased eyelid closure time.PERCLOS, blink rate, and blink duration were measured using head-mounted eye-tracking on pilots using a flight simulator inside a hypobaric chamber. Pilot subjects were tasked with programming the autopilot of a G-1000 console according to instructions from a simulated air traffic controller. Data was collected at 5% decrements in blood oxygen saturation (Spo2) through progressive decreases in hypobaric pressure to model slow-onset hypoxia.PERCLOS, blink rate, and blink duration increased significantly and linearly as a function of decreasing Spo2, and largely recovered in the posthypoxia normoxia condition. The greatest change in PERCLOS relative to the prehypoxia baseline occurred in the 80% Spo2 condition, whereas the greatest change in blink rate and duration occurred at 75% Spo2. As Spo2 decreased, a higher frequency of long blink durations was observed.The increase in blink rate and duration in the absence of task demand manipulation could suggest hypoxia-induced sympathetic excitation and impairment of adaptive blink inhibition behavior. The effect of hypoxia on oculomotor features is also likely task-specific. In consideration of the extensive demand made upon the visual modality in flight, increased PERCLOS may further tax visual information processing.Thropp JE, Scallon JFV, Buza P.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle atrophy is a striking example of the multiple changes in the physiological state of humans and animals induced by microgravity. Previous studies have shown that a blood circulation disorder may be a cause of this atrophy, and traditional Chinese medicine has been regarded as a potential countermeasure to reverse the atrophy in China. This study was carried out to test the effects of Xuefuzhuyu capsules (XFZY) on the skeletal muscle atrophy induced by simulated microgravity. METHODS: The mass and cross-sectional area of the soleus muscle were compared in rats treated with XFZY that were hindlimb unloaded for 30 d (XFZY-TS group), untreated rats that were hindlimb unloaded for 30 d (TS group), and control rats (CON group). The expression and phosphorylation levels of key proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum stress system were also measured. RESULTS: Treatment with XFZY attenuated the loss of muscle mass and cross-sectional area induced by hindlimb unloading. Western blot analysis showed that the phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase/phospho-Akt (PI3K/p-Akt) pathways were down-regulated after 30 d in the TS group compared with the CON group. This effect was partly reversed by XFZY. Hindlimb unloading increased the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Caspase 12. Treatment with XFZY alleviated this increased protein expression. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that XFZY could partially reverse the effects of hindlimb unloading on muscle atrophy and perhaps target the sarcoplasmic reticulum stress system, possibly through the GRP78-CHOP-JNK-Caspase 12 pathway.

    "abstract": "Commercial air travel is usually without health incidents. However, there is a view that cabin environments may be detrimental to health, especially flights of 8 h or more. Concerns have been raised about deep vein thrombosis, upper respiratory tract infections, altitude sickness, and toxins from the engines.Passenger cabin simulators were used to achieve a comparative observational study with 8-h flights at pressures equivalent to terrestrial altitudes of ground, 4000, 6000, and 8000 ft. Biomarkers of thrombosis (D-Dimer), inflammation (interleukin-6), and respiratory dysfunction (FEV1) and oxygen saturation (Spo2) were measured, as well as pulse and blood pressure. The wellbeing of the passengers was also monitored.During 36 flights, 1260 healthy subjects [626 women (F) and 634 men (M) (mean age = 43, SD = 16)] were assessed. Additionally, 72 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (F = 32, M = 40, mean age = 48, SD = 17) and 74 with heart failure (F = 50, M = 24, mean age = 54, SD = 14) contributed to 11 flights. Additionally, 76 normal controls were observed while engaged in a usual day's work (F = 38, M = 38, mean age = 39, SD = 15). There were no health-significant changes in D-Dimer, interleukin-6, or FEV1. Spo2 varied as expected, with lowest values at 8000 ft and in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. The only differences from the controls were the loss of the normal diurnal variations in interleukin-6 and D-Dimer.This very large, comparative, controlled study provides much reassurance for the traveling public, who use airline flights of up to 8 h. We did not show evidence of the development of venous thrombosis, inflammation, respiratory embarrassment, nor passenger distress.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ambulation during extravehicular activity on Mars may increase the risk of decompression sickness through enhanced bubble formation in the lower body. Hypotheses: walking effort (ambulation) before an exercise-enhanced denitrogenation (prebreathe) protocol at 14.7 psia does not increase the incidence of venous gas emboli (VGE) at 4.3 psia, but does increase incidence if performed after tissues become supersaturated with nitrogen at 4.3 psia. METHODS: VGE results from 45 control subjects who performed exercise prebreathe without ambulation before or during a 4-h exposure to 4.3 psia were compared to 21 subjects who performed the same prebreathe but ambulated before and during the hypobaric exposure (Group I) and to 41 subjects who only ambulated before the hypobaric exposure (Group II). Monitoring for VGE in the pulmonary artery was for 4 min at about 12-min intervals using precordial Doppler ultrasound (2.5 mHz). Detected VGE were assigned a categorical grade from I to IV. The detection of Grade III or IV was classified as “high VGE grade.” RESULTS: The incidence of high VGE grade for Group I (57%) was greater than the control (17%) and Group II (15%). The incidence of pain-only decompression sickness was greater for Group I (20%) than the control (0%) and Group II (5%). CONCLUSIONS: High-grade VGE are increased by mild ambulation conducted under a supersaturated state (Group I vs. II); however, no increase was observed with mild ambulation during the saturated state alone (control vs. Group II).Conkin J, Pollock NW, Natoli MJ, Martina SD, Wessell JH III, Gernhardt ML.

    "abstract": "Remote-guidance (RG) techniques aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have enabled astronauts to collect diagnostic-level ultrasound (US) images. Exploration-class missions will likely require nonformally trained sonographers to operate with greater autonomy given longer communication delays (> 6 s for missions beyond the Moon) and blackouts. Training requirements for autonomous collection of US images by non-US experts are being determined.Novice US operators were randomly assigned to one of three groups to collect standardized US images while drawing expertise from A) RG only, B) a computer training tool only, or C) both RG and a computer training tool. Images were assessed for quality and examination duration. All operators were given a 10-min standardized generic training session in US scanning. The imaging task included: 1) bone fracture assessment in a phantom and 2) Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) examination in a healthy volunteer. A human factors questionnaire was also completed.Mean time for group B during FAST was shorter (20.4 vs. 22.7 min) than time for the other groups. Image quality scoring was lower than in groups A or C, but all groups produced images of acceptable diagnostic quality.RG produces US images of higher quality than those produced with only computer-based instruction. Extended communication delays in exploration missions will eliminate the option of real-time guidance, thus requiring autonomous operation. The computer program used appears effective and could be a model for future digital US expertise banks. Terrestrially, it also provides adequate self-training and mentoring mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "An acute bout of exercise can improve cognitive function in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. However, limited research supports the improvement of cognitive function and mood state in women. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of hypoxia and exercise on working memory and mood state in women.There were 15 healthy women (age = 22 ± 2 yr) who completed the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics-4th Edition (ANAM), including the Running Memory Continuous Performance Task (RMCPT) and Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) in normoxia (21% O2), at rest in normoxia and hypoxia (12.5% O2), and during cycling exercise at 60% and 40% Vo2max in hypoxia.RMCPT was not significantly impaired at 30 (100.3 ± 17.2) and 60 (96.6 ± 17.3) min rest in hypoxia compared to baseline in normoxia (97.0 ± 17.0). However, RMCPT was significantly improved during exercise (106.7 ± 20.8) at 60% Vo2max compared to 60 min rest in hypoxia. Following 30 (-89.4 ± 48.3) and 60 min of exposure to hypoxia (-79.8 ± 55.9) at rest, TMD was impaired compared with baseline (-107.1 ± 46.2). TMD was significantly improved during exercise (-108.5 ± 42.7) at 40% Vo2max compared with 30 min rest in hypoxia. Also, RMCPT was significantly improved during exercise (104.0 ± 19.1) at 60% Vo2max compared to 60 min rest in hypoxia (96.6 ± 17.3).Hypoxia and an acute bout of exercise partially influence RMCPT and TMD. Furthermore, a moderate-intensity bout of exercise (60%) may be a more potent stimulant for improving cognitive function than low-intensity (40%) exercise.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is much debate regarding the appropriate analgesic management of patients undergoing medical evacuation following combat trauma. Our primary objective was to review the utility of regional anesthetic techniques in patients undergoing aeromedical evacuation following surgical limb amputation as treatment for combat trauma. METHODS: This study was conducted as an observational retrospective cohort whereby acutely injured amputee patients were identified via the U.S. Transportation Command’s patient movement database. The Theater Medical Data Store was cross-referenced for additional patient care data including opioid consumption, duration of regional technique, pain scores, and rates of intubation. RESULTS: Eighty-four records were retrieved from the Theater Medical Data Store. All 84 patients were victims of improvised explosive device detonation requiring limb amputation and subsequent transport from Kandahar Airfield or Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, to the United States. The majority of interventions remained in place throughout the evacuation process. A significant decrease in opioid consumption in patients receiving regional anesthesia was identified at each leg of the medical evacuation process. Pain scores were sporadically reported and not statistically different. Higher rates of intubation were identified in the nonregional anesthetic group. DISCUSSION: Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying regional anesthetic techniques for pain management to our combat wounded trauma patients throughout multiple stages of aeromedical evacuation. Benefits include the potential for less sedation and less opioid consumption while potentially foregoing the requirement for intubation during transport.Carness JM, Wilson MA, Lenart MJ, Smith DE, Dukes SF.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mild hypercapnia combined with a cephalad fluid shift [e.g., that occurring during spaceflight or laparoscopic surgery with head-down tilt (HDT)] might affect cerebral autoregulation. However, no reports have described the effects of the combination on dynamic cerebral autoregulation. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the combination of mild hypercapnia and a cephalad fluid shift would attenuate dynamic cerebral autoregulation. METHODS: There were 15 healthy male volunteers who were exposed to 4 10-min protocols in which they received air in the supine position (Placebo/Supine), 3% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the supine position (CO 2 /Supine), air with −10° HDT (Placebo/HDT) and 3% CO 2 with −10° HDT (CO 2 /HDT). Dynamic cerebral autoregulation was evaluated using a transfer function analysis of the beat-to-beat variability in mean arterial blood pressure (ABP) and mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity. RESULTS: The phase in the low-frequency range was significantly lower during CO 2 /HDT than all other protocols, where CO 2 /HDT was −25% lower than Placebo/Supine (CO 2 /HDT, 0.49 ± 0.21; Placebo/Supine, 0.65 ± 0.16 radians). The transfer function gain in the low-frequency range was significantly higher during CO 2 /HDT than all other protocols, where CO 2 /HDT was 26% higher than Placebo/Supine (CO 2 /HDT, 1.08 ± 0.34; Placebo/Supine, 0.86 ± 0.28 cm · s −1 · mmHg −1 ). However, neither the CO 2 /Supine nor Placebo/HDT showed significant differences compared with the Placebo/Supine. DISCUSSION: Even short-term exposure to 3% CO 2 plus HDT increased synchrony and the magnitude of transmission between ABP and CBF in the low-frequency range. Thus, the combination of mild hypercapnia and a cephalad fluid shift attenuated dynamic cerebral autoregulation.Kurazumi T, Ogawa Y, Yanagida R, Morisaki H, Iwasaki K.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Blindfolded subjects used a joystick to orient themselves to the direction of balance in a device programmed to exhibit inverted pendulum behavior in the roll plane; they indicated with a trigger press when they were at that location. Our goal was to determine how otolith and somatosensory information about the gravitational vertical influenced the ability to locate the direction of balance. METHODS: The subjects ( N = 12) were tested in each of three orientations of the body roll plane: vertical (Upright), 45° back (45_Degree), and 90° back (Supine), which provided progressively less salient otolith and somatosensory information about roll orientation with regard to the direction of gravity. For each pitch plane, subjects were tested with three directions of balance: 0° (aligned with the gravitational vertical in the Upright condition) and 30° right or left. RESULTS: The mean achieved and indicated orientations for the Upright and 45_Degree conditions were significantly displaced away from the direction of balance in the direction of gravity, with indicated angles less displaced. In the Supine condition, the mean achieved and indicated angles were closer to the direction of balance, but their within-trial standard deviations were significantly larger than in the Upright and 45_Degree conditions, which did not differ. This greater variability resulted from the frequent side to side “drifting” behavior that was a characteristic feature of the Supine condition only. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that in the absence of vision accurate dynamic orientation requires gravity dependent shear forces on the otolith organs and body surface.Panic AS, Panic H, DiZio P, Lackner JR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the United States, the proportion of Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) fatal accidents remained unchanged despite an overall decreasing accident rate. Previous research showed night HEMS operations influenced fatal outcomes. Pilots with &lt;6 yr of HEMS domain task experience (low-DTE) had a higher likelihood of a night operational accident in conditions associated with adverse weather. This study sought to determine whether a difference existed between day and night fatal accident rates and identify influences contributing to night fatal HEMS accidents. Any risk factors identified will be used for a risk analysis to inform future operational safety of the night visual flight rule (VFR) HEMS transport system. METHODS: Historical accident data and industry hours were obtained. Both pilot DTE groups (low and high) and mission VFR and instrument flight rule (IFR) capability were identified using data from 32 night VFR operational fatal HEMS accidents. Accidents were stratified by loss of control and controlled flight into terrain, pilot DTE, and flight rule capability. The effectiveness of both DTE groups and both flight rule capabilities were measured using system safety risk analysis techniques. RESULTS: Night fatal accident rates were statistically different from daytime. Low-DTE pilots and the VFR capability combination had the highest likelihood of night operational nonsurvivable accident. CONCLUSION: Low-DTE pilots and the VFR capability were the least effective mission combination to avoid hazardous conditions at night and maintain spatial orientation, respectively.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is the \"silent killer\" and may lead to more severe conditions if left unmanaged. Hypertension in service members of the U.S. military has the potential to negatively impact readiness. The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact to readiness of active duty Naval aviators and aircrew under the new 2017 ACC/AHA blood pressure guidelines.METHODS: This cross-sectional study used the Military Health System Data Repository for 2015. The population included all active duty Naval aviators and aircrew. The absolute number and proportion of those with hypertension were compared based on previous Joint National Committee 7 and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. Impact to readiness was calculated based on lost work days and the number of individuals with hypertension that fit the criteria to be medically grounded according to the U.S Naval Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide.RESULTS: Hypertension diagnoses will increase by 2904 individuals (599%) in the 23,492 Naval aviators and aircrew included in the population. Impact to readiness will result in an estimate of 510 lost work days.CONCLUSION: The 2017 ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines will lead to a dramatic increase in hypertension diagnoses in this population. Depending on the U.S. Navy disposition on hypertension, the impact can be minor or substantial, but the early opportunity for care made available with the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines may provide long-term benefits of a healthy fighting force worth the immediate impact to readiness.Johnson MC, Banaag AL, Condie KJ, Servies TE, Pérez Koehlmoos TL.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Of all phases of flight operations, accidents during landings are the most frequent. Of these, poor speed management during landing has ramifications for injury severity since: 1) impact forces increase as a square of forward velocity; and 2) an aerodynamic stall, associated with inadequate landing speed, imparts high vertical G forces. Herein, the proportion of landing accidents involving deficient airspeed control and occupant injury severity was determined.METHODS: General aviation landing accidents (1997-2016) were identified from the NTSB database. An accident involving high-airspeed (high-energy) was one for which the NTSB cited airplane porpoising, multiple bounces, or floating, whereas an inadequate airspeed related (low energy) mishap was one citing this term or in which an aerodynamic stall occurred. An anonymous online survey of certificated pilots was used to inform landing technique. Statistical analyses used Poisson distribution and Chi-squared tests.RESULTS: Relative to the earliest period (1997-2001), the landing accident rate was undiminished for more recent years (2007-2016). Of 235 accidents, 38% involved high-energy, whereas 4% were inadequate airspeed-related. For the former, 17% resulted in occupants with fatal-serious injuries, twofold higher than for mishaps with no evidence of mis-speed. Of 1392 survey respondents, 73% selected a landing airspeed higher than required for an under-maximum weight airplane.CONCLUSION: For landing accidents involving airspeed mismanagement, those related to excessive energy predominate and are associated with more severe injuries. Two mitigating strategies are advanced: 1) pilot training should discuss landing airspeed adjustment for aircraft weight; and 2) installation of inflatable restraints for reducing injury severity should be encouraged.Boyd DD.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) toxicity could be catastrophic for astronauts. Suppressing metabolism by lowering body temperature decreases CO 2 production and may facilitate rescue in the event of a crippled ship. Lowering body temperature requires shivering suppression. We evaluated dexmedetomidine to facilitate cooling of healthy individuals. METHODS: Following consent, we administered a 1 mcg · kg −1 bolus of dexmedetomidine followed by continuous infusion (0.5–1.4 mcg · kg −1 · h −1 ) for 3 h of cooling. We cooled subjects using a bolus of 30 cc · kg −1 of 4°C saline followed by surface cooling. We measured vital signs, thermal and comfort scales, sedation, and shivering for 3 h and during recovery. ANOVA evaluated changes in measures over time. RESULTS: Nine subjects completed the study. Mean age was 31 (SD 8) yr, mean mass was 71 (SD 14) kg, height of 168 (SD 9) cm, and body mass index of 25 (SD 3). Median time to 1°C drop in core temperature was 16 (IQR 15, 32) min. Temperature changed over time with median lowest temperature being 33.1°C (IQR 32.8°C, 34.1°C). Neither heart rate nor diastolic blood pressures changed over time. Systolic blood pressure decreased over time. Subjects responded to verbal stimuli and completed tasks throughout the protocol. During cooling and maintenance, subjects reported discomfort and the sensation of being cold. CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine facilitates shivering suppression during prolonged cooling in healthy individuals. Subjects are easily roused, have mild decreases in systolic blood pressure, and note sensations of discomfort and cold. Cooling to suppress metabolism is a feasible countermeasure to prolong astronaut endurance. Rittenberger JC, Flickinger KL, Weissman A, Repine M, Elmer J, Guyette FX, Callaway CW.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Microgravity leads to a progressive loss in muscular strength, endurance, and aerobic capacity (Vo 2peak ). Blood flow restricted (BFR) exercise has been shown to elicit rapid gains in muscular strength and Vo 2peak . Rowing exercise combined with BFR could be a supplemental countermeasure to maintain preflight muscle function and Vo 2peak , especially within future space vehicles with restricted physical volume. METHODS: There were 20 men who completed 19 min of rowing exercise during CON or BFR in a randomized order. Exercise intensity for all sets was 30% of peak work load achieved during a separate incremental maximal exercise test. Kaatsu training cuffs were inflated around each leg during BFR. Muscle oxygen saturation (Smo 2 ) and heart rate (HR) were measured throughout exercise and rest. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and muscle activation, using surface electromyography (sEMG), were measured during the last 30 s of each exercise set. Blood pressure (BP) and whole blood lactate ([La - ] b ) were measured at rest and postexercise. RESULTS: Smo 2 declined significantly in BFR during exercise and rest by 13% and 14%, respectively. HR and RPE showed significant increases during BFR (120.5 ± 5.53 vs. 128.9 ± 9.86 bts · min −1 ) (9.8 ± 1.85 vs. 11.8 ± 1.88 arbitrary units). No differences were observed for BP, [La − ] b , and sEMG. DISCUSSION: Findings indicate exercise intensity and cuff pressure elicited acute muscular, cardiovascular, and perceptual responses. BFR rowing exercise could be advantageous as an adjunct for future exercise countermeasures where aerobic and anaerobic exercise may be performed on one device or in limited physical space.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Working memory is an essential executive function for flying an aircraft and its limitations may jeopardize flight safety. This function is particularly critical when pilots have to struggle with spatial disorientation (SD) cues. This research aimed to assess the combined effect of the auditory N -back task (NBT) and simulator-induced SD cues on pilots’ flight performance. METHODS: Using an SD simulator, 39 male military pilots (control N = 20; age M = 31.6; SD = 8.22, experimental N = 19; age M = 26.9; SD = 8.67) were exposed to 12 flight sequences, where 6 contained an SD conflict—3 with vestibular illusions and 3 with visual illusions. Additionally, the pilots from the experimental group were asked to perform an auditory NBT involving sound stimuli (the sequential letter memory task) as they performed during oriented and disoriented flight conditions. RESULTS: Pilots’ flight performance from the NBT group were significantly worse than the control group in the approach and landing profiles involving visual illusions (for both nonconflict and conflict flight), and in the profile involving the false horizon illusion (only for the conflict flight). No increase in a pilot’s susceptibility to SD was observed with any other profiles. DISCUSSION: The current study provides support that pilots’ cognitive workload can negatively impact flight performance. Pilots are not always aware of altered flight parameters, which may indicate that they have lost spatial orientation, mainly as a result of visual illusion. If problems occur in maintaining proper flight parameters, pilots should direct all available mental resources to regain their orientation and withdraw from any other parallel tasks.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Changes in gravity or body position provoke changes in hydrostatic pressure in the arterial system and in venous return. Potential asymmetries between left (Q LV ) and right ventricular (Q RV ) cardiac output during transient gravity changes were investigated. It was hypothesized that blood volume is temporarily stored in the pulmonary vessels, with amount and duration depending on the level and directions of gravity. METHODS: Eight healthy, male subjects (32 ± 3 yr, 182 ± 7 cm, 82 ± 6 kg) were tested on a tilt seat (TS), in a long arm human centrifuge (laHC), and during parabolic flights (PF). The gravitational changes during PF were reconstructed by changing gravity in a laHC and different body positions on a TS. All participants were tested in the seated, resting position. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded continuously and Q LV was calculated, applying the Modelflow Algorithm. Gas exchange was measured breath-by-breath. Q RV was calculated from these data according to the Fick Principle. Four sequences were superimposed and analyzed by ANOVA with the factors Time, Ventricle (Q RV , Q LV ), and Mode (TS, PF, laHC). RESULTS: After reductions in gravity Q RV and Q LV were transiently desynchronized. ANOVA showed no main effect for Mode, but significant changes were found for Time and Ventricle and all interactions. DISCUSSION: Phases of reduced gravity seem to lead to transiently increased storage of blood volume inside the pulmonary vascular system. A more detailed understanding of these mechanisms might help to describe the compliance of the pulmonary vascular system in diseases of the pulmonary circulation.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rapid onset, noninjection methods are required to provide “as needed” therapy for motion sickness. Intranasal scopolamine (IN SCOP) is attractive because it can be fast acting and work when gastric motility is slowed. Intranasal administration can provide a time to maximal concentration (T max ) of drugs (e.g., naloxone and midazolam) of 30 min or less. We evaluated the efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of IN SCOP in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study, and compared pharmacokinetic outcomes against other published results. METHODS: There were 18 healthy adult volunteers (10 M, 8F) who received placebo, low dose (0.2 mg), and high dose (0.4 mg) IN SCOP intranasally using a pump device and a gel formulation. Participants rode in an off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) chair 1.25 h after dose administration and completed neurocognitive tests to evaluate secondary drug impacts. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) were assessed in eight subjects. PK data were compared to results from previously published studies. RESULTS: Low and high dose IN SCOP increased chair time significantly compared to placebo. No significant sleepiness or cognitive impairment was seen, likely due to the small sample size. T max was long for both dosages (High dose 75.0 ± 49.4 min, Low dose 61.9 ± 37.1 min), compared to other intranasally administered drugs and some previous studies with IN SCOP. Average T max was not superior to previously published values for dose-matched (0.4–0.5 mg), orally-delivered SCOP. DISCUSSION: IN SCOP has potential as a rapid administration route for relieving MS symptoms, but more work is needed to identify optimal intranasal formulation and dispensing methods.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The work schedules of airline crewmembers include extended workdays, compressed work periods, and limited time for recovery, which may lead to cardiovascular strain and fatigue. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in heart rate variability (HRV) during work and sleep, and with respect to work characteristics and breaks. METHODS: We followed 49 airline crewmembers during four consecutive workdays of ≥39 h. Data included HRV measurements, a questionnaire, and sleep/work diaries. HRV parameters include root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), standard deviation of the normal beat-to-beat differences (SDNN), and the low and high frequency ratio (LF/HF). RESULTS: The results indicate higher levels of cardiovascular strain on the 4th compared to the 1st workday, most prominent among cabin crewmembers. In this group, we observed indications of decreased cardiovascular strain by increasing duration of sleep, demonstrated by increased RMSSD (B = 2.7, 95% CI 1.6, 3.8) and SDNN (B = 4.4, 95% CI 3.0, 5.7), and decreased LF/HF (B = −0.2, 95% CI, −0.4,−0.01). Similarly, longer duration of breaks was associated with lower cardiovascular strain, indicated by increased RMSSD (B = 0.1, 95% CI 0.03, 0.1) and SDNN (B = 0.1, 95% CI 0.1, 0.1). Among pilots, increased LF/HF indicated higher cardiovascular strain in those who often or always reported of high workload (B = 4.3, 95% CI 2.3, 6.3; and B = 7.3, 95% CI 3.2, 11.4, respectively). DISCUSSION: The results support the contention that the studied work period increases cardiac strain among airline crew. Work characteristics, breaks, and sleep are associated with changes in HRV.

To mitigate this problem, previous research investigated pilot decision making and the effects of new technology. Limited investigations have examined usability and interpretability of observation and forecast weather products available to pilots. Therefore, this study examined the interpretability of weather observation and forecast reports that GA pilots use for preflight weather planning and the impact of pilot certification level on the interpretability of these displays. METHOD: There were 204 GA pilots (Mean age = 22.50 yr; Median flight hours = 131.0) who completed a 90-item multiple choice Aviation Weather Product Test. The questions portrayed static weather displays available on the NOAA/National Weather Service Aviation Weather Center website. The questions were designed to have high cognitive fidelity in comparison with preflight weather planning tasks. RESULTS: The results revealed overall low mean interpretability scores (Mean percent correct= 59.29%, SD = 16.01%). The scores for observation products and product attributes were lower for student pilots than experienced pilots. Forecast product scores for student and private pilots did not differ, however, student pilot scores were significantly lower than instrument rated private and commercial pilots. DISCUSSION: The low interpretability scores indicate that GA pilots misinterpret weather information provided by most weather observation and forecast products. Possible contributing factors to the low product interpretation scores include poor usability and a lack of training. Future research should measure the usability of weather displays designed for pilots. Blickensderfer BL, Guinn TA, Lanicci JM, Ortiz Y, King JM, Thomas RL, DeFilippis N.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The vestibulo-sympathetic reflex operates during orthostatically challenging movements to initiate cardiovascular responses in advance of a baroreceptor-mediated response. The objective of this study was to determine whether there was an association between changes in vestibular function and cardiovascular responses during a prone-to-stand movement in astronauts after return from long-duration spaceflight. METHODS: Thirteen crewmembers who participated in International Space Station missions were tested before spaceflight and 1 d after landing. Vestibular function was evaluated by computerized dynamic posturography while their head was erect and while they performed dynamic head tilts. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure were measured while the subjects were in prone and standing positions. RESULTS: The 21.4% increase in the astronauts’ heart rate during the prone to stand maneuver after spaceflight correlated significantly with their spaceflight-induced 48.7% decrease in postural stability during dynamic head tilts. The larger mean arterial pressure in the prone position after spaceflight compared to preflight (+7%) also correlated with the postflight decrease in postural stability during dynamic head tilts. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that an appropriate vestibular function is important to evoke optimum vestibulo-sympathetic response during orthostatically challenging voluntary movements performed after spaceflight. They also suggest that there may be a greater need to generate an anticipatory cardiovascular response after spaceflight.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The objective was to quantify the venous redistribution during a 4-d dry immersion (DI) and evaluate the effect of thigh cuffs. METHODS: The study included nine control (Co) and nine subjects wearing thigh cuffs during the daytime (CU). Ultrasound measures were performed Pre-DI, on day 4 AM (D4 AM) and D4 PM: left ventricle stroke volume and ejection fraction (SV, EF), jugular vein volume (JVvol), portal vein diameter (PV), and middle cerebral vein velocity (MCVv). An additional measure of JVvol was performed on Day 1 after 2 h in DI. RESULTS: After 2 h in DI, JVvol increased significantly from Pre in both groups, but increased more in the Co compared to the CU subjects (Co: 0.27 0.15 cm 3 to 0.94 0.22 cm 3 ; CU: 0.32 0.13 cm 3 to 0.64 0.32 cm 3 ). At D4 AM, SV and EF decreased from Pre (SV: 111 23 cm 3 to 93 24 cm 3 ; EF: 0.66 0.07 to 0.62 0.07). JVvol was slightly increased (Co: 0.47 0.22 cm 3 CU: 0.35 014 cm 3 ). MCVv and PV remained unchanged from Pre-DI. No difference was found between the two groups for any of the parameters measured. From D4 AM to PM, no significant change was observed for any parameter. CONCLUSION: The results confirm that DI induces, during the first 2-3 h, a significant cephalic fluid shift as observed in spaceflight. During this early phase, the thigh cuffs reduced the amplitude of the fluid shift toward the head, but after 4 d in DI there was only a slight memory (residual) effect of DI on the jugular volume and no residual effect of the thigh cuffs.

Despite the progress in research concerning fatigue among civil aviation and military pilots, fatigue in student pilots has remained unexamined. The aim of this study was to examine fatigue among ab-initio pilots. In this study, the fatigue model previously proposed and used in the literature is redesigned for ab-initio pilots. METHOD: A 48-item questionnaire was applied. Factor analysis was performed using SPSS. The data were collected from 114 ab-initio pilots. RESULTS: It was determined that 23% ( N 26) of the participants included in the study were women and 77% ( N 88) were men. When the license types of the participants were analyzed, it was seen that 11% ( N 13) had commercial pilot licenses (CPL; N 80), 70% had private pilot licenses (PPL), and 18% ( N 21) had student pilot licenses (SPL). Results showed that seven performance factors (types of flight, training scheduling, crew composition, environment of the aircraft, types of accommodation, flight training-related issues, and biological issues) affect ab-initio pilots fatigue on various levels. DISCUSSION: The findings may help flight training organizations and ab-initio pilots take assertive preventive measures against fatigue. Kilic B. Fatigue among student pilots .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Aerospace Medicine Systematic Review Group was set up in 2016 to facilitate high quality and transparent synthesis of primary data to enable evidence-based practice. The group identified many research methods specific to space medicine that need consideration for systematic review methods. The group has developed space medicine specific methods to address this and trialed usage of these methods across seven published systematic reviews. This paper outlines evolution of space medicine synthesis methods and discussion of their initial application. METHODS: Space medicine systematic review guidance has been developed for protocol planning, quantitative and qualitative synthesis, sourcing gray data, and assessing quality and transferability of space medicine human spaceflight simulation study environments. RESULTS: Decision algorithms for guidance and tool usage were created based on usage. Six reviews used quantitative methods in which no meta-analyses were possible due to lack of controlled trials or reporting issues. All reviews scored the quality and transferability of space simulation environments. One review was qualitative. Several research gaps were identified. CONCLUSION: Successful use of the developed methods demonstrates usability and initial validity. The current space medicine evidence base resulting in no meta-analyses being possible shows the need for standardized guidance on how to synthesize data in this field. It also provides evidence to call for increasing use of controlled trials, standardizing outcome measures, and improving minimum reporting standards. Space medicine is a unique field of medical research that requires specific systematic review methods.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the next 20 yr, international market expansion will necessitate the production of new commercial airplanes and the recruitment of additional crewmembers and technicians. Research has proven that fatigue and lack of sleep are risk factors for impaired cognitive performance and human error. Pilots frequently report fatigue to their employers, which may be related to sleep disturbance. Airline pilots, in particular, often experience circadian desynchronization and other types of sleep disorders. Shift workers have been observed to be at higher risk of fatigue that affects their performance and alertness. In Saudi Arabia, sleep disorders among airline pilots are understudied and underreported. The primary objective of this study was to screen for and determine the risk of sleep disorders, fatigue, and depression among pilots. METHODS: A cross-sectional epidemiological study with national commercial pilots was conducted from March 2019 to March 2020 using validated questionnaires to screen for the risk of sleep disorders, fatigue, and depression. RESULTS: In total, 344 pilots participated in the study. Half the sample was at risk for insomnia and fatigue. Older and more experienced pilots were less likely to suffer impaired sleep quality, insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue, and depression. In total, 59 (17.2%) pilots were at high risk for sleep apnea. CONCLUSION: The current study found that pilots were at risk of developing sleep disorders. A more robust and objective assessment is warranted for screening.

    "abstract": "The most commonly cited hypotheses for motion sickness (MS) focus on inconsistent sensory inputs. Visual/vestibular conflicts may lead to MS, but visual input from retinal regions/neural pathways that are sensitive to motion might bear more weight in MS etiology. We hypothesized that inducing blurred vision in an optokinetic drum would attenuate the influence of foveal (parvocellular) input, but not peripheral (magnocellular) input that is sensitive to motion. Increased relative influence of peripheral visual input was predicted to subsequently lead to more visual/vestibular conflict and subsequently more severe MS symptoms.Through goggles that were either clear or frosted, 15 subjects (5 men, 10 women, mean age = 24.9 yr, range = 18-49) viewed the interior of a rotating (60° · s(-1)) optokinetic drum for 10 min. Subjects completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) before and after viewing. Overall subjective sickness ratings (0-10) and visually induced self-motion perception (vection) ratings (0-10) were also recorded.Postexposure SSQ scores obtained in the blur condition (total - 52.9, oculomotor - 38.9, disorientation - 69.6) were significantly higher than those obtained in the control condition (total - 30.4, oculomotor - 21.7, disorientation - 37.8). Overall sickness ratings and vection ratings were also significantly higher in the blur condition.These results suggest that visual blur can exacerbate MS, perhaps because of differential influences of visual pathways. Although these results were obtained with an optokinetic drum, possible effects of visual blurring in motion provocative environments such aircraft, watercraft, spacecraft, and land vehicles should be considered.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Perfluorocarbon (PFC) formulations can be a useful adjunct treatment for decompression sickness (DCS) when staged decompression procedures cannot be followed due to time constraints or lack of equipment. The benefit of PFC treatment is believed to result from its ability to transport more dissolved gas than can be transported by blood alone. Dodecylfluoropentane (DDFPe) is a unique nanodroplet compound that expands into a gaseous state when exposed to physiological temperatures, resulting in a higher dissolved gas-carrying capacity than standard PFC formulations. METHODS: We investigated the efficacy of DDFPe in reducing morbidity and mortality in a rat model of severe DCS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-280 g) were compressed to 210 fsw for 60 min before rapid decompression. Animals were immediately injected with 2% DDFPe (0.07 ml · kg −1 , 0.5 ml · kg −1 , 1.0 ml · kg −1 ) or saline, and were transferred to a 100% O 2 environment for 30 min. RESULTS: Of the animals in the saline group, 47% (18/38) did not survive the decompression event, while ∼98% (46/47) of the animals in the DDFPe group did not survive. Of the animals that died during the observation period, the saline group survived on average 89% longer than DDFPe treated animals. Seizures occurred in 42% of the DDFPe group vs. 16% in the saline group. Histological analysis revealed the presence of large, multifocal gas emboli in the liver and heart of DDFPe treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that DDFPe is not an effective nonrecompressive treatment for DCS in rodents.Sheppard RL, Regis DP, Mahon RT.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Military aeromedical evacuation, especially that associated with the present Middle East conflict, is seeing increasing research. This ecological study initiates research into the validating flight surgeon by looking at cabin altitude restriction (CAR), arguably the validating flight surgeon’s prescription with the highest patient-mission impact, and its association with postflight complications. METHODS: CAR rates from January 2006 through February 2008 were determined from the U.S. Transportation Command Regulating and Command and Control Evacuation System database. Postflight complication rates—the rate of patients with postflight complications (PFC) and the postflight complications per 100 patients (PFC-100)—from January 2007 through June 2008 were calculated from the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center trauma database. CAR and complication rates were examined before, during, and after the authors’ deployment. In addition, the relationship between CAR and postflight complication rates was investigated; as the rates were nonlinear, a Spearman correlation was performed. RESULTS: CAR rates during the authors’ deployments were significantly up compared to the authors’ predecessors or successors; their predecessors and successors did not differ statistically. Likewise, the PFC rate during the authors’ deployments was significantly lower than that of the before or after time frames. Furthermore, a statistically significant inverse relationship between CAR and PFC rates (Spearman rho = −0.587) as well as CAR and PFC-100 rates (Spearman rho = −0.568) was demonstrated. DISCUSSION: CAR rate was inversely correlated to PFC and PFC-100 rates. This finding suggests that aggressive prescribing of CARs may have a salutary effect on postflight complication rates and bears further investigation.Butler WP, Steinkraus LW, Burlingame EE, Fouts BL, Serres JL.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motion sickness can influence energy homeostasis by enhancing thermolysis. This study tested the hypothesis that resting energy expenditure (REE), as the major component of thermogenesis, might also play a role during motion sickness. METHODS: The effect of seasickness on REE at sea was examined in 71 healthy Chinese male volunteers. Change in REE, heart rate variability (HRV), blood ghrelin levels, and leptin levels were observed across baseline, voyage, and recovery stages. Seasickness severity was assessed using the Graybiel motion sickness questionnaire (GMSQ), and the nausea syndrome rating (NSR) of each participant was also evaluated. REE was examined by indirect calorimetry. HRV was derived from the electrocardiogram to analyze cardiac sympathovagal activity. Blood ghrelin and leptin levels were tested by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: In subjects with severe seasickness during the voyage, the GMSQ and NSR scores were higher than in subjects with slight and moderate seasickness. The REE declined significantly compared to baseline and recovery levels and was lower than in subjects with slight and moderate seasickness. Cardiac sympathetic activity was significantly decreased, while vagal activity was increased. Plasma ghrelin levels were also significantly increased and were negatively correlated with the measured REE levels and positively correlated with NSR as well as change of HRV LF/HF ratio from baseline. DISCUSSION: Severe motion sickness induces REE suppression, which may be attributed to dramatic alteration of sympathovagal activity and plasma ghrelin levels in humans.Wang J-Q, Qi R-R, Pan L-L, Zhou W, Zhang L-L, Cai Y-L.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biological specimens from pilots fatally injured in civil aviation accidents are analyzed for ethanol and drugs at the Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI). Prevalence of these substances in the pilots has been evaluated at 5-yr intervals since 1989. In continuation, a fifth 5-yr study (2009–2013) was conducted. METHODS: The CAMI toxicology/medical certification and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident databases were searched. RESULTS: During 2009–2013, samples from 1169 pilots were analyzed. Aircraft involved in the accidents were primarily operating under general aviation. Most airmen were private pilots and held third-class medical certificates. In relation to the first 5-yr (1989–1993) period, the pilot fatality cases decreased by 37% and the presence of ethanol and/or drugs in the pilots increased by 239% in the fifth 5-yr period. The ethanol usage was unchanged, but increases were 267% and 583% with illicit and prescription drugs, respectively. The use of ethanol and/or drugs by aviators, along with underlying medical conditions, was determined by the NTSB to be cause/factors in 5% of the accidents. CONCLUSION: The observed decrease in the fatality cases does not necessarily suggest the decrease in aviation accidents, as active airmen numbers also declined. The increase in the drug positive cases is primarily attributed to the continuous rise in the use of prescription drugs. Although prevalence of ethanol and drugs has been evaluated in fatally injured aviators, such evaluation has not been performed in active pilots not involved in accidents. This type of comparative study would be crucial in assessing aviation safety.Chaturvedi AK, Craft KJ, Hickerson JS, Rogers PB, Canfield DV .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with respiratory disease are at risk of excessive hypoxemia in the hypobaric commercial aircraft cabin environment, and the consensus is that this is easily corrected with supplementary oxygen. However, despite the risks of hypercapnia with increasing inspired oxygen in some patients being well established, this issue is not currently addressed in medical guidelines for air travel. CASE REPORT: A 76-yr-old woman with chronic type 2 respiratory failure underwent hypoxic challenge testing (HCT) to assess in-flight oxygen requirements. She is stable on home ventilation, and baseline arterial blood gases showed mild hypoxemia (P a o 2 9.12 kPa), normal P a co 2 (5.64 kPa) and pH (7.36) with 98% S p O 2 . HCT was performed delivering 15% F I o 2 via a mask, and the patient desaturated to &lt; 85%. HCT blood gases revealed significant hypoxemia (P a o 2 &lt; 6.6 kPa), indicating in-flight oxygen. Continuous oxygen at 2 L · min −1 via nasal cannula corrected the hypoxia, although P a co 2 increased to 6.9 kPa with reduction in pH to the threshold of severe respiratory acidosis (pH 7.25). The patient was advised against flying due to hypoxemia during HCT and the precipitous drop in pH on oxygen. DISCUSSION: It is possible to hyperoxygenate patients with type 2 respiratory failure in flight with the minimum level of supplementary oxygen available on many aircraft. In these cases P a co 2 and pH should be scrutinized during HCT before recommending in-flight oxygen. No current guidelines discuss the risk of hypercapnia from in-flight oxygen; it is therefore recommended that this be addressed in future revisions of medical air travel guidelines, should further research indicate it.Spurling KJ, Moonsie IK, Perks JL.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study examined the effects of long-term bed rest with or without a concurrent resistance exercise protocol on different muscle function indices of the knee extensors and their influence on previously shown atrophy, neural impairment, and slow-to-fast phenotype shift. METHODS: Nine men underwent 90 d of bed rest only (BR), while eight men in addition performed maximal supine squats every third day (BRE). Before and at day 1 and 5 following bed rest, surface quadriceps electromyographic (EMG) activity was measured during a sustained (60-s) submaximal isometric action and rate of force development (RFD) was assessed during a maximal isometric action, both in the supine squat position. Maximal torque was measured during isokinetic knee extensions at different angular velocities before and after (day 2 and 11) bed rest. RESULTS: EMG amplitude at a fixed submaximal load increased in BR, but not in BRE. The increase in amplitude during the sustained action was elevated in BR but not in BRE. RFD decreased in BR; this effect was attenuated day 1 and normalized day 5 in BRE. RFD expressed relative to maximal force was maintained in both groups. Angle-specific torque decreased equally for all velocities in BR. The decrease in isokinetic strength was attenuated day 2 in BRE. DISCUSSION: Phenotype changes were not reflected in muscle function measurements, probably because they were overridden by the effects of atrophy and neural adaptation. The protective effect of resistance exercise was more pronounced in tasks similar to the training action, inferring great impact of neural mechanisms.Alkner BA, Norrbrand L, Tesch PA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Following a transition from microgravity to a gravity-rich environment (e.g., Earth, Moon, or Mars), astronauts experience sensorimotor impairment, primarily from a reinterpretation of vestibular cues, which can impact their ability to perform mission-critical tasks. To enable future exploration-class missions, the development of lightweight, space-conscious assessments for astronauts transitioning between gravity environments without expert assistance is needed. METHODS: We examined differences in performance during a two-dimensional (2D) hand–eye multidirectional tapping task, implemented in augmented reality in subjects ( N = 20) with and without the presence of a vestibular-dominated sensorimotor impairment paradigm: the binaural bipolar application of a pseudorandom galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) signal. Metrics associated with both the impairment paradigm and task performance were assessed. RESULTS: Medial-lateral sway during balance on an anterior-posterior sway-referenced platform with eyes closed was most affected by GVS (effect size: 1.2), in addition to anterior-posterior sway (effect size: 0.63) and the vestibular index (effect size: 0.65). During the augmented reality task, an increase in time to completion (effect size: 0.63), number of misses (effect size: 0.52), and head linear accelerations (effect size: 0.30) were found in the presence of the selected GVS waveform. DISCUSSION: Findings indicate that this multidirectional tapping task may detect emergent vestibular-dominated impairment (near landing day performance) in astronauts. Decrements in speed and accuracy indicate this impairment may hinder crews’ ability to acquire known target locations while in a static standing posture. The ability to track these decrements can support mission operations decisions. Allred AR, Weiss H, Clark TK, Stirling L.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Musculoskeletal injuries are one of the more common injuries in spaceflight. Physical assessment of an injury is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, when musculoskeletal injuries occur in space, the flight surgeon is limited to two-dimensional videoconferencing and, potentially, observations made by the crew medical officer. To address these limitations, we investigated the feasibility of performing physical examinations on a three-dimensional augmented reality projection using a mixed-reality headset, specifically evaluating a standard shoulder examination. METHODS: A simulated patient interaction was set up between Western University in London, Ontario, Canada, and Huntsville, AL, United States. The exam was performed by a medical student, and a healthy adult man volunteered to enable the physical exam. RESULTS: All parts of the standard shoulder physical examination according to the Bates Guide to the Physical Exam were performed with holoportation. Adaptation was required for the palpation and some special tests. DISCUSSION: All parts of the physical exam were able to be completed. The true to anatomical size of the holograms permitted improved inspection of the anatomy compared to traditional videoconferencing. Palpation was completed by instructing the patient to palpate themselves and comment on relevant findings asked by the examiner. Range of motion and special tests for specific pathologies were also able to be completed with some modifications due to the examiner not being present to provide resistance. Future work should aim to improve the graphics, physician communication, and haptic feedback during holoportation. Levschuk A, Whittal J, Trejos AL, Sirek A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are a major public health issue, the prevention of which plays a key role in promoting flight safety. However, few studies have looked at the determinants of the overall risk of CV morbidity-mortality within the various aeronautical occupations. METHODS: A monocentric, observational, cross-sectional study was based on the retrospective data collected during 6 mo at the Toulon Aeromedical Center. From October 2017 to April 2018, 2792 professional aircrew ages 18–74 were included. The overall CV risk was estimated using the European Society of Cardiology SCORE and the Framingham model, as well as a summation model. RESULTS: More than two-thirds of this mainly male population (86.2%) had no more than one CV risk factor [69.9% (68.2–71.6)]. In 82.5% of cases, this was dyslipidemia according to current European criteria [55.8% (52.4–59.1)] or smoking [26.7% (23.8-29.8)]. An overall risk level of “moderate” to “very high” concerned only one subject in five according to the SCORE model [20.1% (18.6-21.6)], one in six according to Framingham [16.3% (14.9-17.7)] and almost one in three according to the summation model [30.1% (28.4-31.9)]. DISCUSSION: Multivariate analyses found no significant associations between socio-professional criteria and overall risk levels. The results have underlined the effect of dyslipidemia and smoking on early risk among applicants. Beyond the illustration of favorable cardiovascular status among aircrews related to the standards of selection and close monitoring process, areas for improvement were identified, inviting the development of prevention strategies around the “moderate” overall CV risk.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Modular organization in brain regions often performs specific biological functions and is largely based on anatomically and/or functionally related brain areas. The current study aimed to explore changes in whole-brain modular organization affected by flight training. METHODS: The study included 25 male flight cadets and 24 male controls. The first assessment was performed in 2019, when the subjects were university freshmen. The second assessment was completed in 2022. High spatial resolution structural imaging (T1) and resting-state functional MRI data were collected. Then, 90 cerebral regions were organized into 6 brain modules. The intensity of intra- and intermodular communication was calculated. RESULTS: Mixed-effect regression model analysis identified significantly increased interconnections between the parietal and occipital modules in the cadet group, but significantly decreased interconnections in the control group. This change was largely attributed to flight training. DISCUSSION: Pilots need to control the aircraft (e.g., attitude, heading, etc.) using the stick and pedal in response to the current state of the aircraft displayed by the instrument panel; as such, flying requires a large amount of hand–eye coordination. Day-to-day flight training appeared to intensify the connection between the parietal and occipital modules among cadets. Chen X, Jiang H, Meng Y, Xu Z, Luo C.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Decompression sickness (DCS) is a medical condition caused by outgassing of dissolved nitrogen following rapid ascent by divers and aviators. Cutaneous DCS, historically termed cutis marmorata (CM), presents as a predominantly truncal reticular violaceous-to-dusky eruption. The prevailing theories for its pathogenesis include: localized cutaneous outgassing, paradoxical embolism across a right-to-left shunt (RLS), and brainstem emboli disrupting autonomic control of cutaneous microcirculation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of reports of cutaneous DCS to investigate relationships among CM, RLS, and neurological sequelae to better elucidate the mechanism of CM. A literature search examining reports of cutaneous DCS yielded 31 eligible studies, comprising a pooled total of 128 patients. RESULTS: Of the patients with documented workup, 84% showed evidence of RLS with CM. Subsequently 18 patients underwent percutaneous closure of intracardiac RLS with no recurrence of DCS. Of the patients with documented neurological evaluations, 57% experienced both CM and neurological DCS manifestations. The coexistence of RLS and neurological symptoms with CM was noted in numerous cases; exact percentages of overlap cannot be stated due to data unavailability. DISCUSSION: Our results indicating the striking coexistence of RLS and neurological sequelae in CM patients is supportive of the paradoxical embolism theory of pathogenesis. The frequent coincidence of CM with RLS and neurological symptoms raises concern that CM may signify vulnerability to devastating systemic gas emboli. CM has historically been considered trivial and self-limiting; however, our results support reappraisal of its clinical significance and potential reclassification to the more severe subtype.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Accessible spaceflight may seem a distant concept. As part of a diverse European Space Agency funded Topical Team, we are working on the physiological feasibility of space missions being undertaken by people with physical disabilities. Here, the first activity of this team is presented in the form of key lessons learned from aviation to inform new work on space missions. DISCUSSION: The first lesson is agreeing on realistic expectations about impairments, their severity, and the possibility of flying independently. This is important in terms of astronaut recruitment and societal expectations. The second lesson relates to training and adjustments for people with disabilities. Flexibility is important while maintaining safety for everyone involved. The third lesson is about managing unconscious bias from the different stakeholders. We conclude by arguing that engagement with people from different backgrounds is essential for the success of the first space mission with people with physical disabilities.

It remains unclear how this cooling method affects physiological strain during work while wearing protective garments. This study investigated the effect of ice slurry ingestion on physiological strain during work in hot conditions while wearing firefighter protective clothing.In three counterbalanced trials, eight men (mean ± SD; age = 21 ± 2 yr, height = 179.5 ± 3.5 cm, mass = 79.1 ± 4.1 kg, body fat = 11.4 ± 3.7%) wore firefighter protective clothing and walked (4 km · h-1, 12% incline, ∼7 METs) for 30 min in hot conditions (35°C, 40% RH). Every 2.5 min, subjects ingested 1.25 g · kg-1 (relative total: 15 g · kg-1, absolute total: 1186.7 ± 61.3 g) of a tepid (22.4 ± 1.7°C), cold (7.1 ± 1.5°C), or ice slurry (-1.3 ± 0.2°C) beverage.Heart rates (HR) were lower with ice slurry ingestion compared to both fluid trials starting 5 min into exercise (tepid = 158 ± 14, cold = 157 ± 11, ice slurry = 146 ± 13 bpm) and persisting for the remainder of the bout (min 30: tepid = 196 ± 10, cold = 192 ± 10, ice slurry = 181 ± 13 bpm).

CPT hyper-responders have unique traits, including risk of hypertension and a greater vasoconstrictor reserve and g force tolerance compared to hypo-responders. The purpose of this study was to uncover differences in cardiovascular and sympathetic biomarkers between responder types.Healthy volunteers (N = 30) submerged one hand into cold water (3.3 ± 0.8°C) for 5 min. Blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, and cardiac parameters were recorded using an automated monitor, impedance cardiography, and a beat-to-beat monitoring system. We analyzed for salivary α-amylase (SαA), which is a convenient biomarker of the sympathetic nervous system. Subjects were stratified post hoc into hyper-responders (≥ 22 mmHg) and hypo-responders (< 22 mmHg) based on change in systolic blood pressure during CPT.Hyper-responders had a significantly lower baseline heart rate (64 ± 7 bpm), cardiac output (5.6 ± 0.9 L · min-1), and SαA (60 ± 37 U · mL-1) compared to hypo-responders (73 ± 9 bpm, 6.9 ± 1.3 L · min-1, 165 ± 122 U · mL-1). During the cold immersion, hyper-responders had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (150 ± 14 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (91 ± 10 mmHg), mean arterial pressure (129 ± 17 mmHg), and systemic vascular resistance (1780 ± 640 dyn · s-1 · cm-5) than hypo-responders (130 ± 14 mmHg, 81 ± 10 mmHg, 110 ± 9 mmHg, 1290 ± 220 dyn · s-1 · cm-5). The change in systolic blood pressure correlated with baseline SαA (r = -0.455, P = 0.011) and baseline heart rate (r = -0.374, P = 0.042).Baseline characteristics influenced by sympathetic tone such as SαA, heart rate, and cardiac output are indicative of responses to CPT.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We examined whether long-haul airline pilots without recurrent on-duty sleepiness obtain more prior sleep and use more effective in-flight alertness management strategies than their colleagues with recurrent on-duty sleepiness. METHODS: There were 51 pilots who flew at least twice from Helsinki to Asia. Of them, 44 flew at least twice back to Helsinki following 1 local night. On-duty sleepiness was measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), alertness management strategies by a diary, and sleep by a diary and activity monitor. Pilots who rated KSS ≥ 7 on each, some, or none of the flights were classified as ”regularly”, “sometimes”, and “never” sleepy, respectively. This classification was performed separately for the outbound and inbound flights. RESULTS: On the outbound flights, 22% of the pilots were “never”, 54% “sometimes”, and 24% “regularly” sleepy. For the inbound flights, the respective distribution was 25%, 48%, and 27%. Compared to the “regularly” sleepy group, the “never” sleepy group obtained 54 min more night sleep prior to the outbound flights. For the inbound flights, the respective difference was 1 h 23 min. Also, the “never” sleepy pilots slept 31 min more between days off than the ”regularly” sleepy pilots. The results of the in-flight alertness management strategies were mixed. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that pilots without recurrent on-duty sleepiness obtain more sleep than their colleagues with recurrent on-duty sleepiness. The result emphasizes the need to investigate whether the sleep of recurrently sleepy pilots can be increased and whether this increase would reduce their on-duty sleepiness.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is a common cause of optic neuropathy with the exact pathophysiology unknown. Risk factors include advanced age, small optic nerve head, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea. 6 High altitude is considered another risk factor, although only few cases have been reported. No cases of NAION have been reported to occur during flight. CASE REPORT: A 41-yr-old male pilot presented with vision change while performing high G-force maneuvers in an A10 fighter jet. He developed a paracentral visual field defect superiorly in the left eye. Contrasted MRI was within normal limits. The left optic nerve showed blurred margins while the right was sharp, but cupless. The left eye had similar episodes 16 mo before and 8 mo after, but not during flight. DISCUSSION: Our case may be the first reported NAION during flight in an airplane pilot. Our patient was an active U.S. Air Force pilot whose second episode of NAION occurred while performing maneuvers in a fighter jet. The patient is younger than expected for NAION and he did not have any of the commonly associated risk factors. His nonflight episodes suggest he was predisposed to NAION. G-force maneuvers, which restrict blood flow and force blood to the extremities away from the optic nerve head, were the precipitant of his second NAION. With a single case, whether high G maneuvers in general are a risk factor for NAION is unknown. Distefano AG, Lam BL. Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in pilots .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microgravity induces redistribution of body fluids and reductions in muscle and bone mass. These effects correlate with changes in lab test results, including urea and bone minerals. Difficulties with collecting blood and urine during space missions limit the available data. This pilot study investigated metabolic changes during a space mission using untimed spot samples of urine and saliva. Untimed spot urine was used for urinalysis with data normalization per creatinine concentration. Saliva was proven useful as an index of serum urea and phosphorus. METHODS: Two astronauts collected urine and saliva samples 75 ± 5 d before launch (baseline) and 3–5 times during a 6-mo space mission. Samples were collected 3 h after morning breakfast. Urine was collected using a standard NASA device. Saliva was collected using a Salivette™ synthetic swab. Samples were kept frozen using automated biochemistry until lab work-up. Anthropometric data were collected at baseline and after the mission. RESULTS: For astronauts 1 and 2, respectively, total bone mineral density decreased (−1.4% and −0.9%). In-flight changes were as follows: transiently decreased urine urea/creatinine ratio (−32% and −24%), transiently decreased urine phosphorus/creatinine ratio (−52% and −30%), increased urine calcium/creatinine ratio (up to +116% and +27%), and transient increases in saliva urea (up to +48% and +195%) and phosphorus (up to +29% and +46%). The astronaut with greater changes in urine minerals had greater reduction in bone mineral density. DISCUSSION: The results support the hypothesis that untimed samples of urine and saliva are useful for investigation of metabolic changes during space missions.

Social support from within the workplace may mitigate behavioral health concerns arising during the preflight period and enhance resiliency before and during extended missions. The purpose of this review was to evaluate evidence addressing the viability of workplace social support as a pre-mission countermeasure, specifically addressing: 1) the observed relationships between workplace social support and behavioral health; 2) perceived need, acceptability, and format preference for workplace social support among high-achievers; 3) potential barriers to delivery/receipt of workplace social support; 4) workplace social support interventions; and 5) delivery timeframe and anticipated duration of workplace social support countermeasure benefits. METHODS: We conducted an evidence review examining workplace social support in professional contexts sharing one or more characteristics with astronauts and spaceflight. Terms included populations of interest, social support constructs, and behavioral health outcomes. Abstracts of matches were subsequently reviewed for relevance and quality. RESULTS: Research findings demonstrate clear associations between workplace social support and behavioral health, especially following exposure to stress. Further, studies indicate strong need for support and acceptability of support countermeasures, despite barriers. Our review revealed two general formats for providing support (i.e., direct provision of support and training to optimize skills in provision and receipt of support) with potential differentiation of expected duration of benefits, according to format.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We evaluated ophthalmic changes in healthy individuals who underwent integrated resistance and aerobic training (iRAT) during 70-d 6° head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest (BR). METHODS: Participants were selected using NASA standard screening procedures. Standardized NASA BR conditions were implemented. Subjects were randomly assigned to the iRAT protocol or no exercise during HDTBR. Weekly ophthalmic examinations were performed in the sitting (pre/post-BR only) and HDT (BR only) positions. Mixed-effects linear models compared pre- and post-HDTBR intraocular pressure (IOP), Spectralis OCT circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) thickness, and peripapillary retinal thickness observations between groups. RESULTS: Six controls and nine exercisers completed the study. There was an overall effect of BR on our outcomes. Except Goldmann IOP (mean pre/post difference in controls and exercisers: −0.47 mmHg vs. +1.14 mmHg), the magnitude of changes from baseline was not significantly different between groups. There was a +1.38 mmHg and a +1.63 mmHg iCare IOP increase during BR in controls and exercisers, respectively. Spectralis OCT detected a +1.33 μm average cpRNFL thickness increase in both groups, and a +9.77 μm and a +6.65 μm peripapillary retinal thickening post-BR in controls and exercisers, respectively. Modified Amsler grid, red dot test, confrontational visual field, color vision, and stereoscopic fundus photography were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: HDTBR for 70 d induced peripapillary retinal thickening and cpRNFL thickening without visible signs of optic disc edema. The magnitude of such changes was not different between controls and exercisers. A slight IOP increase during BR subsided post-BR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Numerous authors have identified the stressors likely to be encountered on long duration space exploration missions (e.g., to Mars), including the possibility of significant crises, separation from family, boredom/monotony, and interpersonal conflict. Although many authors have noted that meaningful work may be beneficial for astronauts on these missions, none have detailed the sources of meaningful work for astronauts and how these sources may differ between astronauts. The present article identifies how engagement in meaningful work during long duration missions may mitigate the adverse effects of demands and increase the potential for benefits resulting from the missions. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with nine NASA personnel, including astronauts, flight directors, and flight surgeons. Questions addressed sources of meaning for astronauts, characteristics of tasks that enhance vs. detract from meaning, and recommendations for enhancing meaning. RESULTS: Personnel mentioned contributing to humanity and the next generation, contributing to the mission, and exploration as the most meaningful aspects of their work. Characteristics of tasks that enhanced meaning included using a variety of skills, feeling personal control over their schedule, autonomy in the execution of tasks, and understanding the importance of the experiments conducted on the mission. Top recommendations to sustain meaning were insuring social needs were met through such activities as the strategic use of social media, giving astronauts autonomy as well as structure, and conducting training during transit. DISCUSSION: Implications are addressed for tailoring meaning-based interventions for astronauts participating on long duration missions and assessing the effectiveness of these interventions.Britt TW, Sytine A, Brady A, Wilkes R, Pittman R, Jennings K, Goguen K.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astronauts’ orientation preferences tend to correlate with their susceptibility to space motion sickness (SMS). Orientation preferences appear universally, since variable sensory cue priorities are used between individuals. However, SMS susceptibility changes after proper training, while orientation preferences seem to be intrinsic proclivities. The present study was conducted to investigate whether orientation preferences change if susceptibility is reduced after repeated exposure to a virtual reality (VR) stimulus environment that induces SMS. METHODS: A horizontal supine posture was chosen to create a sensory context similar to weightlessness, and two VR devices were used to produce a highly immersive virtual scene. Subjects were randomly allocated to an experimental group (trained through exposure to a provocative rotating virtual scene) and a control group (untrained). All subjects’ orientation preferences were measured twice with the same interval, but the experimental group was trained three times during the interval, while the control group was not. RESULTS: Trained subjects were less susceptible to SMS, with symptom scores reduced by 40%. Compared with untrained subjects, trained subjects’ orientation preferences were significantly different between pre- and posttraining assessments. Trained subjects depended less on visual cues, whereas few subjects demonstrated the opposite tendency. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that visual information may be inefficient and unreliable for body orientation and stabilization in a rotating visual scene, while reprioritizing preferences for different sensory cues was dynamic and asymmetric between individuals. The present findings should facilitate customization of efficient and proper training for astronauts with different sensory prioritization preferences and dynamic characteristics.Chen W, Chao J-G, Zhang Y, Wang J-K, Chen X-W, Tan C.

Although thunderstorms are hazardous to light aircraft, little research has been undertaken on in-flight pilot decision-making regarding their avoidance. The study objectives were: 1) to determine if the thunderstorm accident rate has declined over the last two decades; and 2) assess in-flight (enroute/landing) airman decision-making regarding adherence to FAA separation minima from thunderstorms.Thunderstorm-related accidents were identified from the NTSB database. To determine en route/arriving aircraft real-time thunderstorm proximity/relative position and airplane location, using a flight-tracking (Flight Aware®) website, were overlaid on a graphical weather image. Statistics employed Poisson and Chi-squared analyses.The thunderstorm-related accident rate was undiminished over the 1996-2014 period. In a prospective analysis the majority (enroute 77%, landing 93%) of flights violated the FAA-recommended separation distance from extreme convection. Of these, 79 and 69% (en route and landing, respectively) selected a route downwind of the thunderstorm rather than a less hazardous upwind flight path. Using a mathematical product of binary (separation distance, relative aircraft-thunderstorm position) and nominal (thunderstorm-free egress area) parameters, airmen were more likely to operate in the thunderstorm hazard zone for landings than en route operations.The thunderstorm-related accident rate, carrying a 70% fatality rate, remains unabated, largely reflecting nonadherence to the FAA-recommended separation minima and selection of a more hazardous route (downwind) for circumnavigation of extreme convective weather. These findings argue for additional emphasis in ab initio pilot training/recurrency on thunderstorm hazards and safe practices (separation distance and flight path).Boyd DD.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Experience with commercial heliox diving at high altitude is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute high-altitude exposure on fitness to dive and the safety of decompression after heliox diving while using U.S. Navy heliox decompression tables with Cross correction. METHOD: Four professional male divers were consecutively decompressed in a hypo- and hyperbaric chamber to altitudes of 3000 m (9842.5 ft), 4000 m (13,123.4 ft), and 5200 m (17,060.4 ft) during the 8-d study. The dive profiles tested were to 30 m (98.4 ft) for 60 min at all three altitudes and, in addition, a dive to 50 m (164 ft) for 60 min at 5200 m altitude. The decompression followed the U.S. Navy heliox decompression table. The safety of decompression was evaluated by precordial Doppler venous gas emboli (VGE) monitoring during the decompression stages and postdive monitoring of the divers for symptoms of decompression sickness (DCS). Effects of altitude exposure were measured as subjective rating and EEG signs of sleepiness and fatigue, clinical symptoms of high altitude disease, and fitness to dive. RESULTS: A total of 24 person-dives were conducted. There were no VGE detected during the decompression and no postdive symptoms of decompression illness. Both the EEG findings and subjective evaluation indicated increased sleepiness and fatigue at 3000 m, 4000 m, and 5200 m, all compared with the sea level baseline. During the diving phase, both the EEG findings and subjective evaluation scores returned to the baseline and the divers successfully completed diving. DISCUSSION: Diving at high altitude with a short acclimatization period appears safe despite divers exhibiting clinical symptoms and EEG signs of impairment by hypoxia at high altitude. Despite a small number of dives, the results of this study indicate that our application of U.S. Navy standard heliox decompression tables with Cross correction is effective and could be used for underwater constructions up to 5200 m altitude, with due caution.Shi L, Zhang Y, Tetsuo K, Shi Z, Fang Y, Denoble PJ, Li Y.

    "abstract": "We compared microvascular and macrovascular blood flows of the tibia and anterior tibial artery during graded whole-body tilt. We hypothesized equal responses for bone microvascular and macrovascular blood flows during varying angles of tilt.There were 18 volunteers who were randomly positioned in the following postures: supine, 15° head-up tilt, 6° head-up tilt, 6° head-down tilt, and 15° head-down tilt using an inversion table with reference to seated posture (baseline control). Ultrasonography quantified anterior tibial arterial diameter and peak systolic velocity, enabling calculation of macrovascular blood flow to the tibia. Tibial bone microvascular blood flow was measured noninvasively using photoplethysmography in the same leg.Transitioning from a seated position to a supine position, macrovascular blood flow did not change significantly (1.81 ± 1.18 to 2.80 ± 1.74cm 3 · s-1). However, bone microvascular flow increased significantly (0.36 ± 0.23 to 1.11 ± 0.79 V) from the seated to the supine position. Transitioning from a seated posture to 15° head-down tilt, both arterial macrovascular and bone microvascular flows increased significantly (1.81 ± 1.18 to 3.32 ± 2.08 cm3 · s-1 and 0.36 ± 0.23 V to 2.99 ± 2.71 V, respectively). The normalized flow for microvascular blood flow as a function of body tilt was significantly greater than that for macrovascular blood flow at 6° and 15° head-down tilt.These data do not support our hypothesis that bone microvascular flow and arterial macrovascular flow share equal responses to altered body tilt. Therefore, for a given decrease in local blood pressure in the leg with head-down body tilt, the magnitude of increase in blood flow is greater in the microcirculation as compared to the feeding artery.Becker RL, Siamwala JH, Macias BR, Hargens AR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common injury among active duty service members resulting in missed duty hours and limited duty status. Little is known about the current burden of disease and risk factors for LDH among military rotary wing aviators. METHODS: A query was made using the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED), including patient encounters for the U.S. Military from 2006–2015 using the ICD-9 code for LDH. Incidence rates were calculated for patients with the occupation of helicopter pilot and stratified by age, gender, and branch of service, then compared to matched controls using a Poisson regression analysis. Then, data from a 17-yr period were examined for long term trends. RESULTS: We identified 1218 cases of LDH among 141,383 person-years among helicopter pilots, yielding a 1.22-fold higher incidence rate compared to controls. Significant risk factors identified after Poisson regression analysis were age greater than 30 yr old and Army service branch affiliation. Male gender was not found to be a significant risk factor. Long term data revealed a 2.6-fold increased incidence of LDH among helicopter pilots since 1997. DISCUSSION: We identified significant increased risk of LDH in rotary wing pilots as compared to their nonpilot peers. Among rotary wing pilots, the incidence of this condition has increased, with both increasing pilot age and Army branch affiliation identified as risk factors. This information will allow targeted prevention strategies and further investigation to potential aircraft-specific causes of increased risk in Army pilots. Knox JB, Deal JB Jr, Knox JA.

METHODS: During dry immersion, which lasted for 5 d, nine subjects (healthy men, 20 to 29 yr of age) were individually placed in a tub (2.2 × 1.1 × 0.85 m) filled with water (temperature was kept constant at about 33°C). Subject floated in the tub without bodily support in the supine horizontal position, but isolated from the water by waterproof material. Resting state EEGs were registered at the fourth or fifth day of dry immersion. Under the control conditions, resting state EEGs were registered while subjects laid in a supine position on a couch. RESULTS: Compared to the control condition, EEG power in the alpha range (8–13 Hz) was greater in dry immersion; this effect was distributed across the whole scalp. No effects of dry immersion were found for the beta, delta, or theta frequency bands. CONCLUSION: The results of the study, similar to those obtained in a real spaceflight, indicate that support withdrawal is an important contributor to brain activity alterations in weightlessness.

    "abstract": "Reading a map requires the ability to judge one's position in a large-scale space from information presented in a small-scale representation. Individuals are more accurate and faster in making judgments when the \"up\" direction on the map is the same as the \"forward\" direction of the environment, which is when a map is aligned with the perspective of the spatial layout they have learned (alignment effect). The aim of this study was to explore whether military pilots, who have high spatial abilities, would not show the alignment effect compared with nonpilots.Recruited were 20 military pilots and 20 nonpilots. Mean flight hours were 418.75. Nonpilots without flight experience were matched for age and education with pilots. Subjects were asked to learn a map and to perform directional judgments to verify whether the alignment effect was present considering absolute angular errors.An ANOVA for mixed designs on absolute angular errors revealed a main \"group\" effect: pilots performed better than nonpilots (pilots: M = 22.60 ± 5.57; nonpilots: M = 82.59 ± 5.56). A main \"directional judgments\" effect was also observed: aligned judgements were easier than contra-aligned judgements (aligned, M = 9.277 ± 0.938; contra-aligned, M = 11.004 ± 0.805). ANOVA showed a significant \"group × directional judgments\" interaction: post hoc comparison showed that contra-aligned were more difficult than aligned judgments for nonpilots.High visuo-spatial abilities preserved pilots from having alignment effect bias. They performed directional judgments equally well, being less influenced by the increased cognitive effort requested by the changing perspective.Verde P, Angelino G, Piccolo F, Carrozzo P, Bottiglieri A, Lugli L, Piccardi L, Nori R.

So it is of profound significance to address how emotional factors affect flight training performance. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and simulated flight performance (SFP), and explore the mechanism of emotional state as a mediator in the effect of EI on SFP.METHODS: Ninety undergraduates took part in the study. EI (Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale), neuroticism (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised), anxiety (State Anxiety Inventory), and tension (Profile of Mood States) were collected. Conducted were 9 h of simulated flight training in a simulator of the Type 6 Primary Trainer. The Delphi Experts Grading Method was used to assess students' SFP. Mediation effect of emotional state was explored using regression analysis.RESULTS: EI was significantly correlated with neuroticism (r = -0.31), tension (r = -0.31), and anxiety (r = -0.31), respectively. Multiple mediation effects showed that emotional state mediated the association between EI and SFP. Tension especially mediated the associations between the Self Emotion Appraisals and Regulation of Emotion dimensions of EI and SFP. However, the Use of Emotion dimension of EI had a direct negative effect on SFP without the mediating role of emotional state.DISCUSSION: The findings indicated that EI was significantly correlated with emotional state (neuroticism, tension, and anxiety). EI may directly or indirectly affect SFP and tension played an important mediating role. Implications for the promotion of EI and emotional state to enhance performance in real flight training are discussed.Dai J, Wang H, Yang L, Wen Z.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A flight is composed of many flight performance aspects. However, not all of these aspects are equally important for the success and safety of a flight. When investigating the influence of a stressor on flight performance, it is important to understand not only which flight performance aspects are important for the success and the safety of the flight, but also which of these aspects will most likely be affected by reduced alertness. METHOD: A total of 136 helicopter pilots of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) of all qualification levels were invited to participate in a three-round ranking Delphi study. RESULTS: A total of 41 (30%) helicopter pilots completed the first questionnaire round and 20 (77%) flight instructors completed the ranking round. The top ten skills elements comprised seven nontechnical skills (NTS), namely, awareness of the environment, decision making, workload management, stress management, planning and coordinating, general knowledge, and basic fitness; and three technical skills (TS), that is, advanced aircraft handling, flight maneuvers and procedures, and abnormal and emergency procedures. The top three ranked skill elements (awareness of environment, decision making, and workload management) were considered by the flight instructors to be highly influenced by reduced pilot alertness. CONCLUSION: NTS are considered more important and more affected by reduced pilot alertness during operational helicopter flight compared to TS.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Effects of breathing gas with elevated oxygen partial pressure (Po 2 ) and/or elevated inspired oxygen fraction (F I o 2 ) at sea level or higher is discussed. High F I o 2 is associated with absorption problems in the lungs, middle ear, and paranasal sinuses, particularly if F I o 2 &gt; 80% and small airways, Eustachian tubes, or sinus passages are blocked. Absorption becomes faster as cabin altitude increases. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity and direct oxidative injuries, related to elevated Po 2 , are improbable in flight; no pulmonary oxygen toxicity has been found when Po 2 &lt; 55 kPa [418 Torr; 100% O 2 higher than 15,000 ft (4570 m)]. Symptoms with Po 2 of 75 kPa [520 Torr; 100% O 2 at 10,000 ft (3050 m)] were reported after 24 h and the earliest signs at Po 2 of 100 kPa (760 Torr, 100% O 2 at sea level) occurred after 6 h. However, treatment for decompression sickness entails a risk of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. Elevated Po 2 also constricts blood vessels, changes blood pressure control, and reduces the response to low blood sugar. With healthy lungs, gas transport and oxygen delivery are not improved by increasing Po 2 .

RESULTS: Performance on both Cognition and WinSCAT decreased with age but improved with repeated administration due to practice effects, and men had higher scores than women on tasks that required vigilant attention, spatial reasoning, and risk-taking behaviors. Assessment of test-retest reliability showed intraclass coefficients for efficiency ranging from 0.417 to 0.810, reflecting the broad nature of constructs assessed by Cognition.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-altitude decompression sickness (HADCS) is a rare condition that has been associated with aircraft accidents. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first case report of a patient treated for severe HADCS using recompression therapy and veno-venous extracorporeal oxygenation (VV-ECMO) with a complete recovery. CASE REPORT: After depressurization of a cabin, the 51-yr-old jet pilot was admitted to the Military Institute of Medicine with a life-threatening HADCS approximately 6 h after landing from a high-altitude flight, in a dynamically deteriorating condition, with progressing dyspnea and edema, reporting increasing limb paresthesia, fluctuating consciousness, and right-sided paresis. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the intensive care mode was initiated. A therapeutic recompression with U.S. Navy Treatment Table 6 was performed with neurological improvement. Due to cardiovascular collapse, sedation, mechanical ventilation, and significant doses of catecholamines were started, followed by continuous veno-venous hemodialysis. In the face of disturbances in oxygenation, during the second day of treatment the patient was commenced on veno-venous extracorporeal oxygenation. Over the next 6 d, the patient’s condition slowly improved. On day 7, VV-ECMO was discontinued. On day 19, the patient was discharged with no neurological deficits. DISCUSSION: We observed two distinct stages during the acute phase of the disease. During the first stage, signs of hypoperfusion, neurological symptoms, and marbled skin were observed. During the second stage, multiple organ dysfunction dominated, including heart failure, pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, and fluid overload, all of which can be attributed to extensive endothelial damage.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spatial disorientation, poor situational awareness, and aerodynamic stalls are often causal/contributory to general aviation accidents. To mitigate against the occurrence of these mishaps Cirrus Aircraft has, since 2002, introduced advanced avionics into their piston airplanes (Cirrus SR20/22). These airplanes are also certificated to more rigorous crashworthiness tests than legacy aircraft approved prior to these standards being codified. Herein, using for comparison two legacy aircraft fleets manufactured prior to 2002, we determined whether a reduced mishap rate for all accidents or relating to the aforementioned causes/contributing factors and/or diminished injury severity for survivable accidents were evident for Cirrus SR20/22 airplanes. METHODS: Accidents (2008–2017) involving Cirrus SR20/22 airplanes (manufactured 2002 or later) and Beechcraft 35/36 (Bonanza) and Mooney 20 models (both manufactured no later than 2001) (14CFR Part 91 rules) were identified ( N = 136, 259, 164, respectively) from the NTSB database. Statistical analyses used Poisson distribution/contingency tables/ t - and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: For each year within the 2013–2017 timespan the Cirrus SR20/22 all-accident rate was diminished 39–75% relative to both legacy fleets. Temporally, the fraction of fatal Cirrus SR20/22 accidents, initially higher, declined 50% achieving a lower, or comparable, proportion to the two legacy airframes. Fatal accident rates involving spatial disorientation/situational awareness/aerodynamic stalls were &gt; 80% lower for Cirrus SR20/22 airplanes. For survivable mishaps, Cirrus SR20/22 aircraft showed a lower proportion (0.13 compared with 0.20–0.35) of fatal/serious injuries. CONCLUSION: Toward improving legacy aircraft safety, owners should be encouraged to upgrade their avionics for mitigating against the occurrence of such human-factor-related mishaps and install airbags to minimize injury severity.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Being able to identify individual differences in skilled motor learning during disorienting conditions is important for spaceflight, military aviation, and rehabilitation. METHODS : Blindfolded subjects ( N = 34) were strapped into a device that behaved like an inverted pendulum in the horizontal roll plane and were instructed to use a joystick to stabilize themselves across two experimental sessions on consecutive days. Subjects could not use gravitational cues to determine their angular position and many soon became spatially disoriented. RESULTS : Most demonstrated minimal learning, poor performance, and a characteristic pattern of positional drifting during horizontal roll plane balancing. To understand the wide range of individual differences observed, we used a Bayesian Gaussian Mixture method to cluster subjects into three statistically distinct groups that represent Proficient, Somewhat Proficient, and Not Proficient performance. We found that subjects in the Not Proficient group exhibited a suboptimal strategy of using very stereotyped large magnitude joystick deflections. We also used a Gaussian Naive Bayes method to create predictive classifiers. As early as the second block of experimentation (out of ten), we could predict a subject’s final group with 80% accuracy. DISCUSSION : Our findings indicate that machine learning can help predict individual performance and learning in a disorienting dynamic stabilization task and identify suboptimal strategies in Not Proficient subjects, which could lead to personalized and more effective training programs.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In recent decades, there has been investigation into the effects of microgravity and microgravity-like environments on cognition and emotion separately. Here we highlight the need of focusing on emotion-cognition interactions as a framework for explaining cognitive performance in space. In particular, by referring to the affective cognition hypothesis, the significant interplay between emotional variables and cognitive processing in space is briefly analyzed. Altogether, this approach shows an interesting pattern of data pointing to a dynamic relation that may be sensitive to microgravity. The importance of examining interactions between emotion and cognition for space performance remains fundamental (e.g., stress-related disorders) and deserves further attention. This approach is ultimately interesting considering the potential effects that microgravity may play on human performance during long-term space missions and on return to Earth. Mammarella N.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While skin conditions are commonly reported in flight on the International Space Station (ISS), postflight skin complaints have generally been limited to foot sole sensitivity upon reloading after landing. In this case report, we describe the postflight skin findings in NASA’s first year-long crewmember. CASE REPORT: The crewmember was a 51-yr-old astronaut who spent 340 d in space on this mission. His in-flight course was unremarkable except for medication use for congestion, likely secondary to microgravity-induced fluid shift and elevated CO 2 levels on the ISS, and an episode of contact dermatitis from electrodes for an experiment. He had a nominal landing in Kazakhstan. During his direct return to Houston, approximately 10 h after the Soyuz landing, he developed erythema and skin sensitivity in gravity-dependent areas. The skin findings persisted for 6 d and were successfully treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, gabapentin, hydrotherapy, and massage. DISCUSSION: While vascular, allergic, and immunologic causes cannot be ruled out, we hypothesize that a prolonged lack of skin stimulation over the course of the year-long mission led to the crewmember’s postflight rash and skin sensitivity. Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in cutaneous receptor feedback in the sole of the foot in spaceflight and, therefore, it is plausible that skin in other parts of the body can undergo similar changes if they are not stimulated as they normally would be on Earth. More work will be needed to better understand this phenomenon and test potential mitigations. Law J, Gilmore S, Kelly S.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aircraft maintenance workers may be exposed to organophosphates in hydraulic fluid and engine oil. Previous research has indicated that inhalation may not be the primary exposure route. This study sought to measure dermal contact and inhalation in conjunction with cholinesterase inhibition and determine if Air Force Specialty Code serves as an exposure predictor. METHODS: Aircraft maintenance workers were sampled for changes in acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Dermal contact was measured using wrist-worn silicone passive dosimeters and inhalation exposure was measured using thermal desorption tube air sampling. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of any cholinesterase inhibition in the study population was 25.33%. Prevalence of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase was 18.67% and 6.67%, respectively. The mean tributyl phosphate result was 1.71 ng of tributyl phosphate per gram of wristband (ng g 1 ) [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.63, 9.05]. Triphenyl phosphate was more prevalent, with only one sample below the limit of detection (mean 1386.26 ng g 1 ; 95% CI: 7297.78, 10,070.31), and tricresyl phosphate was found in every sample (mean 4311.65 ng g 1 ; 95% CI: 8890.24, 17,512.31). No organophosphates were detected via air sampling. DISCUSSION: Workers experienced organophosphate exposure and cholinesterase inhibition, but the study was not large enough to establish a statistically significant association between exposure and disease. Exposure to organophosphate esters is more likely to occur through contact and absorption of chemicals through the skin than through inhalation of oil mists. Air Force Specialty Code does not appear to be a good predictor of exposure to organophosphates. Future studies should consider using a larger sample size.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The risks posed by flight illusions impacting pilot spatial orientation have been determined as a safety concern from numerous past aviation accident investigations. Early demonstration of the adverse effects of flight illusions on spatial orientation would be desirable for all pilots, especially at the early training stages to deeply embed good practices for onset detection, flight correction, and response mitigation. METHOD: Simulated flights on a disorientation demonstrator were performed by 19 pilots for 3 conditions: no illusion, somatogyral illusion, and Coriolis illusion. An objective approach for assessing pilot performance degradation due to flight illusions can be done by using a defined flight profile: instrument landing system (ILS) flight trajectory during final instrument approach. Deviations to the standard ILS profile were recorded to measure and evaluate the influence of the demonstrated flight illusion on pilot performance. RESULTS: The results show the expectation that the smallest deviations from the ideal trajectory are caused by pilot tracking error (no illusion), and the greatest deviations are caused by the Coriolis illusion. Results demonstrated a statistically significant effect of illusions on performance. According to statements from pilots, training for flight illusion response is essential to complement training in aircraft regulations and aerodynamics. DISCUSSION: Measuring the influence of vestibular illusions on flight profile with a simulator allows assessment of individual differences and improvement of pilot performance under the conditions of no illusion, the somatogyral illusion, and the Coriolis illusion.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This article presents the results of an EASA-commissioned study aimed at analyzing the medical causes of grounding of a broad European pilot population and recommending measures to reduce the risk of in-flight incapacitation in commercial air transport pilots.METHOD: European National Aviation Authorities (NAAs) were requested to provide data concerning the total number of pilots that were examined, their age and license category, number of unfit pilots, and the medical causes of each case of grounding. Diagnoses were classified according to the format and definitions laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No. 1178/2011 Part Med.RESULTS: Analyzed were 82,435 cases assessed by 6 NAAs. Of these cases, 2.1% were assessed as unfit to fly. Frequent causes for grounding a pilot were cardiovascular (19%), psychiatric (11%), neurological (10%), and psychological (9%). Cardiovascular conditions were the most frequent cause for grounding in the older age groups, with 21% in the age 51-60 cohort, 28% in the age 61-65 cohort, and 48% in those beyond 65 yr. Psychiatric and psychological diagnoses were most frequent in the age 20-40 cohort.DISCUSSION: Cardiovascular conditions were the most frequent cause for grounding. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are associated with modifiable risk factors. Tackling these risk factors gives aeromedical examiners the opportunity to improve the health of pilots and reduce CVD-related flight safety risks by reducing the number of pilots at risk of in-flight incapacitation.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accurate color vision is essential for optimal performance in aviation and space environments using nonredundant color coding to convey critical information. Most color tests detect color vision deficiency (CVD) but fail to diagnose type or severity of CVD, which are important to link performance to occupational demands. The computer-based Cone Contrast Test (CCT) diagnoses type and severity of CVD. It is displayed on a netbook computer for clinical application, but a more portable version may prove useful for deployments, space and aviation cockpits, as well as accident and sports medicine settings. Our purpose was to determine if the CCT can be conducted on a tablet display (Windows 8, Microsoft, Seattle, WA) using touch-screen response input. METHODS: The CCT presents colored letters visible only to red (R), green (G), and blue (B) sensitive retinal cones to determine the lowest R, G, and B cone contrast visible to the observer. The CCT was measured in 16 color vision normals (CVN) and 16 CVDs using the standard netbook computer and a Windows 8 tablet display calibrated to produce equal color contrasts. RESULTS: Both displays showed 100% specificity for confirming CVN and 100% sensitivity for detecting CVD. In CVNs there was no difference between scores on netbook vs. tablet displays. G cone CVDs showed slightly lower G cone CCT scores on the tablet. CONCLUSIONS: CVD can be diagnosed with a tablet display. Ease-of-use, portability, and complete computer capabilities make tablets ideal for multiple settings, including aviation, space, military deployments, accidents and rescue missions, and sports vision.Chacon A, Rabin J, Yu D, Johnston S, Bradshaw T.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aerobic exercise capacity provides information regarding cardiorespiratory health and physical capacity. However, in many populations the ability to measure whole-body or leg aerobic exercise capacity is limited due to physical disability or lack of appropriate equipment. Clinically there is a need to evaluate aerobic capacity in individuals who cannot use their legs for locomotion. In astronauts the habitable space for exercise testing in the next generation of space exploration systems may be restricted and may not support the traditional lower body testing. Therefore, the purpose was to determine if upper body physical performance could estimate lower body aerobic capacity. METHODS: Maximal O 2 uptake (&lt;inline-graphic xlink:href=\"amhp4181inf1.gif\"/&gt;o 2max ), gas exchange threshold (GET), and the highest sustainable rate of aerobic metabolism [arm cranking critical power ( A CP) and lower body critical speed ( L CS)] were determined in 55 conditioned men and women during arm-cranking and treadmill running. RESULTS: &lt;inline-graphic xlink:href=\"amhp4181inf1.gif\"/&gt;o 2max and GET (48.6 ± 7.6 and 29.0 ± 4.8 ml · kg −1 · min −1 , respectively) were significantly lower during arm-cranking exercise compared to running (27.1 ± 7.6 and 13.5 ± 2.6 ml · kg −1 · min −1 , respectively). The &lt;inline-graphic xlink:href=\"amhp4181inf1.gif\"/&gt;o 2 at A CP was significantly lower than the &lt;inline-graphic xlink:href=\"amhp4181inf1.gif\"/&gt;o 2 at the L CS (18.4 ± 5.01 vs. 39.5 ± 8.1 ml · kg −1 · min −1 , respectively).

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Environmental motion can affect shipboard sleep of crewmembers. Slamming and similar harsh motion may interfere with sleep, whereas mild motion and sopite syndrome may enhance sleep. If sleep needs vary by sea condition, this factor should be considered when assessing human performance at sea. The goal of this study was to assess sleep duration in different sea conditions. METHODS: Crewmembers ( N = 52) from a U.S. Navy vessel participated in the study while performing their normal daily schedule of duties. Sleep was assessed with wrist-worn actigraphy. Motion sickness and sopite syndrome were assessed using standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: In rough sea conditions, crewmembers experienced increased severity of motion sickness and sopite syndrome compared to their ratings during calmer sea conditions. Crewmembers slept significantly longer during sea state 5-6 compared to sleep on days with sea state 4 (25% increase) and sea state 3-4 (30% increase). Specifically, daily sleep increased from 6.97 ± 1.24 h in sea state 3-4, to 7.23 ± 1.65 h in sea state 4, to 9.04 ± 2.90 h in sea state 5–6. DISCUSSION: Although the duration of sleep in rough seas increased significantly compared to calmer sea conditions, causal factors are inconclusive. Accumulated sleep debt, motion-induced fatigue, and sopite syndrome all may have contributed, but results suggest that motion sickness and sopite syndrome were the predominant stressors. If sleep needs increase in severe motion environments, this factor should be taken into account when developing daily activity schedules or when modeling manning requirements on modern ships.Matsangas P, Shattuck NL, McCauley ME.

The focus of the present work was to study the changes over time observed in the Nearest Neighbor Index (NNI), an index derived from the spatial distribution of eye fixations that has been reported to be sensitive to variations in mental workload. Of particular interest are periodic changes in the ultradian timescale (an ultradian rhythm is a recurrent period or cycle repeated throughout a 24-h circadian day).Data from a previously reported experiment were further analyzed using temporal spectral analysis, which is one of the most commonly used techniques for studying measurements collected at regularly spaced intervals of time.An ultradian rhythm with a periodicity between 2 and 15 min was found, which is compatible with results obtained by analyzing reaction times in prolonged vigilance tasks.The identification of a periodicity in the allocation of mental resources should be considered in the design of automation support that is dynamically matched to mental workload.",

The study objectives were to determine 1) HEMS accident rates and causes; 2) occupant injury severity profiles; and 3) whether accident aircraft were certified to the more stringent crashworthiness standards implemented two decades ago. METHODS: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) aviation accident database was used to identify HEMS mishaps for the years spanning 1983–2014. Contingency tables (Pearson Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test) were used to determine differences in proportions. A generalized linear model (Poisson distribution) was used to determine if accident rates differed over time. RESULTS: While the HEMS accident rate decreased by 71% across the study period, the fraction of fatal accidents (36–50%) and the injury severity profiles were unchanged. None of the accident aircraft fully satisfied the current crashworthiness standards. Failure to clear obstacles and visual-to-instrument flight, the most frequent accident causes (37 and 26%, respectively), showed a downward trend, whereas accidents ascribed to aircraft malfunction showed an upward trend over time. CONCLUSION: HEMS operators should consider updating their fleet to the current, more stringent crashworthiness standards in an attempt to reduce injury severity. Additionally, toward further mitigating accidents ascribed to inadvertent visual-to-instrument conditions, HEMS aircraft should be avionics-equipped for instrument flight rules flight.Boyd DD, Macchiarella ND.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exploration missions to asteroids and Mars will bring new challenges associated with communication delays and more autonomy for crews. Mission safety and success will rely on how well the entire system, from technology to the human elements, is adaptable and resilient to disruptive, novel, or potentially catastrophic events. The recent NASA Extreme Environment Missions Operations (NEEMO) 20 mission highlighted this need and produced valuable “lessons learned” that will inform future research on team adaptation and resilience. METHODS: A team of NASA, industry, and academic members used an iterative process to design a tripod shaped structure, called the CORAL Tower, for two astronauts to assemble underwater with minimal tools. The team also developed assembly procedures, administered training to the crew, and provided support during the mission. RESULTS: During the design, training, and assembly of the Tower, the team learned first-hand how adaptation in extreme environments depends on incremental testing, thorough procedures and contingency plans that predict possible failure scenarios, and effective team adaptation and resiliency for the crew and support personnel. DISCUSSION: Findings from NEEMO 20 provide direction on the design and testing process for future space systems and crews to maximize adaptation. This experience also underscored the need for more research on team adaptation, particularly how input and process factors affect adaption outcomes, the team adaptation iterative process, and new ways to measure the adaptation process.Anglin KM, Kring JP.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bone loss due to weightlessness is a significant concern for astronauts’ mission safety and health upon return to Earth. This problem is monitored with bone densitometry (DXA), the clinical tool used to assess skeletal strength. DXA has served clinicians well in assessing fracture risk and has been particularly useful in diagnosing osteoporosis in the elderly postmenopausal population for which it was originally developed. Over the past 1–2 decades, however, paradoxical and contradictory findings have emerged when this technology was widely employed in caring for diverse populations unlike those for which it was developed. Although DXA was originally considered the surrogate marker for bone strength, it is now considered one part of a constellation of factors–described collectively as bone quality–that makes bone strong and resists fracturing, independent of bone density. These characteristics are beyond the capability of routine DXA to identify, and as a result, DXA can be a poor prognosticator of bone health in many clinical scenarios. New clinical tools are emerging to make measurement of bone strength more accurate. This article reviews the historical timeline of bone density measurement (dual X-ray absorptiometry), expands upon the clinical observations that modified the relationship of DXA and bone strength, discusses some of the new clinical tools to predict fracture risk, and highlights the challenges DXA poses in the assessment of fracture risk in astronauts.Licata AA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Commercial spaceflight participants (SFPs) will introduce new medical challenges to the aerospace community, with unique medical conditions never before exposed to the space environment. This is a case report regarding the response of a subject with multiple cardiac malformations, including aortic insufficiency, pulmonary atresia, pulmonary valve replacement, ventricular septal defect (post-repair), and pulmonary artery stenosis (post-dilation), to centrifuge acceleration simulating suborbital flight. CASE REPORT: A 23-yr-old man with a history of multiple congenital cardiac malformations underwent seven centrifuge runs over 2 d. Day 1 consisted of two +G z runs (peak = +3.5 G z , run 2) and two +G x runs (peak = +6.0 G x , run 4). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G x and +G z ). Data collected included blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, neurovestibular exams, and post-run questionnaires regarding motion sickness, disorientation, greyout, and other symptoms. Despite the subject’s significant medical history, he tolerated the acceleration profiles well and demonstrated no significant abnormal physiological responses. DISCUSSION: Potential risks to SFPs with aortic insufficiency, artificial heart valves, or valvular insufficiency include lower +G z tolerance, earlier symptom onset, and ineffective mitigation strategies such as anti-G straining maneuvers. There are no prior studies of prolonged accelerations approximating spaceflight in such individuals. This case demonstrates tolerance of acceleration profiles in an otherwise young and healthy individual with significant cardiac malformations, suggesting that such conditions may not necessarily preclude participation in commercial spaceflight.Blue RS, Blacher E, Castleberry TL, Vanderploeg JM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Wearable accelerometers have become ubiquitous in the fields of exercise physiology and ambulatory hospital settings. However, these devices have yet to be validated in extreme operational environments. The objective of this study was to correlate the gravitational forces (G forces) detected by wearable accelerometers with the G forces detected by high performance aircraft. METHODS: We compared the in-flight G forces detected by the two commercially available portable accelerometers to the F/A-18 Carrier Aircraft Inertial Navigation System (CAINS-2) during 20 flights performed by the Navy’s Flight Demonstration Squadron (Blue Angels). Postflight questionnaires were also used to assess the perception of distractibility during flight. RESULTS: Of the 20 flights analyzed, 10 complete in-flight comparisons were made, accounting for 25,700 s of correlation between the CAINS-2 and the two tested accelerometers. Both accelerometers had strong correlations with that of the F/A-18 G z axis, averaging r = 0.92 and r = 0.93, respectively, over 10 flights. Comparison of both portable accelerometer’s average vector magnitude to each other yielded an average correlation of r = 0.93. Both accelerometers were found to be minimally distracting. DISCUSSION: These results suggest the use of wearable accelerometers is a valid means of detecting G forces during high performance aircraft flight. Future studies using this surrogate method of detecting accelerative forces combined with physiological information may yield valuable in-flight normative data that heretofore has been technically difficult to obtain and hence holds the promise of opening the door for a new golden age of aeromedical research.Rice GM, VanBrunt TB, Snider DH, Hoyt RE.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ecology of medical care model has been used in various populations with varying results. We aimed to apply this model in the population of Israeli Air Force (IAF) aviators. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was presented to all Israeli Air Force aviators during their mandatory yearly check-up over 1 yr starting on November 26 th , 2012. The questionnaire contained items on demographic, personal, and military details, as well as items on the presence of clinical symptoms, and various health care contacts in the previous month. We assessed the differences between career and reserve personnel using a X 2 test. RESULTS: There were 325 aviators who completed the questionnaire (2 women, 132 reserves). Clinical symptoms were reported by 62.5% of the responders. Over half (52.6%) had any health care encounter: 23.7% with a dentist, 17.9% with non-MD therapists, 12.6% with a specialist, and 11.7% with a primary physician. A significant difference between reserve and career personnel was found only in primary care visits. Out of the aviators who reported having clinical symptoms, 70.9% did not visit a physician. Of those who did not seek medical care, 42.4% reported that the symptoms were viewed as unimportant, 41% thought they would disappear by themselves, 40.3% could not find time for treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Aviators in the IAF have similar rate of clinical symptoms as in other unselected populations. Those who report symptoms usually do not visit a physician for treatment. When they do seek advice it is mostly from non-MD practitioners.Gordon B, Levy Y, Yemini T, Carmon E, Erlich Y, Hermoni D. The ecology of medical care among Israeli military aviators.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astronauts on the mission to Mars will be subjected to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) exposures. While ground-based studies suggest that simulated GCR (GCRsim) exposure impairs performance in multiple cognitive tasks, the impact of such exposures on task switching performance (an important skill for all aviators) has not yet been determined.METHODS: Male Wistar rats previously exposed to 10 cGy of ⁴He ions or GCRsim and their sham littermates were trained to perform a touchscreen-based switch task designed to mimic warning light response tests used to evaluate pilots' response times.RESULTS: Irradiated rats failed to complete a high cognitive task load training task threefold more frequently than shams. There were 18 (4 Sham, 7 He-, and 7 GCR-exposed) rats that successfully completed initial training and underwent switch task testing. Relative to the sham rats in the switch task, the GCRsim-exposed rats had significantly slower response times in switch but not repeat trials. The GCRsim-exposed rats had significantly (P < 0.01) higher switch response ratios (switch/repeat trial response time) and absolute switch costs (switch minus repeat trial response time) than either the sham or He-exposed rats.DISCUSSION: Rats exposed to GCRsim have significantly impaired performance in the switch task manifested as an absolute switch cost of ∼700 ms. The operational significance of such an increase requires further investigation, but a 1000-ms switch cost results in a twofold increase in cockpit error rates in pilots. If exposure to GCR in space results in similar effects in humans, the operational performance of astronauts on the Mars mission may be suboptimal.Stephenson S, Britten R.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unexpected events in flight might decrease the transparency of the flying process and weaken the pilot’s perception of the current state, or even erode manipulating skills. However, during the flight test of a new or modified aircraft, to verify the boundaries of aircraft aerodynamic performance and handling stability, unexpected events may be encountered that need to be handled by the test pilot. Therefore, studying the differences between test pilots and airline pilots could help improve flight safety. METHODS: Two kinds of physiological parameters, eye blink rate and average fixation duration and task-related performance of test pilots and airline pilots, were analyzed in three abnormal scenarios. A total of 16 pilots participated. The study was carried out in an A320 flight simulator. RESULTS: The differences were significant for both test pilots and airline pilots in eye blink rate and average fixation duration. Furthermore, the reaction time of test pilots (Mean = 23.38 s) was significantly shorter than airline pilots (Mean = 42.63 s) in Unreliable Airspeed condition, and the pitch angle deviations between them were significant in both Wind Shear and Unreliable Airspeed condition. DISCUSSION: The uncertainty of environmental change could create more severe pressure and mental workload influence than actual system failure. For airline pilots, compared with test pilots, the importance of practicing manual flight should still be emphasized. Improving reactions to unexpected ambient conditions and unannounced fault status could also contribute to flight safety. Zheng Y, Lu Y, Jie Y, Zhao Z, Fu S.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maintenance and disposition of decedent remains during spaceflight require the isolation of biohazardous products of decomposition in microgravity and in the absence of refrigeration. Containment and isolation options would preferably offer sufficient time to enable crew and ground support teams to determine appropriate disposition of remains and even potentially return remains to the Earth. The pilot study described herein undertook an effort to develop a postmortem containment unit for the isolation and maintenance of decedent remains in a microgravity environment.METHODS: Commercial off-the-shelf containment units were modified to meet the needs of a microgravity spaceflight environment and to offer the best likelihood of successful containment and management of remains. A subsequent evaluation of modified containment unit performance was undertaken utilizing human cadavers, with measurement and analysis of volatile off-gassing over time followed by impact testing of the units containing cadaverous remains in a simulated spaceflight vehicle seat.RESULTS: Modifications were implemented without significant negative design impact. Failure was observed in one modified unit after 9 d and attributed to improper filter application. The remaining unit successfully contained remains beyond the intended endpoint of the study.DISCUSSION: These pilot efforts offer important insight into the development of effective postmortem containment options for future spaceflight. Further study is needed to ensure repeatability of the findings and to further characterize the failure modes of the modified units evaluated, the impact of microgravity conditions, and the identification of additional modifications that would improve remains disposition.Houser T, Lindgren KN, Mazuchowski EL II, Barratt MR, Haines DC, Jayakody M, Blue RS, Bytheway JA, Stepaniak PC.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A recent finding of a deep venous thrombosis during spaceflight has prompted the need to clarify mechanisms and risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In turn, mitigation countermeasures, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options must be explored. The objective of this review was to synthesize current evidence on VTE in spaceflight. METHODS: A literature review was performed from inception to April 2023 pertaining to VTE in the context of spaceflight or ground-based analogs with human participants. PubMed was searched for papers written in English using the terms “spaceflight” or “weightlessness” and “thrombotic” or “embolism” or “thromboembolism” in “venous” or “veins”. Papers using cellular or animal models were excluded. RESULTS: There were 63 papers captured; 7 original scientific studies, 3 narrative reviews, 2 systematic reviews, and 3 commentaries discussed VTE in spaceflight. Reference lists were screened. Important themes included: altered venous hemodynamics, increased fibrinogen and coagulation markers, hypoalbuminemia, and immune dysfunction. Additional risk factors may be seen in women, such as the use of oral contraceptives. DISCUSSION: Venous stasis and decreased shear stress secondary to fluid shifts may induce inflammatory changes in the venous system, resulting in endothelial damage and upregulation of the coagulation cascade. Additionally, women in space are subject to physiological factors increasing their VTE risk, such as the use of oral contraceptives, inducing increased blood viscosity and hypoalbuminemia. Efforts should also be placed in optimizing sensitivity and specificity of imaging markers, payload, and training ability, notably the use of vector flow imaging, and improving point-of-testing biomarkers, such as albumin and p-selectin.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to high ambient altitudes above 10,000 ft (3048 m) over sea level during aviation can present the risk of hypobaric hypoxia. Hypoxia can impair sensory and cognitive functions, degrading performance and leading to mishaps. Military aircrew undergo regular hypoxia familiarization training to recognize their symptoms and understand the consequences of hypoxia. However, over the years, aviators have come to believe that individuals have a “personal hypoxia signature.” The idea is that intraindividual variability in symptom experience during repeated exposure is low. In other words, individuals will experience the same symptoms during hypoxia from day to day, year to year. METHODS: We critically reviewed the existing literature on this hypothesis. Most studies that claim to support the notion of a signature only examine group-level data, which do not inform individual-level consistency. Other studies use inappropriate statistical methods, while still others do not control for accuracy of recall over the period of years. To combat these shortcomings, we present a dataset of 91 individuals who completed nearly identical mask-off, normobaric hypoxia exposures days apart. RESULTS: We found that for every symptom on the Hypoxia Symptom Questionnaire, at least half of the subjects reported the symptom inconsistently across repeated exposure. This means that, at best, 50% of subjects did not report the same symptom across exposures. DISCUSSION: These data provide compelling evidence against the existence of hypoxia signatures. We urge that hypoxia familiarization training incorporate these findings and encourage individuals to expect a wide range of hypoxia symptoms upon repeated exposure. Cox BD, McHail DG, Blacker KJ.

METHODS: The subjects were volunteer cadets (inexperienced group) and lieutenants (experienced group) undergoing their first centrifuge training. The first group did not have any high performance aircraft (HPA) experience, while the latter one had a 1-yr experience of intense flying of HPA. During the centrifuge run, EMG activity was recorded from the left and right shoulder, neck flexor, and neck extensor muscles. RESULTS: The pilots without HPA experience had significantly higher muscle activity in the neck flexor and extensor muscles during the last 5 s of the recorded period at G levels exceeding +7.4. DISCUSSION: Muscle activity in the neck and shoulder muscles was gradually higher among the whole study group with increasing +G z forces. Because pilots without any HPA experience had significantly higher muscle activity than their counterparts with experience of HPA, we suppose that the experience of high +G z forces might lead to lower muscle activation in the same flight mission.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One of the most difficult challenges in aviation medicine is to diagnose, as early as possible, pilots with psychiatric disorders that may impair pilot performance and increase the risk of incidents and accidents. This diagnosis applies particularly to bipolar disorder (BD), where return to flying duty is not an option in the majority of cases. BD is a long-term mental disorder presenting remittent depressive, hypomanic, manic, or mixed episodes between low symptomatic or asymptomatic intermediate periods. Onset in most cases is in late teen or early adult years. Suicidal intentions and suicide risk are significantly elevated in individuals with BD compared to the general population. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed of BD and aviation accidents and the National Transportation Safety Board database of fatal general aviation accidents was searched. One case report and two database reports of interest from 1994 to 2014 were identified. RESULTS: The findings set a minimum frequency of BD in general aviation fatalities to be approximately 2 out of 8648 (0.023%) in the United States. DISCUSSION: The reported incidence may underestimate the real number of BD cases for several reasons, including the fact that the medical history of pilots is not always available or is sometimes not the primary interest of a safety investigation. This study suggests that the demarcation of psychiatric disorder related to fitness to fly is an important step in safety.Vuorio A, Laukkala T, Navathe P, Budowle B, Bor R, Sajantila A.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health incapacitation is a serious threat to flight safety. Therefore, a study conducted 10 yr ago examined the incidents of ear-nose-throat (ENT) barotrauma and upper respiratory infection (URI) among commercial pilots and found that a large number continued to carry out their duties despite the risk of incapacitation. Now, 10 yr later, this new study examines if the attention to URIs has improved. METHOD: This study was conducted at the Danish Aeromedical Centre over the course of 1 yr with 463 valid respondents to a questionnaire on URIs and ENT barotrauma. These respondents were compared to 940 respondents answering the same questionnaire 10 yr prior in the same setting. RESULTS: This study shows a significant increase in the number of pilots flying despite signs of an URI from 42.8 to 50.1% and in the number of pilots using decongestant medicine from 43.3 to 59.5%. The proportion of pilots experiencing one or more ENT barotraumas has also increased from 37.4 to 55.5% for barotitis media and from 19.5 to 27.9% for barosinusitis. CONCLUSION: Half of all pilots in this study fly despite signs of an URI. This is a significant increase and shows that after 10 yr an URI is still not considered a valid reason for reporting in sick despite international aeromedical recommendation. Based on these findings, the study recommends that awareness of the risk of flying with an URI be increased.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This paper examines the subjective sense of orientation during asymmetric body rotations in normal subjects. METHODS: Self-motion perception was investigated in 10 healthy individuals during asymmetric whole-body rotation with different head orientations. Both on-vertical axis and off-vertical axis rotations were employed. Subjects tracked a remembered earth-fixed visual target while rotating in the dark for four cycles of asymmetric rotation (two half-sinusoidal cycles of the same amplitude, but of different duration). RESULTS: The rotations induced a bias in the perception of velocity (more pronounced with fast than with slow motion). At the end of rotation, a marked target position error (TPE) was present. For the on-vertical axis rotations, the TPE was no different if the rotations were performed with a 30° nose-down, a 60° nose-up, or a 90° side-down head tilt. With off-vertical axis rotations, the simultaneous activation of the semicircular canals and otolithic receptors produced a significant increase of TPE for all head positions. DISCUSSIONS: This difference between on-vertical and off-vertical axis rotation was probably partly due to the vestibular transfer function and partly due to different adaptation to the speed of rotation. Such a phenomenon might be generated in different components of the vestibular system. The adaptive process enhancing the perception of dynamic movement around the vertical axis is not related to the specific semicircular canals that are activated; the addition of an otolithic component results in a significant increase of the TPE.Panichi R, Occhigrossi C, Ferraresi A, Faralli M, Lucertini M, Pettorossi VE.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) is mainly caused by failure to sustain an oxygenated blood supply to the pilot’s brain because of the sudden acceleration in the direction of the +G z axis, and is considered a critical safety issue. The purpose of this study was to develop G-LOC warning algorithms based on monitoring electromyograms (EMG) of the gastrocnemius muscle on the calf. METHODS: EMG data was retrieved from a total of 67 pilots and pilot trainees of the Korean Air Force during high-G training on a human centrifugal simulator. Seven EMG features were obtained from root mean square (RMS), integrated absolute value (IAV), and mean absolute value (MAV) for muscle contraction, slope sign changes (SSC), waveform length (WL), zero crossing (ZC), and median frequency (MF) for muscle contraction and fatigue. RESULTS: Out of seven EMG features, IAV and WL showed a rapid decay before G-LOC. Based on these findings, this study developed two algorithms which can detect G-LOC during flight and provide warning signals to the pilots. The probability of G-LOC occurrence was detected through monitoring the decay trend for representing muscle endurance and climb rate of the IAV and WL value during sudden acceleration above 6 G, representing muscle power. The sensitivity of the algorithms using IAV and WL features was 100% and the specificity was 66.7%. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that a G-LOC detecting and warning system may be a customized, real-time countermeasure by improving the accuracy of detecting G-LOC.Kim S, Cho T, Lee Y, Koo H, Choi B, Kim D.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The effects of repeated centrifugation in association with head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest (BR) on the mediation of basic reflexes associated with the major postural muscles was investigated as a potential countermeasure for maintaining balance control and neuromotor reflex function. METHODS: There were 15 male volunteers who were exposed to 21 d of 6° HDT-BR. Eight were treated with daily 1-h artificial gravity (AG) exposures aboard a short radius centrifuge that provided 1-g footward loading at heart level. The other seven served as HDT-BR control subjects. Balance control was assessed using a standard computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) protocol that was modified by adding low-frequency pitch-plane head movements. Neuromotor reflex function was assessed using tendon stretch reflexes (MSR) and functional stretch reflex (FSR) data collected from the triceps surae muscle group. RESULTS: CDP performance was degraded by HDT-BR in both groups (ranging from 24 to 26%), but was unaffected by AG. BR also degraded MSR and FSR functions in both groups, with increased peak reflex latencies between 1.5 and 1.95 ms, but AG maintained pre-BR latencies for the MSR subjects. DISCUSSION: AG exposure did not modify balance control from pre-BR responses, but did help prevent decrements in FSR latencies post-BR.Paloski WH, Reschke MF, Feiveson AH.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many civilian aviation regulators favor evidence-based strategies that go beyond hours-of-service approaches for managing fatigue risk. Several countries now allow operations to be flown outside of flight and duty hour limitations, provided airlines demonstrate an alternative method of compliance that yields safety levels “at least equivalent to” the prescriptive regulations. Here we discuss equivalence testing in occupational fatigue risk management. We present suggested ratios/margins of practical equivalence when comparing operations inside and outside of prescriptive regulations for two common aviation safety performance indicators: total in-flight sleep duration and psychomotor vigilance task reaction speed. Suggested levels of practical equivalence, based on expertise coupled with evidence from field and laboratory studies, are ≤ 30 min in-flight sleep and ± 15% of reference response speed. METHODS: Equivalence testing is illustrated in analyses of a within-subjects field study during an out-and-back long-range trip. During both sectors of their trip, 41 pilots were monitored via actigraphy, sleep diary, and top of descent psychomotor vigilance task. Pilots were assigned to take rest breaks in a standard lie-flat bunk on one sector and in a bunk tapered 9 from hip to foot on the other sector. RESULTS: Total in-flight sleep duration (134 ± 53 vs. 135 ± 55 min) and mean reaction speed at top of descent (3.94 ± 0.58 vs. 3.77 ± 0.58) were equivalent after rest in the full vs. tapered bunk. DISCUSSION: Equivalence testing is a complimentary statistical approach to difference testing when comparing levels of fatigue and performance in occupational settings and can be applied in transportation policy decision making.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Flying a helicopter is a complex psychomotor skill requiring constant control inputs from pilots. A deterioration in psychomotor performance of a helicopter pilot may be detrimental to operational safety. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that psychomotor performance deteriorates over time during sustained operations and that the effect is more pronounced in the feet than the hands. The subjects were helicopter pilots conducting sustained multicrew offshore flight operations in a demanding environment. The remote flight operations involved constant workload in hot environmental conditions with complex operational tasking. METHODS: Over a period of 6 d 10 helicopter pilots were tested. At the completion of daily flying duties, a helicopter-specific screen-based compensatory tracking task measuring tracking accuracy (over a 5-min period) tested both hands and feet. Data were compared over time and tested for statistical significance for both deterioration and differential effect. RESULTS: A statistically significant deterioration of psychomotor performance was evident in the pilots over time for both hands and feet. There was also a statistically significant differential effect between the hands and the feet in terms of tracking accuracy. The hands recorded a 22.6% decrease in tracking accuracy, while the feet recorded a 39.9% decrease in tracking accuracy. DISCUSSION: The differential effect may be due to prioritization of limb movement by the motor cortex due to factors such as workload-induced cognitive fatigue. This may result in a greater reduction in performance in the feet than the hands, posing a significant risk to operational safety. McMahon TW, Newman DG.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 23 pilots flying with G z limitation (max limitation ranging from +2 G z to +5 G z ) due to spinal disorders and 50 experienced (+1000 flight hours) symptomless controls flying actively in operative missions in the Finnish Air Force. Data obtained for all subjects included the level of cumulative G z exposure measured sortie by sortie with fatigue index (FI) recordings and flight hours during the first 5 yr of the pilot’s career. RESULTS: The mean (± SD) accumulation of FI in the first 5 yr of flying high-performance aircraft was 8.0 ± 1.8 among the pilots in the FDL group and 7.7 ± 1.7 in the non-FDL group. There was no association between flight duty limitations and early career cumulative +G z exposure level measured with FI or flight hours. DISCUSSION: According to the present findings, it seems that the amount of cumulative +G z exposure during the first 5 yr of a military pilot’s career is not an individual risk factor for spinal disorders leading to flight duty limitation. Future studies conducted with FI recordings should be addressed to reveal the relationship between the actual level of +G z exposure and spinal disorders, with a longer follow-up period and larger sample sizes.

We examined the relation between the frequency of translocations and cosmic radiation dose in 83 male airline pilots. METHODS: Translocations were scored using fluorescence in situ hybridization chromosome painting. Cumulative radiation doses were estimated from individual flight records. Excess rate and log-linear Poisson regression models were evaluated. RESULTS: Pilots’ estimated median cumulative absorbed dose was 15 mGy (range 4.5–38). No association was observed between translocation frequency and absorbed dose from all types of flying [rate ratio (RR) = 1.01 at 1 mGy, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97–1.04].

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fatigue continues to be a leading cause of military aviation mishaps. Several factors, including reversed shift missions, can negatively affect sleep patterns and increase the risk of fatigue due to sleep restriction. Currently, there is a lack of objective data regarding the current rest and activity patterns of military aviators across multiple operational conditions. The purpose of this descriptive study was to document the rest and activity patterns of U.S. Army aviators in operational training and garrison (routine) environments using wrist-worn actigraphy devices. METHODS: Actigraphy data were collected from U.S. Army aviators in training ( N = 20) and garrison ( N = 77) environments for a period of 1 wk. RESULTS: Results from this study indicate that 90% of subjects in the training environment, even after accounting for small sleep bouts during the day, averaged less than the recommended 8 h of sleep daily across the recording week. Approximately half of subjects in garrison averaged less than 8 h of sleep daily after accounting for smaller sleep bouts. Sleep efficiency was relatively high and similar in both groups (∼84%). Subjects in the training group averaged significantly more time awake and less time sleeping than those in the routine garrison group. Moreover, subjects in training were exposed to more light during sleep than those in garrison. DISCUSSION: Training environments that are representative of deployed conditions restrict aviator restorative sleep.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Precooling (PC) before exercise may help prevent severe hyperthermia and exertional heatstroke (EHS). Before clinicians can advocate PC as an EHS prevention strategy, it must effectively mitigate factors associated with EHS development while not lessening the effectiveness of EHS treatment. Therefore, this study determined if PC affected rectal temperature (T rec ), body heat storage, heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), thermal sensation, sweat rate, and postexercise cold-water immersion (CWI) T rec cooling rates. METHODS: In this randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, 12 subjects (6 men, 6 women; age = 22 ± 2 yr; mass = 73.5 ± 7.9 kg; height = 171 ± 7 cm) underwent 15 min of CWI (10.0 ± 0.03°C) in an environmental chamber (38.6 ± 0.6°C; 36 ± 2% humidity). After a 10-min rest, they exercised to a T rec of 39.5°C. Subsequently, they underwent CWI (9.99 ± 0.03°C) until T rec reached 38°C. On control (CON) days, the same procedures occurred without the 15-min PC intervention. T rec , HR, thermal sensation, and RPE were measured at various times before, during, and after exercise. RESULTS: PC lowered body heat storage and T rec by 15.7 ± 15.0 W · m −2 and 0.42 ± 0.40°C, respectively, before exercise. Subjects exercised significantly longer (PC = 66.7 ± 16.3 min, CON = 45.7 ± 9.5 min) and at lower T rec (∼0.5 ± 0.5°C) and HR (∼10 ± 7 bpm) following PC. PC significantly lowered sweat rate (PC = 1.02 ± 0.31 L · h −1 , CON = 1.22 ± 0.39 L · h −1 ), but did not affect RPE or CWI cooling rates (PC = 0.18 ± 0.14°C · min −1 ; CON = 0.19 ± 0.05°C · min −1 ). Thermal sensation significantly differed between conditions only at pre-exercise (PC = 3 ± 1, CON = 5 ± 0.5). DISCUSSION: PC delayed severe hyperthermia and mitigated dehydration without affecting thermal perception or cooling rates posthyperthermia. PC may help prevent dangerous hyperthermia in athletes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tolerance to central hypovolemia is dictated by exhaustion of the physiological capacity to compensate called the compensatory reserve. Such physiological compromise can have detrimental impact on performance in aerospace environments as well as survival from hemorrhage on the battlefield. We induced central hypovolemia using progressively stepwise lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in women during various phases of the menstrual cycle to test the hypothesis that similar tolerance across all menstrual cycle phases would be reflected by similar changes in compensatory reserve. METHODS: Based on self-reporting of the last menstrual period, 40 healthy women, matched by demographics, were classified into 1 of 5 menstrual cycle phases: early follicular (EF, Days 1–7; N = 10), late follicular and ovulatory (LF, Days 9–15, N = 6), early luteal (EL, Days 16–18, N = 6), midluteal (ML, Days 19–25, N = 8), and late luteal (LL, Days 26–30, N = 10). All subjects had a 28–30 d menstrual cycle and were not taking oral contraceptives. Tolerance to central hypovolemia was measured as time (seconds) from baseline to the onset of presyncopal symptoms induced by LBNP. RESULTS: Time to presyncope as well as hemodynamic and compensatory reserve responses were statistically indistinguishable across all menstrual cycle phases. DISCUSSION: Consistent with our hypothesis, compensatory reserve with associated hemodynamic responses and tolerance to central hypovolemia was not affected by menstrual cycle phases. Our findings indicate experimental comparisons of responses to central hypovolemia involving the participation of healthy women with normal menstrual cycles and not taking oral contraceptives can be conducted independent of menstrual cycle phase.

The aim of the present study was to compare decompression stress during simulated sustained high-altitude flying vs. high-altitude flying interrupted by periods of moderate or marked cabin pressure increase. METHODS: The level of venous gas emboli (VGE) was assessed from cardiac ultrasound images using the 5-degree Eftedal-Brubakk scale. Nitrogen washout/uptake was measured using a closed-circuit rebreather. Eight men were investigated in three conditions: one 80-min continuous exposure to a simulated cabin altitude of A) 24,000 ft, or four 20-min exposures to 24,000 ft interspersed by three 20-min intervals at B) 20,000 ft or C) 900 ft. RESULTS: A and B induced marked and persistent VGE, with peak bubble scores of [median (range)]: A: 2.5 (1–3); B: 3.5 (2–4). Peak VGE score was less in C [1.0 (1–2), P &lt; 0.01]. Condition A exhibited an initially high and exponentially decaying rate of nitrogen washout. In C the washout rate was similar in each period at 24,000 ft, and the nitrogen uptake rate was similar during each 900-ft exposure. B exhibited nitrogen washout during each period at 24,000 ft and the initial period at 20,000 ft, but on average no washout or uptake during the last period at 20,000 ft. DISCUSSION: Intermittent reductions of cabin altitude from 24,000 to 20,000 ft do not appear to alleviate the DCS risk, presumably because the pressure increase is not sufficient to eliminate VGE. The nitrogen washout/uptake rate did not reflect DCS risk in the present exposures. Ånell R, Grönkvist M, Eiken O, Gennser M.

Prevalence of hypertension (HT) among pilots as per new criteria is largely unknown. This study aims to understand the prevalence of hypertension and obesity in civil aviation pilots and their correlation. METHODS: Enrolled were 1185 civilian pilots reporting for medical evaluation to a regulatory medical establishment in India. Their height, weight, and blood pressure (BP) were measured. Pilots were categorized as hypertensive or normotensive as per JNC VIII criteria and hypertensive, having elevated BP, or normotensive as per new ACC/AHA criteria of 2017. Data were analyzed for prevalence of obesity and overweight as per both WHO and Asia Pacific criteria. Results were analyzed using SPSS version 17. RESULTS: Prevalence of hypertension was 4.1%. Maximum hypertensives were in the 26–35 yr age group. Under the new ACC/AHA guidelines, prevalence of HT was 18.7%. Prevalences of overweight and obesity as per WHO criteria were 39% and 7.3% and as per Asia Pacific guidelines were 23.3% and 46.3%, respectively. As BMI increased above 23, risk of developing hypertension or white coat hypertension as per JNC VIII criteria increased by 6.86 times (OR 6.86, 95% CI 0.9–52.58). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of HT rose from 4.1% to an alarmingly high 18.7% when new criteria were applied.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Human factors have contributed to a constant increase in the level and numbers of aviation incident involvement. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relationships between anticipated negative emotions (ANEs) and incident involvement among Chinese civil pilots. Furthermore, this paper examines the role of risk perception and proactive coping within the relationships in order to understand the mechanisms underlying pilots’ involvement in air transport incidents. METHODS: A cross-sectional regression design was used to measure ANEs (Anticipated Negative Emotions Scale), proactive coping (Proactive Coping Scale), risk perception (Pilot Risk Perception Scale), and incident involvement (Hazardous Events Scale) among 295 Chinese civil pilots from China Southern Airlines. Mediation and moderating effects were explored using regression analyses and were confirmed by the bootstrapping approach. RESULTS: The results show that ANEs are significantly correlated with risk perception ( r = −0.55) and incident involvement ( r = 0.28). ANEs have a direct effect on pilot involvement in incidents and have an indirect effect on pilot incident involvement through the influencing of risk perception. Proactive coping was also found to weaken the direct effect of anticipated negative emotions on incident involvement. DISCUSSION: The safety benefits of proactive coping are more pronounced among pilots with high levels of ANEs. The practical implications of the study include recommendations relating to injury prevention efforts in incident involvement. Future research directions are also discussed.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Understanding UV exposure is essential for the assessment of its contribution to the occupational risk of pilots developing ocular and skin pathologies. The objective of this observational study was to measure the UV exposure of pilots flying between the United Kingdom and a range of destinations at three different seasons. METHODS: The in-flight UV exposure of pilots was measured on 322 Monarch Airlines short-haul flights on the Airbus A321-231 and Airbus A320-214 to 31 destinations, mostly in Europe, from 4 UK airports in September 2016–August 2017. The erythema effective and UV-A doses were compared with the ICNIRP guidance and typical recreational weekend exposure of UK office workers. RESULTS: The erythema effective radiant doses did not exceed 0.1 SED. For most of the flights, the UV-A exposure was also low. On 27 single sector flights, UV-A exposure could have exceeded the ICNIRP guidance if eye protection was not used. DISCUSSION: The UV exposure in a cockpit is mostly governed by the presence of direct sunlight and the duration of a flight. The average monthly exposures were low and significantly below weekend recreational exposures of UK office workers over a similar period. To assess the contribution of occupational UV exposure to the risk of developing sun-related ocular and cutaneous pathologies, it is important to consider the accumulative flight time, destinations, and UV attenuation of aircraft windshields. Additionally, leisure and recreational outdoor time needs to be considered before meaningful overall risk analysis can be undertaken.

METHODS: A total of 18 pilots performed flight tasks in a two-condition (high and low cognitive load) within-subject experiment to compare their flight performance and eye movement indicators. Eye movements were tracked during the flight mission by a portable eye-tracking device. RESULTS: Compared to the low cognitive load task, in the high cognitive load task, the subjects exhibited shorter average fixation times (M = 420.38, SD = 60.56), higher fixation frequencies (M = 2.27, SD = 0.30), and lower saccade frequencies (M = 2.7, SD = 0.31). Their flight performance was better during the low cognitive load task, as evidenced by the lower entropy (M = 0.11, SD = 0.03) of their eye movements. Analysis of fixation time percentages and fixation counts showed that the distribution of attention to each area of interest was adjusted dynamically over the course of the given task. DISCUSSION: Significant differences were observed in both fixation order and fixation frequency across the instrument array. When the cognitive load is high, the subjects used more efficient eye movement patterns and search strategies accompanying a higher level of SA. Lu T, Lou Z, Shao F, Li Y, You X.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human fatigue is an important factor within aviation, leading organizations to develop strategies to assess and mitigate associated risks. The U.S. Air Force’s Air Mobility Command (AMC) conducted the current pilot study to assess fatigue-related risks and issues in mobility operations. Specifically, we examined the relationship among fatigue perceptions, fatigue mitigation strategies, performance effectiveness graph reference, and circadian typology. METHODS: There were 21 volunteers from the Joint Base Charleston C-17 pilot community (M age = 28.67; SD age = 2.11; Proportion male = 85.71%) who completed a survey. Items referred to fatigue perceptions, fatigue mitigation strategies, performance effectiveness graph reference, and circadian typology. We examined descriptive statistics, correlations among the variables of interest, and possible moderation effects of circadian typology. RESULTS: Overall, aircrew perceived fatigue to be a serious safety of flight concern. Personal fatigue concerns and perceptions of pressure to continue missions despite fatigue were associated with increased use of the strategy of limiting light exposure during sleep episodes ( r = 0.49 and 0.47). Fatigue perceptions were not directly associated with performance effectiveness graph usage. Results suggested that morning type participants might be more likely to utilize specific fatigue mitigation strategies when there are concerns of fatigue compared to evening types. DISCUSSION: Despite organizational efforts, fatigue continues to be a serious concern for the mobility community. This pilot study suggests that circadian typology might affect the relationship between fatigue perceptions and fatigue mitigation strategies and resource use. Future research should further examine these relationships and their impact within fatigue risk management (FRM) programs. Morris MB, Howland JP, Amaddio KM, Gunzelmann G.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In-flight breaks are used during augmented long-haul flight operations, allowing pilots a sleep opportunity. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration duty and rest regulations restrict the pilot flying the landing to using the third rest break. It is unclear how effective these restrictions are on pilots ability to obtain sleep. We hypothesized there would be no difference in self-reported sleep, alertness, and fatigue between pilots taking the second vs. third rest breaks. METHODS: Pilots flying augmented operations in two U.S.-based commercial airlines were eligible for the study. Volunteers completed a survey at top-of-descent (TOD), including self-reported in-flight sleep duration, and Samn-Perelli fatigue and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale ratings. We compared the second to third rest break using noninferiority analysis. The influence of time of day (home-base time; HBT) was evaluated in 4-h blocks using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: From 787 flights 500 pilots provided complete data. The second rest break was noninferior to the third break for self-reported sleep duration (1.5 0.7 h vs. 1.4 0.7 h), fatigue (2.0 1.0 vs. 2.9 1.3), and sleepiness (2.6 1.4 vs. 3.8 1.8) at TOD for landing pilots. Measures of sleep duration, fatigue, and sleepiness were influenced by HBT circadian time of day. DISCUSSION: We conclude that self-reported in-flight sleep, fatigue, and sleepiness from landing pilots taking the second in-flight rest break are equivalent to or better than pilots taking the third break. Our findings support providing pilots with choice in taking the second or third in-flight rest break during augmented operations.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The effects of spaceflight on the intervertebral disc (IVD) have not been thoroughly studied, despite the knowledge that spaceflight increases the risk of herniation of IVDs in astronauts upon return to Earth. However, as long duration missions become more common, fully characterizing the mechanisms behind space-induced IVD degeneration becomes increasingly imperative for mission success. This review therefore surveys current literature to outline the results of human, animal, and cell-level studies investigating the effect of microgravity and radiation exposure on IVD health. Overall, recurring study findings include increases in IVD height in microgravity conditions, upregulation of catabolic proteases leading to a weakening extracellular matrix (ECM), and both nucleus pulposus (NP) swelling and loss of annulus fibrosus (AF) fiber alignment which are hypothesized to contribute to the increased risk of herniation when reloading is experienced. However, the limitations of current studies are also discussed. For example, human studies do not allow for invasive measures of the underpinning biochemical mechanisms, correlating animal model results to the human condition may be difficult, and cellular studies lack incorporation of ECM and other complexities that mimic the native IVD microarchitecture and environment. Moving forward, the use of three-dimensional organoid culture models that incorporate IVD-specific human cells, ECM, and signals as well as the development of cell- and ECM-level computational models may further improve our understanding of the impacts that spaceflight has on astronaut IVD health.Smith K, Mercuri J.

    "abstract": "AbstractBACKGROUND: Members of the public will soon be taking commercial suborbital spaceflights with significant Gx (chest-to-back) acceleration potentially reaching up to 6 Gx. Pulmonary physiology is gravity-dependent and is likely to be affected, which may have clinical implications for medically susceptible individuals.METHODS: During 2-min centrifuge exposures ranging up to 6 Gx, 11 healthy subjects were studied using advanced respiratory techniques. These sustained exposures were intended to allow characterization of the underlying pulmonary response and did not replicate actual suborbital G profiles. Regional distribution of ventilation in the lungs was determined using electrical impedance tomography. Neural respiratory drive (from diaphragm electromyography) and work of breathing (from transdiaphragmatic pressures) were obtained via nasoesophageal catheters. Arterial blood gases were measured in a subset of subjects. Measurements were conducted while breathing air and breathing 15 oxygen to simulate anticipated cabin pressurization conditions.RESULTS: Acceleration caused hypoxemia that worsened with increasing magnitude and duration of Gx. Minimum arterial oxygen saturation at 6 Gx was 86 1 breathing air and 79 1 breathing 15 oxygen. With increasing Gx the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient widened progressively and the relative distribution of ventilation reversed from posterior to anterior lung regions with substantial gas-trapping anteriorly. Severe breathlessness accompanied large progressive increases in work of breathing and neural respiratory drive.DISCUSSION: Sustained high-G acceleration at magnitudes relevant to suborbital flight profoundly affects respiratory physiology. These effects may become clinically important in the most medically susceptible passengers, in whom the potential role of centrifuge-based preflight evaluation requires further investigation.Pollock RD, Jolley CJ, Abid N, Couper JH, Estrada-Petrocelli L, Hodkinson PD, Leonhardt S, Mago-Elliott S, Menden T, Rafferty G, Richmond G, Robbins PA, Ritchie GAD, Segal MJ, Stevenson AT, Tank HD, Smith TG.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Current spacesuits are cumbersome and metabolically expensive. The use of robotic actuators could improve extravehicular activity performance. We propose a novel method to quantify the benefit of robotic actuators during planetary ambulation. METHODS: Using the OpenSim framework, we completed a biomechanical analysis of three walking conditions: unsuited, suited with the extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) spacesuit (represented as external joint torques applied to human joints), and suited with the EMU and assisted by robotic actuators capable of producing up to 10 Nm of torque. For each scenario, we calculated the inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics of the lower body joints (hip, knee, and ankle). We also determined the activation of muscles and robotic actuators (when present). Finally, from inverse dynamics and muscle activation results, the metabolic cost of one gait cycle was calculated in all three conditions. RESULTS: The moments of lower body joints increased due to the increased resistance to movement from the spacesuit. The additional torque increased the overall metabolic cost by 85 compared to the unsuited condition. The assistive robotic actuators were able to reduce the metabolic cost induced by EMU resistance by 15. DISCUSSION: Our model indicates that the majority of metabolic cost reduction can be attributed to the actuators located at the hip. The robotic actuators reduced metabolic cost similar to that of modern-day actuators used to improve walking. During a Mars mission, the actuators could save one crewmember up to 100,000 kilocal on one 539-d planetary expedition. Kluis L, Keller N, Bai H, Iyengar N, Shepherd R, Diaz-Artiles A.

International business travelers have an important role in economic growth; however, there is a lack of research investigating jet lag and jet-lag management in international business travelers. This study aimed to investigate international business travelers use of jet-lag countermeasures. METHODS: International business travelers from Australia (N = 107) participated in a survey examining use of jet-lag countermeasures (pharmacological and nonpharmacological). Chi-squared tests were conducted examining the association between duration of stay and traveling experience on jet-lag countermeasure use. RESULTS: Most subjects had traveled for business for less than 15 yr and 57% reported taking between 14 trips annually. Durations of stay averaged 10 d (SD 13 d). Nonpharmacological countermeasure use was high. Pharmacological countermeasure use was less common. There were no significant associations between duration of stay and countermeasure implementation. Travel experience was only associated with nonpharmacological countermeasures after arrival home. CONCLUSION: Education programs delivered through businesses would be beneficial for providing information on jet lag, its implications, and recommended countermeasures to travelers.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In-water resuscitation (IWR) is recommended in the 2010 guidelines of the European Resuscitation Council. As IWR represents a physical challenge to the rescuer, a novel Rescue Tube device with an integrated “Oxylator” resuscitator might facilitate IWR. The aim of the present study was the assessment of IWR using the novel Rescue Tube device. METHODS: Tidal and minute volumes were recorded using a modified Laerdal Resusci Anne mannequin. Furthermore, rescue time, water aspiration, submersions, and physical exertion were assessed. In this randomized cross-over trial, 17 lifeguards performed four rescue maneuvers over a 100-m distance in open water in random order: no ventilation (NV), mouth-to-mouth ventilation (MMV), Oxylator-aided mask ventilation (OMV), and Oxylator-aided laryngeal tube ventilation (OLTV). RESULTS: OLTV resulted in effective ventilation over the entire rescue distance with the highest mean minute volumes (NV 0, MMV 2.9, OMV 4.1, OLTV 7.6 L · min −1 ). NV was the fastest rescue maneuver while IWR prolonged the rescue maneuver independently of the method of ventilation (mean total rescue time: NV 217, MMV 280, OMV 292, OLTV 290 s). Aspiration of substantial amounts of water occurred only during MMV (mean NV 20, MMV 215, OMV 15, OLTV 6 ml). NV and OLTV were rated as moderately challenging by the lifeguards, whereas MMV and OMV were rated as substantially demanding on a 0-10 visual analog scale (NV 5.3, MMV 7.8, OMV 7.6, OLTV 5.9). DISCUSSION: The device might facilitate IWR by providing effective ventilation with minimal aspiration and by reducing physical effort. Another advantage is the possibility of delivering 100% oxygen.Lungwitz YP, Nussbaum BL, Paulat K, Muth C-M, Kranke P, Winkler BE. A novel rescue-tube device for in-water resuscitation .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: One disorienting movement pattern, common during flight, is the entering of a coordinated turn. While the otoliths persistently sense upright head position, the change in roll attitude constitutes a semicircular canal stimulus. This sensory conflict also arises during acceleration in a swing-out gondola centrifuge. From a vestibular viewpoint there are, however, certain differences between the two stimulus situations; the aim of the present study was to elucidate whether these differences are reflected in the perceived roll attitude. METHODS: Eight nonpilots were tested in a centrifuge (four runs) and during flight (two turns). The subjective visual horizontal (SVH) was measured using an adjustable luminous line in darkness. The centrifuge was accelerated from stationary to 1.56 G (roll 50°) within 7 s; the duration of the G plateau was 5 min. With the aircraft, turns with approximately 1.4 G (45°) were entered within 15 s and lasted for 5 min. Tilt perception (TP) was defined as the ratio of SVH/real roll tilt; initial and final values were calculated for each centrifugation/turn. RESULTS: In both systems there was a sensation of tilt that declined with time. The initial TP was (mean ± SD): 0.40 ± 0.27 (centrifuge) and 0.37 ± 0.30 (flight). The final TP was 0.20 ± 0.26 and 0.17 ± 0.19, respectively. Both initial and final TP correlated between the two conditions. CONCLUSION: The physical roll tilt is under-estimated to a similar degree in the centrifuge and aircraft. Also the correspondence at the individual level suggests that the vestibular dilemma of coordinated flight can be recreated in a lifelike manner using a gondola centrifuge.Tribukait A, Ström A, Bergsten E, Eiken O.

    "abstract": "Missions to terrestrial destinations (i.e., asteroids, the Moon, and Mars) will consist of physically challenging mission-critical tasks. These tasks, coupled with the negative physiological effects of prolonged microgravity exposure, create a plausible situation in which physical requirements may exceed an astronaut's physical capacity. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the association of aerobic fitness and muscular strength parameters with performance during two field tests designed to simulate upper-body mission-critical activities.There were 70 subjects who completed a material transport field test requiring the loading, transport, and unloading of geological samples and a device operations field test consisting of tasks associated with equipment set-up and the operations of controls and valves. The relationships between test duration and the following measurements were determined: running Vo(2max), gas exchange threshold (GET), speed at Vo(2max) (s-Vo(2max)), highest sustainable rate of aerobic metabolism [critical speed (CS)], and the finite distance that could be covered above CS (D'); and arm cranking Vo(2peak), GET, critical power (CP), and the finite work that can be performed above CP (W').CP (r = -0.66), CS (r = -0.56), and arm cranking Vo(2peak) (r = -0.54) were most strongly correlated with the material transport field test and decision tree analysis revealed CP as the best predictor of performance. For the device operations field test, CP (r = -0.70), CS (r = -0.62), and arm cranking peak power output (r = -0.56) were significant predictors.Arm cranking tests are strongly associated with upper-body dependent tasks, highlighting that the nature of mission tasks needs to be considered when evaluating astronaut physical capacity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Susceptibility of healthy astronauts to orthostatic hypotension and presyncope is exacerbated upon return from spaceflight. Up to 64% of astronauts experience postflight orthostatic intolerance. A promising countermeasure for postflight orthostatic intolerance is fluid loading by giving crew salt tablets and water prior to re-entry. The primary goal of the current study was to determine the optimal time window prior to re-entry when individual crewpersons would initiate fluid loading. METHODS: There were 16 subjects who were given two 6-h exposures, with and without fluid loading (conditions), to head-down tilt (HDT) to simulate the effects of microgravity. Pre- and post-HDT stand tests of orthostatic tolerance were given. Physiological measurements recorded included heart rate, blood pressure, peripheral blood volume, total peripheral resistance, and impedance cardiography. Echocardiography measures of stroke volume and cardiac output were also recorded. RESULTS: Data were analyzed with three-way repeated measures ANOVA (gender × condition × time). Only the condition × time interaction was significant for mean arterial pressure. Post hoc multiple comparison tests revealed significant increases in mean arterial pressure occurred between hours 1 and 3 of HDT after fluid loading (10 mmHg higher than no fluid). DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that the optimal time for crew to begin fluid loading is within 1 to 3 h prior to re-entry. Nonsignificant trends of multiple cardiovascular responses showed similar time profiles. The large amount of individual variability suggests that fluid loading alone may be an inadequate countermeasure for all crewmembers. Further research is needed on possible adjunct methods of tailoring countermeasures for individuals.Cowings P, Toscano W, Kanis D, Saicheur T, Ravikumar A, Gebreyesus F.

The ‘blue light hazard’ is considered a risk factor for retinal changes similar to those seen in macular degeneration. Previous studies ascertaining the prevalence of radiation related ocular disease in pilot cohorts have not considered use of solar eye protection. The aim of this study was to explore pilot use of sunglasses and other solar eye protection habits and to gain insight into the difficulties encountered managing sunlight on the flight deck. Additionally, the prevalence of radiation related ocular pathology in the study group was calculated. METHODS: A web based questionnaire was developed and administered to a large population of current UK professional pilots. RESULTS: There were 2917 respondents who completed the questionnaire, demonstrating a wide range of sunglass use during flight. A number of barriers to sunglass use were identified, the most prevalent being the requirement for corrective lenses to be used. Pilots most commonly increase sunglass use due to ocular health concerns. A high level of dissatisfaction with standard aircraft sun protection systems was reported. Long haul airline pilots were the highest users of nonstandard sunlight blocking strategies. No correlation between reported pathology and flying experience was found. DISCUSSION: The use of sunglasses during flight is complex; however, a number of practical recommendations can be made to increase the success for those pilots who wish to use sunglasses more. Aircraft manufacturers should consider how greater control of cockpit sunlight levels can be achieved.Chorley AC, Evans BJW, Benwell MJ. Solar eye protection practices of civilian aircrew .

    "abstract": "Prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the Indian population varies from 31.6 to 41.1%. Indians, without being conventionally obese, but inherently insulin resistant, have higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Since military aircrew, belonging to the same ethnic pool, may reflect similar prevalence of MetS as the general Indian populace, this study was undertaken to find the prevalence of MetS among Indian military aircrew using one candidate definition.In this cross sectional descriptive study, 210 military aircrew voluntarily participated. Besides demographic and lifestyle related details, their anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and skin fold thickness were recorded. Body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were deduced from the recorded measurements. Resting heart rate and blood pressure were recorded and appropriate laboratory investigations were undertaken.Prevalence of MetS, as per chosen definition, was 33.3% (N = 70), which had moderate, fair, and slight agreement with NCEP ATP III (k = 0.43), IDF (k = 0.27), and WHO (k = 0.15) definitions, respectively. Decadal prevalence of MetS was found to be highest in the fourth decade (46.8%), followed by the third decade (41.3%).Reported prevalence of MetS highlights an urgent need to define preventive strategies to minimize loss of trained manpower among military aircrew. Flight surgeons have an important role to play to educate aircrew about modifying their lifestyle to reduce morbidity and mortality among themselves in the future.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This is a cross-sectional observational study to investigate the safety and feasibility of integrating changing body positions and physical activity in a hypoxic challenge test (HCT). The secondary objective was to compare oxygen saturation (S p o 2 ) in two different locations (forehead and finger). METHODS: Included were 12 pediatric to young adult patients with congenital heart ( N = 7) or lung disease ( N = 5). An HCT was performed using breathing room air (21% oxygen) while sitting and breathing a normobaric hypoxic gas mixture (15% oxygen) through a facemask while seated, lying supine, standing, walking 3 km/h, and walking 5 km/h in a nonrandomized order. RESULTS: All patients, except one, successfully passed the HCT. Three patients reported symptoms, possibly related to hypoxia. Median S p o 2 during the HCT decreased in all body positions compared with room air. In 9/12 (finger oximeter) vs. 6/12 (forehead oximeter) patients S p o 2 decreased below 90% in one or more body positions at rest. In 11/12 (finger oximeter) vs. 3/12 (forehead oximeter) patients S p o 2 decreased below 90% during mild exercise. There was no significant difference in S p o 2 between the different body positions. However, patients desaturated significantly more during mild exercise (walking 3km/h and 5 km/h). S p o 2 % measured at the forehead gave significantly higher values compared to the index finger. DISCUSSION: HCT is safe and feasible in children and adolescents with congenital heart or lung disease, and gives additional information about oxygenation during physical activity in addition to resting conditions. Simulated hypoxia of 8202 ft (2500 m) induced a small but significant decrease in S p o 2 %.Spoorenberg ME, Hulzebos EHJ, Takken T.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As NASA and private spaceflight companies push forward with plans for missions to cis-lunar and interplanetary space, the risk of surgical emergency increases. At latencies above 500 ms, telesurgery is not likely to be successful, so near-real-time telementoring is a more viable option. We examined the effect of a 700-ms time delay on the performance of first year surgical residents on a simulated task requiring significant feedback from a mentor in a pilot study.METHODS: A simulated surgical task requiring precision and accuracy with built-in error detection was used. Each resident underwent two trials, one with a mentor in the same room and one with the mentor using a teleconference with time delay. Outcomes measured included time to complete task, game pieces successfully removed, number of errors, and scores on the NASA Task Load Index by both mentor and operator. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests.RESULTS: The time delay group removed significantly fewer pieces successfully than the real time group (3.0 vs. 1.6, P = 0.02). There was no difference in the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) scores for the operators between the two groups, but the mentor reported significantly higher scores on Mental Demand (5.6 vs. 12.0, P = 0.04) and Effort (6.2 vs. 11.8, P = 0.05) during the time-delayed trials.DISCUSSION: A 750-ms time delay significantly degraded performance on the task. Though operator TLX scores were not affected, mentor TLX scores indicated significantly increased mental load. Telementoring is viable, but more onerous than in-person mentoring.Kamine TH, Smith BW, Fernandez GL. Impact of time delay on simulated operative video telementoring: a pilot study.

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of barodontalgia and dental barotrauma among French civilian scuba divers. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional internet-based survey was conducted among French scuba divers over 18 yr of age registered by the French Federation of Underwater Sports (FFESSM). The online questionnaire was distributed from October to December 2020. It contained questions regarding general characteristics of participants, barodontalgia and dental barotrauma occurrences, and relationship of the diver with his/her dentist. RESULTS: There were 684 scuba divers (65.4% men; aged 48 ± 12 yr) who participated in the study. Barodontalgia was reported by 18.7%, with some respondents reporting more than one episode. Most barodontalgia affected posterior (81.2%) and upper teeth (55.2%) with dental filling (50.0%). At least one dental barotrauma was reported by 10.1% of respondents, including mainly loss or fracture of a dental filling (4.2%). The occurrence of dental barotrauma was significantly higher among men (12.3%) than women (5.9%) and increased significantly with the age, the years of diving and the diving qualification.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neuro-ophthalmic findings collectively defined as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) are one of the leading health priorities in astronauts engaging in long duration spaceflight or prolonged microgravity exposure. Though multifactorial in etiology, similarities to terrestrial idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) suggest these changes may result from an increase or impairing in intracranial pressure (ICP). Finding a portable, accessible, and reliable method of monitoring ICP is, therefore, crucial in long duration spaceflight. A review of recent literature was conducted on the biomedical literature search engine PubMed using the search term “non-invasive intracranial pressure”. Studies investigating accuracy of noninvasive and portable methods were assessed. The search retrieved different methods that were subsequently grouped by approach and technique. The majority of publications included the use of ultrasound-based methods with variable accuracies. One of which, noninvasive ICP estimation by optical nerve sheath diameter measurement (nICP_ONSD), presented the highest statistical correlation and prediction values to invasive ICP, with area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.75 to 0.964. One study even considers a combination of ONSD with transcranial Doppler (TCD) for an even higher performance. Other methods, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), show positive and promising results [good statistical correlation with invasive techniques when measuring cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP): r = 0.83]. However, for its accessibility, portability, and accuracy, ONSD seems to present itself as the up to date, most reliable, noninvasive ICP surrogate and a valuable spaceflight asset.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tactical aviators require administration of enhanced inspired oxygen concentrations (hyperoxia) to reduce risk of hypobaric hypoxia and decompression injuries. Hyperoxia is not without consequence; it reduces cerebral perfusion (CBF). Characterizing the relationship between F I O 2 and CBF is necessary to establish F I O 2 levels that do not reduce CBF yet are sufficient to mitigate risk of in-flight physiological stressors. To achieve that goal, this study’s objective was to determine whether a dose-response relationship exists between F I O 2 and CBF and, if so, the F I O 2 at which CBF significantly declines. METHODS: Healthy male and female subjects ( N = 26) were randomized to receive either low dose F I O 2 of 30%, 40%, 50%, and 100% (Arm 1) or high dose F I O 2 of 60%, 70%, 80%, and 100% (Arm 2), followed by a return to 21% for both groups. Subjects were placed within a 3-Tesla MRI scanner equipped with pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling software (pCASL) to measure CBF. Baseline CBF measurements were obtained during exposure to 21% F I O 2 , with subsequent CBF measurements obtained at each predetermined F I O 2 level. RESULTS: Baseline CBF did not differ between subjects in Arm 1 and Arm 2. Low dose F I O 2 ≤ 50% did not affect CBF. In contrast, high dose F I O 2 ≥ 60% significantly reduced CBF. Exposure to 100% F I O 2 led to similar reductions of CBF for subjects in both Arm 1 and Arm 2. DISCUSSION: The neurovascular system appears to respond to increasing F I O 2 levels in a dose dependent manner, with significant reductions in CBF with F I O 2 exposures ≥ 60%.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In-flight medical emergencies (IME) are challenging situations: aircraft cabins are noisy and narrow, medical supplies are scarce, and high-altitude related physiological changes may worsen chronic respiratory or cardiac conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which anesthetist-intensivists and emergency physicians are aware of IME specificities.METHODS: A questionnaire containing 21 items was distributed to French anesthetist-intensivists and emergency physicians between January and May 2020 using the mailing list of the French Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine and the French Society of Emergency Medicine. The following topics were evaluated: high-altitude related physiological changes, medical and human resources available inside commercial aircraft, common medical incidents likely to happen on board, and previous personal experiences.RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 1064 physicians. The items corresponding to alterations in the arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and heart rate at cruising altitude were answered correctly by less than half of the participants (respectively, 3%, 42%, and 44% of the participants). Most responders (83%) were interested in a complementary training on IME management.DISCUSSION: The present study illustrates the poor knowledge in the medical community of the physiological changes induced by altitude and their consequences. In addition to offering specific theoretical courses to the medical community, placing sheets in commercial aircraft summarizing the optimal management of the main emergencies likely to happen on board might be an interesting tool.Diop S, Birnbaum R, Cook F, Mounier R.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The extravehicular activity suit currently used by the United States in space includes a liquid cooling and ventilation garment (LCVG) that controls thermal conditions. Previously, we demonstrated that self-perspiration for evaporative cooling (SPEC) garment effectively lowers skin temperature without raising humidity in the garment. However, the cooling effect is delayed until a sufficient dose of water permeates and evaporates. In the present study, we hypothesized that wearer-controlled vaporization improves the cooling effect. METHODS: Six healthy subjects rode a cycle ergometer under loads of 30, 60, 90, and 120 W for durations of 3 min each. Skin temperature and humidity on the back were measured continuously. Subjects wore and tested three garments: 1) a spandex garment without any cooling device (Normal); 2) a simulated LCVG (s-LCVG) or spandex garment knitted with a vinyl tube for flowing and permeating water; and 3) a garment that allowed wearer-controlled vaporization (SPEC-W). RESULTS: The use of s-LCVG reduced skin temperature by 1.57 ± 0.14°C during 12 min of cooling. Wearer-controlled vaporization of the SPEC-W effectively and significantly lowered skin temperature from the start to the end of cycle exercise. This decrease was significantly larger than that achieved using s-LCVG. Humidity in the SPEC-W was significantly lower than that in s-LCVG. DISCUSSION: This preliminary study suggests that SPEC-W is effective in lowering skin temperature without raising humidity in the garment. The authors think it would be useful in improving the design of a cooling system for extravehicular activity.Tanaka K, Nagao D, Okada K, Nakamura K.

    "abstract": "General aviation (GA) accidents have continued to demonstrate high fatality rates. Recently, ballistic parachute recovery systems (BPRS) have been introduced as a safety feature in some GA aircraft. This study evaluates the effectiveness and associated factors of the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) at reducing the odds of a fatal accident in Cirrus aircraft crashes.Publicly available Cirrus aircraft crash reports were obtained from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database for the period of January 1, 2001-December 31, 2016. Accident metrics were evaluated through univariate and multivariate analyses regarding odds of a fatal accident and use of the parachute system.Included in the study were 268 accidents. For CAPS nondeployed accidents, 82 of 211 (38.9%) were fatal as compared to 8 of 57 (14.0%) for CAPS deployed accidents. After controlling for all other factors, the adjusted odds ratio for a fatal accident when CAPS was not deployed was 13.1.The substantial increased odds of a fatal accident when CAPS was not deployed demonstrated the effectiveness of CAPS at providing protection of occupants during an accident. Injuries were shifted from fatal to serious or minor with the use of CAPS and postcrash fires were significantly reduced. These results suggest that BPRS could play a significant role in the next major advance in improving GA accident survival.Alaziz M, Stolfi A, Olson DM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intermittent artificial gravity (AG) training over days and weeks has been shown to improve the human orthostatic tolerance limit (OTL) and improve cardiovascular regulation in response to orthostatic stress. Effects of a single AG exposure are currently unknown. METHODS: We tested cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress in 16 hypovolemic subjects (9 men and 7 women), once following a single, short (∼90 min) bout of AG and once following a similar period of head-down bed rest (HDBR). Hypovolemia was produced by intravenous furosemide infusion (20 mg) and orthostatic stress was produced by combined 70° head-up tilt (HUT) and progressively increasing lower body negative pressure until symptoms of presyncope developed. To assess reflex-induced changes in cardiovascular regulation, heart rate and blood pressure variability were analyzed by spectral analysis and baroreflex activity was evaluated by transfer function analysis. RESULTS: Compared to HDBR, a short AG exposure increased men’s low frequency (0.04–0.15 Hz) power of systolic blood pressure (SBP LF ), but did not change women’s SBP LF responses to orthostatic stress. In response to 70° HUT, compared to supine, low frequency phase delay (Phase LF ) between systolic blood pressure and RR intervals increased by ∼20% following HDBR, but did not change following AG, reflecting improved baroreflex activity at a milder level of orthostatic stress after AG. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a short bout of AG increased both sympathetic and baroreflex responsiveness to orthostatic stress in hypovolemia-induced, cardiovascular-deconditioned men and women, which may contribute to the AG-induced improvement of OTL shown in our previous reports.Zhang Q, Evans JM, Stenger MB, Moore FB, Knapp CF.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The neurocognitive effects of acute hypobaric hypoxia are still largely unknown. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that executive control, an important component of cognition, is especially vulnerable to hypoxia. METHOD: Subjects participated in a simulated hypobaric chamber flight to 5500 m. Four auditory tasks were presented before, during, and after hypoxia: 1) Voice, and 2) Name variant of the Stroop task (both measuring conflict resolution); 3) go/no-go task (GNG; measuring inhibition); and 4) two-choice reaction time task (CRT; which is a noninhibitory control task). RESULTS: The Stroop effect increased during hypoxia: in the Voice Stroop it increased from 49.4 to 83.6 ms for reaction time and from 4.1 to 12.3% for accuracy; in the Name Stroop from 43.5 to 82.9 ms for reaction time (accuracy remained unchanged). Accuracy declined from 82.3 to 75.0% in CRT, and from 85.8 to 77.5% (averaged over stimulus types) in the GNG task. Importantly, accuracy decreased similarly to go and no-go stimuli in the GNG task, revealing unaffected inhibition. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that tasks requiring conflict resolution are more likely to be impaired than tasks requiring inhibition of response. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the distinct nature of inhibitory control functions. Takács E, Czigler I, Pató LG, Balázs L .

METHODS: This study was a longitudinal, retrospective cohort analysis of audiogram records for Air Force aviation-related personnel on active duty during calendar year 2013 without a diagnosis of non-noise-related hearing loss. The outcomes of interest were raw change in hearing sensitivity from initial baseline to 2013 audiogram and initial occurrence of a significant threshold shift (STS) and non-H1 audiogram profile. Potential predictor variables included age and elapsed time in cohort for each audiogram, gender, and Air Force Specialty Code. Random forest analyses conducted on a learning sample were used to identify relevant predictor variables. Mixed effects models were fitted to a separate validation sample to make statistical inferences. RESULTS: The final dataset included 167,253 nonbaseline audiograms on 10,567 participants. Only the interaction between time since baseline audiogram and age was significantly associated with raw change in hearing sensitivity by STS metric. None of the potential predictors were associated with the likelihood for an STS. Time since baseline audiogram, age, and their interaction were significantly associated with the likelihood for a non-HI hearing profile. DISCUSSION: In this study population, age and elapsed time since baseline audiogram were modestly associated with decreased hearing sensitivity and increased likelihood for a non-H1 hearing profile.

Medical triage capabilities for mishaps involving pulmonary conditions have not been systematically reviewed. Recent studies have advocated the use of point-of-care ultrasound to screen for lung injury or illness. The operational utility of portable ultrasound systems in disaster relief and other austere settings may be relevant to commercial spaceflight. METHODS: A systematic review of published literature was conducted concerning the use of point-of-care pulmonary ultrasound techniques in austere environments, including suggested examination protocols for triage and diagnosis. RESULTS: Recent studies support the utility of pulmonary ultrasound examinations when performed by skilled operators, and comparability of the results to computed tomography and chest radiography for certain conditions, with important implications for trauma management in austere environments. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary injury and illness are among the potential health risks facing spaceflight participants. Implementation of point-of-care ultrasound protocols could aid in the rapid diagnosis, triage, and treatment of such conditions. Though operator-dependent, ultrasound, with proper training, experience, and equipment, could be a valuable tool in the hands of a first responder supporting remote spaceflight operations.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rotary wing pilot neck strain is increasing in prevalence due to the combined effects of head supported mass (e.g., Night Vision Goggles, head mounted displays) and whole-body vibration. This study examined the physiological responses of pilots during exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) representative of the National Research Council’s Bell 412 helicopter in forward flight. WBV levels were measured and evaluated using the ISO-2631-1-1997 WBV standards. METHODS: Twelve pilots (aged 20–59 yr, 7 of the 12 with 20+ years flight experience) underwent six 15-min vibration trials on a human rated shaker platform. Participants were exposed to three vibration levels (-25%, normal, and +25% amplitude; Levels 1–3, respectively) while seated on an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or vibration mitigating (MIT) cushion. Upper back and neck electromyography (EMG) and acceleration were continuously recorded. RESULTS: Normalized EMG amplitude was higher using the OEM compared to the MIT during Level 2 (0.18 vs. -0.27) and Level 3 (0.24 vs. -0.14) for the anterior neck muscles. Health weighted vibration amplitude at the head (Mean of 3 levels: OEM = 1.19 and MIT = 1.11 m · s −2 ) was larger than the vibration amplitude at the seat (Mean of 3 levels: OEM = 0.77 and MIT = 0.70 m · s −2 ). DISCUSSION: The amplification of head vibration relative to the seat, and the significant effects of vibration level, as well as the vibration mitigation cushion, on neck EMG amplitude support the need for revisions to the ISO-2631-1 standard to account for the head and neck response to whole-body vibration.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to examine which marker or testing protocols have been suggested for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment in asymptomatic populations, at which CVD risk level, and how this can be implemented for CVD risk assessment in pilot populations. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using Systematic Reviews Subset on PubMed; the OvidSP interface, including all EBM reviews and EMBASE databases; and the G-I-N International Guideline Library. From each recommendation, we extracted data on consideration of the use of a marker or test for cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic populations. RESULTS: Included were 45 guidelines, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses relevant to cardiovascular risk assessment in asymptomatic populations. The majority (9/12) of the citations recommend coronary artery calcium score (CACS) for CVD risk assessment in intermediate-risk (10-yr CVD risk score of 10–20%) asymptomatic adults. Other cardiac and vascular tests that may also be considered include the measurements of carotid-intima media thickness, supplemented by carotid plaque, and the ankle brachial index for prevention of peripheral artery disease and stroke. Stress myocardial perfusion scan is the potential cardiac functional test to be used with pilots with 5-yr risk of ≥15%. Among laboratory markers, only hs-CRP has a potency to be used in CVD risk assessment in intermediate-risk asymptomatic adults; however, the strength of the recommendation is not adequate. DISCUSSION: Among the cardiac and vascular testing available, CACS is the most frequently suggested test. The implications of findings for CVD risk assessment in airline pilots are highlighted in this paper. Wirawan IMA, Griffiths RF, Larsen PD.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While respiratory muscle fatigue is present following load carriage activity at sea level, the effect of environmental conditions on respiratory strength while undertaking load carriage is unknown. METHODS: The effect of thoracic load carriage during walks (5.5 km) in four environments [(thermo-neutral sea level (SL), −10°C (C), 4300 m (H) and 4300 m at −10°C (HC)] was evaluated on respiratory muscle fatigue. Ten subjects completed eight self-paced randomized treadmill walks comprising a variety of gradients, unloaded and loaded (18.2 kg), across the four environments. Respiratory muscle strength was measured via maximal inspiratory pressure (P Imax ) and expiratory pressure (P Emax ) assessments. RESULTS: Submaximal walking in HC elicited respiratory muscle fatigue when compared to SL. Inspiratory muscle fatigue was independent of load. The relative change in P Imax from baseline was significantly greater in HC compared to SL (9.6% vs. 1.3%). P Emax showed a significant reduction during HC (−22.3 cmH 2 O, −14.4%) when compared to the other three environments. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the need to focus on respiratory muscle strength in preparation for exercise in cold hypoxic conditions. Hinde K, Low C, Lloyd R, Cooke C.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans of U.S. Air Force (USAF) altitude workers show increased white matter hyperintensities (WMH) that appear related to decompression stress. Relevant exposure thresholds are unknown. This MRI survey compares the white matter status of UK participants (UKP) in altitude chamber research and training with USAF cohorts having background and increased WMH. METHODS: UKP ( N = 20) comprised 13 research subjects and 7 military altitude chamber instructors ages 33 to 50 yr (16 men, 4 women), encompassing 1417 decompressions over a 15,000-ft (4572 m) pressure altitude (range 11–189; median 50). High resolution MRI reproduced USAF sequences and data were analyzed at the University of Maryland to validate comparison with age-matched USAF control (DOC; N = 85) and aerospace operational physiologist (PHY; N = 55) cohorts. RESULTS: UKP data are dichotomous: 17 subjects (85%) had normal scans (total 19 WMH) and three outliers had excess (&gt;15) WMH (total of 83 lesions). WMH were not associated with metrics of decompression history (total exposures, rapid decompression, pressure breathing, hypoxia familiarization, decompression sickness, or exposure intensity). Ranked data indicate that UKP have fewer WMH than PHY but not DOC. UKP outliers’ excess WMH are attributable to past mild traumatic brain injury. CONCLUSIONS: WMH in UKP are unrelated to subjects’ low intensity (brief, infrequent) experience of altitude chamber decompression, encompassing occasional hypobaric hypoxia and mild decompression sickness, even with cumulative experience over many years. Such low intensity hypobaric exposure appears ‘subthreshold’ for promotion of WMH. Connolly DM, Lee VM, Hodkinson PD. White matter status of participants in altitude chamber research and training .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Airlines are required to monitor the effectiveness of their pilot fatigue risk management. The present survey sought the views of all pilots at Delta Air Lines on fatigue-related issues raised by their colleagues participating in regular airline safety audits. METHODS: All 13,217 pilots from 9 aircraft fleets were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. Questions related to aspects of scheduling, fatigue mitigations, and fatigue safety culture. RESULTS: There were 1108 pilots who completed the survey (response rate = 8.4%). On 7/9 fleets, most pilots thought 5- to 7-d rotations were too long (exceptions: B747, median = 14 d; A330 median = 8.5 d). In the previous year, on average across all fleets, 60.6% of pilots had worked up to or beyond their personal rotation limit (minimum, B747 = 6.3%; maximum, MD88/90 = 75.9%). Rotations where duty periods start progressively earlier were considered highly fatiguing by 73.8% of pilots, compared to 14.7% for rotations where duty periods started progressively later and 1.6% for rotations with successive duty periods starting at the same time. The median optimum break length between rotations was 3-4 d. On 7/9 fleets, fewer than 20% of pilots tried to build their monthly schedules with back-to-back rotations (exceptions: B747, 43.8%; A330, 34.3%). Awareness of fatigue and perceptions of company fatigue risk management activities varied widely among fleets. DISCUSSION: The findings identify possible improvements in fatigue risk management and highlight that care is needed when extrapolating from one operational context to another. As a safety assurance exercise, we recommend repeating the survey biannually, or sooner if warranted by specific circumstances. Gander P, Mangie J, Phillips A, Santos-Fernandez E, Wu LJ.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the reproducibility of two portable, self-administered autorefractors (Netra and SVOne Pro) to assess the time course of visual changes on the ISS. METHODS: We measured cycloplegic refractive error at 5 visits at least a week apart in 13 subjects (6 women, 7 men, 30 ± 9 yr) using both devices seated and also prone with lower body positive pressure (LBPP) applied. Axial length was measured with an optical biometer. Subjects completed a questionnaire on device preferences. RESULTS: The SVOne seated intrasession reproducibility coefficient (RPC) was 0.37 diopters (D), while the Netra’s was 0.41 D. Intersession seated results were: RPC = 0.67 D for the SVOne and RPC = 0.54 D for the Netra. The average seated to prone LBPP differences were significantly different from zero for both the SVOne and Netra. The SVOne was preferred in four out of five categories on the questionnaire and took half the time to complete a measurement set compared to the Netra. DISCUSSION: Users preferred the SVOne and it took less time. An SVOne refraction change of 0.67 D from baseline would happen by chance less than 5% of the time. If multiple separate measurements were taken, the detection limit could be reduced (e.g., three repeated measurements could reduce it to 0.38 D). Since astronauts with visual changes show spherical equivalent changes of 0.5 to 1.0 D, in-flight autorefractors could help determine the time course of refractive changes in space from which changes in axial length could be inferred.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Orientation in a 3-dimensional environment increases demands on the vestibular system. The anterior, lateral, and posterior semicircular canals sense pitch, roll, and yaw acceleration, respectively. The macular end organs sense linear acceleration and provide gravity reference. Creatures that evolved to fly (birds) share the same sensory systems and probably the same limitations as creatures that did not evolve to fly. However, bird semicircular canals have been noted for their large size relative to body mass since 1907. METHODS: A brief literature review was conducted regarding the morphological structure of the vestibular systems in birds, and their evolutionary and functional significance as compared to that in humans. RESULTS: For any given body mass, qualitatively more “agile” species have semicircular canals with larger radius of curvature. Specifically, the anterior and lateral canals were found to be preferentially larger than those of nonavian theropods and humans. Avian canals rarely approach circularity and all three canals typically undergo torsional excursions out of their respective planes. DISCUSSION: Increase in the length of the semicircular canal is associated with greater sensitivity to rotational stimuli. Highly maneuverable birds of prey have the largest overall canal dimensions relative to body mass, most plausibly to match the rapid body rotations that characterize variable speed maneuvering during pursuit. By comparison, the semicircular canals in humans are relatively smaller and lack the adaptive morphological asymmetry in agile flying species. This teleological symmetry may present another inherent but less understood vestibular limitation during aerobatic maneuvers, which could lead to spatial disorientation. Cheung B, Ercoline W.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A review of decompression sickness (DCS) cases associated with the NASA altitude physiological training (APT) program at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) motivated us to place our findings into the larger context of DCS prevalence from other APT centers. METHODS: We reviewed JSC records from 1999 to 2016 and 14 publications from 1968 to 2004 about DCS prevalence in other APT programs. We performed a meta-analysis of 15 APT profiles (488 cases / 385,116 exposures). We used meta-regression to evaluate the relation between estimated exposures and probability of DCS in a test group, accounting for the heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: Our in-house review identified 6 Type I DCS (1 from an inside observer) and 1 Type II DCS. There were 6 cases in 9560 student hypobaric exposures from 3 NASA training flights; a student pooled prevalence rate of 0.44 cases / 1000 exposures compared to 1.44 cases / 1000 from 12 published APT profiles. The overall pooled DCS prevalence rate was 1.16 cases / 1000 exposures. There was substantial heterogeneity in DCS prevalence across studies. Denitrogenation time, exposure pressure, and exposure time were associated with probability of DCS in the meta-regression model. CONCLUSIONS: While the overall DCS prevalence rate is relatively low, there is marked heterogeneity among profiles. The pooled DCS prevalence rate estimate for the NASA profiles was lower than the overall rate. Variability in APT profile DCS prevalence could be further explained given student level and additional test-level covariates.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Performing at high altitude and scuba diving impose functional limitations to the respiratory system and impair exercise performance compared to normobaria. At altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced, which decreases arterial oxygen saturation and exercise performance. Falling arterial oxygen saturation results in hyperventilation and increased pulmonary ventilation. Diving poses unique effects on the respiratory system. The work of breathing is increased from marked increased airway resistance, static lung load, and hydrostatic pressure from the water on the thoracic wall. Both altitude and diving increase the work and energy cost of breathing, resulting in respiratory muscle fatigue. Respiratory muscle training (RMT) has been employed to target the deleterious effects on the respiratory system and exercise capacity. Although the literature is sparse, RMT has been reported to decrease the work and energy cost of breathing and improve pulmonary ventilation, respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function, and exercise capacity. This narrative review summarizes what is currently known about RMT for exercise performance at altitude and in diving, including potential mechanisms and outlines gaps in the literature.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prior research suggests there may be gender differences with regards to hypoxia resilience. Our study was designed to determine whether there were differences between genders in neuronal electrical activity at simulated altitude and whether those changes correlated with cognitive and aviation performance decrements. METHODS: There were 60 student Naval Aviators or Flight Officers who completed this study (30 women, 30 men). Participants were exposed to increasing levels of normobaric hypoxia and monitored with dry EEG while flying a fixed-base flight simulation. Gender differences in brainwave frequency power were quantified using MATLAB. Changes in flight and cognitive performance were analyzed via simulation tasks and with a cognitive test validated under hypoxia. RESULTS: Significant decreases in theta and gamma frequency power occurred for women compared to men with insidious hypoxic exposures to 20K, with an average frequency power decrease for women of 19.4% compared to 9.3% for men in theta, and a 42.2% decrease in gamma for women compared to 21.7% for men. Beta frequency power correlated highest between genders, with an average correlation coefficient of r = 0.95 across seven channels. DISCUSSION: Results of this study suggest there is identifiable brain wave suppression for both men and women with hypoxic exposure and, moreover, there are significant differences in this suppression between genders. Beta frequency power was most sensitive for both genders and highly correlative compared to other brainwave frequencies. The implications of these findings are important considerations for next-generation aviation helmets, which may employ this technology as an early warning mechanism.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Federal Aviation Administration Office of Aerospace Medicine (AAM) is required by law to identify pilots who have driving under the influence (DUI) convictions. It is the responsibility of AAM to determine, based on the DUI, if the pilot has a drinking problem and needs follow-up treatment. Pilots with alcohol problems are at risk to themselves and the public and need to have treatment to reduce the extent of the risk. It has been suggested by some that a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.15 g · dL −1 is evidence of tolerance and the pilot should be placed in an alcohol treatment program. METHOD: The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) Clinician’s Guide considers a person at risk for a drinking problem when a man drinks 5 or more drinks or a woman drinks 4 or more drinks in a day and reaches a 0.08 g · dL −1 of ethanol in the blood. It is possible to estimate from a BAC or breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) the number of drinks consumed using the volume of distribution for ethanol and the weight of the individual. A spread sheet tool was developed to estimate the number of drinks consumed. RESULTS: It was determined that DUI/DWI concentrations could be used to determine the minimum number of drinks consumed. Overweight people reach binge drinking levels and higher Hingson levels at lower DUI/DWI concentrations than people with an average weight or lower. DISCUSSION: Using this tool there is a high probability (99.7%) of identifying a true binge drinker. Canfield DV, Forster EM, Cheong Z-I, Cowan JM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Spaceflight can strain astronaut physical, physiological, and mental well-being, whereas maintaining astronaut operational performance remains an essential goal. Although various cognitive tests have been used for spaceflight assessment, these have been challenged on their lack of operational relevance. METHODS: To address this gap, we developed and characterized the Robotic On-Board Trainer for Research (ROBoT-r) system, based on the Robotic On-Board Trainer (ROBoT) currently used for astronaut training on Canadarm2 track-and-capture activities. The task requires use of dual hand-controllers (6 degrees of freedom) to grapple an incoming vehicle in free-drift in a time-limited setting. After developing a platform for conducting research studies, characterization testing of ROBoT-r was completed by 14 astronaut-like volunteers (35 ± 11 yr; N = 5 women) over 16 sessions each. RESULTS: We describe the design and capabilities of the ROBoT-r system for conducting operationally relevant research on human performance. Version 6.2 of the system supports H-II Transfer Vehicle track-and-capture operations within a multimillion component, physics-enabled 3D model using NASA’s DOUG graphics platform. It has configurable task initialization and auto-run capabilities, saves 38 variables continuously at 20 Hz throughout each run, provides the user quantitative feedback after each run, and provides summaries after each session. Detailed performance characterization data is reported for future experimental planning purposes. DISCUSSION: ROBoT-r’s range of performance variables enables detailed and quantitative performance assessment. Its use in spaceflight will help provide insight into operational performance, as well as allowing investigators to compare these results with more traditional cognitive tests to help better understand the interaction between individual cognitive abilities and operational performance.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: UK Royal Air Force fast jet aircrew use three different anti-G systems, however, little objective comparison of the G protection they provide exists. The G-protection afforded by each system and associated hemodynamic responses were investigated. METHODS: Ten subjects performed centrifuge acceleration exposures using Mk-10 (S1) and Mk-4 (S2) five-bladder anti-G trousers (AGT) and full coverage AGT plus pressure breathing for G-protection (PBG; S3). Measurements of relaxed G tolerance (RGT), eye-level blood pressure (BP eye ), lower body blood volume (LBV), stroke volume (SV) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were made during gradual onset runs (GOR) and rapid onset runs (ROR). The subjective effort required to maintain clear vision at +7 and +8 G z provided an indication of the protection provided by the system. RESULTS: All systems moderated decreases in SV and BP eye and increases in LBV under increased +G z . S3 provided the greatest mean RGT during GOR (+6.2 G z ) and ROR (+6 G z ), reduced the effort required to maintain clear vision at up to +8 G z , prevented venous pooling and afforded the greatest rise in TPR. The majority of indices revealed no difference between S1 and S2 although RGT during the ROR was greater with S2 (+0.25 G z ). DISCUSSION: S3 effectively prevented pooling of blood in the lower limbs under +G z , despite the use of PBG, and offers an advantage over five-bladder AGT. Given the similarities of S1 and S2, it was unsurprising that the majority of indices measured were similar. The objective measurement of hemodynamic parameters provides useful information for comparing the G-protection provided by anti-G systems.

All cadets are required to pass a physical fitness test (3-km running, sit-ups, push-ups) and body composition test on a semiannual basis. Isokinetic muscle function (strength and endurance), +Gz test (+6 Gz ⋅ 30 s-1), and target gene (ACTN-3) were analyzed.RESULTS: The effects of body composition and physical fitness along with the relationship of the ACTN-3 genotype to the +6 Gz test results were determined. Consequently, no significant difference was found concerning the effect of ACTN-3 on the +6 Gz test result, body composition, and physical fitness; however, body fat (%) and isokinetic muscle strength (peak torque right leg extension and left leg flexion) showed significance between the pass and failure groups in the +Gz test.DISCUSSION: The cadets of the Korea Air Force Academy showed dominant fast genetic expression type based on their ACTN-3 genotype [RR and RX (N = 51, 75%) > XX (N = 17, 25%)]. Body fat (%) and isokinetic muscle strength (PT R EX, L FL) can be more effective predictors in the +6 Gz test for cadet training. Another speculation is that more RR- and RX-type-oriented training can promote cadets' Gz tolerance from the isokinetic factors such as high peak torque and low fatigue index.Shin S, Jee H.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) results from long-duration spaceflight and presents with a constellation of signs (e.g., optic disc edema, choroidal folds, globe flattening, refractive error shifts, etc.). Optic nerve tortuosity (ONT) has been detected in approximately 47% of astronauts after long-duration spaceflight but has not yet been fully analyzed. This review examines terrestrial ONT in order to better understand how the condition is caused and measured. METHODS: References were identified by PubMed and ScienceDirect searches covering 1955 to October 2018 using the terms “optic nerve tortuosity,” “optic nerve kinking,” “optic disc torsion,” “optic kinking,” and “ocular torsion.” Additional references were identified by searching relevant articles. RESULTS: ONT measurements have evolved and become more objective. One measure consists of meeting two criteria: 1) lack of optic nerve congruity in &gt;1 coronal section; and 2) subarachnoid space dilation. This “criteria measure” is objective, sensitive, and specific for determining the presence of tortuosity. Another measure is the tortuosity index, which offers additional benefits by measuring the degree of ONT, including the potential to track changes over time. There are numerous terrestrial ONT causes, including intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, neurofibromatosis, glaucoma, and progeria, among others. DISCUSSION: To accurately measure ONT, it is crucial to adhere to objective, standardized techniques. The tortuosity index offers the potential to measure intraindividual change in ONT. Among the varied conditions associated with ONT, one commonality is pressure change. The impact of intracranial pressure on the vascular system and vice versa may offer insight into what is occurring in space. Scott RA, Tarver WJ, Brunstetter TJ, Urquieta E.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of flight-related neck pain in all Royal Air Force (RAF) aircrew is 66% and 70% in UK fast-jet aircrew. The RAF Aircrew Conditioning Programme (ACP) has been designed to enhance pilot performance through reducing fatigue and strain injuries, particularly to the neck. Content validity of the ACP was assessed to determine the appropriateness for delivery to aircrew. METHODS: Six international medical experts reviewed level two of the ACP, which is delivered to student aircrew who have completed basic instruction in cervical spine stability, core stability and initial technique instruction for strength training. Content validity on overall exercise approach (5 items) and specific exercise session (24 items) was rated on a 4-point Likert-type ordinal scale for Relevance and Simplicity. Four reviewers had experience of delivering an exercise program to aircrew. The item-content validity index (I-CVI) was the proportion of experts rating an item/exercise as acceptable (score 3-4) while protocol-CVI was the average I-CVI across items. RESULTS: Of the suggested exercise sessions, 20 reached an excellent I-CVI (1.00) for Relevance (4 reached acceptable I-CVI (0.83)), and 21 reached an excellent I-CVI (1.00) for Simplicity (3 reached acceptable I-CVI (0.83)). Protocol-CVI for the ACP was excellent for Relevance (0.90) and good for Simplicit y (0.83). The need for sufficient supervision during the exercises was recommended for safe exercise execution and to maintain adherence. CONCLUSION: The ACP demonstrated excellent relevance for the target population. The aircrew require additional supervision with the more complex neck exercises to enhance simplicity with the ACP.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aerobatic flight is a challenge for the vestibular system, which is likely to lead to adaptive changes in the vestibular responses of pilots. We investigated whether aerobatic pilots, as individuals who experience intense vestibular stimulation, present modifications of the vestibular-ocular reflex, motion sickness susceptibility and intensity, visual vertical estimation, and visual dependence as compared to normal volunteers. METHODS: To evaluate vestibulo-ocular reflexes, eye movements were recorded with videonystagmography while subjects were rotated on a rotatory chair with the axis of rotation being vertical (canal-ocular reflex) or inclined to 17° (otolith-ocular reflex). Motion sickness was evaluated after the rotatory test using the Graybiel diagnostic criteria. General motion sickness susceptibility and visual field dependence were also evaluated. RESULTS: Averaged data did not show significant difference in canal-ocular reflex and otolith ocular-reflex between groups. However, a significant asymmetry in otolith-driven ocular responses was found in pilots (CW 0.50 ± 1.21° · s −1 vs. CCW 1.59 ± 1.12° · s −1 ), though visual vertical estimation was not altered in pilots and both groups were found field independent. Pilots were generally less susceptible to motion sickness (MSSQ scores: 2.52 ± 5.59 vs. 13.5 ± 11.36) and less affected by the nauseogenic stimulation (Graybiel diagnostic criteria 3.36 ± 3.81 vs. 8.39 ± 7.01). DISCUSSION: We did not observe the expected habituation in the group of aerobatic pilots. However, there was a significant asymmetry in the otolith-driven ocular responses in pilots, but not in the controls, which may result from the asymmetry in piloting protocols.

METHODS: We studied 179 male aircrew members (86 airplane pilots, 15 helicopter pilots and 78 transport aircrew) using bioimpedance. RESULTS: Airplane pilots (AP) had higher means than transport aircrew (TA) in height (179.56 cm vs . 173.90 cm), total body water (46.72 L vs . 42.96 L), intracellular body water (29.45 L vs . 26.89 L), extracellular body water (17.27 L vs . 16.07 L), proteins (12.72 kg vs . 11.63 kg), minerals (4.50 kg vs . 4.15 kg), soft lean mass (60.21 kg vs . 55.29 kg), fat free mass (63.95 kg vs . 58.74 kg), skeletal muscle mass (36.41 kg vs . 33.07 kg), and lower means in body mass index (24.01 kg vs . 25.49 kg), body fat mass (BFM) (13.53 kg vs . 18.81 kg) and percentage of body fat (PBF) (16.83 kg vs . 23.79 kg). Helicopter pilots also had significantly lower means in BFM (13.21 kg vs . 18.81 kg) and PBF (17.11 kg vs . 18.81 kg) than TA. DISCUSSION: The different types of activity between AP (active coping with G forces) and TA (inactive) during operational flights negatively affects the body composition of TA. These results suggest differences in aircrews training and job tasks. Specific training is needed for each unit: it should be individualized, prevent injuries, and be directed by qualified personnel.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Urinary calcium (Uca) levels in space reflect bone loss and kidney stone risk and could be measured using portable devices. This project evaluated the repeatability of Uca measurements to assess how many repeated measurements would be needed to detect significant urinary calcium elevations in space. METHODS: A total of six subjects collected 24-h urine samples weekly for 8 wk and took 500 mg of oral calcium carbonate and 400 IU of vitamin D daily in week 7 and 8. Uca concentration was analyzed using a calcein-based system. The effect of the intake of calcium and vitamin D on Uca levels and the correlation between first void concentration and 24-h mass were assessed with linear mixed effect models. The reproducibility coefficient (RPC) for Uca was determined using Bland-Altman analysis on pairs of measurements at different time points. RESULTS: Oral supplementation did not significantly affect 24-h mass. First void concentration correlated with 24-h mass. The 24-h mass RPCs were 167.0, 116.8, and 108.1 mg for 1-, 2-, and 3-wk average measurements. First void concentration RPCs were 90.6, 76.6, and 72.8 mg L 1 . Skylab astronauts 24-h mass increased by 88.9 76.0, 123.5 58.3, 142.2 56.5, and 159.9 83.4 mg after 1, 2, 3, and 4 wk in flight. DISCUSSION: Averaging multiple Uca measurements reduced variability effectively and allowed increases likely to be seen in space to be detected. Consecutive Uca measurements could be tracked over time in space to assess the effectiveness of the countermeasure program.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Circumstances in flight can adversely affect a pilots spatial abilities and lead to spatial disorientation (SD), increasing the potential for fatal accidents. To systematically understand the impact of SD, it is important to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze pilots flight performance and mental stress, and to verify the effectiveness of verbal reports (VR) in enabling pilots to deal with an SD situation. This study investigated the effects of VR execution and type of SD on flight performance and mental stress. METHODS: SD simulation experiments were conducted on 30 Air Force fighter pilots (15 in the VR group and 15 in the non-VR group) with electrocardiography (ECG) sensors attached. The pilots gave their VRs by immediately verbalizing their attention to instrument information and six potentially disorientating scenarios were implemented in each flight phase. Flight performance was analyzed using instructor evaluation and self-evaluation scores, and mental stress was measured using heart rate variability (HRV) and perceived distress score. RESULTS: In maintaining flight performance, the VR group, respectively, had 8% and 10% higher scores for altitude and speed than the non-VR group. The self-evaluation scores were lowest for Coriolis, while Graveyard Spin was scored lowest in the instructor evaluations. Regarding mental stress, the VR group tended to have higher HFs and lower LF/HF ratios among HRV measures than the non-VR group, and an 11% lower perceived distress score. The highest perceived distress score was for Coriolis. DISCUSSION: We suggest that pilots can be assisted to understand and overcome SD situations through VR. Kang Y, Yun MH, Kim S.

Cabin crewmembers (CCMs) are trained to provide first aid, but their effectiveness has not been appropriately studied. METHODS: IMEs occurring in the biggest airline of Greece were prospectively recorded during a 5-yr period (20142018) and categorized according to a symptom-based taxonomy. RESULTS: During the study period 990 IMEs were recorded corresponding to 16 IMEs for each million passengers or 1.8 IMEs for every thousand flights. The most frequent events were loss of consciousness (38.4%) followed by injuries (8.6%), gastrointestinal problems (8.3%), respiratory symptoms (7.3%), anxiety (5.7%), and burns (5.9%). Diversion was decided in 3% of the cases while death on board was rare (0.3% of events). CCMs responded in 33.5% of IMEs without assistance by a volunteer health professional, achieving a 97% success rate. DISCUSSION: IMEs are rare events and the majority can be treated with simple first aid measures. CCMs acting according to a simplified algorithm were very efficient in providing first aid. A standardized symptom-based IME form will assist in creating a reliable registry for further studies.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In Germany, the German Federal Police assess the performance of aviation security screeners on a regular basis. These so-called “reality tests” are unannounced examinations which aim to investigate whether airport screeners can detect forbidden items in hand luggage or attached to the body. Recent alarming results of such inspections showed clearly that the overall detection rate is in need of improvement. To achieve this, it is important to identify specific factors that influence general screening performance. This especially includes basic cognitive functions like visual screening, alertness, and divided attention, which have come more and more into focus in current fundamental research projects. This brief commentary points out critical factors, contributes background conditions in aviation security screening, and shows possible approaches for enhancement and optimization. Finally, the human aspect is discussed as not only being the weakest factor in security screening, but also one of major importance.Kruger JK, Suchan B.

    "abstract": "Many countries have hypergravity training centers using centrifuges for pilots to cope with a high gravity (G) environment. The high G training carries potential risk for the development of spinal injury. However, no studies evaluated the influence of centrifuge training on the spines of asymptomatic fighter pilots on a large scale.Study subjects were 991 male fighter pilots with high G training at one institution. Subject variables included information about physical characteristics, flight hours of pilots prior to the training, and G force exposure related factors during training. The two dependent variables were whether the pilots developed acute spinal injury after training and the severity of the injury (major/minor).The incidence of acute spinal injury after high G training was 2.3% (23 of 991 subjects). There were 19 subjects who developed minor injury and 4 subjects who developed a herniated intervertebral disc, which is considered a major injury. In multivariate analysis, only the magnitude of G force during training was significantly related to the development of acute spinal injury. However, there was no significant factor related to the severity of the injury.These results suggest that high G training could cause negative effects on fighter pilots' spines. The magnitude of G force during training seemed to be the most significant factor affecting the occurrence of acute spinal injury.",

METHODS: There were 10 Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Griffon pilots who participated in an in-flight investigation of a 3-dimensional conformal Helmet Display Tracking System (HDTS) and the BrownOut Symbology System (BOSS) aboard an Advanced System Research Aircraft. For each symbology system, pilots performed a two-stage departure followed by a single-stage approach. The presentation order of the two symbology systems was randomized across the pilots. Subjective measurements included situation awareness, mental effort, perceived performance, perceptual cue rating, NASA Task Load Index, and physiological response. Objective performance included aircraft speed, altitude, attitude, and distance from the landing point, control position, and control activity. Repeated measures analysis of variance and planned comparison tests for the subjective and objective responses were performed. RESULTS: For both maneuvers, the HDTS system afforded better situation awareness, lower workload, better perceptual cueing in attitude, horizontal and vertical translation, and lower overall workload index. During the two-stage departure, HDTS achieved less lateral drift from initial takeoff and hover, lower root mean square error (RMSE) in altitude during hover, and lower track error during the acceleration to forward flight. During the single-stage approach, HDTS achieved less error in lateral and longitudinal position offset from the landing point and lower RMSE in heading. DISCUSSION: In both maneuvers, pilots exhibited higher control activity when using HDTS, which suggested that more pertinent information was available to the pilots. Pilots preferred the HDTS system.Cheung B, Craig G, Steels B, Sceviour R, Cosman V, Jennings S, Holst P. In-flight study of helmet-mounted symbology system concepts in degraded visual environments .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Habitual exposure to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is expected, but it is not proven, to dull ventilatory sensitivity to co 2 by reducing hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) as it is expressed by the slope of the derived response curve (CO 2 sensitivity: V E /P et co 2 ). It was hypothesized that HCVR is decreased by repeated breath hold maximal efforts (RBHE) before and after apnea training in comparison with no training and the control condition. METHODS: Two groups of breath holders, a control (CBH) group and novices to breath hold activities (NBH), visited the laboratory on four different occasions. In the first visit, subjects performed a HCVR test, whereas in the second visit they completed five successive RBHE separated by 2-min intervals. Another HCVR test was performed 2 min after cessation of the last apnea. For the next 14 d, only the NBH group trained by performing daily five RBHE separated by 2-min intervals. Subsequently, in a third and a fourth condition, subjects repeated the experimental protocol of the second and first visit. RESULTS: Although breath hold time (BHT) increased after apnea training in the NBH group by 46%, CO 2 sensitivity slopes were not different among experimental conditions and groups (2.8 0.3, 2.9 0.4 L min 1 mmHg 1 in the CBH and 2.7 0.5, 2.7 0.3 L min 1 mmHg 1 in the NBH during the second and third visit, respectively). CONCLUSION: HCVR after five RBHE or 14 d of apnea training was not decreased despite the achieved BHT enhancement. Hypercapnic dullness of ventilation is a complex biological process which takes more than 14 d of training to develop.Bourdas DI, Tsakiris TS, Pavlakis KI, Triantafillou DV, Geladas ND.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Motion sickness is often provoked by oscillatory translational (linear) acceleration. For humans, motion frequencies around 0.2–0.3 Hz are the most provocative. A current explanation for this frequency band is that it spans a region of maximum ambiguity concerning the interpretation of vestibular signals. Below 0.2–0.3 Hz, linear accelerations are interpreted as ‘tilt’, whereas at higher frequencies accelerations are interpreted as ‘translation’, i.e., linear motion through space. This is termed the ‘tilt-translation’ hypothesis. However, the origin of this particular frequency range is unclear. We investigated whether the differential perceptions of oscillations at different frequencies derives from the biodynamics of active self-initiated whole body motion. METHODS: Video-films were taken of subjects running slaloms of various combinations of lengths/amplitudes to provoke a range of temporal frequencies of slalom (reciprocal of time to run a cycle). RESULTS: The usual tactic for cornering at frequencies &lt;0.25 Hz was whole-body tilt, whereas &gt;0.4 Hz lateropulsion of the legs with torso erect was observed. Between these frequencies subjects showed variable tactics, mixing components of both tilt and lateropulsion. CONCLUSIONS: This uncertainty in selecting the appropriate tactic for movement control around 0.2–0.3 Hz is the possible origin of ‘tilt-translation’ ambiguity. It also follows that externally imposed motion around these frequencies would challenge both perception and motor control, with the consequence of motion sickness.Golding JF, Gresty MA.

    "abstract": "The aim of the POP (odontological problems among divers) study was to assess dental barotrauma among French military divers exposed to an underwater environment.A questionnaire on dental barotrauma was completed by the divers who presented at the SMHEP (Centre for Hyperbaric Medicine and Diving Expertise) for their quadrennial medical exam from March 2011 to July 2014.There were 1317 questionnaires completed, representing 60.6% of all French military divers. A total of 5.3% of divers had a dental barotrauma (70/1317), mainly fracture and/or loss of dental restoration. Dental barotrauma disrupted diving in 34.3% of cases. A total of 76.4% of divers were informed by a military physician of the importance of maintaining good oral health and 88.5% of divers consult their dentist at least once a year. Of the participants, 82.5% made their dentist aware they are divers, but only 4.9% of the dental practitioners advised their patient not to dive after some types of dental treatments and 12.8% indicated that, as divers, they need adapted dental treatments.Dental barotrauma was experienced by 1 in 19 military divers. Nevertheless, a contradiction exists between the frequency of dental barotraumas and the rigorous medical and dental follow-up of military divers. We note that there is inadequate dental management of divers when dental issues are identified. To avoid this unsatisfactory situation, \"diving dentistry\" should be taught to military and civilian dentists and physicians to make them aware of the potential dental complications and preventive measures associated with operating in a subaquatic environment.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide information on the occurrence of spinal pain, i.e., low back and neck pain, among commercial helicopter pilots, along with possible associations between pain and anthropometric and demographic factors and flying exposure. METHODS: Data were collected through a subjective and retrospective survey among all the 313 (294 men, 19 women) full-time pilots employed by two helicopter companies. A questionnaire was used to assess the extent of spinal complaints in a transient and recurrent pain pattern along with information on physical activities, occupational flying experience, and airframes. RESULTS: The survey had 207 responders (194 men, 13 women). The pilots had extensive flying experience. Spinal pain was reported by 67%. Flying-related transient pain was reported among 50%, whereas recurrent spinal pain, not necessarily associated with flying, was reported by 52%. Women experienced more pain, but sample size prevented further conclusions. Male pilots reporting any spinal pain flew significantly more hours last year (median 500 h, IQR 400–650) versus men with no pain (median 445 h, IQR 300–550). Male pilots with transient or recurrent spinal pain did not differ from nonaffected male colleagues in the measured parameters. CONCLUSION: Spinal pain is a frequent problem among male and female commercial helicopter pilots. For men, no significant associations were revealed for transient or recurrent spinal pain with age, flying experience in years, total hours, annual flying time, type of aircraft, or anthropometric factors except for any spinal pain related to hours flown in the last year.Andersen K, Baardsen R, Dalen I, Larsen JP.

Mental stress increases MCAv, but the MCAv response to combined LBNP and mental stress (COMBO) is unknown. We hypothesized that performing a stressful cognitive challenge (i.e., mental stress) concurrently with LBNP would prevent LBNP-induced reductions of MCAv.There were 18 subjects (9 men, 9 women; ages 20.1±0.3 yr) who completed 3 randomized 3-min trials: 1) LBNP (-40 mmHg); 2) mental stress (serial subtraction); and 3) COMBO (LBNP+mental stress). All reported values are mean±SE. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), forearm blood flow (FBF), and MCAv were measured continuously. Subjects also reported perceived stress following the mental stress and COMBO trials.LBNP decreased MAP (Δ-1.4±0.5 mmHg), MCAv (Δ-2.6±1.1 cm s(-1)) and FBF (Δ-0.8±0.1 units), and increased HR (Δ2.7±1.2 bpm). Mental stress increased MAP (Δ10.1±1.3 mmHg), HR (Δ17.4±2.2 bpm), and FBF (Δ2.4±0.4 units), while MCAv (Δ2.8±1.3 cm s(-1)) tended to increase. COMBO increased MAP (Δ5.3±2.3 mmHg) and HR (Δ21.3±2.6 bpm), and tended to increase FBF (Δ0.5±0.3 units). However, MCAv (Δ-4.6±2.0 cm s(-1)) decreased during COMBO. Decreases in MCAv during COMBO were not statistically different from LBNP-induced decreases (Δ-4.6±2.0 vs. Δ-2.6±1.1 cm s(-1)). Subjective ratings of perceived stress (standard 0 to 4 scale) tended to be higher during COMBO than mental stress (2.9±0.1 vs. 2.5±0.1 units).Our results suggest that mental stress does not effectively preserve MCAv when combined with central hypovolemia (i.e., LBNP).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decompression sickness is an inherent occupational hazard that has the possibility to leave its victims with significant long-lasting effects that can potentially impact an aircrew’s flight status. The relative infrequency of this hazard within the military flying community along with the potentially subtle presentation of decompression sickness (DCS) has the potential to result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, leading to residual deficits that can impact a patient’s daily life or even lead to death. CASE REPORT: The patient presented in this work was diagnosed with a Type II DCS 21 h after a cabin decompression at 35,000 ft (10,668 m). The patient had been asymptomatic with a completely normal physical/neurological exam following his flight. The following day, he presented with excessive fatigue and on re-evaluation was recommended for hyperbaric therapy, during which his symptoms completely resolved. He was re-evaluated 14 d later and cleared to resume flight duties without further incident. DISCUSSION: The manifestation of this patient’s decompression sickness was subtle and followed an evaluation that failed to identify any focal findings. A high index of suspicion with strict follow-up contributed to the identification of DCS in this case, resulting in definitive treatment and resolution of the patient’s symptoms. Determination of the need for hyperbaric therapy following oxygen supplementation and a thorough history and physical is imperative. If the diagnosis is in question, consider preemptive hyperbaric therapy as the benefits of treatment in DCS outweigh the risks of treatment. Finally, this work introduces the future potential of neuropsychological testing for both the diagnosis of DCS as well as assessing the effectiveness of hyperbaric therapy in Type II DCS.Alea K.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Supersonic, high altitude aviation places its pilots and aircrew in complex environments, which may lead to injury that is not easily diagnosed or simply treated. Decompression illness (either venous or arterial) and environmental conditions (e.g., abnormal gases and pressure) are the most likely adverse effects aircrew often face. Though symptomatic aircrew personnel may occasionally require hyperbaric oxygen treatment, it is rare to require more than one treatment before returning to baseline function. CASE REPORT: This challenging aviation case details the clinical course and discusses the salient physiological factors of an F/A-18D pilot who presented with neurological symptoms following loss of cabin pressure at altitude. DISCUSSION: Most crucial to this discussion was the requirement for multiple hyperbaric oxygen treatments over several days due to recurrence of symptoms. The likelihood of recurrence during and after future flights cannot be estimated with accuracy. This case illustrates a degree of recurrences for neurological symptoms in aviation (hypobaric exposure to hyperbaric baseline environment) that has not previously been described.Robinson T, Evangelista JS III, Latham E, Mukherjee ST, Pilmanis A.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is usually a self-limiting condition; however, there is potential for recurrence and permanent visual defects. Aviation demands perfect vision to minimize risk to pilots and aircraft. Consequently, this ailment disqualifies pilots and pilots to be. CASE REPORT: A fully trained fighter pilot with 1260 h in fighter airframes has been contending with central serous chorioretinopathy in the right eye over the course of 3 yr. The condition was diagnosed after the member presented with visual disturbances. His course was followed with multiple treatment modalities: watchful waiting, micropulse laser, and rifampin. His disease responded well with rifampin, but was ultimately stopped secondary to elevated liver enzymes. Micropulse laser failed to resolve subretinal fluid. Ultimately the pilot is left with a chronic area of CSC without visual defects and faces career termination. DISCUSSION: Uncompromised vision is inherently crucial in aerospace careers, especially that of a fighter pilot. With persistent CSC resistant to treatment, there is a risk for progression to permanent visual disturbances and/or defects. Safety concerns of authority figures overseeing pilots and aircraft are warranted. However, the concern could be mitigated in air frames that require two pilots. Another factor partially responsible for ending his career is the fear of G force affecting his prognosis. The author is not aware of any other studies illuminating the effects or consideration of excess G force on subretinal fluid in CSC. This is an area that requires further study.Dietrich KC.

    "abstract": "The Stratex Project is a high altitude balloon flight that culminated in a freefall from 41,422 m (135,890 ft), breaking the record for the highest freefall to date. Crew recovery operations required an innovative approach due to the unique nature of the event as well as the equipment involved. The parachutist donned a custom space suit similar to a NASA Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), with life support system mounted to the front and a parachute on the back. This space suit had a metal structure around the torso, which, in conjunction with the parachute and life support assembly, created a significant barrier to extraction from the suit in the event of a medical emergency. For this reason the Medical Support Team coordinated with the pressure suit assembly engineer team for integration, training in suit removal, definition of a priori contingency leadership on site, creation of color-coded extraction scenarios, and extraction drills with a suit mock-up that provided insight into limitations to immediate access. This paper discusses novel extraction processes and contrasts the required medical preparation for this type of equipment with the needs of the prior record-holding jump that used a different space suit with easier immediate access.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Greek version of the MSAQ. METHODS: The MSAQ was translated into Greek and then translated back into English. Minor differences between the two texts were corrected. The Greek version was then administered to male subjects before and after nauseogenic motion stimulation. With the use of a motor driven rotating chair, the subjects were exposed to Coriolis cross-coupling stimulation. A battery of statistical tests was used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the MSAQ. RESULTS: There were 112 subjects who participated. Internal consistency, measured with Cronbach's alpha coefficient, was excellent for the total scale and subscales. The test-retest evaluation was done with Pearson's coefficient and Bland-Altman's plot for the total score and subscales and showed statistically significant results. Mean total MSAQ score was 19.04 before the exposure and 33.46 after the exposure, which was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Results suggest the Greek-MSAQ is a valid instrument with satisfactory internal consistency, reliability, reproducibility, validity, and responsiveness and can be used in future studies of motion sickness in Greek speaking populations.Kousoulis P, Pantes A, Alevetsovitis G, Fydanaki O.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Middle ear (ME) barotraumas are the most common condition in aviation medicine, sometimes seriously compromising flight safety. Considering this and the ever-increasing amount of commercial aviation, a detailed overview is warranted. METHODS: In this survey study, an anonymous, electronic questionnaire was distributed to commercial aircrew of the three major commercial airlines operating in Finland ( N 3799), covering 93% of the target population (i.e., all commercial aircrew operating in Finland, N 4083). Primary outcomes were self-reported prevalence, clinical characteristics, and health and occupational effects of ME barotraumas in flight. Secondary outcomes were adjusted odds ratios (OR) for frequency of ME barotraumas with respect to possible risk factors. RESULTS: Response rate was 47% ( N 1789/3799), with 85% ( N 1516) having experienced ME barotraumas in flight. Of those affected, 60% had used medications, 5% had undergone surgical procedures, and 48% had been on sick leave due to ME barotraumas (40% during the last year). Factors associated with ME barotraumas included a high number of upper respiratory tract infections [3 URTIs/yr vs. 0 URTIs/yr: OR, 9.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.9920.39] and poor subjective performance in Valsalva (occasionally vs. always successful: OR, 7.84; 95% CI 3.9715.51) and Toynbee (occasionally vs. always successful: OR, 9.06; 95% CI 2.6730.78) maneuvers. CONCLUSION: ME barotraumas were reported by 85% of commercial aircrew. They lead to an increased need for medications, otorhinolaryngology-related surgical procedures, and sickness absence from flight duty. Possible risk factors include a high number of URTIs and poor performance in pressure equalization maneuvers. Lindfors OH, Ketola KS, Klockars TK, Leino TK, Sinkkonen ST.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benign episodic unilateral mydriasis is one cause of anisocoria. This phenomenon is thought to be related to an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. There is a documented association with migraines, but asymptomatic cases have also been reported. A challenge with all cases is the level of investigation required to exclude more sinister causes of nervous system dysfunction. In a dynamic flight environment, additional considerations need to be made, such as varying light levels and use of night vision devices. CASE REPORT: A 27-yr-old woman on deployment to Afghanistan as a flight nurse presented to the role one clinic with right-sided mydriasis. The patient denied headache or any history of migraines. A dilated right pupil that was reactive to light was found on exam. Symptoms and exam findings resolved shortly after initial presentation. We consulted an ophthalmologist who requested patient transfer for review. He made a diagnosis of benign episodic unilateral mydriasis. DISCUSSION: There are a variety of causes for anisocoria. A thorough history and examination are required to avoid unnecessary investigations that may not be locally available in the more austere deployed military settings. From an operational perspective, the decision needs to be made regarding the maintenance of flight status. Consideration needs to be given to patient care capability when treating a flight nurse. In cases of rapid resolution such as this, removal from operational status is not reasonable should a clinician be confident of the diagnosis.Schiemer A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypergravitational exposures during human centrifugation are known to provoke dysrhythmias, including sinus dysrhythmias/tachycardias, premature atrial/ventricular contractions, and even atrial fibrillations or flutter patterns. However, events are generally short-lived and resolve rapidly after cessation of acceleration. This case report describes a prolonged ectopic ventricular rhythm in response to high G exposure. CASE REPORT: A previously healthy 30-yr-old man voluntarily participated in centrifuge trials as a part of a larger study, experiencing a total of 7 centrifuge runs over 48 h. Day 1 consisted of two +G z runs (peak +3.5 G z , run 2) and two +G x runs (peak +6.0 G x , run 4). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +G x and +G z ). Hemodynamic data collected included blood pressure, heart rate, and continuous three-lead electrocardiogram. Following the final acceleration exposure of the last Day 2 run (peak +4.5 G x and +4.0 G z combined, resultant +6.0 G), during a period of idle resting centrifuge activity (resultant vector +1.4 G), the subject demonstrated a marked change in his three-lead electrocardiogram from normal sinus rhythm to a wide-complex ectopic ventricular rhythm at a rate of 91–95 bpm, consistent with an accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR). This rhythm was sustained for 2 m, 24 s before reversion to normal sinus. The subject reported no adverse symptoms during this time. DISCUSSION: While prolonged, the dysrhythmia was asymptomatic and self-limited. AIVR is likely a physiological response to acceleration and can be managed conservatively. Vigilance is needed to ensure that AIVR is correctly distinguished from other, malignant rhythms to avoid inappropriate treatment and negative operational impacts.Suresh R, Blue RS, Mathers C, Castleberry TL, Vanderploeg JM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acceleration load causes several physiological changes that play important roles in pilot performance. One of the problems is determining individual factors responsible for the differences in changes in the level of central nervous system (CNS) arousal after exposure to acceleration loads. We were interested in whether the coping style and anxiety as a trait might differentiate the subjects in terms of reactions of the CNS to +G z load-related stress. METHODS: Examined were 31 male volunteers with ages between 23 and 30 yr. Measurements were obtained under controlled conditions before, during, and every 2 min up to 12 min after centrifugation. The study was conducted using the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory. The value of Critical Flicker Fusion Threshold (CFFT) corresponded to the level of CNS arousal. RESULTS: Two significantly different trends of changes in CNS arousal were identified: class 1 (higher level of fatigue following +G z load) and class 2 (lower level of fatigue following +G z load). Significant differences were observed in CISS scores with Task-Oriented Coping value in class 1 (M = 65.94, SD = 5.47) being considerably greater than in class 2 (M = 62, SD = 4.37). For Emotion-Oriented and Distraction Coping, the mean value in class 1 (M = 29.53, SD = 7.72; M = 16.82, SD = 3.8) was significantly lower than in class 2 (M = 34.33, SD = 6.68; M = 19.42, SD = 3.4). DISCUSSION: The nature of the changes in CFFT values over time is associated with coping style.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Ishihara plates are commonly used as an initial occupational screening test for color vision. While effective at detecting red-green deficiencies, the color deficient subject can learn the test using different techniques. Some medical standards such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) require plate randomization and apply a stricter pass/fail requirement than suggested by Ishihara. This has been reported to increase the false positive rate up to ∼50%. METHOD: Two modifications to the Ishihara protocol are investigated. These involved allowing subjects a second attempt where one or two reading errors were made and the presentation of rotated Ishihara plates. RESULTS: A reduction of false positive rate to 5.9% was found. Correct identification of certain rotated Ishihara plates was not affected. DISCUSSION: By using a modified Ishihara protocol, fewer color normal subjects would require unnecessary advanced color vision examination. Further, additional safeguards would be in place to ensure that no subject with a color vision deficiency could pass the Ishihara test.Chorley AC.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Advances in flight technologies and the demand for long-range flight have increased mission lengths for U.S. Army Black Hawk UH-60 crewmembers. Prolonged mission times have increased reports of pilot discomfort and symptoms of paresthesia thought to be due to UH-60 seat design and areas of locally high pressure. Discomfort created by the seat-system decreases situational awareness, putting aviators and support crew at risk of injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of prolonged restricted sitting in a UH-60 on discomfort, sensory function, and vascular measures in the lower extremities. METHODS: There were 15 healthy men (age = 23.4 ± 3.1 yr) meeting physical flight status requirements who sat in an unpadded, UH-60 pilot’s seat for 4 h while completing a common cognitive task. During the session, subjective discomfort, sensory function, and vascular function were measured. RESULTS: Across 4 h of restricted sitting, subjective discomfort increased using the Category Partitioning Scale (30.27 point increase) and McGill Pain Questionnaire (8.53 point increase); lower extremity sensory function was diminished along the S1 dermatome; and skin temperature decreased on both the lateral (2.85°C decrease) and anterior (2.78°C decrease) aspects of the ankle. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that prolonged sitting in a UH-60 seat increases discomfort, potentially through a peripheral nervous or vascular system mechanism. Further research is needed to understand the etiology and onset of pain and paresthesia during prolonged sitting in UH-60 pilot seats.Games KE, Lakin JM, Quindry JC, Weimar WH, Sefton JM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aviation exposes pilots to various occupationally related hazards, including ionizing radiation and chemical combustion. The possible increased risk of prostate cancer among pilots in comparison to the general population is a subject of debate. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the quality of supporting evidence and magnitude of this association. METHODS: All studies pertaining to prostate cancer in pilots were retrieved from multiple databases and from a manual search. Any study that assessed the incidence of prostate cancer relative to the incidence in the general population was included regardless of language or size. A random effect model was used to pool relative risks (RR) across studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and I 2 . RESULTS: Eight studies with a low risk of bias were included in the meta-analysis. Pilots had an increased risk of developing prostate cancer compared to the general population [RR 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5–2.7]. The analysis was associated with substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 79%). Several subgroups had significantly increased risk, such as African American pilots (RR 10.00; 95% CI, 5.04–19.86) and military pilots (RR 3.30; 95% CI, 2.03–5.39). CONCLUSION: Pilots are at least twice as likely to develop prostate cancer compared to the general population. The implications of these findings are important considering the high prevalence of prostate cancer and the large number of pilots in the workforce.Raslau D, Summerfield DT, Abu Dabrh AM, Steinkraus LW, Murad MH.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that IH reduces the cerebrovascular response to CO 2 . METHODS: Healthy male subjects ( N = 8; 25 ± 2 yr) were exposed to 10 consecutive days of IH (12% O 2 for 5 min followed by 5 min of normoxia for 1 h/d). The cerebrovascular response to CO 2 was assessed prior to (PRE-IH) and following (POST-IH) the IH paradigm with transcranial Doppler ultrasound. RESULTS: There was no change in eupnic measures during or following the IH paradigm; however, the ventilatory response to IH increased by the last exposure (3.0 ± 2.8 L · min −1 ). Cerebral blood flow velocity decreased and increased with hypocapnia and hypercapnia, respectively, but cerebrovascular sensitivity to CO 2 remained unchanged with IH (PRE-IH: 2.58 ± 0.50%/mmHg; POST-IH: 2.59 ± 0.74%/mmHg).

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Flying a helicopter is a complex psychomotor skill. Fatigue is a serious threat to operational safety, particularly for sustained helicopter operations involving high levels of cognitive information processing and sustained time on task. As part of ongoing research into this issue, the object of this study was to develop a field-deployable helicopter-specific psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) for the purpose of daily performance monitoring of pilots. METHODS: The PVT consists of a laptop computer, a hand-operated joystick, and a set of rudder pedals. Screen-based compensatory tracking task software includes a tracking ball (operated by the joystick) which moves randomly in all directions, and a second tracking ball which moves horizontally (operated by the rudder pedals). The 5-min test requires the pilot to keep both tracking balls centered. RESULTS: This helicopter-specific PVT’s portability and integrated data acquisition and storage system enables daily field monitoring of the performance of individual helicopter pilots. The inclusion of a simultaneous foot-operated tracking task ensures divided attention for helicopter pilots as the movement of both tracking balls requires simultaneous inputs. DISCUSSION: This PVT is quick, economical, easy to use, and specific to the operational flying task. It can be used for performance monitoring purposes, and as a general research tool for investigating the psychomotor demands of helicopter operations. While reliability and validity testing is warranted, data acquired from this test could help further our understanding of the effect of various factors (such as fatigue) on helicopter pilot performance, with the potential of contributing to helicopter operational safety.McMahon TW, Newman DG.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The ocular effects of excess solar radiation exposure are well documented. Recent evidence suggests that ocular ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure to professional pilots may fall outside international guideline limits unless eye protection is used. Nonprescription sunglasses should be manufactured to meet either international or national standards. The mean increase in UVR and blue light hazards at altitude has been quantified and the aim of this research was to assess the effectiveness of typical pilot sunglasses in reducing UVR and blue light hazard exposure in flight. METHOD: A series of sunglass filter transmittance measurements were taken from personal sunglasses ( N = 20) used by pilots together with a series of new sunglasses ( N = 18). RESULTS: All nonprescription sunglasses measured conformed to international standards for UVR transmittance and offered sufficient UVR protection for pilots. There was no difference between right and left lenses or between new and used sunglasses. All sunglasses offered sufficient attenuation to counter the mean increase in blue light exposure that pilots experience at altitude, although used sunglasses with scratched lenses were marginally less effective. One pair of prescription sunglasses offered insufficient UVR attenuation for some flights, but would have met requirements of international and national standards for UV-A transmittance. This was likely due to insufficient UVR blocking properties of the lens material. CONCLUSIONS: Lenses manufactured to minimally comply with standards for UVR transmittance could result in excess UVR exposure to a pilot based on in-flight irradiance data; an additional requirement of less than 10% transmittance at 380 nm is recommended.Chorley AC, Lyachev A, Higlett MP, Khazova M, Benwell MJ, Evans BJW.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the United States, accident and fatality rates in helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) operations increase significantly under nighttime environmentally hazardous operational conditions. Other studies have found pilots’ total flight hours unrelated to HEMS accident outcomes. Many factors affect pilots’ decision making, including their experience. This study seeks to investigate whether pilot domain task experience (DTE) in HEMS plays a role against likelihood of accidents at night when hazardous operational conditions are entered. METHODS: There were 32 flights with single pilot nighttime fatal HEMS accidents between 1995 and 2013 with findings of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and loss of control (LCTRL) due to spatial disorientation (SD) identified. The HEMS DTE of the pilots were compared with industry survey data. RESULTS: Of the pilots, 56% had ≤2 yr of HEMS experience and 9% had &gt;10 yr of HEMS experience. There were 21 (66%) accidents that occurred in non-visual flight rules (VFR) conditions despite all flights being required to be conducted under VFR. There was a statistically significant increase in accident rates in pilots with &lt;2 and &lt;4 yr HEMS DTE and a statistically significant decrease in accident rates in pilots with &gt;10 yr HEMS DTE. CONCLUSION: HEMS DTE plays a preventive role against the likelihood of a night operational accident. Pilots with limited HEMS DTE are more likely to make a poor assessment of hazardous conditions at night, and this will place HEMS flight crew at high risk in the VFR night domain.Aherne BB, Zhang C, Newman DG.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a close physiological connection between muscular activity and kidney function. During physical exercise (PE) the qualitative and quantitative composition of urine changes. This paper explores the influence of moderate PE on urine protein composition. The study of urine protein composition will help to make corrections to the existing methods of countermeasures. METHODS: There were 10 healthy men who exercised on a treadmill similar to the one onboard the International Space Station. We analyzed their urinary proteome composition, potassium level, sodium level, and their level of osmotically active substances before and after PE. RESULTS: After moderate PE, a small increase in urine flow speed and a constant glomerular filtration rate were noted. The average-group index of total protein excretion within the urine was reliably increased. From the 148 proteins identified in the urine, 64 were associated with known tissue origin. We found that protein penetration into the urine had a positive correlation with their tissue expression. Selectivity of the glomerular barrier during PE decreased and high-molecular weight proteins penetrated through the glomerular barrier more easily after PE. DISCUSSION: Performance of moderate intensity physical exercise of short duration did not lead to an increase in the glomerular filtration rate nor did diuresis increase above the limits of baseline variability. However, the protein excretion rate increased after PE. We also observed that protein composition drift indicated a change in the set of biological processes in which a given protein participated, in some cases activating, in some cases inactivating them.Fomina EV, Lisova NIu, Kireev KS, Tiys ES, Kononikhin AS, Larina IM.

This pathology is sporadically observed in the diving community, but rarely described in military or civil aviation. This case was particularly unusual in its promptness of onset, rapid recovery, and its association with vertigo.This case report describes a previously healthy 26-yr-old F-16 pilot who experienced ear block and subsequent unilateral facial paralysis while on initial ascent. This was relieved quickly after clearing the affected ear without any neurological sequelae. A second episode was associated with vertigo in addition to the ear block and facial symptoms. Both episodes were separated by 3 d.Barotrauma to the facial nerve via an uncovered or \"dehiscent\" facial nerve canal was suggested by the clinical course, computed tomography, and confirmed by expert consultation. Making the diagnosis in an aviator, especially the military aviator, is important for safety of flight, to avoid unwarranted diagnostics, and to minimize operational impact.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke is a decidedly devastating event for any patient, but particularly for a military aviator in a single-seat aircraft. Incidence of acute ischemic infarct in men ages 25 to 29 ranges from 3.4 to 5.6/100,000. The neurological sequelae of stroke can have a lasting and profound impact on an aviator’s career. Literature review revealed a relatively small number of cases where stroke was attributable to cervical manipulation. CASE REPORT: A 29-yr-old male jet pilot with a 2-wk history of cervicalgia following a mountain bike ride performed self-manipulation of his neck at home following a visit to a chiropractor. He sustained an immediate onset of euphoria, nausea, dysarthria, vertigo, diploplia, and occipital headache, and was transported via ambulance to the nearest emergency department. The patient’s MRI/MRA imaging revealed a dissection of his right vertebral artery, as well as bilateral cerebellar infarcts. During the course of the following months, the patient’s residual symptoms included neck pain, headaches, disequilibrium, and quadrantanopia. DISCUSSION: The ability to recognize the symptoms of stroke and seek treatment in a timely manner are paramount and can drastically reduce the potential for permanent deficit. The evaluation of residual sequelae in military aviators who fly single-seat aircraft is of particular interest to aerospace medicine physicians when it comes time to return a pilot to flight duties. Additionally, the link between cervical manipulation and vertebral artery dissection leading to stroke remains equivocal, and further research is warranted.Mukherjee ST.

We designed a study to compare the reversal of hypobaric hypoxemia at 14,000 ft with continuous flow oxygen from a cylinder and pulsed dose oxygen from a portable concentrator. METHODS: There were 30 healthy volunteers who were randomized to one of three study groups, placed in an altitude chamber, and ascended to 14,000 ft. There were 10 subjects in each study group. Subjects breathed room air for 10 min to induce hypoxemia. Oxygen was then delivered via a nasal cannula from a cylinder at 1, 2, or 3 lpm of continuous flow for 10 min. The subjects again breathed room air at altitude for 10 min and were then placed on pulsed dose oxygen and titrated to obtain the continuous flow S p o 2 equivalent. S p o 2 , E t co 2 , RR, HR, Hgb, and tissue oxygenation (S t o 2 ) were continuously recorded. RESULTS: The 1-lpm group's S p o 2 range was 89–99%. The 2-lpm group's S p o 2 range was 95–98%, and the 3-lpm group's S p o 2 range was 95–99%. The 2-lpm and 3-lpm flows were able to correct hypoxemia in every subject. The mean pulsed dose required to achieve an equivalent S p o 2 ranged from 36.8 ml ± 18.9 ml in the 1-lpm arm, and 102.4 ml ± 53.8 in the 3-lpm arm.

METHODS: Participants were classified as CVN ( N = 45) or CVD ( N = 49) using the Rabin cone contrast test, which is the standard color vision screening test used by the United States Air Force. In the color condition, test images that were representative of the size, shape, and color of symbols and lines used on fifth-generation fighter aircraft displays were used to measure operational performance. In the achromatic condition, all symbols and lines had the same chromaticity but differed in luminance. Subjects were asked to locate and discriminate between friend vs. foe symbols (red vs. green, or brighter vs. dimmer) while speed and accuracy were recorded. RESULTS: Increasing color deficiency was associated with decreasing speed and accuracy for the color condition (R 2 &gt; 0.2), but not for the achromatic condition. Mean differences between CVN and CVD individuals showed the same pattern. DISCUSSION: Although lower CCT scores are clearly associated with lower performance in color related tasks, the magnitude of the performance loss was relatively small and there were multiple examples of high-performing CVD individuals who had higher operational scores than low-performing CVN individuals.Gaska JP, Wright ST, Winterbottom MD, Hadley SC.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The coronavirus epidemic originated in China, having its epicenter in Wuhan. This was the first place in the world to adopt social distancing measures to contain the disease on January 23 rd , 2020. After the initial isolation, several countries started making diplomatic plans to evacuate and repatriate their citizens, with the permission of the Chinese authorities. Due to the high risk of exposure of the transported passengers, evacuations were conducted with preventive measures against contamination by biological agents. CASE REPORT: We report the air evacuation of 39 passengers from China to Brazil. Five passengers were transported to Poland and the remaining 34 went to Brazil, where they remained in quarantine for 14 d. The mission was triggered on February 4 th , named “Operation Return to Brazil” (Operação Regresso à Pátria Amada Brasil), and conducted by military personnel of the Brazilian Air Force. The mission was accomplished in 6 days; the flight from Wuhan lasted 25 h 20 min; and, additionally, there were on-ground preparations. DISCUSSION: Only with adequate isolation and protective measures was it possible to air evacuate the potentially contaminated passengers in the initial phase of the pandemic. Specific protective equipment (Personal Protective Equipment – PPE) is mandatory for missions in which the properties of the potentially contagious biological agent are not fully known, as was the case. Due to the risk of contamination of passengers and the likely evolution of the transport into an aeromedical evacuation, protocols stating the minimum safety conditions for this kind of patient transport must be followed, with consideration for the patient as well as the crew.

Thereafter, they independently evaluated the prevalence of VGE in 70 ultrasonic videos before and after a 14-d interval (test-retest; intra-rater), with these being compared to an experienced sonographer's grading (inter-rater).RESULTS: A significant inter-rater level of agreement was found between the naïve and experienced sonographers' bubble grading both during the first (W = 0.945) and second (W = 0.952) round of bubble evaluation. The naïve observers' evaluations were on average 79% (range: 61-95%) and 75% (range: 48-95%) in complete agreement with the experienced sonographer's gradings, while the level of agreement was 99% and 98% within 1 grade unit. There was a significant intra-rater level of agreement (κ = 0.845) during the test-retest series, with a mean percentage level of agreement of 87% (range: 72-93%).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a short familiarization session enables individuals with no prior sonography experience to consistently evaluate VGE prevalence from precordial ultrasonic videos.Elia A, Ånell R, Eiken O, Grönkvist M, Gennser M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of research on general aviation accidents in Germany. The authorities investigate only a fraction of all national accidents. The current study analyzes existing accident reports and aims to identify injury severity in regard to concomitant risk factors.METHODS: Data of flight accidents was analyzed for aircraft of <5700 kg maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) over a 20-yr period. Besides descriptive data, concomitant factors (type and category of aircraft, date, occupants and outcome, flight phase, etc.) were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-squared test.RESULTS: The authorities list 1595 aircraft accidents between 2000 and 2019, but only 17.9% of these were analyzed in detail. Accidents of aircraft of <2000 kg MTOW were over-represented between May and September and between Friday and Sunday. The fraction of fatal accidents was highest during cruise. During landing, significantly more mishaps of larger aircraft occurred. The number of seriously injured or deceased occupants was significantly higher for accidents involving private pilots. An occupancy rate of more than three persons on board correlated significantly with fewer number of deaths.CONCLUSIONS: The annual count of aircraft accidents has almost halved during the previous 20 yr. Unfortunately, only a small number of mishaps were further investigated by authorities, which leads to a lack of evaluable data needed for in-depth investigations. The accumulation of larger aircraft mishaps in winter and the superior outcome of professional pilots in terms of safety, as well as the fewer number of mishaps in larger aircraft, should be further investigated.Liebold F, Hippler C, Schmitz J, Yücetepe S, Rothschild M, Hinkelbein J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Between 43 and 97% of helicopter pilots in the Canadian Armed Forces report neck pain. Potential contributing factors include the weight of their helmet, night vision goggles (NVG), and counterweight (CW) combined with deviated neck postures. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to quantify changes in neck loads associated with posture, helmet, NVG, and CW.METHODS: Eight male subjects volunteered. They undertook one of five deviated neck postures (flexion, extension, lateral bending, axial rotation) times four configurations (no helmet, helmet only, helmet and NVG, and helmet, NVG, and CW). 3D kinematics and EMG from 10 muscles (5 bilaterally) drove a 3D inverse dynamics, EMG-driven model of the cervical spine which calculated joint compression and shear at C5-C6.RESULTS: The compression in the neutral posture was 116.5 (5.7) N, which increased to 143.7 (11.4) N due to a 12.7 N helmet. NVGs, weighing 7.9 N, also generated this disproportionate increase, where the compression was 164.2 (3.7) N. In flexion or extension, the compression increased with increasing head-supported mass, with a maximum of 315.8 (67.5) N with the CW in flexion. Anteroposterior shear was highest in the lateral bending [34.0 (6.2) N] condition, but was generally low (< 30 N). Mediolateral shear was less than 5 N for all conditions.DISCUSSION: Repositioning the center of gravity of the helmet with either NVGs or CW resulted in posture-specific changes to loading. Posture demonstrated a greater potential to reposition the head segment's center of gravity compared to the helmet design. Therefore, helmet designs which consider repositioning the center of gravity may reduce loads in one posture, but likely exacerbate loading in other postures.Barrett JM, McKinnon CD, Dickerson CR, Laing AC, Callaghan JP.

While many cases and a variety of causes for physiological episodes have been described, few cases, if any, have been reported of hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia and transient loss of consciousness. CASE REPORT: Here we describe a case of an aviator who experienced tingling extremities, confusion, and loss of consciousness during a flight. The aviator incorrectly believed he was experiencing hypoxia and continued to take multiple steps to troubleshoot the wrong underlying problem for his symptoms. Evaluation after landing suggested this was instead a stress-induced hyperventilation that resulted in symptomatic hypocapnia. DISCUSSION: We report this case to add to the body of literature in understanding this phenomenon as well as to provide aviators, physiologists, and flight surgeons with practical suggestions for recognizing hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia and awareness of how to remedy this situation when they recognize it.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is debate whether astronauts traveling to space should undergo a prophylactic splenectomy prior to long duration spaceflight. Risks to the spleen during flight include radiation and trauma. However, splenectomy also carries significant risks. METHODS: Systematic review of data published over the past 5 decades regarding risks associated with splenectomies and risks associated with irradiation to the spleen from long duration spaceflight were analyzed. A total of 41 articles were reviewed. RESULTS: Acute risks of splenectomy include intraoperative mortality rate (from hemorrhage) of 3–5%, mortality rate from postoperative complications of 6%, thromboembolic event rate of 10%, and portal vein thrombosis rate of 5–37%. Delayed risks of splenectomy include overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) at 0.5% at 5 yr post splenectomy, mortality rate as high as 60% for pneumococcal infections, and development of malignancy with relative risk of 1.53. The risk of hematologic malignancy increases significantly when individuals reach 40 Gy of exposure, much higher than the 0.6 Gy of radiation experienced from a 12-mo round trip to Mars. Lower doses of radiation increase the risk of hyposplenism more so than hematologic malignancy. CONCLUSION: For protection against hematologic malignancy, the benefits of prophylactic splenectomy do not outweigh the risks. However, there is a possible risk of hyposplenism from long duration spaceflight. It would be beneficial to prophylactically provide vaccines against encapsulated organisms for long duration spaceflight to mitigate the risk of hyposplenism.

Multimodal spacesuit informatics displays have been proposed as a method of mitigating sEVA risk by increasing operator autonomy. METHODS: A formalized literature review was conducted. In total, 95 journal articles, conference papers, and technical reports were included. Characteristics of U.S. spacesuits were reviewed, ranging from the Apollo A7L to the xEMU Z-2.5. Multimodal display applications were then reviewed and assessed for their potential in aiding sEVA operations. RESULTS: Through literature review 25 performance impairments were identified. Performance impairments caused by the spacesuit represented the greatest number of sEVA challenges. Multimodal displays were mapped to impairments and approximately 36% of performance impairments could be aided by using display interfaces. DISCUSSION: Multimodal displays may provide additional benefits for alleviating performance impairments during sEVA. Utility of multimodal displays may be greater in certain performance impairment domains, such as spacesuit-related impairments. Zhang JY, Anderson AP.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Unexplained physiological events (PE), possibly related to hypoxia and hyperventilation, are a concern for some air forces. Physiological monitoring could aid research into PEs, with measurement of arterial oxygen saturation (S p o 2 ) often suggested despite potential limitations in its use. Given similar physiological responses to hypoxia and hyperventilation, the present study characterized the cardiovascular and respiratory responses to each. METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were exposed to 55 mins of normobaric hypoxia simulating altitudes of 0, 8000, and 12,000 ft (0, 2438, and 3658 m) while breathing normally and voluntarily hyperventilating (doubling minute ventilation). Respiratory gas analysis and spirometry measured end-tidal gases (P ET o 2 and P ET co 2 ) and minute ventilation. S p o 2 was assessed using finger pulse oximetry. Mean arterial, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were measured noninvasively. Cognitive impairment was assessed using the Stroop test. RESULTS: Voluntary hyperventilation resulted in a doubling of minute ventilation and lowered P ET co 2 , while altitude had no effect on these. P ET o 2 and S p o 2 declined with increasing altitude. However, despite a significant drop in P ET o 2 of 15.2 mmHg from 8000 to 12,000 ft, S p o 2 was similar when hyperventilating (94.7 ± 2.3% vs. 93.4 ± 4.3%, respectively). The only cardiovascular response was an increase in heart rate while hyperventilating. Altitude had no effect on cognitive impairment, but hyperventilation did. DISCUSSION: For many cardiovascular and respiratory variables, there is minimal difference in responses to hypoxia and hyperventilation, making these challenging to differentiate. S p o 2 is not a reliable marker of environmental hypoxia in the presence of hyperventilation and should not be used as such without additional monitoring of minute ventilation and end-tidal gases.

Behavioral health and performance among spaceflight teams are key aspects impacted by team composition and cohesiveness. METHODS: This narrative review highlights areas of consideration for building cohesive teams in long duration spaceflight environments. The authors gathered information from a variety of team-behavior related studies that focused on team composition, cohesion, and dynamics, as well as others topics such as faultlines and subgroups, diversity, personality traits, personal values, and crew compatibility training. RESULTS: The literature suggests that team cohesion occurs more easily when individuals are similar to one another, and deep-level variables such as personality and personal values have a greater impact on crew compatibility than surface level variables such as age, nationality, or gender. Diversity can have both positive and negative impacts on team cohesiveness. CONCLUSION: Team composition, as well as pre-mission conflict resolution training can greatly impact group cohesion.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fighter pilots’ Team Situation Awareness (TSA) has been studied from the perspective of TSA accuracy, which represents how closely the pilots’ collective knowledge is aligned with the real world. When TSA accuracy is low, the pilots can have similarly or dissimilarly inaccurate SA. The concept of TSA similarity represents the similarity of team members’ collective knowledge. This paper investigates how TSA accuracy and similarity of F/A-18 pilots are associated with performance. METHOD: Data were extracted from simulated air combat missions. Performance and TSA were investigated in 58 engagements. The accuracy and similarity of pilots’ SA were elicited and performance was evaluated. TSA accuracy and similarity were analyzed with respect to the flights’ performance, and the independent variables were events in which the flights initiated engagements with enemy aircraft versus events in which the flights were engaged by enemy aircraft. RESULTS: With the mentioned events as the main effect, there were statistically significant differences at all levels of TSA accuracy and similarity. With performance as the main effect, there were also significant differences at all levels of TSA accuracy and similarity. TSA accuracy and similarity were superior in offensive engagements and when engagements were successful. DISCUSSION: The main contribution of this paper is the extension of the concept of TSA similarity to air combat: both TSA similarity and accuracy were higher when the flight was engaging the enemy aircraft, compared to situations when the flight itself was being engaged. The results also suggest that low TSA accuracy and similarity have a statistically significantly negative impact on the flights’ performance. Mansikka H, Harris D, Virtanen K.

The heat tolerance test (HTT) was developed to assist in the return-to-duty decisions of military personnel. Although there are several possible causes for heat intolerance, a soldier who fails the test is prevented from returning to serve in a front-line combat unit, regardless of the underlying reason. CASE REPORT: A 19-yr-old special infantry male soldier with unremarkable medical history collapsed during an afternoon hand-to-hand combat training session in the gym. The medic on site promptly initiated inefficient tap water cooling and measured a rectal temperature of 38.7 °C; he returned to duty the same evening. A few weeks later, after intensive physical training, he experienced exhaustion during a stretcher-carrying foot march. He was referred by the unit’s physician, who suspected a condition of heat intolerance, to an HTT. The soldier underwent two HTTs, which were found to be positive. Consequently, he was discharged from serving in his infantry unit. No congenital or functional underlying causes could explain the diagnosis of heat intolerance. DISCUSSION: We discuss the possibility that the only explaining cause for the two positive HTTs was the soldier’s anthropometric measures, particularly the low body surface area to body weight ratio. We raise the question of whether this soldier could have been returned safely to duty. Rabotin A, Epstein Y, Ketko I. Heat intolerance, body size, and return to duty .

This study investigated residual risks to dispatchers and explored the potential for safely conducting repeat exposures in a single duty period.METHODS: In this study, 15 healthy men, ages 20-50 yr, undertook 2 profiles of repeated hypobaric chamber decompression conducting activities representative of dispatcher duties. Phase 1 comprised two ascents to 25,000 ft (7620 m) for 60 and then 90 min. Phase 2 included three ascents first to 25,000 ft for 60 min, followed by two ascents to 22,000 ft (6706 m) for 90 min. Denitrogenation was undertaken at 15,000 ft (4572 m) with successive ascents separated by 1-h air breaks at ground level.RESULTS: At 25,000 ft (7620 m), five cases of limb (knee) pain DCS developed, the earliest at 29 min. Additionally, multiple minor knee \"niggles\" occurred with activity but disappeared when seated at rest. No DCS and few niggles occurred at 22,000 ft (6706 m). Early, heavy, and sustained bubble loads were common at 25,000 ft, particularly in older subjects, but lighter and later loads followed repeat exposure, especially at 22,000 ft.DISCUSSION: Parachutist dispatchers are at high risk of DCS at 25,000 ft (7620 m) commensurate with their heavy level of exertion. However, the potential exists for repeated safe ascents to 22,000 ft (6706 m), in the same duty period, if turn-around times breathing air at ground level are brief.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: General aviation (GA), mainly comprised of light (≤12,500 lb) aircraft, maintains an inferior safety record compared with air carriers. To improve safety, aeronautical decision-making (ADM) practices have been advocated to GA pilots since 1991. Herein, we determined the extent to which GA pilots disregard such practices.METHODS: Fatal accidents (1991-2019) involving private pilots (PPLs) in single-engine airplanes were identified (N = 1481) from the National Transportation Safety Board AccessR database. Of these, deficient go/no-go and in-flight ADM-related mishaps were scored using the PAVE (pilot, aircraft, environment, external pressure)/IMSAFE (illness, medicine, stress, alcohol, fatigue, eating) and PPP (perceive, process, perform) models, respectively. Statistical testing used Poisson distributions, Fisher exact tests, and Mann-Whitney U-tests.RESULTS: Of the 1481 accidents, 846 were identified as deficient ADM-related. Electing to depart into a hazardous environment (PAVE), disregarding wellness (IMSAFE), and poor aircraft familiarity (PAVE) represented the most common categories (54%, 21%, and 20%, respectively) of errant go/no-go ADM. A 64% decline in fatal accidents related to errant go/no-go decisions for the environment category was evident over the 30-yr period, with little decrements in the other domains. Within the errant environment-related category accidents, the decision to depart into forecasted adverse weather (e.g., degraded visibility, icing, thunderstorms) constituted the most prevalent subcategory (56%, N = 195). Surprisingly, of this subcategory, accidents were overrepresented by over nine- and threefold for instrument-rated PPLs disregarding icing and thunderstorm forecasts, respectively.CONCLUSION: With little decrement in ADM-related accidents in the pilot, aircraft, and external pressure domains, new strategies to address such deficiencies for PPLs are warranted.Boyd DD, Scharf MT.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Headaches among military personnel are very common and headgear wear is a frequently identified culprit. Helmet wear may cause migrainous headaches, external compression headache, other primary cranial neuralgias, and occipital neuralgia. The clinical features and the response to treatment allow distinction between the different types of headaches. Headaches among aviators are particularly concerning as they may act as distractors while flying and the treatment options are often incompatible with flying status. CASE REPORT: A 24-yr-old door gunner presented with suboccipital pain associated with the wear of his helmet. He described the pain as a paroxysmal stabbing sensation coming in waves. The physical exam and history supported the diagnosis of primary occipital neuralgia. Systemic pharmacological options were discussed with the soldier, but rejected due to his need to remain in flying status. An occipital nerve block was performed with good clinical results, supporting the diagnosis of occipital neuralgia and allowing him to continue as mission qualified. DISCUSSION: Occipital neuralgia can be induced by helmet wear in military personnel. Occipital nerve block can be performed in the deployed setting, allowing the service member to remain mission capable and sparing him/her from systemic side effects. Chalela JA.

Therefore, application of a 3D measurement method to collect data regarding eye position while in the cruising sitting posture in the aircraft cockpit to guide the design eye point has been proposed. METHODS: A total of 304 male fixed wing aircraft pilots were divided into two groups. Subgroup A (N = 48) were studied to define the cruising posture during flight. Subgroup B (N = 256) were studied with Romer 3D measurement equipment to locate the cruising eye position of the pilots in a simulated cockpit. The 3D data were compared to DEP data in the current standard cockpit. RESULTS: According to 3D measurement, the vertical distance from the cruising eye point to the neutral seat reference point was 759 mm, which is 36 mm lower than that of the Chinese standard DEP and also lower than the U.S. military standard. The horizontal distance was 131 mm, which is 24 mm shorter than that of the Chinese standard. CONCLUSIONS: The current DEP data cannot fulfill the needs of fighter pilots and should be amended according to the results of the 3D measurement so that pilots can acquire the optimal cruising posture in flight. This new method has the value of practical application to investigate cockpit ergonomics and the measurement data can guide DEP design. Wang Y, Guo X, Liu Q, Xiao H, Bai Y.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Because a significant association between training to perform emergency free ascent (EFA) and the occurrence of pulmonary barotrauma (PBT) was demonstrated in 2006, the Belgian Underwater Federation (BUF) decided to discontinue this procedure. An evaluation was needed 10 yr after the implementation of this change. METHODS: All medical records with a diagnosis of PBT that occurred in Belgium from November 2006 to September 2016 were prospectively collected. Data on the proportion of in-water skills training dives were obtained from BUF. RESULTS: A total of 5 cases of PBT were identified, significantly down from 34 cases in the previous 10-yr period. Of those cases, four occurred during training dives (two during ascent training). Analysis of the case files furthermore showed that two should have been medically disqualified from diving. Compared with the retrospective cohort (1995–2005), incidences are significantly reduced from 0.83 to 0.078/10,000 training dives and from 3.33 to 0.11/10,000 ascent-training dives; concomitantly, the incidence of PBT in nontraining dives also was reduced (from 0.0042 to 0.0014×10 −4 /10,000 dives), possibly because less divers undertake the EFA procedure in case of a technical incident and have learned to solve the problem differently. DISCUSSION: Discontinuation of emergency free ascent training was associated with a reduction in the incidence of PBT in the 10-yr follow-up period. We observed a significant decrease of PBT during training dives, confirming the hypothesis that EFA training in its previous form did not contribute significantly to diving safety.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The negative effects of hypoxia on human cognitive function have been well documented. In this study we assess the correlation of performance in the SynWin cognitive Multi-Task Battery (MTB) and the onset of hypoxia and describe the use of cognitive assessment scores for real-time hypoxia detection.METHODS: We performed a correlation analysis between MTB scores (Arithmetic, Memory, Audio Monitoring, Video Monitoring tasks) and blood oxygen saturation levels to discover if the scores are good candidates to detect hypoxia. Since this analysis showed positive correlation, we proceeded to develop a parallel decision fusion system that uses these cognitive scores for real-time hypoxia detection using the Neyman-Pearson criterion.RESULTS: We demonstrate that MTB scores have considerable hypoxia detection potential and can be used (if measurable passively) in a real-time detection framework. Analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves established a hierarchy of importance of the various MTB modules. The Arithmetic task module had the most significant contribution toward correct hypoxia detection (improvement of ∼13.5% and ∼13.9% in detection accuracy under global false alarms of 0.1 and 0.05, respectively), followed by the Memory and Audio Monitoring modules. Fusion of multiple cognitive assessment scores resulted in significantly higher detection accuracy (>86%) than using any one of the scores by itself.DISCUSSION: When available, cognitive assessment scores can be a useful tool for real-time hypoxia detection. Since these MTB tests also assess neuropsychological functioning, study of distributed detection systems based on MTB scores could help in designing tests that are more useful for detecting hypoxic symptoms.Rajasekar A, Acharya S, Shender BS, Rorres C, Hrebien L, Kam M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current attempts to culturally tailor human factors training in aviation segregates cultural identities based on geopolitical, passport nationality, and is therefore poorly suited for (adult) ‘Third Culture Kids’ (TCKs) whose cross-cultural upbringing has led to the development of multicultural individual identities that do not reflect their passport nationalities. In this study, respondents’ self-categorization of personal cultural identity, as opposed to passport nationality, was used to determine whether there were cultural differences in airline pilots’ behaviors. METHOD: A survey with items imported from established scales was distributed to pilots of an international airline to measure pilots’ work values, flight management attitudes, and cultural dimensions, with respondents segregated into Western, TCK, or Asian cultural groups. RESULTS: TCKs shared similar work values with Westerners, were similarly individualistic, had comparable preference for shallow command gradients, were similarly pragmatic in self-evaluation of performance under stress, and both had lower dependency and preference for rules and procedures. TCKs scored in the middle between Westerners and Asians in automation preference attitudes, and on the cultural dimensions of power distance and uncertainty avoidance. TCKs did not share any similarities with Asians at all. DISCUSSION: The results show that TCKs were neither assimilated into a mainstream culture, nor culturally “middle of the pack” as may be expected from their “East meets West” backgrounds. Having identified TCK pilots’ unique values, attitudes, and dimensions, practical implications include changing training design to better suit TCKs’ cultural characteristics and the adaptation of airline management to cater for TCKs’ work values.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The evolution and preservation of venous gas emboli (VGE), as markers of decompression stress, were investigated during alternating high- and moderate altitude exposures, thus, simulating a fighter aircraft high-altitude flight, interrupted by refueling excursions to lower altitudes. METHODS: Eight men served as subjects during three normoxic simulated altitude exposures: High = 90 min at 24,000 ft; High-Low = three × 30 min at 24,000 ft, interspersed by two 30-min intervals at 15,000 ft; Low = 90 min at 15,000 ft. VGE scores were assessed by cardiac ultrasound, using a 5-grade scale. Respiratory nitrogen exchange was measured continuously using a modified closed-circuit electronic rebreather. RESULTS: Both High and High-Low induced persistent VGE, with no inter-condition difference either at rest [median (range): High: 1 (0-3), High-Low: 2 (0-3)] or during unloaded knee-bends [High: 3 (1-4), High-Low: 3 (0-4)], whereas VGE was considerably less in Low, both at rest [0 (0-1)] and during knee-bends [0 (0-2)]. In High-Low, VGE decreased temporarily during the 15,000-ft excursions, but resumed pre-excursion values upon return to 24,000 ft. During the final descent to ground level, VGE were more persistent following High-Low than High. In both High and Low, nitrogen was continuously washed out at altitude, whereas in High-Low, the washout at 24,000 ft was interrupted by nitrogen uptake at 15,000 ft. DISCUSSION: In normoxic conditions, long-duration flying at a cabin altitude of 24,000 ft is associated with substantial VGE occurrence, which is not abolished by intermittent excursions to a cabin altitude of 15,000 ft.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The risks associated with high positive G z (+G z ) aerobatic flight, especially with respect to +G z -induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC), are well known. Less appreciated is the effect of negative G z (−G z ) flight on subsequent +G z maneuvers, known as the “push-pull effect.” This is an example involving the loss of an F-16 and pilot that was caused by the push-pull effect. CASE REPORT: The mishap pilot (MP) was killed during a training flight when his F-16 crashed without an ejection attempt. The MP, while transitioning from prolonged −G z flight to sustained +G z flight, maneuvered the mishap aircraft (MA) from −2.06 G z to +8.56 G z in less than 5 s. At this point, there were only minimal control inputs for 5 s, indicating the MP experienced transient incapacitation, most likely due to G-LOC or almost loss of consciousness (A-LOC). The MP’s subsequent recovery attempt was interrupted by ground impact. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) concluded the MP experienced G-LOC due to the push-pull effect. DISCUSSION: Since this is not the first time the push-pull effect has resulted in G-LOC mishaps, the adverse effects of such maneuvers should continue to be emphasized during military physiological training, as well as during general aviation (GA) aerobatics training. Furthermore, A-LOC, instead of being considered a discrete phenomenon, may need to be included in a broader G-LOC definition that encompasses the entire continuum of G-LOC and A-LOC. Metzler MM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a well-known hazard in aviation. In military fighter communities, policies have evolved to allow for in-flight use of pharmacological vigilance aids to counteract the negative effects of fatigue. With limited objective evidence supporting the role of these medications in continuous flight operations, the present study seeks to evaluate whether use of modafinil is associated with pilot aircraft carrier landing performance.METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was completed following carrier-based flight operations in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. All graded landing passes were included in the analysis. Mixed-effect multivariate linear regression analysis was utilized for the primary outcome of landing signal officer grade of landing performance following combat sorties for events with reported in-flight use of modafinil.RESULTS: A total of 1122 sorties were flown by 79 different pilots with an average landing pass grade of 3.86. The primary outcome of modafinil use in-flight was not generally associated with landing performance. In a subset analysis of more senior ranked aviators, modafinil use appeared to offer a relative performance improvement back to baseline (+0.19). Secondary outcome analysis revealed landing performance was associated with advanced landing technologies (+0.25), sorties later in deployment (+0.05 per 30 d), total career carrier landings (+0.03 per 100 traps), and longer mission duration (-0.04 per hour).DISCUSSION: In the context of evidence supporting subjective benefits of vigilance aid use by aircrew, the results of this study provide ample objective support to the controlled use of modafinil in the operational environment.Schallhorn CS.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Motion sickness is a problem for many; however, it is especially pressing for military personnel who need to operate in life and death environments. The current study investigated the underlying cause of motion sickness by testing postural instability theory. METHODS: Subjects experienced realistic motion profiles while performing a virtual reality shooting task and reporting any motion sickness symptoms. Postural instability was manipulated within 20 subjects across 2 conditions. In one condition, subjects could readily adapt their posture to the motion profile by adjusting their feet on the platform (Free), and in the other condition, their feet were fixed in place on the moving platform (Fixed). This Free condition decreased postural instability by allowing adjustment, while the Fixed condition increased postural instability by restricting adjustment. The same subjects completed both conditions to control for individual differences in motion sickness susceptibility. RESULTS: Overall, motion sickness was mild as measured by SSQ ( M 14.41, Free; M 18.89, Fixed), and no statistically significant differences were observed between the conditions. Performance on the shooting task was reduced in accuracy by approximately 40%, although this result did not differ between conditions. DISCUSSION: The results do not support postural instability as a contributing factor in motion sickness symptomology. They also demonstrate the importance of accounting for motion when conducting training. Pettijohn KA, Pistone DV, Warner AL, Roush GJ, Biggs AT.

Autonomic dysfunction can produce orthostatic intolerance with resultant symptoms and is aeromedically concerning for potential occurrence in flight. Vitamin B12 deficiency is an insidious condition with protean manifestations, which can present with autonomic dysfunction. Neurological abnormalities are often reversible following adequate replacement. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of vitamin B12 deficiency in a pilot with atypical syncope and abnormal tilt-table testing who had progressively abnormal hematologic findings on review. He was also discovered to have intrinsic factor antibodies. After B12 replacement, he had normal cardiovascular response to exercise stress testing and an unremarkable centrifuge assessment. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the importance of recognizing subtle laboratory findings and serial laboratory data review in cases of atypical syncope to identify potential reversible etiologies.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pilot workload assessment plays an important role on flight safety evaluation, interface design, and airworthiness certification. The design of an effective and reliable workload assessment method is a difficult problem in the human factors field. METHOD: This study proposed to assess pilot workload from four dimensions: cognitive activity, control activity, stress, and flight performance. A set of physiological, behavioral, and flight parameters were recorded and combined hierarchically to achieve overall workload assessment. A simulated flight experiment consisting of three flight phases (standard instrument departure, autopilot cruise, and nonprecision approach) was conducted to test the effectiveness of the proposed workload assessment method. RESULT: Experimental results determined the changes of each objective measure. The overall workload index could significantly distinguish the difference in workload caused by changing task difficulty and the result was consistent with the NASA-TLX. The four workload dimensions provided detailed differences about workload: during nonprecision approach there were more control activities and stress than in other flight phases; during autopilot cruise there were the least control activities and the highest flight performance. The correlation between workload dimensions provided extra diagnostic information: the cognitive and control activities in the approach phase were more stressful than in the takeoff phase; the correlation between control activity and performance was higher in the approach phase than in the takeoff phase. CONCLUSION: This study proposed an effective pilot workload assessment method which could also provide detailed and diagnostic information. It could be used as an auxiliary tool for the development and evaluation of pilot-cockpit interaction. Wang Z, Lu Y, Fu S. A multidimensional method for pilot workload assessment and diagnosis .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to low oxygen environments (hypoxia) can impair cognitive function; however, the time-course of the transient changes in cognitive function is unknown. In this study, we assessed cognitive function with a cognitive test before, during, and after exposure to hypoxia. METHODS: Nine participants (28 4 yr, 7 women) completed Conners Continuous Performance Test (CCPT-II) during three sequential conditions: 1) baseline breathing room air (fraction of inspired oxygen, F I o 2 0.21); 2) acute hypoxia (F I o 2 0.118); and 3) recovery after exposure to hypoxia. End-tidal gas concentrations (waveform capnography), heart rate (electrocardiography), frontal lobe tissue oxygenation (near infrared spectroscopy), and mean arterial pressure (finger photoplethysmography) were continuously assessed. RESULTS: Relative to baseline, during the hypoxia trial end-tidal (-30%) and cerebral (-9%) oxygen saturations were reduced. Additionally, the number of commission errors during the CCPT-II was greater during hypoxia trials than baseline trials (2.6 0.4 vs. 1.9 0.4 errors per block of CCPT-II). However, the reaction time and omission errors did not differ during the hypoxia CCPT-II trials compared to baseline CCPT-II trials. During the recovery CCPT-II trials, physiological indices of tissue hypoxia all returned to baseline values and number of commission errors during the recovery CCPT-II trials was not different from baseline CCPT-II trials. DISCUSSION: Oxygen concentrations were reduced (systemically and within the frontal lobe) and commission errors were increased during hypoxia compared to baseline. These data suggest that frontal lobe hypoxia may contribute to transient impairments in cognitive function during short exposures to hypoxia.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In-flight medical emergencies (IFMEs) average 1 of every 604 flights and are expected to increase as the population ages and air travel increases. Flight diversions, or the rerouting of a flight to an alternate destination, occur in 2 to 13% of IFME cases, but may or may not be necessary as determined after the fact. Estimating the effect of IFME diversions compared to nonmedical diversions can be expected to improve our understanding of their impact and allow for more appropriate decision making during IFMEs. METHODS: The current study matched multiple disparate datasets, including medical data, flight plan and track data, passenger statistics, and financial data. Chi-squared analysis and independent samples t -tests compared diversion delays and costs metrics between flights diverted for medical vs. nonmedical reasons. Data were restricted to domestic flights between 1/1/2018 and 6/30/2019. RESULTS: Over 70% of diverted flights recover (continue on to their intended destination after diverting); however, flights diverted due to IFMEs recover more often and more quickly than do flights diverted for nonmedical reasons. IFME diversions introduce less delay overall and cost less in terms of direct operating costs and passenger value of time (averaging around 38,000) than do flights diverted for nonmedical reasons. DISCUSSION: Flights diverted due to IFMEs appear to have less impact overall than do flights diverted for nonmedical reasons. However, the lack of information related to costs for nonrecovered flights and the decision factors involved during nonmedical diversions hinders our ability to offer further insights.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objectives were to assess the prevalence, severity, and medication taken, and to look for predictive factors in order to better identify characteristics of passengers at risk of motion sickness during transport from Hobart in Tasmania to the French polar stations in Antarctica. METHODS: There were 239 passengers who were surveyed over 4 yr with 4 round trips per year using the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ), Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), state-trait anxiety test (STAI-Trait and STAI-State), and general parameters (age, gender, number of trips, jet-lag, direction of the trip), medication, calculation of the distance of each passengers cabin to the center of gravity (CoG). RESULTS: While the passengers had a low intrinsic sensitivity to motion sickness (MSSQ), 94 reported at least one SSQ symptom of motion sickness, and 38 vomited. Five associated factors were discovered: greater initial sensitivity (MSSQ), anticipation of being ill, younger age, higher level of anxiety at midtrip, and greater distance from the CoG. Of the passengers, there were 54 who took anti-motion sickness medication at different times of the trip, however, these passengers experienced more nausea. This could be due to self-selection since they were more sensitive to motion sickness. CONCLUSION: We identified three predictive factors of motion sickness (greater intrinsic susceptibility, younger age, and greater cabin distance from the CoG). For preventive purposes, two associated factors of MS (anticipation of being ill, MSSQ score) were determined to classify three groups of risk of MS to improve passenger care during the trip.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently it is not unusual for general aviation pilots in the United States to continue to fly beyond the age of 70, even into their 80s and 90s. Pilots have regular examinations according to protocols which do not specify special or additional requirements for pilots over 70 yr of age. Additionally, the third class medical reforms passed by the U.S. Senate on 15 July 2016 could potentially result in even less stringent medical certification requirements for general aviation pilots. METHODS: Accident rates, medical parameters, autopsy findings, and toxicological findings from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) general aviation (GA) accident database were analyzed to assess potential risk factors with accident outcomes. RESULTS: During 2003–2012, there were 114 (113 men, 1 woman) general aviation fatal accidents involving pilots ages 70 to 92 yr. A combination of 3 or more drugs were found in 13 (13%) of deceased pilots. The most frequent drugs were first generation antihistamines and antidepressants represented the next highest proportion of possible performance-affecting medications. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that there are critical medical factors that may contribute to fatal accidents among elderly pilots. Polypharmacy use should be taken into consideration, especially during periodic health examinations and fatal aviation investigations involving elderly pilots.Vuorio A, Asmayawati S, Budowle B, Griffiths R, Strandberg T, Kuoppala J, Sajantila A.

    "abstract": "This study explores the U.S. experience with waivers for insulin treatment for third-class medical certificates. From 1997 through 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved an estimated 1500 waivers for insulin-treated diabetes with a total of 450 active waivers as of December 31, 2014. These pilots were involved in 25 accidents, but none were attributed to medical issues.Data for the insulin waiver group and control group were obtained from the FAA's aeromedical certification system and matching accident data from the NTSB database. A logistic regression model comparing accidents in this group to the overall population of third-class certificate holders adjusted for gender, age, and flight times was performed. A novel technique for calculating accident rates was also employed.No statistically significant association between waivers for insulin treatment and accident risk was found by logistic regression. The overall accident rate for pilots possessing an insulin waiver was 7.0 per 100,000 flight hours and an estimate for all third-class pilots was also 7.0 per 100,000 flight hours. Only 8% of waivers for insulin treatment were later terminated for adverse changes related to the applicant's diabetes. Of these pilots, 8% also had coronary artery disease severe enough to require its own waiver.Taken together, these findings suggest that pilots holding special issuance waivers for insulin-treated diabetes are not detectably less safe than other airmen with third-class medical certificates and most are able to successfully comply with the FAA's stringent medical certification protocol for insulin treated diabetes.Mills WD, DeJohn CA, Alaziz M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The minimum flight crew on the flight deck should be established according to the workload for individual crewmembers. Typical workload measures consist of three types: subjective rating scale, task performance, and psychophysiological measures. However, all these measures have their own limitations. To reflect flight crew workload more specifically and comprehensively within the flight environment, and more directly comply with airworthiness regulations, the Workload Function Distribution Method, which combined the basic six workload functions, was proposed. METHODS: The analysis was based on the different conditions of workload function numbers. Each condition was analyzed from two aspects, which were overall proportion and effective proportion. Three types of approach tasks were used in this study and the NASA-TLX scale was implemented for comparison. RESULTS: Neither the one-function condition nor the two-function condition had the same results with NASA-TLX. However, both the three-function and the four- to six- function conditions were identical with NASA-TLX. Further, the significant differences were different on four to six conditions. The overall proportion was insignificant, while the effective proportions were significant. DISCUSSION: The results show that the conditions with one function and two functions seemed to have no influence on workload, while executing three functions and four to six functions had an impact on workload. Besides, effective proportions of workload functions were more precisely compared with the overall proportions to indicate workload, especially in the conditions with multiple functions.Zheng Y, Lu Y, Jie Y, Fu S.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The American military is embarking on the ‘Third Offset’—a strategy designed to produce seismic shifts in the future of warfare. Central to the approach is the conjoining of humans, technology, and machines to deliver a decisive advantage on the battlefield. Because technology will spread rapidly and globally, tactical overmatch will occur when American operators possess a competitive edge in cognition. Investigation of cognitive enhancing therapeutics is not widely articulated as an adjunct to the Third Offset, yet failure to study promising agents could represent a strategic vulnerability. Because of its legacy of research into therapeutic agents to enhance human-machine interplay, the aerospace medical community represents a front-running candidate to perform this work. Notably, there are strong signals emanating from gambling, academic, and video-gaming enterprises that already-developed stimulants and other agents provide cognitive benefits. These agents should be studied not only for reasons of national security, but also because cognitive enhancement may be a necessary step in the evolution of humankind. To illustrate these points, this article will assert that: 1) the need to preserve and enhance physical and cognitive health will become more and more important over the next century; 2) aeromedical specialists are in a position to take the lead in the endeavor to enhance cognition; 3) signals of enhancement of the type useful to both military and medical efforts exist aplenty in today’s society; and 4) the aeromedical community should approach human enhancement research deliberately but carefully.Malish RG.

    "abstract": "Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT) helicopters fly at altitudes of 3000 m in Afghanistan (9843 ft). Civilian hospitals and disaster-relief surgical teams may have to operate at such altitudes or even higher. Mild hypoxia has been seen to affect the performance of novel tasks at flight levels as low as 5000 ft. Aeromedical teams frequently work in unpressurized environments; it is important to understand the implications of this mild hypoxia and investigate whether supplementary oxygen systems are required for some or all of the team members.Ten UK orthopedic surgeons were recruited and in a double blind randomized experimental protocol, were acutely exposed for 45 min to normobaric hypoxia [fraction of inspired oxygen (FIo2) ∼14.1%, equivalent to 3000 m (10,000 ft)] or normobaric normoxia (sea-level). Basic physiological parameters were recorded. Subjects completed validated tests of verbal working memory capacity (VWMC) and also applied an orthopedic external fixator (Hoffmann® 3, Stryker, UK) to a plastic tibia under test conditions.Significant hypoxia was induced with the reduction of FIo2 to ∼14.1% (Spo2 87% vs. 98%). No effect of hypoxia on VWMC was observed. The pin-divergence score (a measure of frame asymmetry) was significantly greater in hypoxic conditions (4.6 mm) compared to sea level (3.0 mm); there was no significant difference in the penetrance depth (16.9 vs. 17.2 mm). One hypoxic frame would have failed early.We believe that surgery at an altitude of 3000 m, when unacclimated individuals are acutely exposed to atmospheric hypoxia for 45 min, can likely take place without supplemental oxygen use but further work is required.Parker PJ, Manley AJ, Shand R, O'Hara JP, Mellor A.

The prevalence of prescription drugs, OTC drugs, controlled drugs and drugs that may be potentially impairing was also examined. METHODS: This study was a descriptive observational study in which the NTSB Aviation Accident Database was searched from the period beginning January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014. RESULTS: During the study period a total of 706 accidents involving 711 fatalities were investigated by the NTSB. This study included 633 of these accidents, involving 646 fatalities. Of these pilots, 42.1% had drugs in their biological samples. The prevalence of prescription drugs, controlled drugs, OTC drugs, opioids, and potentially impairing drugs in the fatally injured pilot population over the study period was 28.9%, 15.0%, 20.1%, 5.1%, and 25.5%, respectively. Pilots with any drugs in their samples were significantly older than those without drugs. Medical certificate held was associated with drug use; pilots who held third class certificates had the highest prevalence at 54.1%. Pilot license was not associated with drug use. In 3.8% of the accidents, drugs were a contributing factor in the cause. DISCUSSION: Despite current FAA medical regulations, potentially impairing drugs are frequently found in biological samples of fatally injured pilots in the U.S. More education of airmen by aviation medical examiners is needed on the safety of drug use.Akparibo IY, Stolfi A.

This study examined the influence of cerebral oxygenation and perfusion on executive function during exercise and recovery in normobaric hypoxia (NH) and normoxia (N). METHODS: There were 18 subjects who completed cycling trials in NH (12.5% F I o 2 ) and N (20.93% F I o 2 ). Right prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxyhemoglobin (O 2 Hb) and middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAbv) were collected during executive function challenges [mathematical processing and running memory continuous performance task (RMCPT)] at baseline, following 30 min of acclimation, during 20 min of cycling (60% Vo 2max ), and at 1, 15, 30, and 45 min following exercise. RESULTS: Results indicated effects of time for Math, RMCPT, and O 2 Hb; but not for MCAbv. Results also indicated effects of condition for O 2 Hb. Math scores were improved by 8.0% during exercise and remained elevated at 30 min of recovery (12.5%), RMCPT scores significantly improved at all time points (7.5–11.9%), and O 2 Hb increased by 662.2% and 440.9% during exercise in N and NH, respectively, and remained elevated through 15 min of recovery in both conditions.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An aircraft’s orientation relative to the ground cannot be perceived via the sense of balance or the somatosensory system. When devoid of external visual references, the pilot must rely on instruments. A sudden unexpected instrument indication is a challenge to the pilot, who might have to question the instrument instead of responding with the controls. In this case report we analyze, from a human-factors perspective, how a limited instrument failure led to a fatal accident. CASE REPORT: During straight-ahead level flight in darkness, at 33,000 ft, the commander of a civil cargo airplane was suddenly confronted by an erroneous pitch-up indication on his primary flight display. He responded by pushing the control column forward, making a bunt maneuver with reduced/negative G z during approximately 15 s. The pilots did not communicate rationally or cross-check instruments. Recordings of elevator and aileron positions suggest that the commander made intense efforts to correct for several extreme and erroneous roll and pitch indications. G z displayed an increasing trend with rapid fluctuations and peaks of approximately 3 G. After 50 s the aircraft entered a turn with decreasing radius and finally hit the ground in an inverted attitude. DISCUSSION: A precipitate maneuvring response can, even if occurring in a large aircraft at high altitude, result in a seemingly inexorable course of events, ending with a crash. In the present case both pilots were probably incapacitated by acute psychological stress and spatial disorientation. Intense variations in G z may have impaired the copilot’s reading of the functioning primary flight display.Tribukait A, Eiken O.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laser devices are ubiquitous in everyday operations. These devices pose a hazard to the eye and numerous injuries have been documented. However, there lies a misunderstanding in the propensity to damage aircrews’ eyes during an exposure. Patient encounters and article review is presented in hopes to raise awareness that aircrew laser exposure at altitude, outside of critical phases of flight, is a distraction and not a threat. Also, to propose a change to Air Force policy regarding such exposures and further educating flight surgeons. METHODS: An electronic medical record (EMR) search at a deployed clinic was performed from July 2016 through Jan 2017. The “reason for visit” column was perused for any reference to the eye and laser exposure. Subsequently, the patient encounters were scrutinized specifically for eye injury, optometry visit, color of laser, and suspension of flight duties. All members were military aircrew spanning loadmasters, boom operators, and pilots. No protective lenses or other forms of optics were employed at time of exposure. RESULTS: There were 21 encounters reviewed; 1 patient was seen twice due to 2 separate instances. Of the encounters, 14 were green lasers, 6 did not comment, and 1 indicated white. Zero acute injuries were discovered. DISCUSSION: Patients were needlessly sent for further examination and prohibited from performing their duties. Following military patient encounters and civilian literature regarding laser injury, the evidence highly supports the hypothesis that hand-held laser exposure in flight from a ground base does not engender eye injury. More emphasis should be placed on recognizing the laser threat as a distraction or disruption to critical phases of flight, and a policy change may be in order for the USAF laser exposure guide.Dietrich KC.

The efficacy of PFC in a mixed gender model of DCS and safety in recompression therapy has not been previously explored.Swine (25 kg; N = 104; 51 male and 53 female) were randomized into normal saline solution (NSS) or PFC emulsion treatment groups and subjected to compression on air in a hyperbaric chamber at 200 fsw for 31 min. Then the animals were decompressed and observed for signs of DCS. Afterwards, they were treated with oxygen and either PFC (4 cc · kg-1) or NSS (4 cc · kg-1). Surviving animals were observed for 4 h, at which time they underwent recompression therapy using a standard Navy Treatment Table 6. After 24 h the animals were assessed and then euthanized.Survival rates were not significantly different between NSS (74.04%) and PFC (66.67%) treatment groups. All swine that received recompression treatment survived to the end of the study and no seizures were observed in either PFC or NSS animals. Within the saline treated swine group there were no significant differences in DCS survival between male (75.00%, N = 24) and female (73.08%, N = 26) swine. Within the PFC treated swine, survival of females (51.85%, N = 27) was significantly lower than males (81.48%, N = 27).In this large animal mixed gender efficacy study in DCS, PFC did not improve mortality or spinal cord injury, but appears safe during recompressive therapy. Gender differences in DCS treatment with PFC will need further study.Cronin WA, Hall AA, Auker CR, Mahon RT.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to establish a dynamic animal model of sinus barotrauma (SB). METHODS: The right nasal cavities of 65 rabbits were filled with sponges to obstruct the right ostiomeatal complex (OMC), while in the left nasal cavities, the left OMC was kept clear. The rabbits were exposed to hypobaric chamber simulation. The right sinuses were assigned as the model group, randomly divided into 13 subgroups with 5 in each subgroup, while the left sinuses were assigned as the control group. The hypobaric chamber simulation involved 6 pairs of ascending/descending speeds (100 m · s −1 , 75 m · s −1 , 50 m · s −1 ) to 2 altitudes (13,123 ft or 6562 ft). The ascending/descending speed for Model Group 13 was 15 m · s −1 to an altitude of 13,123 ft. The control group was not exposed to hypobaric chamber simulation or obstruction of the OMC. All rabbits were monitored for behavior and via nasal endoscopy, MRI, and mucosal pathology, and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: SB appeared at the ascending/descending speeds of 50 m · s −1 , 75 m · s −1 , and 100 m · s −1 . SB was more obvious at 100 m · s −1 than at 50 m · s −1 and 75 m · s −1 , and SB happened mainly at altitudes between 0-6562 ft. Based on behavior during hypobaric chamber simulation and the results of endoscopic morphology, imaging, and cell pathology, SB could be divided into mild, moderate, and severe. DISCUSSION: By obstructing the OMC and using hypobaric chamber simulation at high ascending/descending speeds and altitude, a dynamic rabbit model of SB at various degrees was established. The severity of SB was proportional to the ascending/descending speeds and mainly seen below 6562 ft.Xu X, Wang B, Jin Z, Zhang Y.

METHODS: A search of PubMed using combinations of the key terms ‘prehospital,’ ‘blood product,’ ‘red blood cells,’ ‘damage control resuscitation,’ ‘transfusion,’ ‘air ambulance,’ ‘medical evacuation,’ and ‘medevac’ yielded 196 articles for further analysis, with 14 articles suitable for addressing the background of prehospital transfusion within a helicopter. Retrospective analysis of unclassified briefs, after action reports, and procedures was also undertaken along with interview of subject matter experts. The initial series of 15 transfusions were discussed telephonically among flight crew, trauma surgeons, and lab specialists. Review of Joint Theater System data was readily available for 84 U.S. Army air ambulance transfusions between May-December 2012, with December marking the redeployment of the 25 th Combat Aviation Brigade. RESULTS: Standardized implementation enabled safe blood product administration for 84 causalities from May-December 2012 without blood product shortage, expiration, or transfusion reaction. Challenges included developing transfusion competency, achieving high quality blood support, countering the potential for anti-U.S. sentiment, and diversity in coalition transfusion practices. DISCUSSION: Blood product administration aboard the air ambulance is logistically complex, requiring blood bank integration. Repetitive training enabled emergency medical technicians (EMTs) with basic medical training to safely perform transfusion in accordance with clinical operating guidelines. In the austere environment, logistic factors are significant challenges and political sensitivities are important considerations.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although harness suspension trauma has been documented since the 1960s, especially in the mountaineering setting, there is little robust medical research into the area. Helicopter hoist rescue shares similar risks and is reserved for those cases that cannot be accessed safely by other routes, where extrication may be hazardous or will take an unreasonable amount of time. The single sling or chest harness used for hoist rescue is a single harness around the upper torso and is easier and quicker to apply than a stretcher. However, the risks of a chest harness need to be balanced against the patient’s condition, the environment, aircraft performance, and the urgency of the rescue. CASE REPORT: We report an adult male falling 80 ft to his death while being hoisted into a rescue helicopter for a likely fractured ankle. A single rescue sling harness technique was used, but the patient became unconscious, slipped out of the harness, and fell. He had significant comorbidities, including cardiomyopathy, obstructive sleep apnea, morbid obesity, and diabetes. DISCUSSION: A decrease in cardiac output secondary to thoracic compression was the presumed cause for his loss of consciousness and the potential physiological mechanisms and modifying factors are discussed. Further research into harness suspension trauma is required. Stretcher, double point harnesses, or rescue baskets are likely safer methods of hoisting, especially in a medically compromised patient.Biles J, Garner AA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To flip a switch “down,” our motor system can normally rely on concordant visual, gravitational, and egocentric cues about the vertical. However, divers must sometimes perform this task while visual cues are limited and gravitational cues are misaligned with egocentric cues. Astronauts must also flip switches “down” in absence of gravitational cues. Our study evaluates this ability using a laboratory simulation. METHODS: The subjects were 24 healthy volunteers who were blindfolded, tilted into different angles of roll, and asked to silence an alarm by flipping a switch “down.” The switch was constructed such that it could be flipped in any direction in the subjects’ frontal plane. RESULTS: Two subjects deflected the switch in accordance with the direction of gravity, irrespective of their body orientation. Twenty subjects deflected it in accordance with their body orientation, irrespective of the direction of gravity. The remaining two persons could not be classified unequivocally. Notably, some egocentric responders deflected the rod consistently toward their feet, but others deflected it consistently toward other parts of their body. DISCUSSION: Since our findings disagree with perceptual studies where gravitational rather than egocentric cues predominated in the absence of vision, we posit that perception and action may access distinct internal representations of the vertical. On the practical side, our findings indicate that designers of spaceflight and underwater equipment should not rely on divers’ intuitive knowledge on how to flip a switch “down.”Bock O, Bury N.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: An experiment in a program of research supporting the sense-assess-augment (SAA) framework is described. The objective is to use physiological measures to assess operator cognitive workload in remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) operations, and provide augmentation to assist the operator in times of high workload. In previous experiments, physiological measures were identified that demonstrate sensitivity to changes in workload. The current research solely focuses on the augmentation component of the SAA paradigm. This line of research uses a realistic RPA simulation with varying levels of workload. METHODS: Recruited from the Midwest region were 12 individuals (6 women) to participate in the experiment. The subjects were trained to perform a surveillance task and a tracking task using RPAs. There was also a secondary task in which subjects were required to answer cognitive probes. A within subjects factorial design was employed with three factors per task. Subjective workload estimates were acquired using the NASA-TLX. Performance data were calculated using a composite scoring algorithm. RESULTS: Augmentation significantly improved performance and reduced workload in both tasks. In the surveillance task, augmentation increased performance from 573.78 to 679.04. Likewise, augmentation increased performance in the tracking task from 749.39 to 791.81. Augmentation was more beneficial in high workload conditions than low workload conditions. DISCUSSION: The increase in performance and decrease in workload associated with augmentation is an important and anticipated finding. This suggests that augmentation should only be provided when it is truly needed, especially if the augmentation requires additional assets and/or resources.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that can affect a pilot’s health. The aim of the study was to establish the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the German Air Force. METHODS: All German military pilots are examined regularly at the German Air Force Center of Aerospace Medicine. The data are stored in a special database designed for that purpose. A database query was performed. The following parameters were analyzed: age, duration of observation, BMI, physical working capacity (PWC 170), blood pressure, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose. RESULTS: For the time period of 1996 to 2016, the data of 12,014 pilots were analyzed. Overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 0.9% (95% CI 0.7–1.1%). Participants with a metabolic syndrome had a significantly higher BMI (28.3 vs. 24.1), lower PWC 170 (2.3 vs. 2.7) and higher ESR (4.7 vs. 3.6, mm first hour) than the healthy participants. On average, BMI gradually increased over the years and PWC 170 decreased over the years in all participants. There was no increase of the prevalence of metabolic syndrome during the observational period.

This study examined 10 yr of medical records contained in the U.S. Army Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office (AERO) in an effort to identify the most prevalent conditions affecting Army aviator career longevity. METHODS: This study was a retrospective epidemiological review; data were retrieved on 24,568 rated aircrew patients from the AERO database, of whom 5.2% were women. The dataset was composed of a total of 181,471 cases between June 2005 and June 2015. Age ranged from 17 to 73 yr. The data were examined in terms of raw ICD-9 diagnostic codes, derived systems-based categories, and occupational consequences. RESULTS: The top 10 diagnoses, causes for waiver, and permanent suspension of aircrew were determined both in terms of the ICD-9 codes and the system groupings. Leading waiver causes included hypertension (11.5%), hearing loss (9.7%), spinal disorder (14.4%), and obstructive sleep apnea (5.2%). Leading permanent suspension causes were psychiatric disorders (28.2%), particularly PTSD, being the leading cause, with spinal pathology (16.1%) second. In almost all diagnostic groupings the Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients between age and diagnosis presence were positively related, although often with no association with negative occupational outcome. DISCUSSION: This study revealed the leading medical causes of waiver and suspension from flying duties, producing evidence to inform leadership understanding of disease prevalence and its subsequent impact on flying status. This is of prime importance to help direct policy and implement strategies for health protection. Curry IP, Kelley AM, Gaydos SJ.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Otitis externa secondary to irritant or chemical exposure is well documented; however, specifically secondary to jet fuel exposure and its associated toxicology is not. Over 2 million military and civilian personnel per year are occupationally exposed to aviation fuels. CASE REPORT: An aircraft maintainer presented with noninfectious acute otitis externa secondary to external ear canal exposure to JP-5 jet fuel. Proper exposure guidelines were followed, but it was not realized that the external ear canal was involved. The first symptoms to emerge were vertigo, dizziness, and disequilibrium; however, on physical exam it appeared that there was no middle ear involvement. DISCUSSION: Otitis externa normally does not present with vestibular symptoms as the pathology affects the external ear canal dermal tissue. Upon review of JP-5’s toxicology profile, dermal absorption is a route of entry and can cause general neurological symptoms, including loss of coordination. This case highlights potential deficiencies in the standardized safety data sheets that are used after exposure. Without mention of possible auricular exposure one may focus on the logical protection of the eyes, mouth, and visible skin. This is concerning due to potential delayed exposure symptoms, dermal absorption, high level of dermal destruction, and the close proximity to the sensory system. The goal of this case report is to improve the knowledge of providers caring for personnel who may be exposed and to suggest possible revisions to the Safety Data Sheets for jet fuel.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies of acute hypoxia have largely examined different altitudes in isolation. Pilots, however, receive two exposures during in-flight hypoxic emergencies (IFHEs): the initial exposure at altitude, followed by a second mild exposure after descending and removing the breathing mask. Conventional wisdom holds that performance recovers with blood oxygen saturation and that exposure to mild hypoxia is safe. This study examined the possibility that the effects of moderate hypoxia may linger to overlap with the effects of mild hypoxia during sequential exposures such as those experienced by pilots during an IFHE. METHODS: Subjects performed a simulated flight task and secondary task while being exposed to normobaric hypoxia via the ROBD-2. RESULTS: Average error on the flight task during exposure to 3048 m (10,000 ft) was marginally worse when preceded by exposure to 7620 m (25,000 ft; 7.40 ± 3.32) than when experienced in isolation (6.42 ± 3.82). Performance on the secondary task was likewise worse when the mild exposure followed the moderate exposure (0.27 ± 0.30 lapses per minute) than when the mild exposure occurred by itself (0.19 ± 0.20 lapses per minute). Minimum S p o 2 showed a similar pattern of results (84.87 ± 4.37 vs. 86.61 ± 2.47). DISCUSSION: We believe our results are most likely due to a failure to recover from the original moderate exposure rather than an additive effect between the exposures. Even so, our findings suggest that pilot impairment following an IFHE may be worse than previously believed. Robinson FE, Horning D, Phillips JB.

This study aimed to determine the rate of such accidents, including passenger fatalities and injuries, across all flight hours and to also compare these types of accidents to those of other commercial air tour crashes. METHODS: Hot-air balloon tour accident reports in the Cappadocia region were analyzed for 1,415,943 passengers during 81,112 flight hours undertaken between August 2013 and July 2017. The flight and accident data were obtained from the Accident Investigation Board and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. RESULTS: There were 12 accidents which occurred during the flight hours examined (a rate of 14.8 accidents per 100,000 h). There were 33 individuals seriously injured, 3 fatally in all passengers (3.7 fatalities per 100,000 h in these flights). The majority of accidents that produced serious and fatal injuries occurred during the last year of the study. The most common cause of accidents was a hard landing (58.3%). All accidents occurred during the landing phase of the flight. Seven patients experienced multiple traumas and lower extremity injuries constituted the majority of cases ( N = 21). DISCUSSION: The fatality rate of commercial balloon rides was lower than that for lighter-than-air craft, which include balloons and blimps (sports aviation flights), and the crash rate of hot-air balloons was higher than those of aircraft (airplanes and helicopters) tour flights. However, there is still insufficient information in the literature to properly compare this activity with commercial motorized aircraft tours and other hot-air balloon flights. Aslaner MA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Visual performance is important for safe and accurate taxiing operations. Visibility is associated with navigation errors during taxiing. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of visibility on pilots’ fixation patterns during taxiing. The interaction between visibility and flight experience was also examined. METHODS: Both experienced and less experienced pilots participated in the study. They were instructed to perform simulated taxiing tasks in two visibility conditions: clear day vs. low visibility. A mixed-model analysis of variance was performed to determine the main and interaction effects of ‘visibility’ and ‘flight experience’ on fixation data in each area of interest (AOI). RESULTS: The results showed that experienced pilots’ fixation counts reduced on the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) area, but increased out the middle view (OTWM) and right view out of the window (OTWR) in low visibility than in clear day, while fixation counts among less experienced pilots increased on the primary flight display (PFD) and ECAM areas, but did not change significantly OTWM and OTWR in low visibility. Fixation duration increased by 59.8%, 9.8%, and 7.9% in ECAM, OTWL, and OTWR, respectively, in low visibility than in clear day. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that pilots pay more attention and have higher perceptual load in the low visibility condition to maintain taxiing accuracy, and more experienced pilots make more visual efforts to extract information from AOIs outside the cockpit in the low visibility condition. These findings provide practical implications for safe and accurate taxiing operations. Zhang X, Qu X, Xue H, Liu J. Pilots’ fixation patterns during taxiing and the effects of visibility .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Due to the risk of hypoglycemia-related incapacitation, diabetic pilots requiring insulin are assessed as unfit according to the International Civil Aviation Organization and most national authorities. Some authorities, such as those from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, permit selected insulin-treated pilots (ITDM-pilots) to fly subject to a protocol requiring pre- and in-flight capillary glucose measurements to show safe levels (&gt;100–&lt;300 mg · dl −1 ). Critics of such permission question the practicability of these in-flight measurements and whether clinically desired glycemic targets can be achieved while keeping glucose levels in the safe range. Subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has recently been approved by the FDA as a stand-alone method to provide accurate glucose levels and treatment decision guidance in patients. This commentary considers that use of CGM by ITDM pilots facilitates practicability and recording of in-flight glucose measurements and facilitates achievement of clinically desired glycemic targets without increasing hypoglycemia risks.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aerospace medicine training is often difficult to obtain outside of military education streams. Undergraduate medical trainees and residents may undertake training opportunities, but often have trouble locating programs and/or receiving credit for their experiences and learning. In many countries, no formal aerospace medicine training program or pathway exists and trainees must search out opportunities on their own. Canada is used as an example of a country which, until recently, had no defined civilian aerospace medicine training program or credentialing pathway. Recent development of a Diploma in Aerospace Medicine certified by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons now outlines a series of competencies for trainees and medical professionals seeking advancement in aerospace medicine. Growth of the aviation and aerospace fields will require more training opportunities and more aerospace medicine professionals to support the increased number of aviators and the spacefaring population. This will be particularly important as commercial space companies develop the potential for civilian spaceflight. While few opportunities exist for training, we highlight the major aerospace medicine training opportunities that have been recently available to Canadians. It is our hope that highlighting previous and current opportunities may aid in the development of a formal training program leading to certification in aerospace medicine for Canadians and act as an example for other nations.Sirek A, Samoil K, Harrison MF.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Physical conditioning may improve aircrew performance during exposure to high +G z acceleration, although few studies have directly assessed this. The present study investigated the effects of a 12-wk Aircrew Conditioning Programme (ACP) on markers of G tolerance. The ACP comprises aerobic and muscle strengthening exercise performed twice weekly and targets improved fitness and reduced injury risk. METHODS: There were 36 UK Royal Air Force and Royal Navy aircrew who volunteered; 17 performed the ACP (Ex) and 19 acted as a control group (Con). Centrifuge testing was performed before and after the intervention. Relaxed G tolerance (RGT) and straining G tolerance (SGT), which had the addition of muscle tensing, were assessed. G endurance was also determined via repeated simulated air combat maneuvers (SACMs). During these centrifuge runs a number of physiological variables were recorded. RESULTS: During the G profile to determine RGT, neither RGT, HR, nor blood pressure responses were affected by the ACP. During SGT profiles, a lower HR at a given +G z (+5.5 G z ) level following the ACP was observed (Ex: pre 146.0 ± 4.4, post 136.9 ± 5.6 bpm; Con: pre 148.0 ± 3.2, post 153.1 ± 3.3 bpm). BP was maintained and there was a tendency toward an improved SGT. The ACP increased the proportion of individuals completing the number of SACM profiles, although no meaningful differences were found between groups in other variables. CONCLUSION: Overall the ACP has no negative effect on RGT, reduced the physiological strain associated with a given level of +G z (during SGT), and tended to improve the ability to tolerate repeated G z exposure.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Critical mission tasks for Martian exploration have been identified and include specific duties that astronauts will have to perform despite any adverse effects of chronic microgravity. Specifically, astronauts may have to perform an emergency capsule egress upon return to Earth, which places specific demands on compromised cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to determine the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and simulated capsule egress time. METHODS: There were 15 subjects who volunteered for this study. Vo 2peak and peak power output (PPO) were determined on cycle and rowing ergometers. Critical power (CP) was determined by a 3-min all-out rowing test. Subjects then performed an emergency capsule egress on a mock-up of NASA’s Orion space capsule. Peak metabolic data were compared between the cycling and rowing tests. Pearson’s correlation was used to identify relationships between egress time and Vo 2peak , PPO, and CP. RESULTS: Vo 2peak , Vco 2peak , and minute ventilation were not different between cycling and rowing tests. Cycling elicited a greater PPO than the rowing test. Egress time was negatively correlated to rowing PPO (r = −0.60), but not cycling or rowing Vo 2peak , cycling PPO, or CP. CONCLUSIONS: Rowing PPO/kg correlates with egress time. Although individuals with higher PPO/kg were able to finish the task in less time, individuals with low fitness levels (Vo 2peak ≤ 20 ml · kg −1 · min −1 ) could complete the egress within 2 mins. These results suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness should not limit emergency egress and that this can be assessed using rowing exercise.

METHODS: This is a retrospective study and includes 46 pilots 40 yr and older with incidentally detected emphysema-like changes (ELCs) comprising blebs or bullae in low-dose chest CT (LDCT) during health screening. Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed imaging features. Statistical analysis was done using independent t -tests and bivariate analysis. RESULTS: Among 46 pilots, 39 pilots flew fast jet aircraft and 7 pilots flew nonfast jet aircraft. The mean follow-up period was 1531 d and the LDCT follow-up interval mean period was 424.4 d. There was no evidence of rupture in incidentally detected ELCs during the follow-up period. The mean size of the ELCs was 19.15 mm. There were five cases showing changes in size. There was a statistically significant correlation between the size of ELCs and height. There were no statistically significant differences in the size or number of ELCs relating to smoking status or aircraft type, and there were no statistically significant correlations between the size or number of ELCs and multiple factors, including smoking quantity, flight time, age, BMI, and weight. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the aeromedical safety of incidentally detected ELCs in pilots 40 yr and older without underlying lung disease. The results indicate no need for recommending preventive treatment for ELCs in pilots 40 yr and older, even those flying fast jet aircraft, as a requisite to continue their flight duties.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was pure tone audiometry (PTA) evaluation in normal individuals exposed to hypobaric hypoxia, taking into account the influence of air rarefaction on sound transmission via a standard earphone. METHODS: The study was conducted in a hypobaric chamber using a standard audiometer and a TDH-39P earphone whose performance at altitudes was analyzed in a previous research. Eight male volunteers underwent PTA testing at ground level and at 15,000 ft under normoxia (via an oxygen mask) and after 20 min of hypoxia. Auditory threshold at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz was recorded from the right ear while monitoring arterial oxygen saturation (S a o 2 ). The PTA data obtained at high altitude were corrected according to a specific recalibration table. RESULTS: During hypoxia, a significant threshold shift was observed only at 4000 Hz, with respect to ground level recording, for the sole not-corrected data. At the same frequency a significant threshold shift was also observed between the ground level recording and normoxia at 15,000 ft, confirming the presence of a hypobaric effect not related to hypoxia. After the recalibration procedure, this hearing impairment was not significant. No correlation with S a o 2 levels was observed. DISCUSSION: The mild and not significant presence of high altitude-induced PTA derangements in healthy normal individuals was documented, although a stimulus recalibration was needed for a correct interpretation of our data.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Airsickness is a clinical syndrome manifesting in a variety of symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting during flight. Studies of habituation to motion sickness in humans treated by scopolamine have produced conflicting results. The drug accelerated habituation, but a rebound effect on symptom severity was observed after its withdrawal. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether scopolamine affects the adaptation process. We also evaluated the relationship between initial symptom severity and adaptation to airsickness. METHODS: Aviator cadets in the first two stages of their training were divided into two groups, treated and not treated by scopolamine. Airsickness severity was evaluated using both simulator sickness and motion sickness questionnaires, and drug administration was recorded. RESULTS: A statistically significant higher rate of adaptation was observed among the scopolamine-treated group compared with the nontreated group. On the simulator sickness questionnaire, rate of adaptation for the two groups was −0.21 ± 0.53 and −0.1 ± 0.17, respectively, and for the motion sickness questionnaire −2.34 ± 1.54 and −0.91 ± 1.41, respectively. Examination of a possible connection between initial symptom severity and adaptation rate failed to reveal a significant relationship. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of oral scopolamine to accelerate habituation and find it a relatively safe short-term treatment for airsickness. Our results support the notion that scopolamine accelerates the natural adaptation process. Doron O, Samuel O, Karfunkel-Doron D, Tal D. Scopolamine treatment and adaptation to airsickness .

    "abstract": "Helicopter flying is a complex psychomotor task requiring continuous control inputs to maintain stable flight and conduct maneuvers. Flight safety is impaired when this psychomotor performance is compromised. A comprehensive understanding of the psychomotor performance of helicopter pilots, under various operational and physiological conditions, remains to be developed. The purpose of this study was to develop a flight simulator-based technique for capturing psychomotor performance data of helicopter pilots.Three helicopter pilots conducted six low-level flight sequences in a helicopter simulator. Accelerometers applied to each flight control recorded the frequency and magnitude of movements.The mean (± SEM) number of control inputs per flight was 2450 (± 136). The mean (± SEM) number of control inputs per second was 1.96 (± 0.15). The mean (± SEM) force applied was 0.44 G (± 0.05 G). No significant differences were found between pilots in terms of flight completion times or number of movements per second. The number of control inputs made by the hands was significantly greater than the number of foot movements. The left hand control input forces were significantly greater than all other input forces.This study shows that the use of accelerometers in flight simulators is an effective technique for capturing accurate, reliable data on the psychomotor performance of helicopter pilots. This technique can be applied in future studies to a wider range of operational and physiological conditions and mission types in order to develop a greater awareness and understanding of the psychomotor performance demands on helicopter pilots.",

METHODS: Nineteen young, healthy men completed Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics-4 th Edition (ANAM4) versions of the mood state test before hypoxia exposure, after 60 min of hypoxia exposure (12.5% O 2 ), and during and after two intensities of cycling exercise (40% and 60% adjusted Vo 2max ) under the same hypoxic conditions. Peripheral oxygen saturation (Spo 2 ) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSo 2 ) were continuously monitored. RESULTS: At rest in hypoxia, Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) was significantly increased compared to baseline in both the 40% and 60% groups. TMD was significantly decreased during exercise compared to rest in hypoxia. TMD was also significantly decreased during recovery compared to rest in hypoxia. Spo 2 significantly decreased at 60 min rest in hypoxia, during exercise, and recovery compared to baseline. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation was also reduced at 60 min rest in hypoxia, during exercise, and recovery compared to baseline. DISCUSSION: The current study demonstrated that exercise at 40% and 60% of adjusted Vo 2max attenuated the adverse effects of hypoxia on mood. These findings may have significant applied value, as negative mood states are known to impair performance in hypoxia.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Debate regarding the merits of screening pilots for sleep apnea has been stimulated by recently issued guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration. It has long been appreciated that sleep apnea results in poor quality sleep, and that poor quality sleep is associated with daytime fatigue and decrements in performance. However, the relationship between sleep apnea and poor performance, including risk for accidents is not as well understood. Good quality data are available for commercial truck drivers and have helped influence transportation policy, but there is a lack of pilot specific data. The purpose of this article is to review the basic epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of sleep apnea, including major risk factors for apnea, such as body mass index (BMI), and to look at what is known about the impact of sleep apnea on performance in transportation related occupations. While pilot specific data may be lacking, good quality data for commercial truckers are available and can be used to formulate rational public policy with the goal of improving aviation safety.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Radio communication remains important for the delivery of safety-critical information in military aviation. Pilots are exposed to high noise levels. Noise attenuation provided by certain helmets is not sufficient, and resulting noise exposure can deteriorate operational effectiveness and flight safety. A need for hearing protection that enables efficient communication is obvious, especially for fighter and helicopter pilots. One possible solution for this issue is molded communication earplugs (m-CEP). Data about the advantages and disadvantages of m-CEPs are limited. METHODS: To determine the usage rates, advantages, disadvantages and pilot opinions about m-CEPs, an anonymous survey study including 31 questions was conducted in fighter, fighter trainer, helicopter, and transport aircraft units of the Finnish Defense Forces. RESULTS: Of the pilots who responded, 136 (93%) had used or tried m-CEPs and 90 (62%) were currently using them. There are many benefits to m-CEPs: they seem to enhance experienced speech intelligibility, since 85% of the pilots who had experience about them reported improved speech intelligibility under difficult hearing conditions, and 93% would recommend them to other pilots. It seems m-CEPs provide equal benefits to pilots with and without current hearing problems. They were also considered better than previously used hearing protectors. Still, problems were common: 82% of the pilots reported m-CEP related drawbacks, of which technical problems and discomfort issues were the most prevalent. DISCUSSION: Most military pilots hold a positive opinion on m-CEPs and are willing to recommend their use. Technical problems and discomfort issues are, however, relatively common.Lahtinen TMM, Leino TK. Molded communication earplugs in military aviation . Aerosp Med Hum Perform. 2015;86(9):808–814.",

Recompression may not be immediately available. First aid oxygen (FAo₂) can be administered; however, there is no direct evidence of its efficacy in this scenario.Trials were conducted between 2004 and 2006. Goats exposed to raised pressure for 24 h ('saturation') were either returned directly to atmospheric pressure (Phase A, N = 40) or exposed to simulated submarine escape at a depth of 656 ft (200 m; assumed seawater density = 1019.72 kg · m(-3); Phase B, N = 39). The pressure during saturation was selected to provoke 50% DCI. Cases of DCI were randomly assigned to receive FAo₂or air.DCI cases were: limb pain in 39 subjects, neurological in 6, respiratory in 4, and pulmonary barotrauma in 1 subject. In Phase A, 5/12 subjects in the FAo₂group and 0/11 in the air control group achieved permanent resolution of DCI. In Phase B, 6/8 subjects in the FAo₂group and 5/8 in the air control group achieved permanent resolution. In both Phases, levels of venous gas bubbles reduced sooner with FAo₂. Of three cases of neurological DCI receiving FAo₂, two showed permanent resolution. In total, four cases of respiratory DCI occurred; none of these resolved, with three being treated with FAo₂and one in the air control.Oxygen can be an effective first aid measure for DCI following submarine escape. However, it should not be used as a replacement for recompression therapy.",

It is not considered disqualifying for the pilot’s training program of the Israeli Air Force as long as there are no related symptoms or associated pathologies. During combat flight, increased venous pressure due to acceleration forces and anti-G straining maneuvers, used to counteract high gravitational G forces, can theoretically aggravate the venous blood pooling in varicocele, leading to rupture. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a young fighter-jet pilot presenting with a painful inguinal hematoma extending to the scrotum a day after participating in centrifuge training. Sonographic examination demonstrated dilated spermatic veins and intratesticular varicocele along with subcutaneous thickening of the scrotal wall consistent with hematoma. DISCUSSION: The effects of high G loads on blood flow in spermatic veins, and especially in varicocele, still need to be determined. Varicocele rupture has been described in relation to increased intra-abdominal pressure and could theoretically occur during anti-G straining maneuvers. Such an acute adverse event during combat flight can be detrimental to flight safety and the pilot’s well-being.Kampel L, Klang E, Winkler H, Gordon B, Frenkel-Nir Y, Shoam YE.

Effective HSI incorporates several domains, including manpower, personnel and training, human factors, environment, safety, occupational health, habitability, survivability, logistics, intelligence, mobility, and command and control. To achieve effective HSI, the relationships among these domains must be considered. Although this integrated approach is well documented, there are many instances where it is not followed. Human factors engineers typically focus on system design with little attention to the skills, abilities, and other characteristics needed by human operators. When problems with fielded systems occur, additional training of personnel is developed and conducted. Personnel selection is seldom considered during the HSI process. Complex systems such as aviation require careful selection of the individuals who will interact with the system. Personnel selection is a two-stage process involving select-in and select-out procedures. Select-in procedures determine which candidates have the aptitude to profit from training and represent the best investment. Select-out procedures focus on medical qualification and determine who should not enter training for medical reasons. The current paper discusses the role of personnel selection in the HSI process in the context of remotely piloted aircraft systems.",

The variability and unpredictable nature of occurrences hampers accurate assessment of future risk. This uncertainty results in a necessarily conservative approach to aeromedical recommendations, which unfortunately may lead to over-restrictive dispositions. Limited long-term follow up information is available on migraine outcomes in pilots, particularly assessing for impact of potential modifiable aggravating factors.Methods: This retrospective study reviewed 159 U.S. Air Force pilots with migraine who had been granted aeromedical waivers. As a comparison group, 44 U.S. Air Force flight surgeons with migraine who had been granted aeromedical waivers were reviewed.Results: Migraine with aura and isolated migraine aura without headache accounted for the majority of migraine subtypes in both male and female subjects. Self-identified triggering factors were identified by 62% of subjects. The most commonly reported triggers were dietary factors, sleep disturbances, stress, caffeine intake, and hormonal factors. Sleep disturbances, stress, hormonal factors, and ethanol triggers were more frequently noted in female subjects. Self-reported positive response to trigger factor modification was noted in 54% of subjects. Subjects reported an average of only 3 migraine attacks in the previous year. Long-term follow up indicated continued aeromedical waiver in 91% of subjects.Discussion: The majority of subjects had migraine with aura or isolated migraine aura. Significant salutary response to modification of commonly-reported triggering factors was noted. These findings can be incorporated into individualized aeromedically-compatible management strategies to clarify symptom impact on aviation safety, improve symptom control, and increase the possibility of safe return to fly recommendations.Hesselbrock RR, Haynes JT.

The aims of this study were to assess possible breaking points during a flight career and to evaluate possible determinants affecting pilots' spines.METHODS: Survival analysis was performed on the population who started their jet training in 1995-2015. The endpoint was permanent flight duty restriction due to spinal disorder. Then the quantified Gz exposure and possible confounding factors were compared between those pilots with permanent flying restriction and their matched controls. Cumulative Gz exposure was measured sortie by sortie with fatigue index (FI) recordings. FI is determined by the number of times certain levels of Gz are exceeded during the sorties.RESULTS: The linear trend of the survival curve indicates an annual 0.86% drop out rate due to spinal problems among the fighter pilot population. A conditional logistic regression did not find any difference in the FI between cases and controls (OR 0.96, 95%CI 0.87-1.06). No statistical difference was found for flight hours, a sum of intensive flying periods, fitness tests, or with nicotine product use. Additionally, a maximum +Gz limitation without airframe restriction was assessed and is presented as a useful tool to manage loading and developed symptoms.DISCUSSION: No particular breaking point during follow-up or individual factor was found for Gz induced spinal disorders.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In commercial aviation, pilot fatigue is a major threat to safety. One key fatigue mitigation strategy on long-range (LR; 8-16 h) and ultra-long range (ULR; 16+ h on at least 10% of trips) routes is allotting in-flight rest breaks for the pilots. Since sleep is a strong predictor of performance, it is important to quantify total in-flight sleep (TIFS) and determine rest scheme schedules that optimize sleep opportunity and subsequent performance. Here we quantify in-flight sleep and characterize rest schemes by type and efficiency.METHODS: Between 2015 and 2019, we collected data on in-flight sleep on 3 LR and 5 ULR routes totaling 231 pilots flying over 1200 flight duty periods. Data were collected using a combination of actigraphy and logbooks.RESULTS: Over all combinations of flight direction, crew and LR vs. ULR, average TIFS ranged from 3.4 h to 5.2 h with some ULR pilots getting over 8 h. Most crews made use of simple two- or three-break rest schemes and the complex four-break rest schemes were used almost exclusively on the three longest ULR routes. The complex schemes were less efficient than simple schemes, although this effect was small. Complex schemes resulted in no more TIFS compared to simple schemes on the same routes.DISCUSSION: Overall, we find that crews are getting more sleep on these routes than previously reported on similar routes. Most crews use simple rest schemes and these simple schemes are more efficient than complex schemes.Rempe MJ, Basiarz E, Rasmussen I, Belenky G, Lamp A.

    "abstract": "A sudden loss of external visual cues during critical phases of flight results in spatial disorientation. This is due to undetected horizontal and vertical drift when there is little tolerance for error and correction delay as the helicopter is close to the ground. Three helmet-mounted symbology system concepts were investigated in the simulator as potential solutions for the legacy Griffon helicopters.Thirteen Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Griffon pilots were exposed to the Helmet Display Tracking System for Degraded Visual Environments (HDTS), the BrownOut Symbology System (BOSS), and the current RCAF AVS7 symbology system. For each symbology system, the pilot performed a two-stage departure and a single-stage approach. The presentation order of the symbology systems was randomized. Objective performance metrics included aircraft speed, altitude, attitude, and distance from the landing point. Subjective measurements included situation awareness, mental effort, perceived performance, perceptual cue rating, and NASA Task Load Index. Repeated measures analysis of variance and subsequent planned comparison for all the objective and subjective measurements were performed between the AVS7, HDTS, and BOSS.Our results demonstrated that HDTS and BOSS showed general improvement over AVS7 in two-stage departure. However, only HDTS performed significantly better in heading error than AVS7. During the single-stage approach, BOSS performed worse than AVS7 in heading root mean square error, and only HDTS performed significantly better in distance to landing point and approach heading than the others.Both the HDTS and BOSS possess their own limitations; however, HDTS is the pilots' preferred flight display.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With improved imaging technology, the number of incidental findings detected in cerebral MRI is increasing. This is a challenge that the German Air Force has to deal with in the context of standardized MRI examinations of young pilot candidates and pilots.METHODS: The German Air Force Centre of Aerospace Medicine hosted a 2-d conference to develop recommendations and procedures for the handling of some of the most frequently encountered cerebral incidental findings.RESULTS: Radiological MRI findings from a total of 2724 routine examinations of the skull of pilots and pilot applicants (26.8 ± 10.6 yr old; range from 16 to 62; over 80% range from 17 to 33; 96% men) revealed that in 28.1% of the examinations, one or more incidental findings were discovered. For seven of the following categories of incidental findings, decision guidelines could be established: white matter hyperintensities (N = 393; prevalence 14.4%; 95% CI 13.11-15.75), pinealis cysts (317; 11.6%; 10.43-12.84), developmental venous anomalies (64; 2.3%; 1.78-2.92), cavernomas (15; 0.6%; 0.27-0.83), aneurysms (14; 0.5%; 0.25-0.78), cholesterol granulomas (22; 0.8%; 0.47-1.14), and heterotopias of the gray matter (6; 0.2%; 0.04-0.4).CONCLUSION: Considering pilots health and aviation safety, a waiver decision is often possible after thorough discussion, depending on the specific criteria of the incidental finding and of the type of license.Kühn S, Sönksen S-E, Noble H-J, Knopf H, Frischmuth J, Waldeck S, Müller-Forell W, Weber F, Bressem L.

The aim of this study was to analyze the results of aviation medical examinations conducted in South Korea over the past 5 yr and, in doing so, provide evidence for establishing a health promotion, disease prevention plan.METHODS: Subjects of the study consisted of applicants who underwent aviation medical examinations from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020.RESULTS: Over the past 5 yr, the total number of aviation medical examinations in South Korea has shown an annual increase of more than 10%. In the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the number of aviation medical examinations, both renewal and initial, for all types of licenses, except renewal aviation medical examinations for the ATCL, decreased. Disqualification rates were generally higher in initial examinations than in renewal examinations. The examination results for license renewal showed the ATPL disqualification rate to be the highest at 3.5 per 1000 pilots per year in their 50s, with cardiology cases being the most common reason for disqualification, followed by ophthalmology cases and psychiatry cases. Diagnostic categories for those disqualified after initial aviation medical examinations were similar, though ophthalmological causes were most common, followed by cases of psychiatry and neurology.CONCLUSION: Main causes of disqualification in airmen and air traffic controllers were identified as the presence of cardiovascular, ophthalmic, and psychiatric diseases. The results of this study provide evidence for improving health promotion activity plans to manage risk factors of such diseases for aviation workers.Kim JS, Han BS, Kwon YH, Lim J.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This pilot study examined the effect of a 2-wk ketogenic diet (KD) compared with a carbohydrate (CHO) diet in military personnel on cognitive performance, mood, sleep, and heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: A randomized-controlled, cross-over trial was conducted with eight male military personnel (age, 36 ± 7 yr; body mass, 83.7 ± 9.2 kg; BMI, 26.0 ± 2.3 kg · m −2 ). Subjects ingested their habitual diet for 7 d (baseline), then an iso-energetic KD (∼25 g CHO/d) or CHO diet (∼285 g CHO/d) for 14 d (adaptation), separated by a 12-d washout. HRV, fasting capillary blood D-βHB, and glucose concentration, mood, and sleep were measured daily. Cognitive performance was measured on the 7 th day of baseline and the 7 th and 14 th days of adaptation. Data were analyzed using a series of linear mixed models. RESULTS: Mean weekly D-βHB was higher (95% CI, +0.34 to +2.38 mmol · L −1 ) and glucose was lower (−0.45 to −0.21 mmol · L −1 ) in the KD compared with the CHO diet. Cognitive performance (Psychomotor Vigilance Task, 2-choice reaction time, and running memory continuous performance test) and mean weekly fatigue, vigor, and sleep (sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and sleep onset latency) were similar between diets. A diet × week interaction for HRV approached significance, with exploratory analyses suggesting HRV was lower compared with baseline during week-2 adapt (−27 to +4 ms) in the KD. DISCUSSION: A 2-wk induction to a KD in male military personnel does not appear to affect cognitive performance, mood, or sleep, but may lower HRV, indicating increased physiological stress.

    "abstract": "Recent physiological incidents involving pilots of high performance fighter aircraft have raised the question of whether inadvertent, short bursts of significantly reduced oxygen could negatively impact real-time performance. This study evaluated normobaric, real-time performance in the setting of transient near-anoxia to inform future countermeasure development.The study was performed on 12 healthy subjects without significant medical history. Following collection of baseline data, real-time performance changes were evaluated during sequentially increasing periods of near-anoxic gas exposure (F(I)0(2) = 1%) using a computer-based performance assessment tool. Both room air and 100% oxygen were used as the prebreathe/recovery gases. Statistical analysis was performed on the results.Under normobaric conditions, subjects inspiring up to five near-anoxic breaths showed no significant performance decrement in either accuracy or effective actions per minute. Mean accuracy up to five near-anoxic breaths was 0.67 (SD = 0.01) as compared to a baseline mean of 0.68 (SD = 0.02). Hyperoxia had a protective effect on subject physiological response to near anoxia.These normobaric findings offer an assessment of real-time performance changes in the setting of transient, near-anoxic gas exposure. Overall, the results help inform the design of increasingly complex aircraft oxygen delivery systems in terms of how tightly such systems must match the sea-level gas equivalent with increasing altitude. This is particularly relevant as such systems are being called upon to ensure safe aircrew operations across an expanding operational flight envelope.",

This study investigated the published, historical aviation accidents that have been investigated by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to understand medical conditions and medication use that have been determined to be causal to mishaps. METHODS: A two-part approach was adopted for this study: 1) a scoping review was conducted to provide an overview of the current medical literature addressing medical factors and flight safety; and 2) a comprehensive review of aviation accident reports from the NTSB database from January 2013 to October 2022. RESULTS: The literature review demonstrated that psychiatric, cardiovascular, and neurological medications were the major categories of medications reported in fatal aircraft accidents. Age was not found to be a risk factor. Review of the NTSB database demonstrated that, among 15,654 mishaps, medical factors were associated in 703 (4.5%) accidents. NTSB data showed that cardiovascular (1.3%), psychiatric (0.23%), and endocrine diseases (0.17%) were the most commonly reported diseases among pilots. In accident reports, cardiovascular medications (1.49%), sedating antihistamines (0.91%), and alcohol (0.70%) were the most commonly used medications at the time of the accidents. DISCUSSION: Health-related factors were a small yet likely underestimated proportion of the factors associated with accidents. Cardiovascular diseases and treatment were the most important factors. It is important to continue to investigate the association between health-related factors and the commission of mishaps.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a common condition that can carry considerable risk to aeromedical duties. Because randomized controlled trials are not an appropriate method to evaluate flight safety risk for medical conditions that may cause subtle or sudden incapacitation, the determination of fitness-to-fly must be based on risk assessments informed by extrapolated evidence. Therefore, we conducted a review of current literature to provide background information to inform the aeromedical risk assessment of migraine using a risk matrix approach. METHODS: We identified studies on topics pertinent to conducting an aeromedical risk assessment of migraine. We generated an overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of articles retrieved from searches of Scopus, Ovid, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library published in English from all years, in both general and aircrew populations. International headache and neurology guidelines, as well as headache policies from the U.S. Air Force, were also reviewed. RESULTS: This review includes information on the following topics relevant to conducting an evidence-based risk assessment of migraine: diagnosis, prevalence, incidence, natural course, clinical presentation, triggers, comorbidities, neuroimaging, implications of family history, and efficacy of pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies. DISCUSSION: This review summarizes current literature on migraine for use in a risk matrix approach to the aeromedical assessment of migraine in prospective and current aircrew. Awareness of the most current epidemiological data related to a variety of migraine parameters facilitates an evidence-based risk assessment of migraine in aircrew and requires iterative updates as new information becomes available.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a cause of death in 75% of patients with diabetes. Its often asymptomatic nature delays diagnosis. In aeronautics, it can cause in-flight incapacitation, beyond which it represents a major fear for the medical expert. Screening for CAD is still a topical subject with the advent of new cardiovascular (CV) risk biomarkers and more effective screening tests. We report the experience of the Aeromedical Expertise Center of Rabat in this screening of diabetic pilots, with a recommendations review. METHODS: A prospective study over 1 yr included diabetic pilots who benefited from systematic screening for CAD after a CV risk stratification. Coronary angiography is performed if a screening test is positive. Subsequent follow-up is carried out in consultation with the attending physician with regular evaluation in our center. RESULTS: There were 38 pilots included in our study. The average age was 55 ± 4.19 yr and about 73% had a high CV risk. CAD was detected in 4 cases (10.52%) who had abnormal resting electrocardiograms and required revascularization with the placement of active stents. Approximately 75% of pilots with CAD returned to fly through a waiver with restrictions. DISCUSSION: Screening for coronary disease in diabetics is controversial, and current recommendations are not unanimous. In our study, the screening did not identify coronary diabetic pilots who could benefit from bypass surgery. Nevertheless, coronary disease was diagnosed, justifying grounding to preserve flight safety, which is an absolute priority in aviation medicine.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Employees from any type of aviation services industry were asked to give their opinions about the usefulness of consumer sleep technologies (CSTs) during operations and their willingness to share data from CSTs with their organizations for fatigue risk management purposes under a variety of circumstances. METHODS: Respondents provided information about position in aviation and use of CST devices. Respondents ranked sleep issues and feedback metrics by perceived level of importance to operational performance. Respondents rated their likelihood to share data with their organization under a series of hypothetical situations. RESULTS: Between January-July 2023, 149 ( N = 149) aviation professionals responded. Pilots comprised 72% ( N = 108) of respondents; 84% ( N = 125) of all respondents worked short- or medium-haul operations. “Nighttime operations” and “inconsistent sleep routines” ranked as the most important issues affecting sleep. “Sleep quality history” and “projected alertness levels” ranked as most important feedback metrics for personal management of fatigue. Respondents were split between CST users ( N = 64) and nonusers ( N = 68). CST users did not indicate a strong preference for a specific device brand. The most-reported reason for not using a CST was due to not owning one or no perceived need. Respondents indicated greater likelihood of data sharing under conditions where the device was provided to them by their organization. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that aviation professionals are more concerned about schedule-related disturbances to sleep than they are about endogenous sleep problems. Organizations may be able to increase compliance to data collection for fatigue risk management by providing employees with company-owned CSTs of any brand. Devine JK, Choynowski J, Hursh SR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Negative pressure breathing is breathing with decreased pressure in the respiratory tract without lowering pressure acting on the torso. We lowered air pressure only during inspiration (NPBin). NPBin, used to increase venous return to the heart, is considered a countermeasure against redistribution of body fluids toward the head during spaceflight. We studied NPBin effects on circulation in healthy humans with an emphasis on NPBin-induced oscillations of hemodynamic parameters synchronous with breathing. We propose an approach to analyze the oscillations based on coherent averaging. METHODS: Eight men ages 24–42 yr participated in the NPBin and control series. During the series, to reproduce fluids shift observed under microgravity, subjects were supine and head down (−8°). Duration of NPBin was 20 min, rarefaction −20 cm H 2 O. Hemodynamic parameters were measured by Finometer. Electrical impedance measurements were used to estimate changes in blood filling of cerebral vessels. RESULTS: Mean values of hemodynamic parameters virtually did not change under NPBin, but NPBin induced oscillations of the parameters synchronous with respiration. Peak-to-peak amplitude under NPBin were: mean arterial pressure, 4 ± 1 (mmHg); stroke volume, 7 ± 3 (mL); and heart rate, 4 ± 1 (bpm). Electrical impedance of the head increased during inspiration. The increase under NPBin was three times greater than under normal breathing. DISCUSSION: Analysis of oscillations gives more information than analysis of mean values. NPBin induces short-term decrease in left ventricle stroke volume and arterial blood pressure during each inspiration; the decrease is compensated by increase after inspiration. NPBin facilitates redistribution of body fluids away from the head. Semenov YS, Melnikov IS, Luzhnov PV, Dyachenko AI.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The original Spacecraft Maximal Allowable Concentrations (SMACs) for toluene (set for 1 h, 24 h, 7 d, 30 d, and 180 d) were first established by NASA in 1996 based on a human study in which no irritation or neurotoxicity was reported following 6-h exposure to 40 ppm toluene vapors. While the toluene SMACs were updated in 2008 to account for auditory, visual, and hormonal effects (for 7 d, 30 d, and 180 d) and to include a long-term SMAC (1000 d) in anticipation of longer spaceflight exploration missions, the short-term SMAC limits (1 h and 24 h) remained unchanged. Acute toluene exposure is reported to result in ocular and nasal irritation, although it is not a primary irritant, as well as central nervous system effects including headaches and dizziness. Long-term exposure to toluene can elicit hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and endocrine toxicity. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Since publication of the original and revised toluene SMACs, the National Academy of Sciences developed interim Acute Exposure Guideline Limits reviewed by the National Research Council Committee. Based on these data, we have increased the limits for toluene in crewed spacecraft to 40 ppm for 1 h, 24 h, 7 d, and 30 d. SMACs for durations of 180 and 1000 d will remain unchanged.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This paper describes the method for assigning medical diagnostic and treatment capabilities and resources to the database which assists with an updated probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) tool for exploration class medical system planning. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has used PRA since 2011 to inform mission medical system design, but existing tools are designed only for low Earth orbit. An updated PRA tool was needed to assist with exploration class missions. METHODS: A team of medical experts with a wide range of expertise and experience, including Space Medicine, was assembled to build capability and resource tables for the new PRA tool. This team met over 8 mo and used practice guidelines, literature, and experience to build capability and resource tables (CRTs) for each condition in the new PRA tool database. RESULTS: This process led to CRTs for each condition and a total of 617 distinct capabilities and 839 discrete resources. CONCLUSION: The CRT method is an effective way to translate medical practice guidelines into capabilities and resources usable by PRA tools for exploration class medical system planning. This same method may be used in commercial space ventures and in other applications in which medical predictive analytics are informative.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Military aviation poses unique occupational risks, including exposures to intermittent hypoxia, high gravitational force, and toxic materials, in addition to circadian disruption, cosmic radiation, and ergonomic stressors also present in commercial flight. We sought to investigate whether a military aviation officer’s career is associated with adverse maternal or fetal health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of female aviation and nonaviation officers in the Military Health System from October 2002 to December 2019. Exposure was identified as assignment of an aviation occupation code. Maternal and fetal health outcomes were identified by International Classification of Diseases codes from medical records. Regression analysis was used to estimate adjusted relative risks (aRR). RESULTS: Included in the study were 25,929 active-duty female officers, with 46,323 recorded pregnancies and 32,853 recorded deliveries; 2131 pregnancies were diagnosed in aviation officers. Pregnant aviation officers had a decreased risk of composite adverse pregnancy outcomes [aRR 0.82 (0.73–0.92)], including gestational diabetes [aRR 0.69 (0.57–0.85)] and gestational hypertension [aRR 0.84 (0.71–0.99)]. Pregnant aviation officers had a decreased risk of depression prior to delivery [aRR 0.43 (0.35–0.53)] and hyperemesis gravidarum [aRR 0.74 (0.57–0.96)], but an increased risk of placental complications [aRR 1.15 (1.02–1.30)] and fetal growth restriction [aRR 1.36 (1.16–1.60)]. DISCUSSION: Pregnant military aviation officers have an increased risk of placental complications and fetal growth restriction in spite of a lower risk of gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension. Further research is needed to determine how flight-related occupations impact pregnancy.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As next-generation space exploration missions require increased autonomy from crews, real-time diagnostics of astronaut health and performance are essential for mission operations, especially for determining extravehicular activity readiness. An augmented reality (AR) system may be a viable tool allowing holographic visual cueing to replace physical objects used in traditional assessments. METHODS: In this study, 20 healthy adults were compared in an Ingress and Egress Task and Obstacle Weave Task with holographic and physical objects to determine the effect of AR on performance. Subjects performed each task three times within each modality. RESULTS: AR exhibited increased task completion times with greater head pitch angles across the two tasks. The head and torso angular velocity showed a reduction in magnitude in both tasks within AR, while decreased magnitudes of head and torso acceleration were observed for the Obstacle Weave Task. The subjects were more deliberate and careful in their task completion during the Ingress and Egress Task within AR, stepping higher and lowering their heads further. DISCUSSION: Subjects successfully completed both tasks using AR and meaningful assessments of their performance were obtained. The increased head pitch observed supported the hologram visualization with the reduced AR field of view. The increased task time and reduced torso angular velocity were compared to strategies used by astronauts postflight while experiencing sensorimotor impairments. AR may be a useful instrumentation solution for assessing in-flight performance, providing embedded sensors and onboard computations; however, thresholds for assessing extravehicular activity readiness must be developed.

These exposures in animal models are associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. We sought to investigate whether a maternal military aviation career was associated with adverse neonatal health outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of female officer’s children born in the Military Health System from October 2002 to December 2019. Female fixed-wing aviation officers were identified by the presence of an aviation occupation code prior to birth. Adverse neonatal outcomes were identified by International Classification of Diseases codes in in-patient medical records. Binomial regression was used to estimate the adjusted relative risk (aRR) of neonatal health outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 27,033 eligible births, with 1144 children born to female fixed-wing aviation officers and 25,889 to female nonaviation officers. Children of fixed-wing aviation officers had a significantly lower adjusted risk of overall neonatal growth abnormalities compared to children of nonaviation officers [aRR 0.74 (95% Confidence Interval 0.57–0.99)], but did not have significant differences in low birth weight [aRR 0.78 (0.56–1.10)] or small for gestational age [aRR 0.72 (0.46–1.10)] diagnoses. There were no statistically significant adverse neonatal outcomes.

METHODS: A series of evaluations assessed aircrew performance using the 3M TM Model 1860 N95 respiratory protection mask, two aviation-specific cloth mask prototypes, and a commercial off-the-shelf aviation-specific cloth mask. The series of evaluations included different sets of subjects consisting of up to five Black Hawk helicopter aircrew members, air traffic control (ATC), and 12 CH-47 aircrew members. The Modified Rhyme Test was used to measure speech intelligibility and was administered in the UH-60 among crewmembers of the same aircraft, between pilots of different aircraft, and between the pilots and ATC. Measures of workload, usability, comfort, and pulse oximetry were also administered. RESULTS: Results from the Modified Rhyme Test indicated that all subjects scored greater than 80% accuracy given the proper microphone positioning relative to the mask. With respect to workload, NASA-TLX total scores for the perform radio communications task was 50.83. DISCUSSION: Despite an elevated perceived degree of workload on the communications flight task, results from the speech intelligibility test indicated that performance was maintained within the acceptable range as defined by MIL-STD-1474E, Design Criteria Standard Noise Limit. This abbreviated evaluation suggests that the face masks tested are safe for use by helicopter aircrew under the conditions tested.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recent reports of in-flight, hypoxia-like events have prompted concern that aircraft life support systems (LSS) may not always provide effective altitude protection. An analysis was undertaken of hypoxia-like incidents reported in a UK front-line combat aircraft. METHODS: A search of the UK Aviation Safety Information Management System database identified all Typhoon Defense Air Safety Occurrence Reports (DASORs) notifying in-flight symptoms over the decade 20082017. Qualitative analysis focused on the event narrative, altitude profile, timeline, symptom description, sortie characteristics, LSS function, postflight engineering investigation, and training implications. The plausibility and likelihood of hypobaric hypoxia were assessed, and the probable cause of symptoms ascribed. RESULTS: There were 18 DASORs with notified symptoms of suspected in-flight hypoxia, 13 in solo pilots and 5 reports of symptoms affecting 7 of 10 aircrew in 2-seat aircraft. Two cases of probable hypoxia comprised one oxygen bottle failure and one mask-off cabin depressurization. In one report, hypoxia was assessed as plausible but unlikely, following birdstrike with failure of cabin pressurization during climb. Symptoms were explained by hyperventilation in 13 cases (65%) and twice by minor constitutional upset. Suspected hypoxia was managed by immediate selection of emergency oxygen and expedited descent in 10 of 18 occurrences (56%). CONCLUSIONS: Only 2 cases of probable hypoxia have been reported in over 150,000 Typhoon flying hours. The Typhoon LSS has provided effective altitude protection including during cases of cabin depressurization. Symptom occurrences in Typhoon are idiosyncratic and unrelated; hyperventilation probably accounts for two-thirds of reports. Connolly DM, Lee VM, McGown AS, Green NDC.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Air taxis conduct nonscheduled transport and employ aircraft in various performance categories hereafter referred to as low, medium, and high performance, respectively. No study has yet addressed fixed-wing air taxi safety by performance category. Herein, we compared accident rates/occupant injury across air taxi airplane fleets grouped by performance category and identified human factors contributing to fatal accidents for airplanes in that category with the highest mishap rate. METHODS: Accidents (20042018) in the United States were identified from the National Transportation Safety Board database. General Aviation/Part 135 Activity Surveys provided annual fleet times. Fatal accident contributing factors were per the Human Factors Classification System (HFACS). Statistics utilized Poisson distributions, Chi-Square/Fisher, and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: There were 269 air taxi mishaps (53 fatal) identified. Over the 15 yr, the accident rate (1.10/million flight hours-all categories) declined 50%, largely due to a reduction in medium/high performance category airplane crashes. However, little temporal change was observed for low performance airplanes (1.5/million flight hours) and injury severity trended higher. At the aircrew/physical environment levels, HFACS revealed decision (improper choices), skill-based (stick and rudder) and perceptual (night, instrument conditions) errors contributing to &gt; 60% of fatal accidents involving low performance airplanes. At the organizational level, failing to correct problems, time pressures, and incentive systems contributed to 16% of fatal mishaps. CONCLUSION: Safety deficits remain for the low performance category air taxi fleet warranting increased pilot instrument flight training/utilization of the mandatory 3-axis autopilot in degraded visibility. Safety culture improvements to address issues of personnel/equipment/training deficiencies, failing to correct problems, and time pressures/a safety-compromising incentive system all need to be addressed.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the biomechanical effects of different interventions on astronauts lumbar intervertebral discs in a microgravity environment during spaceflight and in a gravity environment when the astronaut returns. METHODS: A finite element model of the L4L5 lumbar segment was developed with eight loading schemes representing different interventions. The loading schemes included no intervention, wearing a penguin suit, sleeping in a fetal position, wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position, reclining for 4 or 16 h/d, and maintaining upright posture for 4 or 16 h/d. RESULTS: Without intervention, the microgravity environment led to increased central pore pressure, radial displacement, and water content in the lumbar intervertebral disc. Wearing a penguin suit combined with sleeping in the fetal position can reduce disc pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content to 0.156 MPa, 11.50 kPa, 0.538 mm, and 1.390%, respectively. When astronauts return to the gravity environment, staying upright for 4 h can reduce the pore pressure, axial stress, radial displacement, and water content of the intervertebral disc to 0.222 MPa, 10.72 kPa, 0.373 mm, and 0.219%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study showed that wearing a penguin suit and sleeping in the fetal position both have the potential to protect the lumbar intervertebral disc from the negative effects caused by microgravity. Remaining in the upright posture for 4 h per day may help squeeze out the water in the intervertebral disc safely when astronauts return to the gravity environment.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Education frequently dictates students need to study for prolonged periods of time to adequately prepare for examinations. This is especially true with aviation preflight indoctrination (API) candidates who have to assimilate large volumes of information in a limited amount of time during API training. The purpose of this study was to assess caffeine consumption patterns (frequency, type, and volume) among naval aviation candidates attending API to determine the most frequently consumed caffeinated beverage and to examine if the consumption of a nonenergy drink caffeinated beverage was related to energy drink consumption. METHODS: Data were collected by means of an anonymous 44-item survey administered and completed by 302 students enrolled in API at Naval Air Station Pensacola, FL. RESULTS: Results indicated the most frequently consumed caffeinated beverage consumed by API students was coffee (86.4%), with daily coffee consumption being approximately 28% and the most frequent pattern of consumption being 2 cups per day (85%). The least frequently consumed caffeinated beverages reported were energy drinks (52%) and energy shots (29.1%). The present study also found that the consumption patterns (weekly and daily) of caffeinated beverages (coffee and cola) were positively correlated to energy drink consumption patterns. DISCUSSION: Naval aviation candidates’ consumption of caffeinated beverages is comparable to other college and high school cohorts. This study found that coffee and colas were the beverages of choice, with energy drinks and energy shots being the least frequently reported caffeinated beverages used. Additionally, a relationship between the consumption of caffeinated beverages and energy drinks was identified.Sather TE, Williams RD, Delorey DR, Woolsey CL.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The coordination of team effort on shared tasks is an area of inquiry. A number of tests of team performance in challenging environments have been developed without comparison or standardization. This article provides a systematic review of the most accessible and usable low-to-medium fidelity computerized tests of team performance and determines which are most applicable to military- and aviation-relevant research, such as studies of group command, control, communication, and crew coordination. METHODS: A search was conducted to identify computerized measures of team performance. In addition to extensive literature searches (DTIC, Psychinfo, PubMed), the authors reached out to team performance researchers at conferences and through electronic communication. RESULTS: Identified were 57 potential tests according to 6 specific selection criteria (e.g., the requirement for automated collection of team performance and coordination processes, the use of military-relevant scenarios). The following seven tests (listed alphabetically) were considered most suitable for military needs: Agent Enabled Decision Group Environment (AEDGE), C3Conflict, the C 3 (Command, Control, &amp; Communications) Interactive Task for Identifying Emerging Situations (NeoCITIES), Distributed Dynamic Decision Making (DDD), Duo Wondrous Original Method Basic Awareness/Airmanship Test (DuoWOMBAT), the Leader Development Simulator (LDS), and the Planning Task for Teams (PLATT). Strengths and weaknesses of these tests are described and recommendations offered to help researchers identify the test most suitable for their particular needs.

Among mechanics, who are heavily involved in military aircraft maintenance, the occurrence of sudden cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs) is a possible risk factor during the maintenance process, which should be performed perfectly.We performed health examinations on 2123 male aircraft pilots and 1271 aircraft mechanics over 30 yr of age and determined the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), an important risk factor for CCVDs.The prevalence of MetS in the aircraft mechanics (21.3%) was significantly higher than in the pilots (12.6%), and the gap in prevalence tended to grow as age increased. Among aircraft mechanics in their 30s and 40s, the prevalence of MetS was lower than in the general population. However, the prevalence of MetS among aircraft mechanics in their 50s (36.0%) was similar to that in the general population (35.7%).Systematic health management is needed for aircraft mechanics for aviation safety and for the maintenance of military strength via the prevention of CCVDs.Kim M-B, Kim H-J, Kim S-H, Lee S-H, Lee S-H, Park W-J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Paratrooper training courses are very demanding, leading to a high number of drop-outs, despite existing selection criteria. This study investigated physiological, neuropsychological, and subjective data of completers and drop-outs during paratrooper training to identify potential predictive indices. METHODS: Tested were 24 paratrooper soldiers before (t 0 ), after 8 wk (t 1 ), and at the end of a 12-wk training camp (t 2 ). There were 11 soldiers who completed the course and 13 dropped out. The Training OPtimalisation test (TOPtest) uses two maximum exercise events to assess changes in measured parameters. The TOPtest was administered at t 0 , t 1 , and t 2 ; physiological [i.e., adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, heart rate (HR)], neuropsychological (Stroop, Flanker, Go NoGo, Task Switch), and subjective data [Profile of Mood States (POMS)] were collected. Physiological and subjective raw data was gathered pre- and post-test from each of the two maximum exercise tests. The pre/post-test change of each parameter’s raw values was calculated as the parameter’s reactivity (or delta score). RESULTS: At t 0 , drop-outs showed a significantly smaller HR reactivity (117.9 ± 14.0 vs.107.7 ± 10.6). Delta scores of tension and fatigue values differed significantly between completers and drop-outs at t 0 . Completers’ physiological reactivity during the TOPtest at t 2 (HR: 105.91 ± 13.68 vs. 95.55 ± 10.28) was significantly reduced and became comparable to the drop-outs’ reactivity at t 0 . Delta scores of fatigue and tension values showed a similar pattern. DISCUSSION: Reactivity of HR, tension, and fatigue parameter values were found to have predictive value in identifying completers vs. drop-outs of an elite paratrooper training course.Vrijkotte S, Meeusen R, Roelands B, Kubesch S, Mairesse O, de Schutter G, Pattyn N.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Advanced combat helmets (ACH) coupled with night-vision goggles (NVG) are required for tactical athletes during training and service. Head and neck injuries due to head supported mass (HSM) are a common occurrence in military personnel. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of HSM on neck muscle fatigue that may lead to chronic stress and injury of the head and neck. METHODS: Subjects wore an ACH and were affixed with electromagnetic sensors to obtain kinematic data, as well as EMG electrodes to obtain muscle activations of bilateral sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius, and paraspinal muscles while running on a treadmill. Subjects performed a 2-min warmup at a walking pace, a 5-min warmup jog, running at a pace equal to 90% maximum heart rate until absolute fatigue, and lastly a 2-min cooldown at a walking pace. Kinematic and EMG data were collected over each 2-min interval. Days later, the same subjects wore the same ACH in addition to the NVG and performed the same protocol as the first session. RESULTS: This study showed significant differences in muscle activation of the right upper trapezius [ F (1,31) = 10.100] and both sternocleidomastoid [ F (1,31) = 12.280] muscles from pre-fatigue to absolute fatigue. There were no significant differences noted in the kinematic variables. DISCUSSION: This study suggests that HSM can fatigue bilateral neck flexors and rotators, as well as fatigue the neck extensors and rotators on the contralateral side of the mounted NVG.Hanks MM, Sefton JM, Oliver GD.

The model calculates the risk scores of medications, which can then be compared to an organization's acceptable risk tolerance.Risk scores for each medication were established by summing the products of incidence rates and severity scores for all published side effects. The incidence of each side effect was obtained in an evidence-based manner and each assigned a severity multiplier. Using statistical analysis of the calculated risk scores of approved medications, an acceptance control chart was generated.Range of calculated risk scores of historically approved medications was 10-9140. Six Sigma Acceptance Control Line was calculated at 1.5 SDs above the mean and was 9822. Risk score range of medications generally felt unsafe was 27,010-41,294. Risk score range of medications under consideration for approval was 986-6863.This novel approach to medication approval is the first in aerospace medicine to attempt to combine evidence-based medicine, risk analysis, and control charts to standardize and streamline the medication approval process within an organization. The model was validated by testing against medications generally accepted to be unsafe for use in flight. These medications fell several deviations above the control line. Other medications not yet authorized fall well below the acceptance line and could be considered for approval.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this investigation was to identify factors associated with Air Force aviators delaying ejection during in-flight emergencies. METHODS: The investigator reviewed all reports within the Air Force Safety Automated System describing mishaps that resulted in the destruction of Air Force ejection-seat equipped aircraft between 1993 and 2013. Crewmembers were classified as either timely or delayed ejectors based on altitude at onset of emergency, altitude at ejection, and a determination regarding whether or not the aircraft was controlled during the mishap sequence. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to explore the association between delayed ejection and multiple potential risk factors. RESULTS: In total, 366 crewmembers were involved in in-flight emergencies in ejection-seat-equipped aircraft that resulted in the loss of the aircraft; 201 (54.9%) of these crewmembers delayed ejection until their aircraft had descended below recommended minimum ejection altitudes. Multivariate analysis indicated that independent risk factors for delayed ejection included increased crewmember flight hours and a mechanical or human-factors related cause of the emergency versus bird strike or midair collision. DISCUSSION: This investigation provided quantitative assessments of factors associated with aviators delaying ejection during in-flight emergencies. Increased odds of delay among crewmembers with greater than 1500 total flight hours suggests that complacency and overconfidence may adversely influence the ejection decision to at least as great a degree as inexperience. Increased odds of delay during mechanical and human factors mishaps confirms previously reported hypotheses and reaffirms the importance of targeting these areas to reduce aviator injuries and fatalities.Miles JE.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of hypoxia on the exhaled nitric oxide (NO) of humans is unresolved. Many studies have measured the fraction of exhaled NO (FE NO ) or the partial pressure of exhaled NO (PE NO ) in normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia, with differing results. METHODS: To better understand NO physiology and altitude acclimatization, we employed a random effects meta-analysis to determine the effect of acute normobaric hypoxia on the PE NO of humans. A total of 93 subjects from 7 published studies (with 9 groups) were included. The median duration of exposure was 30 min and the mean hypoxic P I o 2 was 95 (SD = 10) mmHg. RESULTS: The weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) in PE NO measured at baseline and during an acute exposure to normobaric hypoxia was not significantly different from zero (SMD = 0.09; 95% CI = −0.17, 0.34; z = 0.65). CONCLUSION: Based on this meta-analysis, acute normobaric hypoxia does not affect the PE NO measured from the mouths of humans. This result should be considered for interpretations of high-altitude (and hypobaric) measurements of exhaled NO. As the PE NO is a potential biomarker for altitude-illness susceptibility, recognizing that normobaric hypoxia does not affect the PE NO will be important for understanding previous associations between low exhaled NO and poor acclimatization to hypoxia.MacInnis MJ, Carter EA, Donnelly J, Koehle MS.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hyperbaric therapeutic chambers are pressure vessels capable of accommodating one or more persons with the purpose of providing medical treatment. Therapeutic hyperbaric chambers have been in use from the mid-20 th century, yet apparently their design has not reached their full potential and they are not compatible with current healthcare facilities design. This paper will present therapeutic hyperbaric chambers from a human-environment-machine perspective in order to highlight their specific problems and requirements, and suggest design concepts that may improve patient satisfaction, quality of treatment, and functionality of the staff. Data were collected from a literature review, a market survey, and personal observations. Main design solutions include personal space and privacy, stress- and anxiety-reducing environments, hazard mitigation, rearrangement of seating, and personalized (user-tailored) entertainment systems. It is suggested that adopting a user-centered design rather than an engineering focus will increase satisfaction and overall 'user experience' of the patients, alleviate psychological issues, and lessen workload and improve functionality of the staff. This study could be applicable and easily adapted to other confined therapeutic environments in which patients are restrained for several hours on a regular basis in receiving treatment, such as dialysis or chemotherapy rooms, and for confined nonmedical situations such as aircrafts and rapid trains.Bitterman N, Bonen A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypoxia caused by high altitude exposure can impair cerebral and mental functions. Blood flow and oxygenation of the buccal tissue can be reliable markers to detect hypoxia. In this study, near infrared spectroscopy was used in combination with a novel optical probe to evaluate the applicability of the novel probe in measuring hypoxia markers in buccal tissue under a hypoxic condition. METHODS: Six healthy participants were tested at altitudes from 2000 to 16,000 ft inside a hypobaric chamber. The buccal reference measurements of blood flow and oxygen saturation were synchronized with the spectral measurements of the novel near infrared probe and the relationship between the reference measurements and spectral data were evaluated by multivariate partial least square method. In addition, finger oxygen saturation was measured during the experiment and the recordings were compared with buccal oxygen saturation. RESULTS: The spectral analysis illustrated that the spectral data from the near infrared probe correlated strongly with the absorption features of both buccal flow and oxygenation measured by the reflectance sensors (average R 2 = 0.89). The results showed probably overestimated values for buccal oxygen saturation recorded by the reference pulse oximeter in comparison with finger oxygen saturation, with the mean difference increasing from 1.8% at 2000 ft to 11.4% at 16,000 ft. CONCLUSION: The novel near infrared probe showed promising results for simultaneous measurement of blood flow and oxygen saturation in the buccal tissue.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Since the debut of energy beverages, the consumption of energy beverages has been immensely popular with young adults. Research regarding energy beverage consumption has included college students, European Union residents, and U.S. Army military personnel. However, energy beverage consumption among naval aviation candidates in the United States has yet to be examined. The purpose of this study was to assess energy beverage consumption patterns (frequency and volume) among naval aviation candidates, including attitudes and perceptions regarding the benefits and safety of energy beverage consumption. METHODS: A 44-item survey was used to assess energy beverage consumption patterns of 302 students enrolled in the Aviation Preflight Indoctrination Course at Naval Air Station Pensacola, FL. RESULTS: Results indicated that 79% of participants ( N = 239) reported consuming energy beverages within the last year. However, of those who reported consuming energy beverages within the last year, only 36% ( N = 85) reported consuming energy beverages within the last 30 d. Additionally, 51% ( N = 153) of participants reported no regular energy beverages consumption. The majority of participants consumed energy beverages for mental alertness (67%), mental endurance (37%), and physical endurance (12%). The most reported side effects among participants included increased mental alertness (67%), increased heart rate (53%), and restlessness (41%). DISCUSSION: Naval aviation candidates appear to use energy drinks as frequently as a college student population, but less frequently than expected for an active duty military population. The findings of this study indicate that naval aviation candidates rarely use energy beverages (less than once per month), but when consumed, they use it for fatigue management.Sather TE, Delorey DR.

The exercise was designed to provide firsth and experience of the effects of cold water exposure on BH time.After completing the required HUET, 47 subjects completed two BH testing sessions as well as a short questionnaire. The first BH was completed while standing on the pool deck. The second BH was completed while fully immersed (face down) in 2-3°C water. There were 40 of the volunteers who also breathed from an emergency breathing system (EBS) while in the cold water.Results demonstrated that BH capabilities in cold water were significantly lower than those in ambient air. A significant correlation was also found between BH in air and the difference in cold water vs. air BH capabilities, which suggests that subjects who can hold their breath the longest in air experienced the greatest decrease in BH when immersed. Results indicate that 92% of the subjects reported that the practical cold water immersion exercise had a high value. Finally, 58% of those who used the EBS reported that it was harder to breathe in cold water than while in the training pool (approximately 22°C).The BH times for this group were similar to those reported in previous cold water immersion studies. Based on the questionnaire results, it is possible, when carefully applied, to include a practical cold water immersion exercise into existing HUET programs.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Earlier research described a linear relationship between the highest 1 min of oxygen consumption (Vo 2 ) during a recurring physical activity and incidence of decompression sickness (DCS) during research chamber exposures to high altitude. The current effort was designed to determine if that relationship holds true at a lower altitude. METHODS: Male subjects (20) were exposed without prebreathe to 22,500 ft (6858 m; 314 mmHg; 6.1 psi) for 4 h while seated, nonambulatory the entire time, with echo-imaging at 16-min intervals (Non-Amb Echo), breathing 100% oxygen. Average highest 1 min of Vo 2 and level of activity was determined. Results during Non-Amb Echo were compared with earlier research data acquired under identical conditions except for higher levels of activity. RESULTS: No DCS was reported or observed and no venous gas emboli were observed. Combined with earlier data, a strong linear relationship (r &gt; 0.99) was observed between DCS incidence and level of activity. DISCUSSION: These results suggest physiological envelopes might be expanded or prebreathe time reduced for some high-altitude aircraft operations that involve very low levels of physical activity. They may also help to explain the higher DCS risk for inside observers vs. trainees during altitude chamber training. The data imply potential for update of altitude DCS risk prediction models by adjustment with quantified level of activity during exposure.Webb JT, Morgan TR, Sarsfield SD.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Self-reported occupational exposures are often used in epidemiological studies when actual exposure measurements are unavailable, which could cause measurement error and bias study results. This study provides a numeric example of this potential bias. METHODS: A study of block hours and preterm birth was used as an illustrative example. This study included 577 flight attendants, ages 18-45 yr, who gave birth to a term (37 or greater gestational weeks) or preterm (20-36 gestational weeks) infant between 1992 and 1996. Flight attendants self-reported the number of block hours flown during the first trimester of pregnancy; the number of block hours flown during the first trimester of pregnancy was also calculated from airline records. No adjustment for confounding was performed for this illustrative example. RESULTS: Although flight attendants having term and preterm births self-reported similar hours worked during the first trimester (median 213 vs. 215 block hours), airline records showed that flight attendants having term births worked more hours than those having preterm births (median 146 vs. 104 block hours). Using self-reported block hours, there was no association between block hours and preterm birth; when using airline records, an inverse association was observed. DISCUSSION: In this example, differential measurement error from use of self-reported block hours obscured an inverse association apparent when using airline records, demonstrating the importance of accurate exposure assessment for identifying occupational risk factors for health outcomes.Johnson CY, Grajewski B.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study investigated how operation complexity and type affect Chinese individuals’ performance of simulated spaceflight operations under conditions of sleep deprivation and confinement (SDC). METHODS: There were 20 male volunteers who were randomly divided into 2 groups: the SDC group ( N = 8) and the control group ( N = 12). During the 72-h experimental period, the volunteers were asked to perform 11 computerized spaceflight emergency procedures, varying in operation complexity and type, three times at the 9 th , 33 rd , and 57 th hours, respectively. Operation times and errors of each spaceflight emergency procedure were recorded. Three complexity levels (i.e., low complexity, high complexity, and combined complexity) and three operation types (i.e., two-way judgment, manual operation, and mixed operation) were identified according to an operation complexity measure and an engineering definition. RESULTS: Mixed model ANOVAs indicated that performance of the three complex operations and three operation types were negatively affected by SDC. Moreover, the results showed that the operation time of manual operation (10.67 ± 1.706 at the 9 th hour, 13.94 ± 4.261 at the 33 rd hour) and mixed operation (4.88 ± 0.247 at the 9 th hour, 5.15 ± 1.308 at the 57 th hour) increased significantly with the increase of waking time. It was also shown that the high complexity operation and manual operation got less variation in operation time compared with low complexity and two-way judgment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The result indicated that the task assignment with high complexity requiring cognition could be a useful way to counteract the effect of SDC. It was also implied that psychomotor abilities were more easily affected by SDC than perception and judgment.Zhang Y, Li Z, Liu X, Liu F, Jing X, Wu B.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The recent developments of technology in almost all areas of industrial processing, workplace, smart homes, mobility, media, and communication change humans’ everyday life environment and behavioral responses in numerous ways. Our main objective in this study was to determine whether subjects’ operator performance in a complex sensorimotor task is associated with their gaze behavior. METHODS: In two experiments subjects operated a complex control task. To this end they watched multiple displays, made strategic decisions, and used multiple actuators to maximize their virtual earnings from operating a virtual power plant. In Experiment 1 we compared gaze behavior during the tasks with respect to operator performance in two different age groups (young vs. old), and in Experiment 2 in two different gravity conditions (normal vs. microgravity). RESULTS: We found gaze pattern changed in older subjects as well as in microgravity. Older adults and subjects in microgravity looked longer at areas that are less relevant for task success. Most importantly, these changes in gaze pattern accounted for the effects of age and microgravity and on total earnings in the instrument-control task. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, age- and gravity-related changes of gaze behavior show a similar pattern. Gaze behavior seems to play an important role in complex control tasks and might predict alterations of operational performance.Kalicinski M, Steinberg F, Dalecki M, Bock O.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The issue of expanding flight privileges that do not require medical oversight is currently an important topic, especially in the United States. We compared personal flying accident rates in aircraft with special light sport aircraft (SLSA) and experimental light sport aircraft (ELSA) airworthiness certificates to accident rates for personal flying in other general aviation (GA) aircraft. METHODS: To calculate accident rates, personal flying hours were obtained from the annual FAA General Aviation and Part 135 Activity Surveys, and numbers of personal flying accidents were obtained from the NTSB accident database. Overall and fatal personal flying accident rates for the SLSA and ELSA groups and other GA aircraft were calculated and accident rates were compared. RESULTS: The overall personal flying accident rate for SLSA and ELSA was found to be 29.8 per 100,000 flight hours and the fatal accident rate was 5.2 per 100,000 flying hours. These are both significantly greater than the overall personal flying rate of 12.7 per 100,000 h and fatal rate of 2.6 per 100,000 h for other GA aircraft. DISCUSSION: Although this study has several limitations, the significantly higher accident rates in the sport pilot aircraft suggests caution when expanding sport pilot privileges to include larger, more complex aircraft.Mills WD, DeJohn CA.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inner ear decompression sickness (IEDCS) in scuba diving results in residual vestibulocochlear deficits with a potential impact on health-related quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive factors for poor clinical recovery and to try to establish a prognostic score on initial physical examination. METHODS: The medical records of injured divers with IEDCS treated in our facility between 2009 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical severity of the deficit was evaluated on admission using a numerical scoring system taking into account the intensity of vestibular symptoms and the presence of cochlear signs. The clinical outcome was assessed at 3 mo by telephone interview. After multivariate analysis of potential risk factors for sequelae, the discriminating value of the score and these prognostic reliability indices were calculated. RESULTS: Among the 99 patients included in the study, 24% still had residual symptoms. Statistical analysis revealed that only a high clinical score [OR = 1.39 (95% CI 1.13-1.71)] and a delay in hyperbaric recompression &gt;6 h [OR = 1.001 (95% CI 1-1.003)] were independently associated with incomplete recovery. The advantage of the score lay in its highly specific nature (92%) rather than its sensitivity (48%) for a threshold of 10. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the severity of IEDCS can be easily determined by a clinical score during the acute phase. Recompression treatment should not be delayed.Gempp E, Louge P, de Maistre S, Morvan J-B, Vallée N, Blatteau J-E.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite significant investment into the development and improvement of military helicopter seat systems, military aviators continue to report seat system related pain and discomfort during prolonged missions. METHODS: Using a factorial repeated measures design, 15 healthy subjects completed the study, in which focal pressure was applied to two locations on the sitting surfaces of the body (ischial tuberosity and middle of the posterior thigh). Pressure was applied using a purpose-built pressure application system allowing subjects to sit in a position mimicking the sitting position in the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. The researchers measured pain using the Category Partitioning Scale and McGill Pain Questionnaire and vascular function using dynamic infrared thermography in the lower leg and pulse oximetry at the great toe. Data were collected before and during a 10-min application of focal pressure applied to either the ischial tuberosity or middle of the posterior thigh and at two different pressure magnitudes (36 or 44 kPa). RESULTS: We found that during a 10-min pressure application, superficial skin temperature increased by 0.61°C, suggesting a decreased venous return during pressure application. We found that lower extremity blood oxygenation remained unchanged during pressure application. Subjects’ reported pain increased during pressure application and was greater with 44 kPa of application compared to 36 kPa. DISCUSSION: These results support the hypothesis that locally high pressure creates symptoms of discomfort and paresthesia. Research examining the effects of local pressure application on physiological and neurological function is needed.Games KE, Lakin JM, Quindry JC, Weimar WH, Sefton JM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is a fulminant, deadly, and yet still unpredictable brain disease. A new prophylactic treatment for HACE and its predecessor, acute mountain sickness (AMS), needs to be developed without the contraindications or adverse effect profiles of acetazolamide and dexamethasone. Since neovascularization signals are likely key contributors to HACE/AMS, our approach was to examine already existing anti-angiogenic drugs to inhibit potential initiating HACE pathway(s). This approach can also reveal crucial early steps in the frequently debated mechanism of HACE/AMS pathogenesis. METHODS: We exposed four rat cohorts to hypobaric hypoxia and one to sea level (hyperbaric) conditions. The cohorts were treated with saline controls, an anti-angiogenesis drug (motesanib), a pro-angiogenesis drug (deferoxamine), or an intraperitoneal version of the established AMS prophylaxis drug, acetazolamide (benzolamide). Brain tissue was analyzed for cerebrovascular leak using the Evans Blue Dye (EVBD) protocol. RESULTS: We observed significantly increased EVBD in the altitude control and pro-angiogenesis (deferoxamine) cohorts, and significantly decreased EVBD in the anti-angiogenesis (motesanib), established treatment (benzolamide), and sea-level cohorts. DISCUSSION: Anti-angiogenesis-treated cohorts demonstrated less cerebrovascular extravasation than the altitude control and pro-angiogenesis treated rats, suggesting promise as an alternative prophylactic HACE/AMS treatment. The leak exacerbation with pro-angiogenesis treatment and improvement with anti-angiogenesis treatment support the hypothesis of early neovascularization signals provoking HACE. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence to guide further investigation for VEGF- and HIF-inhibitors as HACE/AMS prophylaxis, and as elucidators of still unknown HACE pathogenesis.Tarshis S, Maltzahn J, Loomis Z, Irwin DC.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The U.S. Navy experienced a series of physiological events in aircrew involving primarily the F/A-18 airframe related to rapid decompression of cabin pressures, of which aviation decompression sickness (DCS) was felt to contribute. The underlying pathophysiology of aviation DCS is the same as that of diving-related. However, based on the innate multifactorial circumstances surrounding hypobaric DCS, in clinical practice it continues to be unpredictable and less familiar as it falls at the intersect of aerospace and hyperbaric medicine. This retrospective study aimed to review the case series diagnosed as aviation DCS in a collaborative effort between aerospace specialists and hyperbaricists to increase appropriate identification and treatment of hypobaric DCS. METHODS: We identified 18 cases involving high-performance aircraft emergently treated as aviation DCS at a civilian hyperbaric chamber. Four reviewers with dual training in aviation and hyperbaric medicine retrospectively reviewed cases and categorized presentations as “DCS” or “Alternative Diagnosis”. RESULTS: Reviewers identified over half of presenting cases could be attributed to an alternative diagnosis. In events that occurred at flight altitudes below 17,000 ft (5182 m) or with rapid decompression pressure changes under 0.3 atm, DCS was less likely to be the etiology of the presenting symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Aviation physiological events continue to be difficult to diagnose. This study aimed to better understand this phenomenon and provide additional insight and key characteristics for both flight physicians and hyperbaric physicians. As human exploration continues to challenge the limits of sustainable physiology, the incidence of aerospace DCS may increase and underscores our need to recognize and appropriately treat it.

Aeronauts were modeled using several parameters, including sex, cardiovascular fitness, and other common modifiers such as G-suits, positive pressure breathing gear, anti-G straining, and other muscle tensing. The software was validated by comparison with experimental data from the peer-reviewed literature.RESULTS: CGEM predicted physiological effects of Gz exposure accurately, particularly for rapid onset rates. Predicted times to G-LOC and absolute incapacitation periods were consistently within 1 SD of pooled results obtained during centrifuge experiments using U.S. Navy (USN) and U.S. Air Force (USAF) pilots. Predictions of G tolerance based on visual effects onset also compared well with published data, as did evaluation of symptoms expected during a difficult aerobatic maneuver.DISCUSSION: CGEM is a new tool for civil and military aviation. Rather than providing a simple G tolerance number, flight surgeons, pilots, and accident investigators can gain insight into changes in risk-from factors such fatigue, medications, dehydration, and anti-G countermeasures used-through proper selection of parameters.Copeland K, Whinnery JE.

This was done to identify the relationship between the TFEQ, body composition, and G resistance, in order to provide basic data for pilots and air force cadets to strengthen G tolerance.METHODS: From the Republic of Korea Air Force Academy (ROKAFA), 138 fourth-year cadets were assessed using the TFEQ and for body composition and physical fitness. Based on these measurement results, a G test result analysis and a correlation analysis were conducted.RESULT: The TFEQ showed statistically significant differences in several areas when comparing the G test pass group (GP group) to the G test fail group (GF group). Three-km running time was significantly faster in the GP group than in the GF group. Physical activity levels were higher in the GP group compared to the GF group.CONCLUSION: The TFEQ demonstrated utility in predicting whether cadets will pass or fail G-LOC testing. G test success for any cadet will require improvement in continuous eating behavior and physical fitness management. If variables affecting the G test are analyzed and applied to physical education and training through continuous research over the next two to three years, it is expected to have a greater effect on the success of the G test for every cadet.Sung J-Y, Kim I-K, Jeong D-H.

The pilot flight ability evaluation scale was used as the criterion of test validity. According to the scale score, pilots were divided into high, middle, or low spatial ability groups pursuant to the 27% allocation principle. Differences in reaction time (RT), correct rate (CR), and correct number per second (CNPS) of MRT between groups were compared. Correlations between scale scores and MRT scores were analyzed. RT, CR, and CNPS of MRT among different age groups and between genders were also compared.RESULTS: The RT of the high spatial ability group was remarkably slower than that of the low spatial ability group (363.4 ± 140.2 s, 458.1 ± 151.7 s). The CNPS of the high spatial ability group was dramatically higher than that of the low spatial ability group (0.111 ± 0.045 s, 0.086 ± 0.001 s). There were no significant differences in RT, CR, and CNPS between different genders. Pilots in the 29-35 yr old age group had considerably slower RT than those in the 22-28 yr old age group (330.8 ± 140.3 s, 417.2 ± 132.7 s). Pilots in the 29-35 yr old age group had conspicuously higher CNPS than pilots in the 22-28 yr old age group (0.119 ± 0.040 s, 0.096 ± 0.036 s). All pilots' scale scores were positively correlated with CNPS (r = 0.254) and negatively correlated with RT (r = -0.234).DISCUSSION: MRT based on VR has a good discrimination efficacy for SVA of pilots and is a good indicator for the SVA component measurement.Zhang M, Wang M, Feng H, Liu X, Zhai L, Xu X, Jin Z.

When the benzene SMACs were updated in 2008, there was no revision to the short-term SMAC limits. Rather, that effort developed a long-term SMAC (1000-d) for Exploration mission scenarios. Acute benzene exposures can cause numerous neurological effects, and long-term exposure to low levels is well-known to cause acute myeloid leukemia. Since publication of the original benzene SMACs, the National Academy of Sciences developed interim Acute Exposure Guideline Limits (AEGLs) for unintentional releases of benzene into the air.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Prior study has indicated that individuals of varied age, medical history, and limited-to-no experience tolerate spaceflight conditions. We sought to expand upon the understanding of layperson response to hypergravity conditions expected in commercial spaceflight by exposing subjects, following minimal training, to centrifuge-simulated, high-fidelity commercial spaceflight profiles. We further explored how these individuals perform in simulated operational activities during and following hypergravity.METHODS: Volunteer subjects participated in up to five centrifuge runs (maximum +4.0 Gz, +4.5 Gx, 6.1 G resultant; onset rate <0.5 Gz · s-1, ≤1 Gx · s-1). Profiles included two winged spacecraft simulations with sequential and combined +Gx/+Gz and two capsule simulations representing nominal +Gx launch and reentry. The final profile simulated a capsule launch abort, with a more dynamic cycling of +Gx exposures and oscillatory multi-axis exposures simulating parachutes and water motion. Touchscreen tablets were used to administer pattern-replication tasks during and after profiles.RESULTS: A total of 46 subjects participated, including 4 diabetics and 9 with cardiac disease. There was increased frequency of motion sickness, subjectively associated with capsule-type profiles, and increased termination of participation compared to prior studies. There was no association between medical history, age, sex, or motion sickness history and tolerance or noncompletion. Tablet test errors were common; accuracy and time to completion were associated with age. There was no association between any time metric or accuracy and sex.DISCUSSION: This study improves understanding of layperson tolerance in commercial spaceflight analog conditions, and the capsular profiles broaden the applicability of the findings. The frequency of task errors highlights the potential for mistakes in operational activities when performed by laypersons.Blue RS, Ong KM, Ray K, Menon A, Mateus J, Auñón-Chancellor S, Shah R, Powers W.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to the increased overweight and obesity prevalence in Colombia, the aim of this study is to determine the frequency of metabolic syndrome (MetS) among Colombian Air Force military aviators, crews, remote piloted aircraft operators, and air traffic controllers and relationships with clinical markers.METHODS: Operationally active Columbian Air Force military personnel examined periodically at the Colombian Air Force Aerospace Medical Directorate were chosen for a cross-sectional study performed among 2179 subjects. Medical history, anthropometrics, and laboratory results were analyzed and frequencies, correlations, and odds ratios were calculated.RESULTS: Overall prevalence of MetS was 21.7%; in subjects with BMI ≥25, frequency increased to 36% vs. those with BMI <25. Hypertriglyceridemia was present in 31%, impaired fasting glucose 12.5%, hypertension (≥130/85 mmHg) 14.4%, low HDL-C 35.2%, and increased waist circumference 46.2%. Those with three criteria were 14.6%, four criteria 5.8%, and five criteria 1.2%. Pilots had a significantly lower prevalence of MetS at 17.7% and an adjusted OR of 0.61 (0.49-0.76) than other crew; hyperuricemia was three times more likely (3.2-5.1) and hypercholesterolemia OR was 2.3 (1.9-2.9). Subjects with MetS had a significantly higher fat percentage, waist circumference, low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), uric acid, and white blood cell (leukocyte) count, and a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate. There is a linear relationship of the AIP and waist circumference, BMI, uric acid, and white blood cell count.DISCUSSION: MetS prevalence among Colombian Air Force aviators is lower than the general population, higher than other countries, and displays worse lipid profiles that increase cardiovascular and diabetes mellitus risk within the military.Malpica D.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In 2022, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began launching missions to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon. One key to success will be maintaining human health. In preparation for longer missions with more diverse crews, the Spaceflight for Everybody Symposium was held to review currently known human spaceflight biomedical knowledge, the future of exploration space medicine, and the ability of NASA to manage the spaceflight human health risks and enable exploration. The symposium highlighted the future of precision health/personalized medicine, the possible spaceflight health acute and lifetime illnesses, and the challenge of identifying appropriate prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and autonomous medical systems for long-duration spaceflight. The symposium was organized to look back at NASA exploration, science, and leadership successes, celebrate NASA women’s leadership, and focus on future Artemis activities, including research and development that will benefit both spaceflight and terrestrial life. NASA current preparations for returning to the Moon have led to increased acknowledgment of the importance of workforce diversity, i.e., to use the best candidate in every work position, including the plan for the first woman and person of color to land on the Moon. NASA is developing plans to use commercial spaceflight research opportunities when the International Space Station is no longer available. Astronaut health decisions will consist of individualized health risk determinations and mitigation strategies and increased medical self-care. Research findings include improved exploration cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and radiation risk reduction and improved interpersonal support for both astronaut crews and mission control personnel.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While catastrophic spaceflight events resulting in crew loss have occurred, human spaceflight has never suffered an on-orbit fatality with survival of other crewmembers on board. Historical plans for management of an on-orbit fatality have included some consideration for forensic documentation and sample collection, human remains containment, and disposition of remains; however, such plans have not included granular detailing of crew or ground controller actions. The NASA Johnson Space Center Contingency Medical Operations Group, under authority from the Space and Occupational Medicine Branch, the Space Medicine Operations Division, and the Human Health and Performance Directorate, undertook the development of a comprehensive plan, including an integrated Mission Control Center response for flight control teams and Flight Surgeons for a single on-orbit crew fatality on the International Space Station (ISS) and subsequent events. Here we detail the operational considerations for a crew fatality should it occur during spaceflight onboard the ISS, including forensic and timeline constraints, behavioral health factors, and considerations for final disposition of decedent remains. Future considerations for differential survival and crewmember fatality outside of low-Earth orbit operations will additionally be discussed, including consideration of factors unique to planetary and surface operations and disposition limitations in exploration spaceflight. While the efforts detailed herein were developed within the constraints of the ISS concept of operations, future platforms may benefit from the procedural validation and product verifications steps described. Ultimately, any response to spaceflight fatality must preserve the goal of handling decedent remains and disposition with dignity, honor, and respect.Stepaniak PC, Blue RS, Gilmore S, Beven GE, Chough NG, Tsung A, McMonigal KA, Mazuchowski EL II, Bytheway JA, Lindgren KN, Barratt MR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Several astronauts have experienced severe headaches during spaceflight, but no studies have examined the associated brain microstructure and functional changes. Head-down-tilted bed rest (HDBR) is a well-established method for studying the physical effects of microgravity on the ground. In this study, we analyzed the changes in brain microstructure and function during headache caused by HDBR using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI).METHODS: We imaged 28 healthy subjects with DTI and R-fMRI in the horizontal supine position and HDBR. Using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were compared between the headache and non-headache groups. Additionally, an analysis of functional connectivity (FC) was performed, followed by a correlation analysis between FC and numerical rating scale.RESULTS: HDBR caused headaches in 21 of 28 subjects. DTI analysis showed no significant change in fractional anisotropy after HDBR, whereas axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity increased significantly. R-fMRI analysis showed a significant decrease in FC in several areas after HDBR. The headache group showed significantly higher FC before HDBR, and both groups showed higher FC after HDBR. Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between FC and numerical rating scale before HDBR but negative after HDBR.DISCUSSION: We demonstrated the image change in the acute phase of space headache by HDBR using DTI and R-fMRI. Changes in brain microstructure and function specific to patients developing headaches may be evaluated by imaging.Goto M, Shibata Y, Ishiyama S, Matsumaru Y, Ishikawa E.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adding noise to a system to improve a weak signal’s detectability is known as stochastic resonance (SR). SR has been shown to improve sensory perception and cognitive performance in certain individuals, but it is unknown whether this performance improvement can translate to meaningful macrocognitive enhancements in performance for complex, operational tasks. OBJECTIVE: We investigated human operator performance in a lunar landing simulation while applying auditory white noise and/or noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation. METHODS: We measured performance ( N = 16 subjects) while completing simulation trials in our Aerospace Research Simulator. Trials were completed with and without the influence of auditory white noise, noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation, and both simultaneously in a multimodal fashion. Performance was observed holistically and across subdimensions of the task, which included flight skill and perception. Subjective mental workload was collected after completing four trials in each treatment. RESULTS: We did not find broad operator improvement under the influence of noise, but a significant interaction was identified between subject and noise treatment, indicating that some subjects were impacted by additive noise. We also found significant interactions between subject and noise treatment in performance subdimensions of flight skill and perception. We found no significant main effects on mental workload. CONCLUSIONS: This study investigated the utility of using additive sensory noise to induce SR for complex tasks. While SR has been shown to improve aspects of performance, our results suggest additive noise does not yield operational performance changes for a broad population, but specific individuals may be affected.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common allergic disease globally and its prevalence is increasing year by year. This study aimed to analyze the prevalence and risk factors of self-reported AR among the Chinese National Railway train crew in the China Railway Beijing Group.METHODS: This prospective questionnaire study surveyed 1511 randomly recruited train crewmembers from 20 cities in the China National Railway network, and 494 reported having AR. A structured questionnaire was tailored, designed, and delivered electronically to all subjects. Prevalence of and risk factors for AR were analyzed based on self-reported results.RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported AR among train crewmembers was 32.6%. Among respondents, 86.03% worked in passenger cars and 64.6% reported having worse AR symptoms while on trains. AR frequencies were 40.15% perennially and 59.85% seasonally. Among the Total Nasal Symptoms Scores (TNSS), significant differences were found between rhinorrhea and sneezing and between nasal itching and sneezing. The Rhino-Conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) showed significant correlations between all seven sections. TNSS was significantly associated with the RQLQ. Scores of both the TNSS and RQLQ showed that the severity of AR symptoms (rp = 0.103) and the impact on quality of life (rp = 0.113) correlated significantly with seniority.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of self-reported AR among train crew working in passenger cars is higher than that of the general Chinese population. The severity of AR symptoms and the impact on quality of life are associated with seniority, meaning the number of years working on trains.Yu R-L, Ning H-Y, Lan T-F, He H, Zheng C-B, Wang X-Y, Wang H-T, Wang X-Y.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this study, we investigated the impact of a loss of horizon due to atmospheric conditions on flight performance and workload of helicopter pilots during a low-altitude, dynamic flight task in windy conditions at sea. We also examined the potential benefits of a helmet-mounted display (HMD) for this specific task. METHODS: In a fixed-based helicopter simulator, 16 military helicopter pilots were asked to follow a maneuvering go-fast vessel in a good visual environment (GVE) and in a degraded visual environment (DVE). DVE was simulated by fog, obscuring the horizon and reducing contrast. Both visual conditions were performed once with and once without an HMD, which was simulated by projecting head-slaved symbology in the outside visuals. Objective measures included flight performance, control inputs, gaze direction, and relative positioning. Subjective measures included self-ratings on performance, situation awareness, and workload. RESULTS: The results showed that in DVE the pilots perceived higher workload and were flying closer to the go-fast vessel than in GVE. Consequently, they responded with larger control inputs to maneuvers of the vessel. The availability of an HMD hardly improved flight performance but did allow the pilots to focus their attention more outside, significantly improving their situation awareness and reducing workload. These benefits were found in DVE as well as GVE conditions. DISCUSSION: DVE negatively affects workload and flight performance of helicopter pilots in a dynamic, low-altitude following task. An HMD can help improve situation awareness and lower the workload during such a task, irrespective of the visual conditions. Ledegang WD, van der Burg E, Valk PJL, Houben MMJ, Groen EL.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising method for maintaining cognitive performance. Anticipated changes in rotary-wing aircraft are expected to alter aviator performance. METHODS: A single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study evaluated effects of 2-mA anodal tDCS to the right posterior parietal cortex on aviator performance within a Black Hawk simulator. A mixed design with one between-subjects factor was assessed: stimulation prior to flight (20 constant min) and during flight (two timepoints for 10 min each). The within-subjects factor included active vs. sham stimulation. Randomly assigned to each stimulation group were 22 aviators. Aircraft state metrics derived from the simulator were used to evaluate performance. Subjects completed two flights (active stimulation and sham stimulation) with an in-flight emergency introduced at the end to assess whether the timing of tDCS application (prior or during flight) affected the ability to maintain attention and respond to an unexpected event. RESULTS: Results found active stimulation during flight produced statistically significant improvements in performance during the approach following the in-flight emergency. Subjects maintained a more precise approach path with glideslope values closer to zero (M = 0.05) compared to the prior-to-flight group (M = 0.15). The same was found for localizer values (during flight, M = 0.07; prior to flight, M = 0.17). There were no statistically significant differences between groups on secondary outcome measures. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest stimulation during flight may assist in maintaining cognitive resources necessary to respond to an unexpected in-flight emergency. Moreover, blinding efficacy was supported with 32% of subjects correctly guessing when active stimulation was being delivered (52% correctly guessed the sham condition). Feltman KA, Kelley AM.

This includes assessing the risks and benefits that a complicated medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) poses to the injured crewmember, the crew, and the mission. This qualitative study identifies common MEDEVAC risk assessment principles used in spaceflight and other extreme environments to better inform future risk assessment tools and exploration mission concepts. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with subject matter experts in spaceflight and analog domains, including polar operations, undersea operations, combat medicine, and mountaineering. Transcripts were analyzed using the qualitative method of Thematic Analysis with the technique of consensus, co-occurrence, and comparison. RESULTS: Subject matter experts described 18 themes divided into two main categories: Primary Risk Considerations (e.g., crew, mission, resources, time) and Contributing Factors (e.g., psychological considerations, medical preparation, politics). DISCUSSION: Primary Risk Considerations can assess MEDEVAC risk across mission phases, with Contributing Factors acting as premission tools to adjust those risks. Inter- and intracategory connections identified medical support considerations, MEDEVAC support considerations, and philosophy as the most impactful Contributing Factors. Medical support considerations, psychological considerations, and political considerations were found to have unique aspects given the distances and societal impact of exploration vs. low Earth orbit spaceflight. The Contributing Factor theme of decision making was determined to be unique due to its impacts across both categories.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Zolpidem is a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic that has been approved by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) for aircrew sleep management since 2005. Prior to consuming zolpidem for operational reasons, each RSAF aircrew member is required to undergo a ground test to exclude operationally relevant adverse drug effects. This study describes the RSAF’s zolpidem ground testing outcomes over a 12.5-yr period. METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of 578 RSAF aircrew members who underwent zolpidem test dosing from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2017. RESULTS: The median age was 29 yr (range, 19–54 yr) and the mean age was 30.1 yr ± 6.3 yr. Of the aircrew members, 568 (98.3%) were men and all were of Asian origin; 558 (96.5%) were medically cleared for the operational use of zolpidem. Among the 20 (3.5%) who failed zolpidem ground testing, next-day drowsiness (cumulative incidence, 1.04%), headache (cumulative incidence, 0.87%), and dizziness (cumulative incidence, 0.35%) were the most common causes of failure. None of the aircrew members reported abnormal sleep behaviors or major adverse drug events from zolpidem ingestion. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest a low occurrence of adverse effects among military aircrew members who undergo zolpidem test dosing prior to using the drug operationally. To our knowledge, this is the single largest published case series of zolpidem ground testing outcomes among Asian military aviators. Kew GS, See B. Zolpidem as a sleep aid for military aviators.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A loss of 1% or more of bodyweight due to dehydration has a negative effect on cognitive performance, which could critically affect flight safety. There is no mention in the literature concerning the amounts of military pilots’ fluid loss during flight. The aim of this study was to quantify fluid loss of pilots during military flight. METHODS: There were 48 aviators (mean age 23.9) from the Israeli Air Force who participated in the study, which included 104 training flights in various flight platforms. Bodyweight, urine specific gravity, and environmental heat strain were measured before and after each flight. Fluid loss was calculated as the weight differences before and after the flight. We used a univariate and one-way ANOVA to analyze the effect of different variables on the fluid loss. RESULTS: The mean fluid loss rate was 462 ml · h −1 . The results varied among different aircraft platforms and depended on flight duration. Blackhawk pilots lost the highest amount of fluids per flight, albeit had longer flights (mean 108 min compared to 35.5 in fighter jets). Jet fighter pilots had the highest rate of fluid loss per hour of flight (up to 692 ml, extrapolated). CONCLUSION: Overall, at 11 flights (11%) aircrew completed their flight with a meaningful fluid loss. We conclude that military flights may be associated with significant amount of fluid loss among aircrew. Levkovsky A, Abot-Barkan S, Chapnik L, Doron O, Levy Y, Heled Y, Gordon B.

RESULTS: T re was lower after PREC compared to WU throughout exercise and lower than COMBO for the first 12 km; COMBO was lower than WU for the first 4 km. T sk during PREC was lower than COMBO and WU for the first 8 km, and lower in COMBO than WU for the first 4 km. PREC lowered pre-exercise heart rate relative to COMBO and WU (68 ± 10, 106 ± 12, 101 ± 13 bpm, respectively), but it increased similarly during exercise. Local sweat rate (SR) was lower in PREC (0.1 ± 0.1 mg · cm −2 · min −1 ) than COMBO (0.5 ± 0.2 mg · cm −2 · min −1 ) and WU (0.6 ± 0.2 mg · cm −2 · min −1 ) for the first 4 km. Treatments did not differentially affect performance (PREC = 31.9 ± 1.9 min, COMBO = 32.6 ± 2.7 min, WU = 33.1 ± 2.9 min). DISCUSSION: We conclude precooling alone or with warm-up mitigated thermal strain during exercise, but did not significantly improve 16.1-km cycling time trial performance.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhinitis is a prevalent condition warranting special aeromedical consideration due to its potential for acute and painful manifestations involving the middle ear or paranasal sinuses during rapid barometric pressure changes. Although second generation antihistamines and intranasal steroids are safe and effective treatments for this common condition, aeromedical management varies. METHODS: An aeromedical policy review of 14 public access civil and military data repositories was undertaken. Policy within a convenience sample of nine countries (Australia, Canada, Croatia, France, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States) was further ascertained through subject matter expert consultation. A convenience sample of recent primary care review articles and ENT guidelines were reviewed in order to substantiate the evidence basis for aeromedical practices. RESULTS: Policies range from disqualification of flight applicants with any history of allergic rhinitis to the authorization of short-term, select undeclared medication use for the management of mild symptoms, with military authorities applying a more conservative approach. A range of intranasal and oral therapies are approved and requirements for waiver vary across most authorities. DISCUSSION: Variation in practices must be considered when managing flight crews as part of military coalition peacetime and combat operations, as well as for international civil aviation missions conducted in support of natural disaster relief, rescue, and other stability efforts. Standardization of approved therapies for allergic rhinitis could be a useful starting point for the harmonization of aeromedical global policies in the future. Beneficial national specific policy updates may be undertaken on the basis of international experience. Powell-Dunford N, Reese C, Bushby A, Munkeby BH, Coste S, Pezer VL, Rosenkvist L.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The spectrum of altitude decompression sickness (DCS) is evolving as more cases of atypical pressure fluctuations occur. This ongoing change makes it a difficult condition to diagnose and even more difficult to identify. Both Flight Surgeons and Undersea Medical Officers (UMOs) must keep DCS on the differential. These two cases describe altitude DCS after unique pressure patterns, with one at a markedly lower than expected altitude for DCS. CASE REPORT: Both cases occurred in the F/A-18C and resulted in DCS requiring hyperbaric chamber treatment. The aviator in case 1 experienced an over-pressurization to an unknown depth with a subsequent rapid decompression during a carrier approach at 600 ft (182.9 m) above sea level. The aviator in case 2 experienced cabin pressure fluctuations between 9000 ft (2743.2 m) and 18,000 ft (5486.4 m). Both cases demonstrate the progression of DCS after partial treatment on ground-level oxygen therapy, and the case sequence illustrates how evaluations and protocols changed with experience. DISCUSSION: Decompression sickness is difficult to identify since it does not have a diagnostic test. These cases were even more difficult because of subtle exam findings, reliance on subjective symptoms, and atypical pressure profiles. Environmental, physiological, and psychosocial factors specific to the aviation community can delay the diagnosis and treatment. Descending in altitude and using in-flight emergency oxygen or ground-level oxygen partially treats and masks symptoms for both the aviator and the physician. The Flight Surgeons’ integration within the squadron and collaboration with UMOs is important to identify the first signs of DCS and decrease time to treatment. Lee KJ, Sanou AZ.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Understanding human behavior under the effects of sleep deprivation allows for the mitigation of risk due to reduced performance. To further this goal, this study investigated the effects of short-term sleep deprivation using a tilt-based control device and examined whether existing user models accurately predict targeting performance. METHODS: A task in which the user tilts a surface to roll a ball into a target was developed to examine motor performance. A model was built to predict human performance for this task under various levels of sleep deprivation. Every 2 h, 10 subjects completed the task until they reached 24 h of wakefulness. Performance measurements of this task, which were based on Fitts’ law, included movement time, task throughput, and time intercept. RESULTS: The model predicted significant performance decrements over the 24-h period with an increase in movement time (R 2 = 0.61), a decrease in throughput (R 2 = 0.57), and an increase in time intercept (R 2 = 0.60). However, it was found that in experimental trials there was no significant change in movement time (R 2 = 0.11), throughput (R 2 = 0.15), or time intercept (R 2 = 0.27). DISCUSSION: The results found were unexpected as performance decrement is frequently reported during sleep deprivation. These findings suggest a reexamination of the initial thought of sleep loss leading to a decrement in all aspects of performance. Bolkovsky JB, Ritter FE, Chon KH, Qin M.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A habitat atmosphere of 34% oxygen (O 2 ) and 66% nitrogen (N 2 ) at 8.2 psia (56.5 kPa) is proposed to minimize the risk of decompression sickness during extravehicular activity. The resulting inspired O 2 partial pressure (P I o 2 ) of 128 mmHg is similar to that experienced during portions of 41 Space Shuttle missions that used a “staged” denitrogenation (prebreathe) protocol with an atmosphere of 26.5% O 2 and 73.5% N 2 at 10.2 psia (70.3 kPa). We evaluated symptoms possibly linked to mild hypoxia in astronauts breathing a P I o 2 of 127 mmHg. METHODS: Environmental data were used to determine time in the shuttle at 10.2 psia and time at 14.7 psia (101.3 kPa). A total of 14 possible hypoxia symptoms were compared with symptoms collected during normoxic shuttle operations at 14.7 psia using logistic regression. RESULTS: There were 134.1 d (788.8 person days) under the 10.2 psia staged condition with a mean of 3.17 ± 2.2 SD d/mission. There were 258.81 d at 14.7 psia (2192.95 person days). An average of 4.31 potentially hypoxia-related symptoms per mission day was documented under the staged condition compared with 4.08 per mission day during the normoxic condition. Logistic regression showed no symptoms were significantly associated with just the 10.2 psia condition. DISCUSSION: Chronic exposure to a P I o 2 of 127 mmHg is well-tolerated by healthy humans on Earth. A similar short-duration exposure on the shuttle resulted in no increased reporting of possible hypoxia-related symptoms. However, chronic mild hypoxia interactions with physiological changes due to microgravity adaptations remain unclear. Wessel JH III, Schaefer CM, Thompson MS, Norcross JR, Bekdash OS.

    "abstract": "Artificial hypergravity has been proposed to prevent or treat various forms of physiological deconditioning experienced during spaceflight. We have previously reported that cerebral blood flow decreased at 15-21 min of +1.5-Gz centrifugation without decreases in arterial pressure at heart level. We reanalyzed our previous data to clarify time-dependent changes in cerebral blood flow and arterial pressure during mild +Gz hypergravity.We reanalyzed data for 0-20 min during +1.5-Gz centrifugation on 13 male subjects for whom physiological data were steadily recorded. Mean cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCBFVMCA), mean arterial pressure at heart level (MAPheart), and middle cerebral artery level (MAPMCA) during centrifugation were averaged every 5 min and compared with prehypergravity data (+1.0 Gz, 5 min).MAPheart did not change significantly, but MAPMCA decreased significantly throughout centrifugation compared to prehypergravity data (-16.7% to -24.7%). MCBFVMCA tended to be decreased at 0-5 min of +1.5-Gz centrifugation (-3.3%), but this was not statistically significant. MCBFVMCA was significantly decreased at 5-10 min (-5.5%). MCBFVMCA at 10-15 min and 15-20 min were also significantly decreased to almost the same level (-6.9% and -6.8%, respectively).No significant change in MAPheart was detected, whereas MAPMCA decreased significantly from the beginning of +1.5-Gz centrifugation. On the other hand, MCBFVMCA gradually decreased and became roughly flat in the latter half of 20-min centrifugation. Understanding the different time-dependent changes in cerebral blood flow and arterial pressure under mild +Gz hypergravity might be important for implementation of centrifuging as a countermeasure for spaceflight-induced deconditioning.Konishi T, Kurazumi T, Kato T, Takko C, Ogawa Y, Iwasaki K.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spontaneous pneumothorax (PTX) is a diagnostic challenge in aviators given the common occurrence of musculoskeletal pain after flight and notorious underreporting of symptoms of other diseases in this group. CASE REPORT: A 24-yr-old active duty F/A-18 Weapon Systems Officer performed an anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) in response to a 6.5-g warm-up turn during a training flight at 16,000 ft (4876.8 m) above sea level. He immediately developed right-sided thoracic back pain. The flight was terminated, he landed, and the pain improved. Over the next 5 d, he noticed the insidious development of pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. His symptoms prompted presentation to an aviation medicine clinic where a large right sided PTX was identified. After transfer to a local emergency department, a large bore chest tube was placed. A CT scan showed bilateral apical blebs requiring right and subsequently left video assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) with chemical/mechanical pleurodesis and apical wedge resection. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) showed a mild restriction defect 2-1/2 mo after surgery. The patient also completed cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), performing better than his predicted reference range. After a high resolution CT showed no remaining signs of bleb or cyst disease and another month of healing he was returned to flight. DISCUSSION: PTX should be considered in aviators with perithoracic pain after flight as several aspects of flight in high performance aircraft may increase the risk for PTX. These include positive pressure breathing through a facemask, repeated use of the AGSM, and the possibility of bleb expansion at altitude. DeYoung H, Ahmed Y, Buckley J.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excess postexercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) is an elevation in oxygen consumption (Vo 2 ) following exercise. Altitude decreases maximal oxygen uptake; however, studies are equivocal concerning the effect on resting metabolic rate. The EPOC response has not been studied with normobaric hypoxia. The purpose was to observe EPOC following constant-load cycling in normobaric hypoxia. METHODS: Subjects ( N = 7 women, 7 men) completed resting metabolic rate testing between 06:00 and 08:30. Constant workload cycle exercise was performed (10 min at 100 W) while breathing air from an altitude simulator under the following conditions: normoxic control (CON), 3353 m (11,001 ft; HI), and 6401 m (21,001 ft; EXT). Subjects completed remaining conditions in a counterbalanced order. Upon completion, participants were reconnected to the metabolic system until a running 5-min average of Vo 2 values returned to baseline (EPOC duration). Magnitude was determined by summing the net oxygen consumption each minute during the EPOC period. Data were analyzed using 2 × 3 repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: No sex differences were detected for any variable. EPOC duration increased significantly at each simulated altitude increase (CON = 15.2 ± 1.9 vs. HI = 20.7 ± 1.7 min) (HI vs. EXT = 28.1 ± 2.6 min). Likewise, EPOC magnitude increased significantly at each simulated altitude (CON = 73.5 ± 9.9 vs. HI = 99.1 ± 9.3 ml O 2 ) (HI vs. EXT = 139.7 ± 14.3 ml O 2 ). DISCUSSION: The EPOC response to simulated altitude represents elevated caloric expenditure that must be accounted for. Individuals who are active at altitude must consider the increased caloric deficit despite a loss of appetite that is common with altitude exposure. Navalta JW, Tanner EA, Bodell NG.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although several studies have shown that an individual’s career influences the brain structure, no study has examined cortical asymmetry in civil aviation pilots. This study focused on hemispheric cortical asymmetries in Chinese civil aviation pilots. METHODS: The MRI structural images of 1065 healthy captains of the Civil Aviation Administration of China were analyzed using a surface-based automated parcellation approach, and hemispheric asymmetries in the global and regional cortical thickness of their brains were examined. RESULTS: The hemispheric asymmetries were relatively significant. In total, 58 regions out of 74 were clearly asymmetrical. Generally, rightward asymmetries (reduction left) were found in slightly more regions than leftward asymmetries. The study also revealed leftward asymmetries mainly throughout the lateral, dorsal, and mesial surfaces of the frontal lobe, extending into the primary sensory, superior parietal, and anterior temporal cortices. In addition, the rightward asymmetries were mainly located in the temporal and occipital cortices. DISCUSSION: Compared with previous studies, in this study, the structural lateralization of the cortical thickness was more significant. Most of the results were in agreement with those of previous studies, although there were different results in some regions. Functional structural lateralization was demonstrated among the regions. Hemispheric differences in the thickness of the cortex might be related to hemisphere-specific functional specializations that may be associated with behavioral asymmetries.

Studies have shown that 20–50% of passengers report ear complaints during the flight or after landing. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of otitis media with effusion in aircrew members and describe the time to resolution of the condition. METHODS: All aircrew members presenting at Civil Aviation Center at Congonhas Airport at São Paulo for annual flight medical examinations from September 2014 to May 2015 were reviewed retrospectively for the presence of otologic disorders. Eligible participants were all pilots, copilots, and flight attendants with a diagnosis of otitis media with effusion confirmed by immittance testing. RESULTS: Of 1607 aircrew members, 155 (9.65%) were diagnosed as having otitis media with effusion. Most participants were men (51.6%). Regarding aircrew position, 81.9% were flight attendants, 11.6% were copilots, and 6.5% were pilots. The mean time to resolution of the otitis media was 8.23 (± 3.02) days. DISCUSSION: Otolaryngologists must be aware of the effects of gas expansion in the middle ear at higher altitudes for the appropriate treatment of diseases related to pressure changes. The recommendation for an aircrew member to return to flying duties should occur only after the individual has been treated and complete resolution, confirmed by immittance testing, has been documented.

However, other nations have organized space programs over the last 40 yr and the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, the China National Space Administration, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency all offer an opportunity for further study of the mortality of space explorers. METHODS: We used biographical and vital data abstracted from public sources for European, Canadian, Chinese, and Japanese astronauts. Using general population mortality rates from the Human Mortality Database and mortality rates derived from the cohort of U.S. astronauts, we computed standardized mortality ratios. RESULTS: The groups displayed different preferences in selection of astronauts. As there were no deaths in any of the four groups, the point estimates for standardized mortality ratios were all 0. However, the European cohort experienced a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk in comparison to the European general population as well as in comparison to U.S. astronauts. DISCUSSION: The healthy worker effect predicts that all study cohorts should have lower all-cause mortality risk in comparison to their general populations. The general population of Japan has mortality rates low enough that any reduction in mortality risk may remain undetectable in the Japanese cohort. Continued surveillance of these populations in the coming decades will make them a useful addition to the evidence base for astronaut mortality. Reynolds RJ, Day SM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For over 30 yr the global medical community has attempted to define the acceptable cardiovascular risk in pilots. This challenge is compounded by the ever-changing technological and medical landscape of air travel. We aimed to review the existing literature on estimating the risk of pilot cardiovascular incapacitation and determine if the current guidelines are founded in the best available evidence. METHODS: A detailed review of the guidelines and literature that supports them was completed. Relevant articles were identified by review of the source literature of the guidelines and the references of these source documents. All articles referenced were reviewed in full by both authors. Data that informed the existing recommendations were reviewed and compared to available modern data. The results of these findings were incorporated into a formula that allows for the calculation of acceptable pilot cardiovascular risk given any operator-determined set of variables. RESULTS: Among the evidence that informs current guidelines, there exists a need for further updating. A number of assumptions have been made in creating guidelines and these may no longer reflect the current technological or medical aviation environment. Incorporating the identified variables into a formula allows for the calculation of acceptable cardiovascular risk. This formula was tested using past data and reproduced existing results. DISCUSSION: Current guidelines for pilot cardiovascular risk assessment require review by the international aviation medical community. We propose a novel formula that may serve as a template for future guidelines and may be adapted as aviation technology and health data evolve. Mulloy A, Wielgosz A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Designed as a more ecological measure of reaction times, the Perception-Action Coupling Task (PACT) has shown good reliability and within-subject stability. However, a lengthy testing period was required. Perceptual-motor judgments are known to be affected by proximity of the stimulus to the action boundary. The current study sought to determine the effects of action boundary proximity on PACT performance, and whether redundant levels of stimuli, eliciting similar responses, can be eliminated to shorten the PACT.METHODS: There were 9 men and 7 women who completed 4 testing sessions, consisting of 3 familiarization cycles and 6 testing cycles of the PACT. For the PACT, subjects made judgments on whether a series of balls presented on a tablet afford \"posting\" (can fit) through a series of apertures. There were 8 ratios of ball to aperture size (B-AR) presented, ranging from 0.2 to 1.8, with each ratio appearing 12 times (12 trials) per cycle. Reaction times and judgment accuracy were calculated, and averaged across all B-ARs. Ratios and individual trials within each B-AR were systematically eliminated. Variables were re-averaged, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficients of variation (CVTE) were calculated in an iterative manner.RESULTS: With elimination of the 0.2 and 1.8 B-ARs, the PACT showed good reliability (ICC = 0.81-0.99) and consistent within-subject stability (CVTE = 2.2-14.7%). Reliability (ICC = 0.81-0.97) and stability (CVTE = 2.6-15.6%) were unaffected with elimination of up to 8 trials from each B-AR.DISCUSSION: The shortened PACT resulted in an almost 50% reduction in total familiarization/testing time required, significantly increasing usability.Johnson CD, LaGoy AD, Pepping G-J, Eagle SR, Beethe AZ, Bower JL, Alfano CA, Simpson RJ, Connaboy C.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is a growing trend in the use of drugs, which could increase the likelihood of an aircraft accident. Evidence exists that pilots do not report all medications to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The purpose of this study was to compare medications discovered by postaccident toxicology testing to those reported to the FAA to determine the veracity of pilot reported medications. METHODS: Medications reported on applications for U.S. medical certificates were compared to those discovered during postaccident toxicology testing. Logistic regressions were performed using Age, Gender, Type of Flight Operation, Medical Class Issued, and whether a Special Issuance (SI) medical certificate was issued as independent covariates. Truth in Reporting a medication was the outcome variable. RESULTS: Age and an SI medical certificate were good predictors of the likelihood of truthfully reporting medications. For each year of age the probability of a subject drug record being truthfully reported increased by 5%, while a pilot with an SI was 3.12 times more likely to be truthful than a pilot without an SI. When reported medications were limited to cardiovascular drugs, Age was the only good predictor of truthful reporting and, for every additional year of age, the probability of a subject drug record being truthfully reported increased by 3%. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the probability of a pilot truthfully reporting medication use increases with Age and an SI medical certificate. When reported medications were limited to cardiovascular drugs, Age was the only good predictor of truthful reporting. DeJohn CA, Greenhaw R, Lewis R, Cliburn K.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Numerous issues in mental health benefit from technological innovation. An example involves the mental health challenges of long-duration spaceflight (such as a Mars mission), including prolonged confinement, microgravity, and different sunlight exposure lengths. Persisting on Earth are global mental health challenges stemming from disease burdens, limited interview-based diagnostic systems, trial-and-error treatment approaches, and suboptimal access. There is potential for cross-pollinating solutions between these seemingly disparate challenges using a range of emerging technologies such as sensors, omics, and big data. In this review, we highlight the bidirectional value of mental health technology transfer aimed to address issues both on Earth and in space. METHODS: We prepared a systematic review of studies pertaining to mental health technological innovation and space medicine. RESULTS: For Earth mental health technologies translatable to long-duration space missions, we cite several example technologies, including device-based psychotherapy and social support, conversational agents aka chatbots, and nutritional and physical activity focused mental health. Space technologies translatable to Earth mental health include remote sensing devices, global navigation satellite systems, satellite communications, chronotherapies, and nutritional advances. DISCUSSION: There is a rich history of space technologies informing Earth technological trends, including general health care on Earth, and vice versa. To avoid the traditional happenstance approach that results in delays, missed opportunities, and increased cost, and to improve outcomes for both Earth and space utilization of these technologies, we propose increased dialogue and training opportunities to enhance innovation and outcomes.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: It is important for military commanders to know the extent of fatigue experienced by soldiers undergoing a long-term military training. This knowledge can enable them to determine the level of physical capabilities of soldiers. The present study aimed to evaluate changes in the level of chosen biochemical parameters in blood during the survival training of Polish Naval Academy cadets. METHODS: Participating voluntarily in the research study were 14 cadets. All subjects were men, ages 23.1 2.0 yr. During the 36-h survival training, the subjects were deprived of sleep. The following biochemical parameters were assessed in venous blood collected from the cadets: creatine kinase (CK) activity, concentration of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs), superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx). RESULTS: After 36 h of training a significant increase was observed in CK (from 183.1 up to 530.2 U L 1 ), LOOHs (from 1.72 up to 3.74 mol L 1 ), and GPx (from 27.4 up to 36.4 U gHb 1 ). After 12 h of rest, the level of LOOHs returned to the initial level, GPx activity did not change significantly, and CK activity was significantly higher than those at baseline (422.3 U L 1 ). DISCUSSION: The 36-h survival training increased oxidative stress, which contributed to the damage to muscle cells in the group of cadets of the Polish Naval Academy. The intensity of postexercise changes in the level of oxidative damage indicators is dependent on the initial level of enzymatic antioxidant defense. The 12-h recovery proved to be too short to regenerate the damaged muscle tissue. Tomczak A, Jówko E, Różański P.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Piloting an aircraft is a complex cognitive task. Human error represents a major contributing factor in aviation accidents. Emotion plays an important role in aviation safety. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to explore whether pilots and nonpilots may differ in the neural mechanisms responsible for the processing of conflict emotional information. METHODS: A total of 27 civil aviation pilots and 24 nonpilot controls performed the emotional Stroop task, in which participants were required to identify the facial expressions of the stimuli while ignoring the congruent or incongruent emotional words superimposed on the faces. Neural responses to the stimuli were compared between pilots and controls. Also, a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was performed to explore whether there were differences in effective connectivity between pilots and nonpilots. RESULTS: Behavioral data showed that pilots (21.23 ms) and nonpilots (26.78 ms) had equivalent congruency effects. Nevertheless, their neural activation patterns differed. Compared with pilots, nonpilots exhibited neural activity in the right supramarginal gyrus when processing incongruent stimuli, and more regions were activated in the process of conflict monitoring. The PPI analysis showed greater activity between the right supramarginal gyrus and the right lingual gyrus when nonpilots confronted incongruent vs. congruent stimuli. However, this effective connectivity was not found in pilots. CONCLUSION: These results suggest different mechanisms underlying emotional conflict control between pilots and the general population.

The purpose of this study was to determine if resistive and/or endurance respiratory muscle training (RRMT and ERMT, respectively) vs. placebo respiratory muscle training (PRMT) improve cycling performance at altitude. METHODS: There were 24 subjects who were assigned to PRMT ( N 8), RRMT ( N 8), or ERMT ( N 8). Subjects cycled to exhaustion in a hypobaric chamber decompressed to 3657 m (12,000 ft) at an intensity of 55% sea level maximal oxygen consumption (Vo 2max ) before and after respiratory muscle training (RMT). Additionally, subjects completed a Vo 2max , pulmonary function, and respiratory endurance test (RET) before and after RMT. All RMT protocols consisted of three 30-min training sessions per week for 4 wk. RESULTS: The RRMT group increased maximum inspiratory (P Imax ) and expiratory (P Emax ) mouth pressure after RMT (P Imax : 117.7 11.6 vs. 162.6 20.0; P Emax : 164.0 33.2 vs. 216.5 44.1 cmH 2 O). The ERMT group increased RET after RMT (5.2 5.2 vs.18.6 16.9 min). RMT did not improve Vo 2max in any group. Both RRMT and ERMT groups increased cycling time to exhaustion (RRMT: 35.9 17.2 vs. 45.6 22.2 min and ERMT: 33.8 9.6 vs. 42.9 27.0 min).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: At sea level, performing chest compressions is a demanding physical exercise. On a commercial flight at cruise altitude, the barometric pressure in the cabin is approximately equal to an altitude of 2438 m. This results in a Po 2 equivalent to breathing an F I o 2 of 15% at sea level, a condition under which both the duration and quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may deteriorate. We hypothesized that rescuers will be able to perform fewer rounds of high-quality CPR at an F I o 2 of 15%. METHODS: In this crossover simulation trial, 16 healthy volunteers participated in 2 separate sessions and performed up to 14 2-min rounds of chest compressions at an F I o 2 of either 0.15 or 0.21 in randomized order. Subjects were stopped if their S p o 2 was below 80%, if chest compression rate or depth was not achieved for 2/3 of compressions, or if they felt fatigued or dyspneic. RESULTS: Fewer rounds of chest compressions were successfully completed in the hypoxic than in the normoxic condition, (median [IQR] 4.5 [3,8.5]) vs. 5 [4,14]). The decline in arterial S p o 2 while performing chest compressions was greater in the hypoxic condition than in the normoxic condition [mean (SD), 6.19% (4.1) vs. 2% (1.66)]. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that the ability of rescuers to perform chest compressions in a commercial airline cabin at cruising altitude may be limited due to hypoxia. One possible solution is supplemental oxygen for rescuers who perform chest compressions for in-flight cardiac arrest. Clebone A, Reis K, Tung A, OConnor M, Ruskin KJ.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited research exists into extraterrestrial CPR, despite the drive for interplanetary travel. This study investigated whether the terrestrial CPR method can provide quality external chest compressions (ECCs) in line with the 2015 UK resuscitation guidelines during ground-based hypogravity simulation. It also explored whether gender, weight, and fatigue influence CPR quality.METHODS: There were 21 subjects who performed continuous ECCs for 5 min during ground-based hypogravity simulations of Mars (0.38 G) and the Moon (0.16 G), with Earths gravity (1 G) as the control. Subjects were unloaded using a body suspension device (BSD). ECC depth and rate, heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE), oxygen uptake (Vo₂), and Borg scores were measured.RESULTS: ECC depth was lower in 0.38 G (42.9 9 mm) and 0.16 G (40.8 9 mm) compared to 1 G and did not meet current resuscitation guidelines. ECC rate was adequate in all gravity conditions. There were no differences in ECC depth and rate when comparing gender or weight. ECC depth trend showed a decrease by min 5 in 0.38 G and by min 2 in 0.16 G. Increases in HR, VE, and Vo₂ were observed from CPR min 1 to min 5.DISCUSSION: The terrestrial method of CPR provides a consistent ECC rate but does not provide adequate ECC depths in simulated hypogravities. The results suggest that a mixed-gender space crew of varying bodyweights may not influence ECC quality. Extraterrestrial-specific CPR guidelines are warranted. With a move to increasing ECC rate, permitting lower ECC depths and substituting rescuers after 1 min in lunar gravity and 4 min in Martian gravity is recommended.Sriharan S, Kay G, Lee JCY, Pollock RD, Russomano T.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mass, moment of inertia, and amplitude of neck motion were altered during a reciprocal scanning task to investigate how night vision goggles (NVGs) use mechanistically is associated with neck trouble among rotary-wing aircrew. METHODS: There were 30 subjects measured while scanning between targets at 2 amplitudes (near and far) and under 4 head supported mass conditions (combinations of helmet, NVGs, and counterweights). Electromyography (EMG) was measured bilaterally from the sternocleidomastoid and upper neck extensors. Kinematics were measured from the trunk and head. RESULTS: Scanning between the far amplitude targets required higher peak angular accelerations (7% increase) and neck EMG (between 1.24.5% increase), lower muscle cocontraction ratios (6.7% decrease), and fewer gaps in EMG (up to a 59% decrease) relative to the near targets. Increasing the mass of the helmet had modest effects on neck EMG, while increasing the moment of inertia did not. DISCUSSION: Target amplitude, not head supported mass configuration, had a greater effect on exposure metrics. Use of NVGs restricts field-of-view, requiring an increased amplitude of neck movement. This may play an important role in understanding links between neck trouble and NVG use. Healey LA, Derouin AJ, Callaghan JP, Cronin DS, Fischer SL.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many workers routinely transition between day and night shiftsincluding pilots, where night flights are commonly considered more stressful. The physiological toll from this transition is not fully understood, though fatigue is a factor in many aviation accidents. This research investigated the changes in physiological markers of stress and cognitive performance as F-22 pilots transitioned from day flying to night flying. METHODS: There were 17 fully-qualified F-22 pilots who took part in a 2-wk data collection using salivary swabs, wrist-worn activity monitors, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) inventory, and a go/no-go (GNG) test. RESULTS: No differences were found in comparing day and night flying on the GNG reaction time/accuracy, NASA-TLX scores, or sleep quantity. Cortisol levels were significantly higher than civilian levels in all experimental conditions and control days. Participants had higher than predicted cortisol levels postflight in the day-flying condition and lower than predicted cortisol levels postflight in the night-flying condition, relative to levels from control day patterns. We also found smaller changes in cortisol (pre- to postflight) in the day-flying condition for those with more F-22 experience. Finally, we found a negative correlation between Perceived Stress Scale scores and age of pilots ( r 0.72). DISCUSSION: We hypothesized that the night-flying environment would be more stressful, but our results disputed this claim. Our results suggest day flying elicits more of a stress response; however, a larger sample size is required to verify results. Preliminary findings of potential stress adaptation may suggest stress adaptation in the F-22 community needs further investigation. Combs EK, Dahlman AS, Shattuck NL, Heissel JA, Whitaker LR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: U.S. airlines often request a healthcare professional to volunteer to assist an ill passenger. Litigation from a Good Samaritans care of an in-flight medical emergency (IME) is considered improbable. The 1998 Aviation Medical Assistance Act (AMAA) encourages health care professionals to volunteer with indemnity for standard and good medical care. It does not offer legal or financial assistance. Our review explored the legal support malpractice companies and U.S. airlines provide if litigation is initiated for IME care. Malpractice insurance policies can differ on IME coverage. We found most private practice physicians policies include IME. Medical institutions may have policies restricting their physicians coverage to the institutions location. Those without malpractice coverage will need to retain and pay for a legal defense to demonstrate no gross negligence and no willful misconduct. The physicians, airline crews, and on-ground IME documentation support should be retained by the Good Samaritan especially for a pediatric or adolescent ill passenger. U.S. airlines consider a Good Samaritan medical volunteer as a passenger and do not extend legal assistance. This contrasts with some foreign airlines that do provide liability protection. Knowledge of the malpractice policy IME coverage is essential prior to traveling by air. After completing care for an ill passenger, physicians should generate their medical documentation and request the IME documentation generated by the airline and on-ground medical expert. We also believe U.S. airlines should assume responsibility to provide legal assistance to a Good Samaritan physician in the event of IME litigation. de Caprariis PJ, Di Maio A.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of inspired O₂ concentration on the development of acceleration atelectasis when wearing modern anti-G garments. METHODS: There were 14 nonaircrew subjects who completed 5 centrifuge exposures to +5 Gz lasting 90 s. During exposures subjects breathed a gas mixture containing 21, 35, 45, 60, or 75% O₂. To assess the extent of atelectasis post-Gz, forced inspiratory vital capacity (FIVC), regional FIVC (EITFIVC), shunt, respiratory resistance, reactance, and compliance and peripheral O₂ saturation during a hypoxic exposure were measured. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, FIVC was not statistically significantly altered. EITFIVC was 14.4% lower after the 75% O₂ exposure only with a greater symptom reporting with higher FIO₂ in some individuals. A significantly greater shunt (3>6%) followed the 60 and 75% O₂ exposures. O₂ concentration during Gz had no effect on respiratory resistance, reactance, compliance, or hypoxemia. DISCUSSION: There is evidence of mild acceleration atelectasis present when breathing 60% O₂, particularly in susceptible individuals, with 75% O₂ causing more obvious physiological compromise. An inspired oxygen concentration of <60% will prevent the majority of individuals from developing acceleration atelectasis. Pollock RD, Gates SD, Radcliffe JJ, Stevenson AT.

    "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND: Based on posturography parameters during sleep deprivation (SD), a mental fatigue index (MFI) was constructed for healthy male cadets. METHODS: There were 37 young male subjects who volunteered for two successive days of SD. Their posturography balance, profile of mood status (POMS), and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured at four different times (10:00 and 22:00 of day 1, 10:00 and 22:00 of day 2). According to the methods used in our previous research, similar MFIs based on posturography parameters were computed. Then, correlations of MFIs with POMS scores and HRV values were evaluated by linear and nonlinear methods including quadratic, S-curve, growth, and exponential analyses. RESULTS: MFI continued to increase during SD and MFI as the independent variable had quadratic relationships with fluster (R 2 0.057), depression (R 2 0.067), and anger (R 2 0.05) scores of POMS. A linear correlation was found between MFI and the depression score (R 2 0.045) and MFI correlated linearly (R 2 0.029) and nonlinearly (R 2 0.03) with heart rate. Similarly, MFI reflected changes in the time and frequency domain parameters of HRV, with linear (R 2 range: 0.0290.082) or nonlinear (R 2 range: 0.0300.082) relationships. DISCUSSION: The increase of MFI was linked with amplification of personal negative moods and an imbalance of autonomic nervous system activity. The findings suggest that MFI might be a potential indicator of mental fatigue and provide a method to prevent driving fatigue and human errors. Cheng S, Yang J, Su M, Sun J, Xiong K, Ma J, Hu W.

Loss of control on landing, wheels down landings, and other landing problems (49%) were the principal causes of the accidents and 77% of the fatalities occurred in this group. These arose because the pilot(s) misjudged wind, waves, and glassy water. Over 50% of seaplanes inverted and 10% floated briefly then sank, resulting in the highest percentage of fatalities. Wearing the seat harness incorrectly, injury, in-rushing water, and inability to locate and operate exit mechanisms (including rescuers inability to open the exits external to the fuselage) all contributed to the fatalities. Life jackets would have been of benefit in several cases. Of the accidents, 57% were private flights. CONCLUSIONS: Passengers require a thorough preflight briefing, life jackets should be worn by all pilots and passengers, and private and commercial pilots should receive Underwater Egress Training.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is an insidious and costly occurrence in the aviation community, commonly a consequence of insufficient sleep. Some organizations use scheduling tools to generate prescriptive sleep schedules to help aircrew manage their fatigue. It is important to examine whether aircrew follow these prescriptive schedules, especially in very dynamic environments. The current study compares aircrew sleep during missions to prescriptive sleep schedules generated by a mission scheduling tool. METHODS: Participating in the study were 44 volunteers (Mage= 28.23, SDage= 4.23; Proportionmale= 77.27%) from a C-17 mobility squadron providing 25 instances of sleep and mission data (80 flights total). Aircrew wore actigraph watches to measure sleep during missions and prescriptive sleep schedules were collected. Actual and prescriptive sleep was compared with calculated performance effectiveness values per minute across mission flights. RESULTS: Prescriptive schedules generally overestimated effectiveness during missions relative to estimated actual sleep, potentially causing shifts in effectiveness to ranges of increased risk requiring elevated fatigue mitigation efforts. Actual and prescriptive effectiveness estimates tended to increasingly diverge over the course of missions, which magnifies differences on longer missions. DISCUSSION: The current study suggests that aircrew sleep during missions often does not align with prescriptive sleep schedules generated by mission planning software, resulting in effectiveness estimates that are generally lower than predicted. This might discourage aircrew from using mission effectiveness graphs as a fatigue mitigation tool. Additionally, because fatigue estimates factor into overall operational risk management processes, these schedules might underestimate risks to safety, performance, and health.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT) are prevalent diseases with baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations that future astronauts and spaceflight participants may suffer from. Preflight, in-flight, and postflight IOP measurements were collected aboard two U.S. Space Shuttle Program missions in normotensive control, OHT, and glaucomatous crewmembers. METHODS: Five subjects (three controls, one glaucomatous, one OHT) were studied aboard 2-wk Space Shuttle missions. Baseline IOP (triplicate; handheld tonometry) was recorded during training 12 mo preflight, in flight (114 d), and postflight (329 d). Subjective symptoms were recorded via questionnaires. Data were analyzed using a spreadsheet with two-sample t-tests. P-value < 0.05 determined significance. RESULTS: IOP increased for all in-flight vs. preflight measurements for controls (N 3, 48.9, 16.9, 5.85), OHT (N 1, 20.3), and glaucomatous (N 1, 32.2) groups. IOP eventually returned to baseline postflight [Return (R)35 d], except for the astronaut with OHT (R917). Subjective symptoms, likely multifactorial, included blurredvision, decreased visual acuity, and headaches. DISCUSSION: IOP increased during spaceflight and normalized upon return. Astronauts and commercial spaceflight participants may need screening for elevated IOP to potentially prevent sequelae related to glaucoma and OHT, the former which requires treatment in flight and the latter which may need prophylaxis. Previous studies have shown elevated IOP upon entry into microgravity with various normalization timeframes in flight and postflight. It is unclear how increased IOP relates to spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS); however, several hypotheses exist. Treatment strategies should be available for acute and chronic ocular pathology during spaceflight despite the unique challenges of eye-drop application in microgravity.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While many COVID-19 studies focus on acute effects of the infection, few examine the intermediate and long-term sequelae of the illness. Studies have shown that a good portion of patients have chronic effects in several body systems for several months or longer. Such effects can potentially adversely impact pilot performance in flight. We sought to determine the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection, how such effects can affect pilot performance, and how to best evaluate pilots for aeromedical flight clearance. METHODS: We used the PubMed literature search engine to review peer-reviewed articles that focused on the intermediate and long-term effects of COVID-19 infection. Chronic signs and symptoms were subdivided based on the particular body organ system affected. Merging information obtained from case reviews, article reviews, and aeromedical standards, we created a risk stratification guide to assist with the aeromedical disposition of affected pilots. RESULTS: Long-term effects of COVID-19 infection can last for several months or longer. The most common effects are fatigue, weakness, pulmonary diffusion defects, depression, and anxiety. DISCUSSION: This review article focuses on the most common intermediate- and long-term COVID-19 conditions of aeromedical significance and the corresponding course of actions recommended for the aeromedical examiner. Aeromedical evaluation should take into consideration factors related to the pilot, aircraft type, and specific aviation environment. Such evaluation may include diagnostic testing, medical specialist consultation, preflight simulation in an altitude chamber, human centrifuge testing, and/or a flight simulator checkride.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: High prevalence of neck pain among skydivers is related to parachute opening shock (POS) exposure, but few investigations of POS deceleration have been made. Existing data incorporate equipment movements, limiting its representability of skydiver deceleration. This study aims to describe POS decelerations and compare human- with equipment-attached data. METHODS: Wearing two triaxial accelerometers placed on the skydiver (neck-sensor) and equipment (rig-sensor), 20 participants made 2 skydives each. Due to technical issues, data from 35 skydives made by 19 participants were collected. Missing data were replaced using data substitution techniques. Acceleration axes were defined as posterior to anterior (+ a x ), lateral right (+ a y ), and caudal to cranial (+ a z ). Deceleration magnitude [ a max (G)] and jerks (G · s −1 ) during POS were analyzed. RESULTS: Two distinct phases related to skydiver positioning and acceleration direction were observed: 1) the x-phase (characterized by − a x , rotating the skydiver); and 2) the z-phase (characterized by + a z , skydiver vertically oriented). Compared to the rig-sensor, the neck-sensor yielded lower a max (3.16 G vs. 6.96 G) and jerk (56.3 G · s −1 vs. 149.0 G · s −1 ) during the x-phase, and lower jerk (27.7 G · s −1 vs. 54.5 G · s −1 ) during the z-phase. DISCUSSION: The identified phases during POS should be considered in future neck pain preventive strategies. Accelerometer data differed, suggesting human-placed accelerometry to be more valid for measuring human acceleration.Gladh K, Lo Martire R, Äng BO, Lindholm P, Nilsson J, Westman A.

Our hypothesis is that EMI in the cockpit of a single-engine fixed-wing aircraft does not result in erroneous detection of arrhythmias and the subsequent delivery of an inappropriate device therapy. METHODS: ICD devices of four different manufacturers, incorporated in a thorax phantom, were transported in a Piper Dakota Aircraft with ICAO type designator P28B during several flights. The devices under test were programmed to the most sensitive settings for detection of electromagnetic signals from their environment. After the final flight the devices under test were interrogated with the dedicated programmers in order to analyze the number of tachycardias detected. RESULTS: Cumulative registration time of the devices under test was 11,392 min, with a mean of 2848 min per device. The registration from each one of the devices did not show any detectable “tachycardia” or subsequent inappropriate device therapy. This indicates that no external signals, which could be originating from electromagnetic fields from the aircraft's avionics, were detected by the devices under test. CONCLUSION: During transport in the cockpit of a single-engine fixed-wing aircraft, the tested ICDs did not show any signs of being affected by electromagnetic fields originating from the avionics of the aircraft. This current study indicates that EMI is not a potential safety issue for transportation of passengers with an ICD implanted in a single-engine fixed-wing aircraft.de Rotte AAJ, van der Kemp P, Mundy PA, Rienks R, de Rotte AA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite technological advances, hypoxia remains a concern in aviation. Hypoxia can present with a vast array of symptoms that are unique to each aviator. Military aviators undergo hypoxia awareness trainings to learn their unique constellation of hypoxia symptoms. CASE REPORT: This case report describes a military aviator who was flying in a B1 when the cabin depressurized. While performing the emergency checklist, the aviator was moving about the cabin and began to experience hypoxia symptoms. His symptoms occurred at an altitude below 3048 m (10,000 ft), and his fellow crewmembers remained asymptomatic. Previous hypoxia awareness trainings enabled the aviator to recognize his symptoms as hypoxic. His symptoms resolved within seconds of applying supplemental oxygen via his facemask, and he did not have any recurrence of his symptoms. DISCUSSION: Aviators reliably remember their hypoxic symptoms from previous hypoxia awareness trainings up to 4.5 yr later. This enables the aviator to quickly take action to correct his or her symptoms. While hypoxia is commonly thought to only occur at altitudes greater than 4267 m (14,000 ft), it can occur at lower altitudes, especially if it is compounded with the physiological changes from exercise.Tristan LR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decompression sickness (DCS) is a potential danger and risk for both divers and aircrew alike. DCS is also a potential side effect of altitude (hypobaric) chamber training as well and can present long after training occurs. Literature review shows that altitude chamber induced DCS has approximately a 0.25% incidence. CASE REPORT: A 32-yr-old, active duty military member developed symptoms of DCS 3 h after his hypobaric chamber training. Unfortunately, he did not seek treatment for DCS until 48 h after the exposure. His initial treatment included ground level oxygen therapy for 30 min at 12 L of oxygen per minute using a nonrebreathing mask. He achieved complete symptom resolution and was returned to duty. However, 12 d after his initial Flight Medicine evaluation, the patient returned complaining of a right temporal headache, multijoint pains, and fatigue. He was treated in the hyperbaric chamber and had complete resolution of symptoms. He was returned to flying status and 5 mo later denied any return of symptoms. DISCUSSION: Hypobaric chamber familiarity training is a requirement for all military aircrew personnel to allow them assess their ability to identify symptoms of hypoxia. This training method is not only costly to maintain, but it also places aircrew and chamber technicians at risk for potential long-term side effects from failed recompression treatment of DCS.

    "abstract": "Transport operators seeking to operate outside prescriptive fatigue management regulations are typically required to present a safety case justifying how they will manage the associated risk. This paper details a method for constructing a successful safety case.The method includes four elements: 1) scope (prescriptive rules and operations affected); 2) risk assessment; 3) risk mitigation strategies; and 4) monitoring ongoing risk. A successful safety case illustrates this method. It enables landing pilots in 3-pilot crews to choose the second or third in-flight rest break, rather than the regulatory requirement to take the third break. Scope was defined using a month of scheduled flights that would be covered (N = 4151). These were analyzed in the risk assessment using existing literature on factors affecting fatigue to estimate the maximum time awake at top of descent and sleep opportunities in each break. Additionally, limited data collected before the new regulations showed that pilots flying at landing chose the third break on only 6% of flights.A prospective survey comparing subjective reports (N = 280) of sleep in the second vs. third break and fatigue and sleepiness ratings at top of descent confirmed that the third break is not consistently superior. The safety case also summarized established systems for fatigue monitoring, risk assessment and hazard identification, and multiple fatigue mitigation strategies that are in place.Other successful safety cases have used this method. The evidence required depends on the expected level of risk and should evolve as experience with fatigue risk management systems builds.Gander P, Mangie J, Wu L, van den Berg M, Signal L, Phillips A.

    "abstract": "Treadmills have been employed as both a form of exercise and a countermeasure to prevent changes in the musculoskeletal system on almost all NASA missions and many Russian missions since the early Space Shuttle flights. It is possible that treadmills may also be part of exercise programs on future Mars missions and that they may be a component of exercise facilities in lunar or Martian habitats.In order to determine if the ambient gravity on these destinations will provide osteogenic effects while performing exercise on a treadmill, ground reactions forces (GRFs) were measured on eight subjects (six women and two men) running at 6 mph during parabolic flight in Martian and lunar gravity conditions.On average, stride length increased as gravity decreased. The first and second peaks of the GRFs decreased by 0.156 and 0.196 bodyweights, respectively, per 1/10 g change in ambient gravity.Based on comparisons with previously measured GRF during loaded treadmill running on the International Space Station, we conclude that unloaded treadmill running under lunar and Martian conditions during exploration missions is not likely to be an osteo-protective exercise.Cavanagh P, Rice A, Glauberman M, Sudduth A, Cherones A, Davis S, Lewis M, Hanson A, Wilt G.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Future space missions beyond low Earth orbit will require deconditioned astronauts to perform occupationally relevant tasks within a planetary spacesuit. The prediction of time-to-completion (TTC) of astronaut tasks will be critical for crew safety, autonomous operations, and mission success. This exploratory study determined if the addition of task-specific strength testing to current standard lower body testing would enhance the prediction of TTC in a 1-G test battery. METHODS: Eight healthy participants completed NASA lower body strength tests, occupationally specific strength tests, and performed six task simulations (hand drilling, construction wrenching, incline walking, collecting weighted samples, and dragging an unresponsive crewmember to safety) in a 48-kg weighted suit. The TTC for each task was recorded and summed to obtain a total TTC for the test battery. Linear regression was used to predict total TTC with two models: 1) NASA lower body strength tests; and 2) NASA lower body strength tests + occupationally specific strength tests. RESULTS: Total TTC of the test battery ranged from 20.2–44.5 min. The lower body strength test alone accounted for 61% of the variability in total TTC. The addition of hand drilling and wrenching strength tests accounted for 99% of the variability in total TTC. DISCUSSION: Adding occupationally specific strength tests (hand drilling and wrenching) to standard lower body strength tests successfully predicted total TTC in a performance test battery within a weighted suit. Future research should couple these strength tests with higher fidelity task simulations to determine the utility and efficacy of task performance prediction.Taylor A, Kotarsky CJ, Bond CW, Hackney KJ.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Repeated ischemic preconditioning (IPC) can improve muscle and pulmonary oxygen on-kinetics, blood flow, and exercise efficiency, but these effects have not been investigated in severe hypoxia. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of 7 d of IPC on resting and exercising muscle and cardio-pulmonary responses to severe hypoxia.METHODS: A total of 14 subjects received either: 1) 7 d of repeated lower-limb occlusion (4 × 5 min, 217 ± 30 mmHg) at limb occlusive pressure (IPC) or SHAM (4 × 5 min, 20 mmHg). Subjects were tested for resting limb blood flow, relative microvascular deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([HHB]), and pulmonary oxygen (Vo2p) responses to steady state and incremental exercise to exhaustion in hypoxia (fractional inspired O₂ = 0.103), which was followed by 7 d of IPC or SHAM and retesting 72 h post-intervention.RESULTS: There were no effects of IPC on maximal oxygen consumption, time to exhaustion during the incremental test, or minute ventilation and arterial oxygen saturation. However, the IPC group had higher delta efficiency based on pooled results and lower steady state Δ[HHB] (IPC ∼24% vs. SHAM ∼6% pre to post), as well as slowing the [HHB] time constant (IPC ∼26% vs. SHAM ∼3% pre to post) and reducing the overshoot in [HHB]: Vo₂ ratio during exercise onset.CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results demonstrate that muscle O₂ efficiency and microvascular O₂ distribution can be improved by repeated IPC, but there are no effects on maximal exercise capacity in severe hypoxia.Chopra K, Jeffries O, Tallent J, Heffernan S, Kilduff L, Gray A, Waldron M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Manually controlled docking of a spacecraft to a space station is an operational task that poses high demands on cognitive and perceptual functioning. Effective processing of visual information is crucial for success. Eye tracking can reveal the operator's attentional focus unobtrusively and objectively. Therefore, our aim was to test the feasibility of eye tracking during a simulation of manual docking and to identify links between visual information processing and performance.METHODS: We hypothesized that duration and number of gazes to specific regions of interest of the simulation (total dwell time and number of dwells) would be associated with docking accuracy. Eye movements were recorded in 10 subjects (30% women, M = 33.4 yr old) during the 6° head-down tilt bed rest study AGBRESA during 20 training sessions with the 6df learning program for spacecraft docking.RESULTS: Subjects' gaze was directed most frequently and longest to the vizor (185 dwells and 22,355 ms per task) followed by the two instrument displays (together 75 dwells and 4048 ms per task). We observed a significant positive relationship between number and duration of visual checks of speed and distance to the docking point and the accuracy of the docking maneuver.DISCUSSION: In conclusion, eye tracking provides valuable information related to docking accuracy that might prospectively offer the opportunity to improve docking training effectiveness.Piechowski S, Johannes B, Pustowalow W, Arz M, Mulder E, Jordan J, Wolf OT, Rittweger J.

We studied the probability that first morning void (FMV) urinary calcium (Uca) measurements would capture the highest Uca concentration in a day. METHODS: For 8 wk, three men and three women collected void-by-void 24-h urine samples weekly. Uca concentration was analyzed using a calcein-based system. Uca concentrations were ranked among all samples from each person. FMV and non-FMV (nFMV) Uca concentrations were compared with a Mann Whitney U -test. The probability that an FMV would capture the highest Uca concentration in a day was assessed. RESULTS: Among 377 voids collected, 46 were FMV and 331 were nFMV. Among all samples, the Uca concentration for FMV was significantly higher than nFMV ( P &lt; 0.0001). Out of the 46 FMVs, 24 were highest in Uca concentration for the corresponding 24-h period, giving a 52.2% probability that any given FMV would capture the highest Uca concentration in a day. The probability of measuring the highest Uca concentration from at least 1 d increased to 77.1%, and 89.1% when two or three FMVs were collected respectively. DISCUSSION: Acquiring 2–3 repeated FMVs provides a high likelihood of capturing the highest Uca from a day. This suggests repeated first morning void Uca concentrations could assess the risk of bone loss and kidney stone formation, which may provide ability for real-time implementation of countermeasure programs to prevent bone and renal complications in prolonged spaceflight.

The aim of this study was to validate a new training method provoking hyperventilation during normobaric hypoxia (NH) training in an F/A-18 Hornet simulator.METHODS: In a double-blind setting, 26 fighter pilots from the Finnish Air Force performed 2 setups in a WTSAT simulator in randomized order with full flight gear. Without the pilot's knowledge, 6% O₂ in nitrogen or 6% O₂ + 4% CO₂ in nitrogen was turned on. Ventilation (VE) was measured before, during, and after hypoxia. Spo₂ and ECG were monitored and symptoms documented. The subjects performed a tactical identification flight until they recognized symptoms of hypoxia. Thereafter, they performed hypoxia emergency procedures with 100% O₂ and returned to the base with a GPS malfunction and executed an instrument landing system (ILS) approach with the waterline HUD mode evaluated by the flight instructor on a scale of 1 to 5.RESULTS: Ventilation increased during normobaric hypoxia (NH) from 12 L · min-1 to 19 L · min-1 at Spo₂ 75% with 6% O₂, and from 12 L · min-1 to 26 L · min-1 at Spo₂ 77% with 6% O₂ + 4% CO₂.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The exercise electrocardiogram (ExECG), or stress test, is a widely used screening tool in occupational medicine designed to detect occult coronary artery disease, and assess performance capacity and cardiovascular fitness. In some guidelines, it is recommended for high-risk occupations in which occult disease could possibly endanger public safety. In aviation medicine, however, there is an ongoing debate on the use and periodicity of ExECG for screening of aircrew.METHOD: In the German Armed Forces, aircrew applicants and active-duty aircrew undergo screening ExECG. We analyzed 7646 applicant ExECGs (5871 from pilot and 1775 from nonpilot applicants) and 17,131 ExECGs from 3817 active-duty pilots. All were performed at the German Air Force Centre of Aerospace Medicine (GAFCAM) and analyzed for ECG abnormalities, performance capacity, blood pressure, and heart rate response.RESULTS: Only 15/5871 (0.2%) of pilot applicants required further investigation and none were ultimately disqualified for aircrew duties due to their ExECG results. Of the nonpilot applicants, 22/1775 (1.2%) required further diagnostic work-up due to their ExECG findings, with only 1 ultimately disqualified. From active-duty pilots, 84/17,131 (0.5%) ExECGs revealed findings requiring further investigation, with only 2 pilots ultimately disqualified from flying duties.DISCUSSION: The extremely low yield of ExECG findings requiring further evaluation and/or disqualification for aircrew duties suggest its use is questionable and not cost-effective as a screening tool in this cohort. It may be enough to perform ExECG on clinical indication alone.Guettler N, Nicol ED, Sammito S. Exercise ECG for screening in military aircrew. Aerosp Med Hum Perform. 2022; 93(9):666-672.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With the increase in crewed commercial spaceflight and expeditions to the Moon and Mars, the risk of critical surgical problems and need for procedures increases. Appendicitis and appendectomy are the most common surgical pathology and procedure performed, respectively. The habitable volume of current spacecraft ranges from 4 m³ (Soyuz) to 425 m³ (International Space Station). We investigated the minimum volume required to perform an appendectomy and compared that to habitable spacecraft volumes.METHODS: The axes of a simulated operating room were marked and cameras placed to capture movements. An expert surgeon, chief surgical resident, junior surgical resident, and a nonsurgeon physician each performed a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma and an appendectomy on a simulated patient. Dimensions and volume needed were collected and compared using unpaired t-tests.RESULTS: Mean volume (± SD) needed was 3.83 m³ ± 0.47 m³ for standing and 3.68 m³ ± 0.49 m³ for kneeling (P = 0.638). Minimal volume needed was 3.20 m³ for standing and 3.26 m³ for kneeling. Minimal theoretical volume was 2.99 m³ for standing and 2.87 m³ for kneeling.DISCUSSION: The unencumbered volume needed for an appendectomy is between 2.87 m³ and 4.3 m³. It may be technically feasible to perform an open appendectomy inside the smallest of currently operating spacecraft, at 4 m³ (Soyuz-MS). Space vessels operating without rapid evacuation to Earth will need to consider this volume for potential surgical emergencies.

Medical Officer Occupied Time (MOOT) may vary significantly depending on provider skill. This pilot study assessed the MOOT Skill Effect (MOOTSkE). METHODS: An expert surgeon (ES), fifth year surgical resident (PGY5), second year surgical resident (PGY2), and an expert Emergency Physician (EP) with only 4 mo direct surgical training each performed two simulated appendectomies. The completion times for endotracheal intubation, appendectomy, and two subprocedures (multilayer tissue repair and single layer tissue repair) were recorded. RESULTS: The ES performed the appendectomy in 410 s, the PGY-5 in 498 s, the PGY-2 in 645 s, and the EP in 973 s on average. The PGY-2 and EP time difference was significant compared to the expert. The PGY-5 was not. The EP’s time was significantly longer for the appendectomy and the multilayer repair than either surgical resident. For the single layer repair, only the EP-ES difference was significant. A single intubation attempt by the PGY-2 took 73 s while the EP averaged 27 s. The average recorded MOOTSkE between novice and expert was 2.5 (SD 0.34). DISCUSSION: This pilot study demonstrates MOOTSkE can be captured using simulated procedures. It showed the magnitude of the MOOTSkE is likely substantial, suggesting that a more highly trained provider may save substantial crew time. Limitations included small sample size, limited number of procedures, a simulation that may not reflect real world conditions, and suboptimal camera angles.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-G acceleration experienced during launch and re-entry of suborbital spaceflights may present challenges for older or medically susceptible participants. A detailed understanding of the associated physiological responses would support the development of an evidence-based medical approach to commercial suborbital spaceflight. METHODS: There were 24 healthy subjects recruited into ‘younger’ (18-44 yr), ‘intermediate’ (45-64 yr) and ‘older’ (65-80 yr) age groups. Cardiovascular and respiratory variables were measured continuously during dynamic combinations of +G x (chest-to-back) and +G z (head-to-foot) acceleration that simulated suborbital G profiles for spaceplane and rocket/capsule platforms. Measurements were conducted breathing air and breathing 15% oxygen to simulate a cabin pressure altitude of 8000 ft. RESULTS: Suborbital G profiles generated highly dynamic changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output. G-induced hypoxemia was observed, with minimum arterial oxygen saturation &lt; 80% in a quarter of subjects. Increased age was associated with greater hypoxemia and reduced cardiac output responses but did not have detrimental cardiovascular effects. ECG changes included recurrent G-induced trigeminy in one individual. Respiratory and visual symptoms were common, with 88% of subjects reporting greyout and 29% reporting blackout. There was one episode of G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC). DISCUSSION: Suborbital acceleration profiles are generally well tolerated but are not physiologically inconsequential. Marked hemodynamic effects and transient respiratory compromise could interact with predisposing factors to precipitate adverse cardiopulmonary effects in a minority of participants. Medically susceptible individuals may benefit from expanded preflight centrifuge familiarization that includes targeted physiological evaluation in the form of a ‘G challenge test’.

Ultrasound-guided percutaneous intervention would allow for the management of a variety of pathologies with largely shared equipment and training. This proof-of-concept work attempts to determine the feasibility of “just-in-time” remote teaching and guidance of a sample procedure of this type. METHODS: Subjects naïve to ultrasound-guided intervention were instructed via a short video regarding the technique for placement of a percutaneous drain into a simulated abscess within a gel phantom. Subjects were then guided through the performance of the procedure via two-way audiovisual communication with an experienced remote assistant. Technical success was determined by the successful aspiration or expression of fluid from the simulated abscess following drain placement. This was then performed by and compared with staff experienced with such procedures. Time to completion and number of needle redirections required were also measured. RESULTS: All 29 subjects naïve to interventional work and the 4 experienced control subjects achieved technical success. There was a statistically significant difference in the time to completion between the two groups, with the experienced subjects averaging 2 min to completion and the inexperienced 5.8 min. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of redirections.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research indicates that first-generation antihistamine usage may impair pilot performance by increasing the likelihood of vestibular illusions, spatial disorientation, and/or cognitive impairment. Second- and third-generation antihistamines generally have fewer impairing side effects and are approved for pilot use. We hypothesized that toxicological findings positive for second- and third-generation antihistamines are less likely to be associated with pilots involved in fatal mishaps than first-generation antihistamines. METHODS: The evaluated population consisted of 1475 U.S. civil pilots fatally injured between September 30, 2008, and October 1, 2014. Mishap factors evaluated included year, weather conditions, airman rating, recent airman flight time, quarter of year, and time of day. Due to the low prevalence of positive antihistamine findings, a count-based model was selected, which can account for rare outcomes. RESULTS: The means and variances were close for both regression models supporting the assumption that the data follow a Poisson distribution; first-generation antihistamine mishap airmen ( N = 582, M = 0.17, S 2 = 0.17) with second- and third-generation antihistamine mishap airmen ( N = 116, M = 0.20, S 2 = 0.18). The data indicate fewer airmen with second- and third-generation antihistamines than first-generation antihistamines in their system are fatally injured while flying in IMC conditions. DISCUSSION: Whether the lower incidence is a factor of greater usage of first-generation antihistamines versus second- and third-generation antihistamines by the pilot population or fewer deleterious side effects with second- and third-generation antihistamines is unclear. These results engender cautious optimism, but additional research is necessary to determine why these differences exist. Gildea KM, Hileman CR, Rogers P, Salazar GJ, Paskoff LN.

The aim of the present work was to compare olfactory function in MS sensitive (MS+) and insensitive (MS-) subjects. METHODS: Olfactory testing included determination of odor detection thresholds, subjective evaluation of the quality (intensity, hedonicity, and familiarity) of three different odorants (limonene, isovaleric acid, and petrol) as well as measures of skin conductance responses to these three odorants. RESULTS: Results showed no difference in olfactory sensitivity between MS+ and MS- subjects. However, findings of both subjective (odor quality self-rating) and objective (psychophysiological responses) measures did reveal that the affective response to petrol odor was significantly different in MS+ and in MS- subjects. Indeed, on a scale from 0 (unpleasant) to 10 (pleasant) MS+ subjects rated petrol odor as more unpleasant (mean = 2.52) than MS- subjects (mean = 4.15) and rise-time of skin conductance responses to petrol odor was significantly longer in MS+ (mean = 5.98 s) compared to MS- subjects (mean = 3.22 s).

Current research has suggested potential health risks posed by energy drink consumption. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of energy drink consumption and beliefs about nutritional supplements in a U.S. military population. METHODS: Data were collected by means of an anonymous 44-item survey that was administered to and completed by 302 naval aviation candidates (100% response rate) enrolled in aviation preflight indoctrination (API) at Naval Air Station Pensacola, FL. RESULTS: Bivariate correlations indicated a statistically significant relationship between beliefs regarding the safety of energy drinks, energy drink consumption frequency, and personal beliefs regarding supplements [r(202) = −0.23]. The negative correlational coefficient indicated an inverse relationship between favorable perceptions on supplements and energy drink consumption. DISCUSSION: This study assessed beliefs about the safety of nutritional supplements among API candidates and to examine if a relationship between nutritional supplement beliefs and energy drink consumption exists. Results indicated a significant inverse relationship between API candidates’ beliefs regarding consumption frequency and safety of energy drinks as well as beliefs regarding supplement use. Results also suggested that the more positively an API candidate perceived nutritional supplements, the less frequently energy drinks were consumed.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: No upper age limit exists at which general aviation pilots are disallowed from exercising their flying privileges. Operating an aircraft, and landing in particular, requires high visual acuity, cognitive function, and eye-hand/foot coordination; i.e., functions which commonly deteriorate with age. No studies have addressed flight safety of airmen ≥ 80 yr of age (octogenarian+ or 80+) or whether such airmen are more landing accident-prone. This research seeks to answer these questions. METHODS: Accidents and private pilot-certificated airmen counts were obtained from the National Transport Safety Board accident database and the U.S. Civil Airmen Statistics, respectively. Contingency tables were used to determine differences in proportions. A Poisson distribution was employed to determine whether airmen count (80+ and 30–39 yr) and their accident rates differed over time. Differences in median values were tested with a Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The proportion of airmen 80+ years doubled and their accident rate increased (6 and 11 mishaps/1000 airmen, respectively) between 2002 and 2016. Landing accidents were over-represented for octogenarian+ pilots compared with airmen 30–39 yr (31 and 17%, respectively) and did not reflect inferior experience but were often due to an aircraft flaring deficiency. The proportion of fatal accidents was comparable (11 and 13%, respectively) for the older and younger age cohorts. CONCLUSION: A growing population and a climbing accident rate for octogenarian+ airmen were evident. The disproportionate count of pilots involved in landing mishaps raises a concern for an increase in such mishaps for octogenarian airmen opting for BasicMed due to less restrictive/frequent visual acuity tests.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Motion sickness is a feeling of unwellness and introduces a significant safety risk. If a specific questionnaire to screen for motion sickness susceptibility is available, it would have benefit for susceptible people. This aimed at examining test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the Thai, non-English version Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire Short-Form (MSSQ-Short). METHODS: The original English-version MSSQ-Short was translated into Thai and then had a backward translation into English. The process of forward and backward translation was repeated until fulfillment of content and language equivalence between the backward translation and the original questionnaire. The Thai-version MSSQ-Short then was applied to people with history of motion sickness for two occasions with a 2-wk interval. The two questionnaires were examined for test-retest reliability and the first occasion was examined for internal consistency. MSSQ total raw score and percentile score between the first and second occasions were tested for correlation. RESULTS: The questionnaires were completed by 30 subjects. The weighted kappa values between the two occasions for the 18 subitems of the MSSQ ranged from 0.38 to 0.86, with most being in the higher range. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient of the MSSQ raw score between the two occasions was 0.94. The internal consistency was 0.80. CONCLUSION: The Thai, non-English version MSSQ-Short had an acceptable value for reliability. Further studies should be conducted with a larger sample size and with other populations.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Voice analysis offers an unobtrusive approach for psychological monitoring. We demonstrate the relationship between voice parameters and cognitive performance in: 1) a task with psychological test character, and 2) performance in an operational, mission-relevant task. The central methodological aim was to verify the usefulness of voice commands and counting in providing anchor values for the step-function model of voice pitch. METHODS: During a 22-yr period, 42 cosmonauts participated in the Russian space experiment “Pilot”, which was a hand-controlled docking maneuver. As reference the experiment included the cognitive task “Manometer.” This task was controlled through voice commands. These voice commands were stored and are the basis for the present analysis. RESULTS: Cosmonauts differed in their working style and respective performance during the Manometer task. Clustered groups can be assumed to represent different effort. Importantly, these groups differed in the changes of voice pitch among mission phases and among task repetitions. However, there were no differences between these motivation groups and performance in the professional task. DISCUSSION: The differing effort is the effect of different motivation of cosmonauts for experimental test tasks vs. mission-relevant professional tasks. Latter ones provide a more reliable chance to assess the real actual state and skills of a cosmonaut. Voice pitch measurement seems to be reliable and useful under space conditions for monitoring this volitional effort.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The present study evaluated the efficacy of the nine-step inflation-deflation tympanometric test for predicting recurrence of middle ear barotrauma. METHODS: Student pilots who were diagnosed with middle ear barotrauma from October 2010 to April 2011 were enrolled. The grade of barotrauma was assigned using Teed’s classification. All subjects underwent tympanometry and nine-step inflation-deflation testing at first visit and after improvement. Recurrence was monitored for 2 wk after they resumed flight. The relationships among the recurrence of middle ear barotrauma, the grade and duration of disease, and tympanometric and nine-step test results were evaluated. RESULTS: There were 35 cases enrolled. According to Teed’s classification, 16 cases were Grade 0 (45.7%) and 11 cases were Grade I (31.4%). Grade III was shown in seven cases (20.0%) and one subject was Grade IV (2.9%). The mean duration of illness was 5.9 d. In the initial 9-step tests, 29 subjects (85.3%) failed to pass the entire test. On follow-up tests, eight cases (22.9%) failed. Seven pilots (20.0%) showed recurrent middle ear barotrauma after resumed flight. All of the cases with recurrence failed the follow-up nine-step tests. The nine-step test showed high sensitivity and specificity values for predicting recurrence. A clear correlation was observed between recurrence and nine-step test results. DISCUSSION: The nine-step inflation-deflation test provides useful information about Eustachian tube function. The nine-step test can be useful to reduce the risk of recurrence of middle ear barotrauma in pilots. Sohn JH. Recurrent middle ear barotrauma in student pilots .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Body composition (BC) measurements are used to determine qualification for enlistment and to ensure active members are meeting standards. Although there is extensive research on BC in active-duty military, very few have examined ROTC cadets. The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify differences in BC between freshman/sophomore [underclass (UND)] and junior/senior [upperclass (UPP)] ROTC cadets by using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS). METHODS: UND ( N = 21) and UPP ( N = 15) Air Force ROTC cadets volunteered for this study. BIS was used to measure fat mass percentage (FM%), fat free mass percentage (FFM%), total body water percentage (TBW%), extracellular fluid percentage (ECF%), and intracellular fluid percentage (ICF%). Separate one-way ANOVAs were run between UND and UPP for all dependent variables with a Bonferroni correction factor. Additionally, a Pearson correlation between abdominal circumference (AC) and FM% was conducted. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the UND and UPP groups’ BMI. However, significant differences were observed for ECF%, ICF%, TBW%, FFM%, and FM% in which the UPP had a higher TBW%, ICF%, FFM%, and a lower ECF% and FM% compared to the UND. CONCLUSIONS: This study observed significant differences in BC across class ranks in ROTC cadets. Findings from this study suggest that due to an increased exposure to ROTC training, UPP cadets have a more ideal body composition (FFM% and FM%) when compared to UND cadets.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Spatial disorientation (SD) remains a leading cause of Class A mishaps and fatalities in aviation. Motion-based flight simulators and other research devices provide the capacity to rigorously study SD in order to develop effective countermeasures. By applying mathematical models of human orientation perception, we propose an approach to improve control algorithms for motion-based flight simulators to study SD. METHODS: The Disorientation Research Device (DRD), or the Kraken™, is the Department of Defense’s newest and most capable aerospace medicine motion-based research device. We implemented an “Observer” model for predicting aircrew spatial orientation perception within the DRD, and perceptions experienced in flight. Further, we propose a framework that uses the model output, in addition to pilot control inputs, to optimize multiaxis motion control including human-in-the-loop control capability. RESULTS: A case study was performed to demonstrate the functionality of the framework. Additionally, the case study highlights both how limitations of human perception are crucial to consider when designing motion algorithms, and the challenges of effective flight simulation with multiple motion axes. DISCUSSION: We implemented a mathematical model for spatial orientation perception to improve the design of control algorithms for motion-based flight simulators, using the DRD as an example application. We provide an example of predicting perceptions, producing quantitative information on the efficacy of motion control algorithms. This mathematical model based approach to validating motion control algorithms aims to improve the fidelity of ground-based SD research. Dixon JB, Etgan CA, Horning DS, Clark TK, Folga RV.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the present study, an Adaptive Ground Control System for Multiple-UAV Operator Workload Decrement (AGCS) has been developed and the effectiveness of the system has been analyzed using eye-tracking and task performance data. The AGCS contained four more functions than the conventional GCS (CGCS) functions. The functions were based on real-time operator gaze information, multiple UAV operational state, and mission state information to help safe and efficient multiple UAV operation.METHODS: A total of 30 volunteers participated in the human-in-the-loop experiment to compare the performances of the newly developed AGCS and CGCS while executing reconnaissance and strike missions by operating multiple UAVs.RESULTS: According to the results, the AGCS demonstrates a statistically significant increase in mission performance, such as the mission completion rate (M = 97.3 vs. M = 95.4; SD = 3.1 vs. SD = 4.9) and mission success rate (M = 90.4 vs. M = 88.4; SD = 5.7 vs. SD = 5.6). In addition, the subjects' pupil diameter and gaze indicator show significant differences in the direction of workload reduction (α = 0.05). The subjects expressed positive opinions about using the AGCS.DISCUSSION: The originally developed AGCS showed a promising future extension based on the experimental data.

The main cause is unknown but there are many risk factors, including geographical properties and high altitude. Our objective was to explore the frequency of RLS in aircrew.METHODS: There were 301 Turkish aircrew who were admitted to Istanbul Medipol University Hospital Neurology Department for periodic examinations and 272 healthy (non-aircrew) subjects included in the study. The International RLS Study Group's Questionnaire and the International RLS Study Group Rating Scale (IRLSSGRS) were used to evaluate RLS. The participants filled the RLS questionnaire and then both groups were divided into two subgroups as having RLS or not. The subjects years in the profession, average flight duration in a month, daily sleep duration, smoking, and coffee consumption were recorded. None of the subjects had previously been diagnosed with RLS.RESULTS: The frequency of RLS was 6.7% in the aircrew group and 7.9% in the control group, and there was no significant difference between the two groups. Age, gender, daily duration of sleep, smoking, coffee consumption, family history of RLS, being a pilot or a flight attendant, years in profession, and monthly flight hours were similar in aircrew with and without RLS.DISCUSSION: The RLS frequency in aircrew was similar to that of the control group.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Portable noninvasive Heart Rate Complexity (HRC) and Compensatory Reserve Measurement (CRM) monitors have been developed to triage supine combat casualties. Neither monitor has been tested in upright individuals during physical exercise. This study tests the hypothesis that exercise evokes proportional changes in HRC and CRM. METHODS: Two instruments monitored volunteers (9 civilian and 11 soldiers) from the Army Trauma Training Department (ATTD) before, during, and following physical exercise. One recorded heart rate (HR, bpm), cardiac output (CO, L · min −1 ), heart rate variability (HRV, root mean square of successive differences, ms), and HRC (Sample Entropy, unitless). The other recorded HR, pulse oximetry (S p o 2 , %), and CRM (%). RESULTS: Baseline HR, CO, HRV, HRC, and CRM averaged 72 ± 1 bpm, 5.6 ± 1.2 L · min −1 , 48 ± 24 ms, 1.9 ± 0.5, and 85 ± 10% in seated individuals. Exercise evoked peak HR and CO at &gt; 200% of baseline, while HRC and CRM were simultaneously decreased to minimums that were ≤ 50% of baseline (all P &lt; 0.001). HRV changes were variable and unreliable. S p o 2 remained consistently above 95%. During a 60 min recovery, HR and CRM returned to baseline on parallel tracks (t 1/2 =11 ± 8 and 18 ± 14 min), whereas HRC recovery was slower than either CRM or HR (t 1/2 =40 ± 18 min, both P &lt; 0.05). DISCUSSION: Exercise evoked qualitatively similar changes in CRM and HRC. CRM recovered incrementally faster than HRC, suggesting that vasodilation, muscle pump, and respiration compensate faster than cardiac autonomic control in young, healthy volunteers. Both HRC and CRM appear to provide reliable, objective, and noninvasive metrics of human performance in upright exercising individuals.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common condition with features that can adversely impact aviation activities. The diagnosis of migraine is often compatible with civil aviation training, but is much more concerning for military pilot applicants. A history of migraine headache traditionally medically excluded potential military pilot applicants due to unpredictability of occurrence and potential for operational distraction or incapacitation. Medical standards and policy applications have been quite variable, ranging from total exclusion for even one headache occurrence to as low as a 1-yr migraine-free period before consideration. In many instances, policy application has been subjective and not based on objective evidence. This presents a challenge to waiver authorities and also potentially sends a mixed message to command authorities. There is essentially no current literature evidence applicable to the aviation population on migraine occurrence risk. METHODS: This study reviewed 71 U.S. Air Force pilot applicants who were diagnosed with migraine and had been granted waivers to assess any predictive factors for migraine recurrence and its aeromedical impact. RESULTS: Only three applicants had recurrence after waiver was granted, with two of these occurring within 2 yr of their last reported migraine event, and all recurrences noted within 3 yr. DISCUSSION: Data indicated favorable risk with suitable migraine-free observation before military pilot training, which could be incorporated into aeromedical standards and policies.

METHODS: The experiment utilized a randomized, repeated-measures design. Subjects ( N = 36) performed the PVT on a touch-screen, hand-held device (HHD), a wrist-worn device (WWD), and a standardized laptop (L). Sleep was assessed using wrist-worn actigraphy. RESULTS: Compared to the L, the HHD was slower on average (∼50% longer reaction times; ∼34% slower response speeds; ∼600% more lapses in attention combined with false starts) and introduced a proportional bias that decreased the range of response speeds by 60%. Compared to the L, the WWD with the backlight on was faster on average (reaction time: ∼6%; response speed: ∼13%), but equivalent in lapses combined with false starts, and introduced a proportional bias that increased the range of responses by 60%. DISCUSSION: Compared to the L PVT, using a hand-held, touch screen interface to collect PVT data may introduce a large constant bias and a proportional bias that decreases the range of response speed. However, performance on the WWD closely mirrors performance on the L PVT and the proportional bias tends to be in favor of detecting individuals with slower responses. Researchers should avoid comparing PVT metrics between different device types. Reliability of PVT data from a WWD or HHD may be degraded when used in an operational setting with unpredictable environmental movement (such as a surface maritime setting). Matsangas P, Shattuck NL.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the understanding of hypobaric hypoxia is increasing, it remains a hazard in aviation medicine. This study examined the feasibility of detecting voice markers sensitive to acute hypobaric hypoxia in an early presymptomatic (PRE-SYMP) stage. METHOD: Eight subjects qualified with hypobaric training completed a series of standardized speech tests in a hypobaric chamber at 20,000 ft and 25,000 ft (6096 and 7620 m) of altitude. Voice response patterns were analyzed in terms of fundamental frequency (F0), F0 range, and voice onset time (VOT). We hypothesized a PRE-SYMP compensatory stage in voice reactivity. RESULTS: There was a different dose-response reactivity course at 20,000 ft vs. 25,000 ft, nonlinear to altitude. At 20,000 ft, our hypothesis was confirmed. In comparison to sea level, a PRE-SYMP compensatory stage could be distinguished, characterized by a decreased F0 range, decreased VOT, and increased F0. During a transitional (TRANS) stage, in comparison with sea level, the F0-range reset, VOT decreased, and F0 increased. During a symptomatic (SYMP) stage, F0 increased, F0 range increased, and VOT decreased. At 25,000 ft, in comparison to sea level, voice reactivity showed increased F0 and F0 range and decreased VOT in a PRE-SYMP stage and increased F0 and F0 range in the SYMP stage. DISCUSSION: The compensatory PRE-SYMP stage is suggested to be the expression of ongoing bottom-up and top-down regulatory mechanisms, whereas the 25,000-ft results are interpreted as a combination of tonic and phasic voice reactivity. This tonic component needs to be foreseen in sea level baseline measures. Van Puyvelde M, Neyt X, Vanderlinden W, Van den Bossche M, Bucovaz T, De Winne T, Pattyn N.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many regulations for aeromedical assessments state that a ratio between forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) of &lt; 0.7 should be evaluated by a pulmonary specialist. The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) reference values introduced the lower limit of normal (LLN 2.5), in which the lowest 2.5% of the population is regarded as abnormal, instead of a fixed ratio. This study assesses the impact of adopting GLI reference values on aeromedical evaluation and referrals. METHODS: The Royal Netherlands Air Force performed 7492 aeromedical assessments between February 2012 and April 2017. Cases with FEV 1 /FVC &lt; 0.7 from three groups were selected: 1) men &lt; 25 yr; 2) men &gt; 40 yr; and 3) women, with twice as many matched controls. Pearson's Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: From the database, 23 (group 1), 62 (group 2), and 7 (group 3) cases were selected, with 184 controls. Respectively, 17%, 84%, and 29% would not be referred using the GLI. In the controls, this would lead to one additional referral (group 1). Qualitative analysis of the cases who would not be referred using the GLI showed that no significant diagnoses would have been missed. DISCUSSION: Using the GLI LLN 2.5 reference values for pulmonary function tests leads to significantly fewer referrals to a pulmonary specialist without missing relevant pulmonary pathology in our aircrew. This would reduce resources spent on the assessment of aircrew without compromising flight safety. Wingelaar-Jagt YQ, Wingelaar TT, Bülbül M, vd Bergh PP, Frijters E, Staudt E.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Due to the standard collegiate academic calendar (two semesters), U.S. Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) cadets have an approximate 3-mo break over the summer in which physical training (PT) is neither regulated nor required. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant changes in cadet physical fitness assessment (PFA) scores occur after a 3-mo summer break when training is not mandatory. METHODS: Male ( N 28) and female ( N 10) cadets performed the PFA in April and August. Cadets were split into two groups depending on if they participated in field training over the summer [FT; N 12 (men 6, women 6)] or did not [NFT; N 26 (men 22, women 4)] to determine if engaging in field training had any effect on performance. RESULTS: Cadets performed significantly better on run time (7%), pushups (7.6%), sit-ups (5.8%), and overall composite score (3.6%) before summer break compared to after. Significant time group interactions were observed for abdominal circumference and run time. Abdominal circumference paired samples t -tests indicated that while the FT group did not differ between the spring and fall time points, the NFT did. There was a main effect for time in which cadets had a significantly larger abdominal circumference in the spring compared to the fall semester. CONCLUSION: Nonmandatory physical training over summer break may significantly decrease a cadets performance on the PFA. Additionally, it appears that even the inclusion of field training for some cadets was not enough to prevent the detraining that took place over summer break.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The increased utility of CT coronary angiography (CTCA) in cardiovascular screenings of aircrew has led to the increased detection of asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). A systematic review of studies relevant to the interpretation of CTCA for the occupational fitness assessment of high-risk vocations was performed, with findings used to describe the development of a pathway for the aeromedical disposition of military aviators with asymptomatic CAD. METHODS: Medline was searched using the terms CT coronary angiogram and screening and prognosis. The inclusion criteria were restricted to study populations ages &gt; 18 yr, were asymptomatic, were not known to have CAD, had undergone CTCA, and with their associations with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and other relevant cardiac outcomes reported. RESULTS: Included in this systematic review were 10 studies. When compared to subjects with no or nonobstructive CAD, those with obstructive CAD on CTCA had hazard ratios (HR) for cardiac events ranging from 1.42 to 105.48. Comparing subjects with nonobstructive CAD and those without CAD on CTCA, a lower HR of 1.19 for cardiac events was found. The annual event rates of subjects with no CAD on CTCA were extremely low, ranging from 0 to 0.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, we suggest that CTCA should only be performed in aircrew with higher cardiac risk profiles. Those found to have no CAD or minimal CAD (i.e., 25% stenosis) in a non-left main coronary artery on CTCA can be returned to flying duties. All other results should be further evaluated with an invasive angiogram. Cheong RWL, See B, Tan BBC, Koh CH. Coronary artery disease screening using CT coronary angiography .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography (ECG) provides valuable information on astronaut physiological and psychological health. ECG monitoring has been conducted during crewed missions since the beginning of human spaceflight and will continue during astronauts upcoming long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs) in support of automated health monitoring systems. ECG monitoring is traditionally performed in clinical environments with single-use, adhesive electrodes in a 3, 6, or 12-lead configuration placed by a trained clinician. In the space exploration environment, astronauts self-place electrodes without professional assistance. Wearable ECG systems are an attractive option for automated health monitoring, but electrode placement has not been quantified to a high enough degree to avoid artifacts within the data due to position changes. This variability presents challenges for physician-limited, autonomous health monitoring, so quantifying electrode placement is key in the development of reliable, wearable ECG monitoring systems. METHODS: We present a method of quantifying electrode placement for 3-lead, chest-mounted ECG using easy-to-measure, two-dimensional chest measurements. RESULTS: We find that male and female dimensions require different electrode positioning computations, but there is overlap in positioning between men and women. The distribution of electrodes vertical positions is wider than their horizontal positions. DISCUSSION: These results can be translated directly to ECG wearable design for the individual and for the size range and adjustability required for the astronaut fleet. Implementation of this method will improve the reliability in placement and fit of future wearables, increasing comfort and usability of these systems and subsequently augmenting autonomous health monitoring capabilities for exploration medicine.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mental health is an important aspect of Army aviation medicine given that it significantly impacts career longevity, readiness, and healthcare usage. One of the most commonly used classes of medications to treat mental health disorders is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Here we present a descriptive epidemiological review of SSRI use in Army aviators over a 10-yr period. METHODS: An archival dataset retrieved from the U.S. Army Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office covering the years 2005 to 2015 was queried for cases of SSRI use. Frequencies were generated by primary diagnoses and aeromedical disposition for the SSRI subset of data. RESULTS: A total of 114 unique cases of SSRI use were identified (122 total aeromedical outcomes). These cases included 41 waiver recommendations, 59 suspension recommendations, and 22 cases of waiver continuations. The top five most common primary diagnoses were depressive disorder ( N 32), anxiety state ( N 21), posttraumatic stress disorder ( N 16), single major depressive episode ( N 13), and adjustment disorder with depressed mood ( N 12). DISCUSSION: Understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of mental health disorders particularly within the safety-focused and unforgiving aviation environment has continued to evolve. With the application of evidence-based policy, deliberate aeromedical decision-making, and methodical risk mitigation, SSRI use does have a place within aviation. Aviators suffering in silence with deleterious impact to performance and safety or aircrew seeking services on the outside without knowledge or oversight of certification authorities must remain in the past.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We assessed determinants of serum hs-CRP level in pilots and air traffic controllers (ATCs) and its impact on their atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. METHODS: We obtained serum hs-CRP measurements, evaluated traditional cardiovascular risk factors and assessed global ASCVD risk based on 2018 ESH/ESC guidelines. Elevated hs-CRP was hs-CRP values &gt; 3 mg L 1 . Determinants of elevated hs-CRP were assessed using stepwise logistic regression analysis. We used the net reclassification method to evaluate the impact of hs-CRP levels on global ASCVD risk. RESULTS: Of the 335 subjects (mean age 45.4 11.6 yr, 70% pilots, 99% men, 37% Caucasians), 127 individuals (39.5%) presented with elevated hs-CRP levels. Compared to those with normal hs-CRP, individuals with elevated hs-CRP were older with faster heart rate and higher blood pressure, BMI, and P wave amplitude. The proportion of individuals with elevated hs-CRP was greater among those with smoking habits, physical inactivity, MetS, tachycardia, altered P wave axis, LVH, and HT-TOD. Aging (aOR 2.15 [1.676.98]), hypertension (aOR 3.88 [2.296.58]), type 2 diabetes (aOR 6.71 [1.7710.49]), tachycardia (aOR 2.03 [1.914.53]), and LVH (aOR 2.13 [1.647.11]) were the main factors associated with elevated hs-CRP levels. Low, moderate, high, and very high risk were observed in 24 (15%), 68 (41%), 62 (37%), and 12 (7%) subjects, respectively. Including hs-CRP resulted in the net reclassification of 25% of subjects, mostly from moderate to high risk. CONCLUSION: The integration of hs-CRP improved the estimation of global ASCVD risk stratification. However, a survey with a comprehensive population assessing the cost/benefit impact of such a referral is needed.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pilots of fixed wing commercial aircraft face numerous occupational hazards. Low back pain is among the most common and costly workplace injury, though relatively little is known about causes of back injuries among pilots. The awkward lifting and twisting maneuvers in the flight deck to position flight bags has not been described as a cause of occupational back injury among pilots. METHODS: A case series of low back injuries among pilots was identified and described by a retrospective review of charts at an airport-based clinic. Circumstances of occupational back injury, initial direct medical costs, treatment, and work status following evaluation were described. RESULTS: Over a 6-yr period, 37 occupational low back injuries among 35 pilots were evaluated and treated. Of these, 24 (65%) involved flight bags. Only 27% of pilots with flight bag-associated injuries were returned to work after initial evaluation; medications with sedating properties were frequently required for treatment. Injuries due to slips, trips, and falls, typically in jet bridges or associated with hotel shuttles, were common among pilots with back injuries not related to flight bags. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of occupational low back injuries seen among pilots in an airport based clinic were attributable to use of flight bags. Substituting electronic flight bags for traditional flight bags could contribute to back injury prevention among pilots.Kanumuri VSR, Zautke JL, Dorevitch S.

No previous studies have looked at the distance from the last radar plot to the crash site. The purpose of this study was to characterize this distance and then identify environmental and flight characteristics that might be used to predict the spatial relationship and, therefore, aid search and rescue planners. METHODS: Detailed records were obtained from the U.S. Air Force Rescue Coordination Center for missing aircraft in distress from 2002 to 2008. The data was combined with information from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Accident Database. The spatial relationship between the last radar plot and crash site was then determined using GIS analysis. RESULTS: A total of 260 missing aircraft incidents involving 509 people were examined, of which 216 (83%) contained radar information. Among the missing aircraft the mortality rate was 89%; most occurred in mountainous terrain (57%); Part 91 flight accounted for 95% of the incidents; and 50% of the aircraft were found within 0.8 nmi from the last radar plot. Flight characteristics, descent rate, icing conditions, and instrument flight rule vs. visual flight rule flight could be used to predict spatial characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In most circumstances, the last radar position is an excellent predictor of the crash site. However, 5% of aircraft are found further than 45.4 nmi. The flight and environmental conditions were identified and placed into an algorithm to aid search planners in determining how factors should be prioritized.Koester RJ, Greatbatch I.

This retrospective study reviewed the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA) experience of Parkinson’s disease. The aeromedical implications of the condition are discussed and the UK CAA policy for the certificatory assessment of pilots with Parkinson’s disease is described. METHODS: A search of the UK CAA medical records database from 1990 to 2015 identified 34 pilots with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. Data was extracted for the class of medical certificate, time from first symptoms to diagnosis, age at diagnosis, the time from diagnosis to loss of certification and the reasons for loss of certification. RESULTS: Of 15 professional (Class 1) and 19 private (Class 2) pilots, the mean time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 36 and 19 mo, respectively. The mean ages at diagnosis were 55 and 59 yr, respectively. The mean interval from diagnosis to loss of certification was 21 (0-93) and 37 (0-84) mo, respectively. The reasons for loss of certification are considered. CONCLUSION: In the UK, pilots diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease may be granted medical certification depending on their functional ability and the side effect profile of medication.

This required medical evacuation from a remote territory, a team surgical approach, and later testing to allow him to return to flight duties in rotary aircraft. DISCUSSION: A search of the literature did not reveal any previous cases of civilian or military flight crew having returned to flying duties after pneumocephalus or neurosurgery. Barometric chamber testing was performed post-operatively to provide clearance.

CASE REPORT: We report data from a preparatory laboratory test in simulated cold conditions (−15°C) with and without wind chill during high- and low-intensity expected ‘race pace’ running. These tests examined the adequacy of the selected clothing assembly and provided recommendations for the race. The tests established that there was no risk of hypothermia, as the clothing assembly provided too much insulation; terminal rectal temperature was 39.25°C. Skin temperature (T sk ) data revealed no impending risk of frostbite; nadir T sk was 20.2°C at the hamstring. Oxygen consumption data revealed the self-selected high intensity was potentially not sustainable based on estimates of substrate utilization. We recommended: 1) a maximum running speed; 2) some of the clothing base layers could be removed pre-race; 3) vents and/or zips could be used to offload or retain heat; and 4) an even pacing profile should be adopted. DISCUSSION: The participant completed the race in 6:55:24 (h:mm:ss) in temperatures of −41°C. GPS data revealed a positive pacing template (i.e., marginally quicker in the first half). Neither hypothermia nor frostbite occurred. Peak pace from the laboratory tests was not consistently exceeded. Marathon performance can be undertaken in one of the world’s most inhospitable environments when careful consideration is given to clothing insulation and exercise intensity by planning for the dynamic thermal changes that may occur as the race ensues.Barwood MJ, Burrows H, Cessford J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The frequency and distribution of gastrointestinal (GI) disease in the population of active duty Air Force pilots is poorly understood, even though GI illness can temporarily or permanently lead to disqualification from flying duties. Better understanding of GI disease within this population could yield considerable operational risk and human performance insight and provide data to use in assessing the effectiveness of current medical standards related to flight training and flying duties. METHODS: A dataset reflecting inpatient and outpatient healthcare visits from 2001 through 2013 was developed and reviewed. Gastrointestinal illness was grouped into 18 subcategories of disease, and the frequency and distribution of visits for these categories were tallied. The total burden of GI illness over the target dates was compared between pilots, nonpilot aircrew/special operational duty personnel, and nonaircrew/nonspecial duty personnel. RESULTS: Esophageal disease and dyspeptic conditions were the two most frequently encountered diagnoses among all three population groups, comprising almost 50% of the gastrointestinal diagnoses in age and gender-matched samples of all three populations. The overall burden of disease over the total timeframe of the study was not statistically different in the three populations, with a median of four encounters per person for GI disease. Of interest, the total burden of disease increased over the course of the study period in all populations, driven in large measure by increases in esophageal disease and dyspeptic conditions. DISCUSSION: The general distribution and overall burden of GI disease in populations of Air Force pilots, nonpilot aircrew/special operational duty personnel, and nonaircrew/nonspecial duty personnel were similar. The increase in esophageal and dyspeptic conditions over time warrants further attention.Storms PR, Kinchen MJ. Gastrointestinal disease in pilots, 2001–2013 .

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of short-term, head-down bed rest (HDBR), with and without artificial gravity countermeasures, on splanchnic and lower limb vein properties. METHODS: Data were collected from 12 men before and after 5 d of continuous −6° HDBR without countermeasures (CON) and with two artificial gravity countermeasure protocols: 30-min continuous centrifugation (AG1), and 30-min intermittent centrifugation (AG2). Portal (PV), tibial (TibV), and gastrocnemius (GastV) veins were investigated by echography supine and after 30 min of head-up tilt. RESULTS: After HDBR, there was no change in PV, TibV, or GastV cross-sectional area at rest in any of the three conditions. In response to tilt, GastV and TibV area increased (168 ± 141% and 192 ± 124%, respectively) with no change in this response post-HDBR in any of the experimental conditions ( P &gt; 0.05). PV area decreased with tilt (−33 ± 13%) and was not different pre- to post-HDBR in the CON or AG1 conditions. However, there was a greater reduction in PV area in the AG2 group post-HDBR (−32 ± 10% pre, −49 ± 9% post-HDBR, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Calf veins were not significantly affected by 5 d of HDBR and did not appear to be negatively impacted by the artificial gravity countermeasures over this time period. In addition, the intermittent protocol resulted in better splanchnic vasoconstriction in response to head-up tilt, which may have contributed to a better maintenance of orthostatic tolerance post-HDBR.Provost RM, Zuj KA, Arbeille P. 5-day bed rest: portal and lower limb veins with and without artificial gravity countermeasures .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Visual Impairment and Intracranial Pressure Syndrome (VIIP) has caused symptomatology during and after long duration missions on the International Space Station (ISS). Only indirect measurements of intracranial pressure (ICP), such as ultrasound, have been performed on ISS. Discussion and interest has happened at NASA about performing lumbar puncture (LP) in microgravity. Only the “blind” palpation approach and the ultrasound-assisted approach have been discussed. This article, as proof of concept, discusses the possibility of portable radiography to assist lumbar punctures in microgravity. METHOD: An anthropomorphic radiological phantom of an adult lumbar spine was made containing a fluid-filled space in the spinal canal with a latex membrane which simulated the dural sac and cerebrospinal fluid. A portable direct-digital radiography system with wireless transmitting image receptor and screen was used to perform image-guided lumbar puncture. Using the same equipment and technique, this procedure was then performed on a cadaver for final proof of concept. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all approaches on the first try without needle redirection. There was no difference between the cadaver model and the phantom model in terms of difficulty in reaching the fluid space or visually confirming needle location. DISCUSSION: Portable radiography via proof of concept has the potential to guide lumbar puncture while minimizing volume and mass of equipment. This could be ideal for assisting in performing lumbar puncture in microgravity, as this is the standard of care on Earth for difficult or failed “blind” lumbar punctures.Lerner DJ, Parmet AJ, Don S, Shimony JS, Goyal MS.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study is intended to identify efficacy, evolving applications, best practices, and challenges of spatial disorientation (SD) training in flight simulators for rotor wing pilots. METHODS: Queries of a UK Ministry of Defense research database and Pub Med were undertaken using the search terms ‘spatial disorientation,’ ‘rotor wing,’ and ‘flight simulator.’ Efficacy, evolving applications, best practices, and challenges of SD simulation for rotor wing pilots were also ascertained through discussion with subject matter experts and industrial partners. Expert opinions were solicited at the aeromedical physiologist, aeromedical psychologist, instructor pilot, aeromedical examiner, and corporate executive levels. RESULTS: Peer review literature search yielded 129 articles, with 5 relevant to the use of flight simulators for the spatial disorientation training of rotor wing pilots. Efficacy of such training was measured subjectively and objectively. A preponderance of anecdotal reports endorse the benefits of rotor wing simulator SD training, with a small trial substantiating performance improvement. Advancing technologies enable novel training applications. The mobile nature of flight students and concurrent anticollision technologies can make long-range assessment of SD training efficacy challenging. Costs of advanced technologies could limit the extent to which the most advanced simulators can be employed across the rotor wing community. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggests the excellent training value of rotor wing simulators for SD training. Objective data from further research, particularly with regards to evolving technologies, may justify further usage of advanced simulator platforms for SD training and research.Powell-Dunford N, Bushby A, Leland RA.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During hovering with a helicopter, an involuntary change in attitude (during brownout) results in reduced lifting force and a horizontal acceleration component. This movement pattern is difficult to perceive via the otolith organs. If the angular displacement occurs rapidly, it will, however, activate the semicircular canals. The major aim of this study was to establish to what extent pitch-plane angular displacements can be perceived based on canal information when there is no tilt stimulus to the otoliths. METHODS: In a helicopter, 9 nonpilots (N) and 8 helicopter pilots (P) underwent 5–6 pitch-forward displacements (magnitude 14–33°, angular velocity 2–7° · s −1 ). In a swing-out gondola centrifuge, 9 N and 3 P were exposed to a similar canal-otolith conflict (acceleration, seated centripetally) with four displacements of 25° and two of 60°. The visually perceived eye level (VPEL) was continuously recorded using an adjustable luminous dot in darkness. For each helicopter dive and centrifuge run the gain was calculated as the ratio (VPEL deflection)/(displacement of helicopter or gondola). RESULTS: In the helicopter there was no difference between N (0.28 ± 0.13) and P (0.36 ± 0.22). In the centrifuge the gains were 0.34 ± 0.18° (25° displacements) and 0.30 ± 0.16° (60° displacements). Values obtained in the helicopter did not differ significantly from those in the centrifuge. There was a correlation between data obtained during the 25° and 60° displacements in the centrifuge. CONCLUSION: There was a pronounced underestimation of pitch angular displacements in a helicopter. The interindividual variability was considerable. Gains for perceived displacement were similar in helicopter and centrifuge.Tribukait A, Bergsten E, Eiken O.

    "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated physiological responses to high acceleration forces during actual flight and to our knowledge no normative data has been acquired by technologies such as wearable biosensors during high performance jet aircraft operations.In-flight physiological data from an FDA cleared portable triaxial accelerometer and bio-sensor were observed from five active duty F-18 pilots of the Naval Flight Demonstration Squadron (Blue Angels). Of the five pilots, three were formation pilots who flew lower G profiles and two were solo pilots who flew higher G profiles. Physiological parameters monitored were heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, caloric expenditure, and duration of exposure to levels of acceleration.Evaluated were 25 practice demonstration flights; 9 flights were excluded secondary to incomplete or inaccurate physiological data. We observed no significant bradycardia during a total of 189 maneuvers which met inclusion criteria for push-pull events (PPE) or isolated -Gz exposures. Further analysis of 73 PPE revealed an overall significant rise in HR following the PPE, where mean heart rate was 106 (95% CI, 100:112) at the beginning of the push and 129 (95% CI, 123:135) following the pull.A majority of the flights monitored provided reliable physiological data. Initial data suggests, contrary to currently held aeromedical doctrine, maneuvers such as the \"push-pull\" do not evoke vasovagal based bradycardic responses in aerobatic pilots. Possible explanations for these findings are sympathetic nervous system activation through adaptation and/or sustained isometric resistance from control inputs, both of which are areas of future research for our team.Rice GM, Snider D, Moore JL, Lavan JT, Folga R, VanBrunt TB.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cavernomas, cavernous angiomas, or cerebral cavernous malformations are clusters of endothelium-lined blood vessels usually found in the brain. With the increasing use of radiological imaging, these are being detected incidentally in asymptomatic aircrew. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) experience of cavernomas is described and the aeromedical concerns, that is, the risk of epilepsy, hemorrhage, and the development of a neurological deficit, are considered. METHODS: A search of the CAA database between 1990 and 2020 was performed for the term cavernoma. The gender, age at diagnosis, class of certification held, clinical presentation, location, and size of the lesion were noted. A PubMed literature review for papers with complications of cavernoma was performed. RESULTS: Six cases of cavernoma have been declared to the CAA: five professional pilots and one private pilot. Five were men and one was a woman. The age range was between 38 and 60 yr, with a mean of 48 yr. Two cases presented with clinical symptoms and four were asymptomatic. Complication rates for seizure and hemorrhage were extracted from the published literature together with the significance of other factors such as cavernoma size, family history, multiplicity, and the development of new lesions. DISCUSSION: A policy for the medical certification of aircrew with cavernomas that have presented with clinical symptoms and those that are detected incidentally is proposed. Jagathesan T, OBrien M.

Hence, we investigated the interaction of exogenous 17- estradiol (E2) treatment and disuse to test the hypothesis that E2 treatment would mitigate disuse-induced bone loss.METHODS: There were 40 virgin female Sprague-Dawley rats (5 mo old) randomized to placebo (PL; 0 ppm E2) or estrogen (E2; 10 ppm E2) treatments, delivered via custom-made rodent diets; half of each group was randomized to either weightbearing (WB) or hindlimb unloading (HU) for 39 d.RESULTS: We observed expected lower values after HU (615%) in volumetric BMD and cross-sectional areas at the proximal tibia metaphysis (PTM, by pQCT), 20% lower %BV/TV (nonsignificant) at the PTM, and 11% lower femoral neck maximal load; none of these HU-induced impacts were modified by E2. Impaired PTM periosteal expansion was observed in all E2-treated rats, with smaller (13 to 18%) cross-sectional areas. Midshaft tibial geometry was unaffected by E2 treatment, but large reductions (73 to 81%) in periosteal bone formation indices were observed in E2-treated rats.DISCUSSION: In summary, modest supplementation of exogenous E2 did not mitigate decrements in volumetric BMD, PTM cross-sectional geometry, or femoral neck strength observed with HU. However, numerous independent impacts of E2 treatment were observed, with significant suppression of periosteal bone formation indices. If maintained over time, this might impact negatively on cortical bone integrity during prolonged nonweightbearing.Mantri AV, Allaway HCM, Brezicha JE, Hogan HA, Bloomfield SA.

However, they are unaware of the effects of self-medication, which may impede their cognitive and decision-making performance. The aim of this study was to determine the awareness levels of ab initio (student) pilots on self-medication and factors contributing to the prevalence of self-medication among them. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first study examining ab initio pilots knowledge on medication use and the causality of self-medication among them.METHODS: A 17-item questionnaire was developed and administered online to 500 students across 5 flight training organizations (FTO) in Turkey. The response rate was 97/500. For the descriptive analysis of the data, SPSS (the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) was used.RESULTS: Based on the results, fear of medical disqualification and job loss is the most significant factor resulting in the prevalence of self-medication among ab initio pilots. Most of the ab initio pilots (88.7%, N 86) were aware of self-medication and its threat to flight safety. Furthermore, three factors influencing the level of awareness and knowledge of ab initio pilots on this subject were evaluated.DISCUSSION: All flight training organizations should educate ab initio pilots on the consequences of self-medication. Furthermore, ab initio pilots should be encouraged to consult an aeromedical examiner with any ailment before a flight.Kilic B. Self-medication among ab initio pilots.

CASE REPORT: A case study of a single healthy male astronaut volunteer was used for this study. The right IJV-CSA was measured using real time ultrasound at set times throughout the Russian pre-launch tilt-table training protocol, a method of physiological preparation for microgravity using tilt-table training. In microgravity, the subjects right IJV-CSA was measured again for comparison. The mean difference from in-flight right IJV-CSA for pre-tilt (0) was 0.438 cm 2 , for 15 was 0.887 cm 2 , for 30 was 0.864 cm 2 , for 50 was 1.15 cm 2 , and for post-tilt (0) the difference was 0.305 cm 2 . DISCUSSION: The cross-sectional areas of the subjects right IJV-CSA were significantly different between in-flight values and several angles of the Russian tilt-table protocol, except for the 0 measurement. In summary, this case-study represents the first time IJV-CSA has been compared between various angles of a tilt-table training protocol and microgravity in the same astronaut subject. The findings support prior cohort studies studying the same principles. Further investigation is merited; both to better describe the relationship between the cardiovascular effects of tilt-table simulations of microgravity and their correlating in-flight values, and to evaluate and study the Russian tilt-table protocol effects on cardiovascular physiology from a training and preparation perspective.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypobaric decompression has been associated with brain white matter injury. Relevant exposure limits are unknown, raising ethical concerns over safety of volunteers for altitude chamber research. To inform this, a prospective study of white matter status using brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was conducted before and after a 9-mo program of hypobaric research. METHODS: Volunteers underwent 3-D, volumetric, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI at the University of Nottingham, UK, on study entry and again after their final exposure. MRI data were analyzed and reported independently at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA. Entry criteria were 5 subcortical white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of total volume 0.08 mL. RESULTS: One volunteer failed screening with 63 WMH (total volume 2.38 mL). Eleven individuals completed 160 short-duration (&lt; 1h) exposures (range 3 to 26) to 18,000 ft pressure altitude (maximum 40,000 ft), no more often than twice weekly. The cohort exhibited eight total WMH on study entry (total volume 0.166 mL) and five (mostly different) total WMH on exit (0.184 mL). Just one WMH (frontal lobe) was present on both entry and exit scans. Excess background WMH on MRI screening were associated with past mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). CONCLUSIONS: One hypoxia familiarization plus multiple, brief, infrequent, nonhypoxic hypobaric exposures (with denitrogenation) have not promoted WMH in this small cohort. Less intensive programs of decompression stress do not warrant MRI screening. A negative past history of MTBI has strong negative predictive value for excess WMH in young healthy subjects ( N 33).

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In fighter aircraft, long-duration high-altitude sorties are typically interrupted by refueling excursions to lower altitude. In normoxia, excursions to moderate cabin altitude may increase the occurrence of venous gas emboli (VGE) at high cabin altitude. The aim was to investigate the effect of hyperoxia on VGE and decompression sickness (DCS) during alternating high and moderate altitude exposure.METHODS: In an altitude chamber, 13 healthy men were exposed to three different conditions: A) 90 min at 24,000 ft (7315 m) breathing normoxic gas (54% O₂; H-NOR); B) 90 min at 24,000 ft breathing hyperoxic gas (90% O₂; H-HYP); and C) three 30-min exposures to 24,000 ft interspersed by two 30-min exposures to 18,000 ft (5486 m) breathing 90% O₂ (ALT-HYP). VGE occurrence was evaluated from cardiac ultrasound imaging. DCS symptoms were rated using a scale.RESULTS: DCS occurred in all conditions and altogether in 6 of the 39 exposures. The prevalence of VGE was similar in H-NOR and H-HYP throughout the exposures. During the initial 30 min at 24,000 ft, the prevalence of VGE was similar in ALT-HYP as in the other two conditions, whereas, after the first excursion to 18,000 ft, the VGE score was lower in ALT-HYP than in H-NOR and H-HYP.DISCUSSION: Hyperoxic excursions from 24,000 to 18,000 ft reduces VGE occurrence, presumably by facilitating diffusive gas exchange across the bubble surfaces, increasing the share of bubble content contributed by oxygen. Still, the excursions did not abolish the DCS risk.Ånell R, Grönkvist M, Gennser M, Eiken O. Hyperoxic effects on decompression strain during alternating high and moderate altitude exposures.

Each subject participated in three conditions wearing helicopter flight equipment, including body armor, and either: a ventilation vest with a 3-dimensional mesh (Vent-1), a ventilation vest with a foam sheet incorporating channels to direct the air flow (Vent-2), or a T-shirt (NoVent); each mission comprised a 10-min walk, followed by sitting for 30 min, kneeling on a vibration platform for 2 h, and finally 30 min of sitting. Core temperature, heart rate, skin temperatures and heat flux, oxygen uptake, sweating rate, and subjective ratings were recorded. Evaporative capacity and thermal resistance of the garments were determined using a thermal manikin.RESULTS: All subjects completed the NoVent and Vent-1 conditions, whereas in the Vent-2 condition, one subject finished prematurely due to heat exhaustion. The increase in core temperature was significantly (P 0.01) greater in Novent (0.93C) and Vent-2 (0.88C) than in Vent-1 (0.61C). Evaporative capacity was significantly higher for Vent-1 (7.8 g min1) than for NoVent (4.1 g min1) and Vent-2 (4.4 g min1).DISCUSSION: Helicopter personnel may be at risk of heat exhaustion during desert missions.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Flight-related neck pain (FRNP) is a frequently reported musculoskeletal complaint among military helicopter aircrew. However, despite its prevalence and suspected causes, little is known of the underpinning pain mechanisms or the impact of neck pain on aircrews in-flight task performance. The biopsychosocial (BPS) approach to health, combined with the contemporary conceptualization of musculoskeletal pain, in which injury and pain are not necessarily synonymous, provides a relatively new holistic framework within which to consider the problem of FRNP in military helicopter aircrew. Combining these concepts, a new conceptual model is proposed to illustrate how biopsychosocial factors may influence pain perception, potentially affecting aircrews capacity to process information and, therefore, threatening in-flight task performance. Recommendations are made for considering the underlying pain mechanisms of FRNP to aid prognoses and guide the development of holistic evidence-based countermeasures for FRNP in military helicopter aircrew. Development of instruments able to measure psychosocial factors, such as self-efficacy and functional ability, validated in the military helicopter aircrew population, would assist this task.

RESULTS: Accidents reporting fatal (8.7) or serious injuries (7.8) were significantly less likely to occur when the aircraft was substantially damaged (84.3) or destroyed (5.2). The majority of the cases occurred after off-airport landings (57.4), which were reported significantly more often in Alaska ( N = 15). A main rotor strike with an individual was at the basis of each of the 10 fatal accidents in the dataset and in 8 of these cases the cause of the accident was attributed to the victim. None of the accidents occurred in instrument meteorological conditions, but, in particular, high winds and gusts proved a main cause of accident (18.3). CONCLUSION: Pilot, passengers, and crew endangered themselves when they were outside the aircraft while the rotors were still turning. Helicopter operating manuals should highlight the limitations and dangers for wind and wind gusts not only during takeoff and flight, but specifically when standing. de Voogt AJ, Hummel C, Kalagher H.

    "abstract": "Abstract INTRODUCTION: For over 50 yr, investigators have studied the physiological adaptations of the human system during short- and long-duration spaceflight exposures. Much of the knowledge gained in developing health countermeasures for astronauts onboard the International Space Station demonstrate terrestrial applications. To date, a systematic process for translating these space applications to terrestrial human health has yet to be defined. METHODS: In the summer of 2017, a team of 38 international scientists launched the Bellagio ll Summit Initiative. The goals of the Summit were: 1) To identify space medicine findings and countermeasures with highest probability for future terrestrial applications; and 2) To develop a roadmap for translation of these countermeasures to future terrestrial application. The team reviewed public domain literature, NASA databases, and evidence books within the framework of the five-stage National Institutes of Health (NIH) translation science model, and the NASA two-stage translation model. Teams then analyzed and discussed interdisciplinary findings to determine the most significant evidence-based countermeasures sufficiently developed for terrestrial application. RESULTS: Teams identified published human spaceflight research and applied translational science models to define mature products for terrestrial clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: The Bellagio ll Summit identified a snapshot of space medicine research and mature science with the highest probability of translation and developed a Roadmap of terrestrial application from space medicine-derived countermeasures. These evidence-based findings can provide guidance regarding the terrestrial applications of best practices, countermeasures, and clinical protocols currently used in spaceflight.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Military aeromedical evaluations are common, but specialized neuropsychological norms for aviation personnel are sparse, resulting in a need to rely on norms from the general population. Little has been published regarding aviation subpopulations and how their neuropsychological profiles may differ from general population normative data. This study investigated neuropsychological test results of aeromedical service members to evaluate consistency with general population norms, and to delineate differences between aviation subpopulations.METHODS: Analyses were conducted on demographic variables and test scores of military aviators (N 26) and nonaviator crewmembers (N 36) referred for evaluation due to a clinical problem requiring a waiver for flight status. Performance differences between subsamples were investigated with general linear modeling. Base rates for low scores were described.RESULTS: Mean test scores in both subsamples were 0 to 1 standard deviation (SD) above the general populations means, with the largest discrepancies being found on measures of visuospatial ability (crewmembers) and verbal learning (aviators). Modeling revealed a significant difference between aviators and crewmembers on Trail Making Test Part B, after accounting for education. Aviators produced fewer low scores than crewmembers, even when using education adjusted normative data.DISCUSSION: Results suggest the cognitive profile of aviators is uniquely strong in specific domains, with fewer low scores. The development of aviator-specific norms may enhance sensitivity to cognitive decrements in this population. Future studies might separately assess crewmember roles to further assess cognitive performance standards across specialties.Maltez-Laurienti A, Minniear A, Moore R, McGovern T, Newman P, Brearly T.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: On December 2020 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This new vaccine has several side effects that can potentially impair function, which warrants special attention regarding aircrews fitness to fly following vaccination.METHODS: A survey was conducted in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) Aeromedical Center in order to characterize the side effects and their duration following Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administration to aviators.RESULTS: The most common side effect was injection site pain. Headache, chills, myalgia, fatigue, and weakness were more common following the second dose administration. The difference is statistically significant. Following the second vaccine, duration of side effects was longer compared to the first vaccine (P-value 0.002).CONCLUSION: The IAF Aeromedical center policy for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recipients among aircrew members, based on side effects duration and severity, is to temporarily ground from flight duties for 24 and 48 h following the first and the second dose, respectively.Gabbai D, Ekshtein A, Tehori O, Ben-Ari O, Shapira S.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 virus has caused over 582,000 deaths in the United States to date. However, the pandemic has also afflicted the mental health of the population at large in the domains of anxiety and sleep disruption, potentially interfering with cognitive function. From an aviation perspective, safely operating an aircraft requires an airmans cognitive engagement for: 1) situational awareness, 2) spatial orientation, and 3) avionics programming. Since impaired cognitive function could interfere with such tasks, the current study was undertaken to determine if flight safety for a cohort of single engine, piston-powered light airplanes was adversely affected during a period of the pandemic (MarchOctober 2020) prior to U.S. approval of the first COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: Airplane accidents were per the National Transportation Safety Board Access<sup/> database. Fleet times were derived using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast. Statistics used Poisson distributions, Chi-squared/Fisher, and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: Little difference in accident rate was evident between the pandemic period (MarchOctober 2020) and the preceding (JanuaryFebruary) months (19 and 22 mishaps/100,000 h, respectively). Similarly, a proportional comparison of accidents occurring in 2020 with those for the corresponding months in 2019 failed to show over-representation of mishaps during the pandemic. Although a trend to a higher injury severity (43% vs. 34% serious/fatal injuries) was evident for pandemic-period mishaps, the proportional difference was not statistically significant when referencing the corresponding months in 2019. CONCLUSION: Surprisingly, using accidents as an outcome, the study herein shows little evidence of diminished flight safety for light aircraft operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Boyd DD.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aerobatic pilots must withstand high and sudden acceleration forces (G z ) up to ±10 G z . The physiological consequences of such a succession of high and abrupt positive and negative G z on the human body over time remain mostly unknown. This case report emphasizes changes in physiological factors such as cerebral oxygenation and heart rate dynamics collected in real aerobatic flights. CASE REPORT: A 37-yr-old man, experienced in aerobatic flying, voluntarily took part in this study. During two flight runs (15-20 min), the pilot performed aerobatic maneuvers with multiple high (±10 G z ) positive and negative accelerations. During the flights he wore a Polar heart rate sensor while cerebral oxygenation was measured continuously over his prefrontal cortex via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS allows for measurement of the relative concentration changes of oxygenated hemoglobin (O 2 Hb) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb), making it possible to determine cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamic status. DISCUSSION: The continuous in-flight monitoring of O 2 Hb and HHb revealed the large effects of successive positive and negative G z exposures on cerebral hemodynamics alterations. The results showed a significant and positive correlation between changes in G z exposures and O 2 Hb concentration. This case report highlights that NIRS provides some valuable and sensitive indicators for the monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics during aerobatic flights exposed to multiple and high acceleration forces. To our knowledge, this first study quantifying cerebral oxygenation changes in aerobatics opens the way for the assessment of individual physiological responses and tolerance in pilots to repeated high G z during real flights.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcutaneous measurement of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has been proposed for physiological monitoring of tactical jet aircrew because in some clinical settings it mirrors arterial CO 2 partial pressure (P a co 2 ). End-tidal monitoring in laboratory settings is known to give high-fidelity estimates of P a co 2 . METHODS: The correspondence between end-tidal (P ET co 2 ) and transcutaneous Pco 2 (tcPco 2 ) was examined in healthy volunteers under laboratory conditions of hyperoxia and hypoxia. Rest and exercise, skin heating and cooling, hyperventilation, and induced CO 2 retention were employed. RESULTS: Neither measure followed all known changes in P a co 2 and tcPco 2 changed when the skin temperature near the probe changed. Bland-Altman analysis showed significant nonzero slopes under most conditions. Regression analysis indicated that oxygen partial pressure (Po 2 ) in tissue measured as transcutaneous Po 2 (tcPo 2 ) is an important explanatory variable for tcPco 2 in addition to P ET co 2 , and that local skin temperature also has an effect. Additionally, absorption atelectasis from breathing 100% O 2 may cause P ET co 2 to deviate from P a co 2 . DISCUSSION: Even as a trend indicator for P a co 2 , tcPco 2 is not useful under conditions that resemble those in the highly dynamic tactical jet aircraft environment. P ET co 2 is also not a good indicator of CO 2 status in pilots who breathe nearly 100% O 2 . Shykoff BE, Lee LR, Gallo M, Griswold CA.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of abnormal EDS and contributing factors among Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) SAR helicopter personnel.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a total of N = 175 RNoAF SAR personnel completed an electronic survey including socio-demographic and lifestyle questions. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was used as both a continuous and categorical outcome variable to measure EDS.RESULTS: Abnormal EDS defined by ESS was found in 41% of the participants in this study. We observed no associations between socio-demographic and lifestyle factors and abnormal EDS in this study. DISCUSSION: There is a high prevalence of abnormal EDS in the current RNoAF SAR population. Despite this elevated level of fatigue, we did not find that the socio-demographic and lifestyle factors assessed in this study were associated with abnormal EDS in RNoAF SAR helicopter personnel. Also unusually, the study cohort did not demonstrate higher scores in factors found to change ESS scores in similar study populations (e.g., caffeine use, tobacco use, exercise level).

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: One of the mechanisms leading to spatial disorientation (SD) is overstimulation of the vestibular system by various aircraft maneuvers. The objective of this study was to observe respiratory rate and pulse changes during vestibular system stimulations with the help of two selected SD training profiles. METHODS: The respiration and pulse rates of 15 subjects were recorded in response to 2 sequential SD training profiles on a motion-based simulator. The session started with a motionless instruction period (IP), continued with a Coriolis profile (CP) which stimulated the semicircular canals, and ended with a Dark Takeoff profile (DP) which stimulated the otolith organs. Recorded parameter means during profiles were statistically compared with IP mean values. RESULTS: The average age of all subjects was 23.67 ± 1.11. Mean CP respiratory rate (23.43 ± 3.21) was higher than mean IP respiratory rate (21.39 ± 4.27) and mean DP pulse rate (79.88 ± 10.39) was lower than mean IP pulse rate (84.76 ± 14.26) of the subjects. These differences were statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Data indicate that stimulation of the semicircular canals increased respiration rate while stimulation of the otoliths caused a reduction in pulse rate. This was considered to be a result of vestibulorespiratory reflex. Inputs from the vestibular otolith organs contribute to the control of blood pressure during movement and changes in posture. Predicting pulse and respiratory changes due to aerial maneuvers may be important for pilot safety during flight.Ilbasmis S, Yildiz S.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: NASA regularly performs ground-based offgas tests (OGTs), which allow prediction of accumulated volatile pollutant concentrations at first entry on orbit, on whole modules and vehicles scheduled to connect to the International Space Station (ISS). These data guide crew safety operations and allow for estimation of ISS air revitalization systems impact from additional pollutant load. Since volatiles released from vehicle, module, and payload materials can affect crew health and performance, prediction of first ingress air quality is important. METHODS: To assess whether toxicological risk is typically over or underpredicted, OGT and first ingress samples from 10 vehicles and modules were compared. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The rate of pollutant accumulation was extrapolated over time. Ratios of analytical values and Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations were used to predict total toxicity values (T-values) at first entry. Results were also compared by compound. RESULTS: Frequently overpredicted was 2-butanone (9/10), whereas propanal (6/10) and ethanol (8/10) were typically underpredicted, but T-values were not substantially affected. Ingress sample collection delay (estimated by octafluoropropane introduced from ISS atmosphere) and T-value prediction accuracy correlated well (R 2 = 0.9008), highlighting the importance of immediate air sample collection and accounting for ISS air dilution. DISCUSSION: Importantly, T-value predictions were conservative 70% of the time. Results also suggest that T-values can be normalized to octafluoropropane levels to adjust for ISS air dilution at first ingress. Finally, OGT and ingress sampling has allowed small leaks in vehicle fluid systems to be recognized and addressed.Romoser AA, Scully RR, Limero TF, De Vera V, Cheng PF, Hand JJ, James JT, Ryder VE.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extra corporeal life support (ECLS) is presently first line therapy for refractory cardiogenic shock. Mobile circulatory support teams implant ECLS or extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients in the hospital without circulatory support. These patients are then transported to specialized centers. Here we report a case of sending a mobile circulatory support team abroad, followed by air ambulance evacuation, which, to our knowledge, has never been used as part of medical assistance abroad. CASE REPORT: In June, during a holiday in Turkey, a 56-yr-old woman complained about chest pain. She had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated with no no-flow time in the local hospital. ECG showed ST segment elevation. Medic'Air International medical assistance (Paris, France) contacted the hospital, which was not equipped with coronarography or cardiac ultrasound and the local treating doctor refused transfer of the patient to another facility. A medical team completed by a cardiothoracic surgeon and a perfusionist went from Paris to the patient’s bedside by air ambulance. They implemented the ECLS and successfully repatriated the patient to her home country (Belgium). The patient’s condition improved, she neurologically improved, and returned home on the 14 th day. DISCUSSION: Possible indications for ECLS repatriations firstly take into account recognized ECLS indications and case-by-case discussions on the evaluation of inadequacy of the health facilities and risk-benefit balance. In international medical assistance, this case’s description is an example of repatriation for patients who previously could not be transferred due to high risk of such intervention.Gerard D, Raffin H, Lebreton G.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Swedish Air Force (SwAF) conducted a study in 2010 to harmonize portrayal of aeronautical info (AI) on SwAF charts with NATO standards. A mismatch was found concerning vertical obstructions (VO). Norway regarded Sweden’s existing symbology as a way to solve the problem of overcrowded air charts and the two countries started to cooperate. The result of this development was a new set of symbology for obstacles. The aim of this study was to test the readability of the new obstacle and power line symbols compared to the old symbols. We also wished to assess the readability in NVG illumination conditions, particularly regarding the new symbols compared to the old. METHODS: In a randomized controlled study design, 21 volunteer military pilots from the Norwegian and Swedish Air Force were asked to perform tracking and chart-reading tests. The chart-reading test scored both errors and readability using a predefined score index. Subjective scoring was also done at the end of the test day. RESULTS: Overall response time improved by approximately 20% using the new symbology and error rate decreased by approximately 30–90% where statistically significant differences were found. DISCUSSION: The tracking test turned out to be too difficult due to several factors in the experimental design. Even though some caution should be shown in drawing conclusions from this study, the general trends seem well supported with the number of aircrew subjects we were able to recruit.Wagstaff AS, Larsen T.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Space radiation research has progressed rapidly in recent years, but there remain large uncertainties in predicting and extrapolating biological responses to humans. Exposure to cosmic radiation and solar particle events (SPEs) may pose a critical health risk to future spaceflight crews and can have a serious impact on all biomedical aspects of space exploration. The relatively minimal shielding of the cancelled 1960s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program’s space vehicle and the high inclination polar orbits would have left the crew susceptible to high exposures of cosmic radiation and high dose-rate SPEs that are mostly unpredictable in frequency and intensity. METHODS: In this study, we have modeled the nominal and off-nominal radiation environment that a MOL-like spacecraft vehicle would be exposed to during a 30-d mission using high performance, multicore computers. RESULTS: Projected doses from a historically large SPE (e.g., the August 1972 solar event) have been analyzed in the context of the MOL orbit profile, providing an opportunity to study its impact to crew health and subsequent contingencies. DISCUSSION: It is reasonable to presume that future commercial, government, and military spaceflight missions in low-Earth orbit (LEO) will have vehicles with similar shielding and orbital profiles. Studying the impact of cosmic radiation to the mission’s operational integrity and the health of MOL crewmembers provides an excellent surrogate and case-study for future commercial and military spaceflight missions.Chancellor JC, Auñon-Chancellor SM, Charles J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Until recently, glaucoma requiring treatment was disqualifying for U.S. pilots and required an aeromedical special issuance waiver. Since 2013 Aerospace Medical Examiners (AMEs) have been authorized to evaluate third-class pilots with mild glaucoma using similar protocols and issue medical certificates without a waiver if these criteria specified in the AME Guide are met. METHODS: The FAA’s medical database was searched for pilots with glaucoma between 2005 and 2014. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident database was then searched to determine which pilots with glaucoma had aircraft accidents during that period. The odds of accidents in the glaucoma pilots were compared with the overall pilot accident odds. RESULTS: Of 5000 pilots being treated for glaucoma, 78 were involved in aircraft accidents; however, glaucoma was not cited as the probable cause or contributing factor in any of the accidents. A logistic regression model adjusted for age showed that glaucoma had a protective effect on accident odds. The crude accident rate for third-class pilots with glaucoma was estimated to be 7.2 per 100,000 flight hours, with a fatal accident rate of 1.8 per 100,000. Although these point estimates were slightly higher than the estimated general aviation accident rates, the differences were not statistically significant. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that third-class pilots with glaucoma are not at significantly greater risk of an accident than the U.S. general aviation community. It also indicates that FAA certification protocols for certifying and following pilots with glaucoma provide an adequate level of flight safety.DeJohn CA, Mills WD.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is only scant information on the influence of the hypobaric environment on luting agents and their efficacy on dental crown cementation. The objective of this study was to provide data on the retentive characters of two cements commonly used on implant abutment surfaces both under normal and under hypobaric conditions. METHODS: There were 56 implant abutments supplied with CAD/CAM milled zirconia oxide crowns. 1) A zinc phosphate cement (ZP), and 2) a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGI), each mixed either A) manually or B) by means of automix capsules, were used for cementation. The cemented crowns of the 4 × 2 subgroups were either kept on the ground or were transported in an aircraft at altitudes up to 13,730 m (45,045.9 ft; N = 28 each), thus being subjected to the pressure changes (80×) every aircrew member or frequent flyer is exposed to. All cemented crowns were stored in climatized boxes during the experimental phase. RESULTS: Hand-mixing of ZP resulted in a significant reduction of mean (± SD) retention forces (581.6 ± 204.5 N) when compared to the control group on the ground (828.4 ± 147.9 N). Automixed ZP (931.9 ± 134.4 N in flight; 996.0 ± 107.4 N on the ground) and RMGI subgroups (ranging from 581.0 N ± 114.3 N to 662.4 N ± 92.5 N) were not affected by hypobaric conditions. DISCUSSION: When treating patients frequently exposed to hypobaric environments, automixing of ZP would seem favorable, while manual mixing should be avoided. RMGI is considered suitable and is not influenced by hand-mixing or barometric pressure changes. Kielbassa AM, Müller JAG.

In the first part we describe spatial disorientation and the function of the vestibular apparatus during flight and its consequences. In this part, the sensory illusion simulator used for the experiment is mentioned. In the second part we describe the simulator and test flight. In the third part we discuss data retrieved during simulator flights that are important for explaining the Giant Hand illusion. CASE REPORT: A well-trained pilot experienced the Giant Hand illusion while executing instrument flight rules flight on a simulator. The Giant Hand illusion was detected from the simulation data and confirmed by the pilot afterward. DISCUSSION: The Giant Hand illusion is a rare type of sensory illusion. The pilot falsely evaluated the situation as a malfunction of the aircraft controls. If the pilot had not been informed by the operator that he might have been influenced by the illusion, he would probably have crashed the simulated aircraft. An unrecognized Giant Hand illusion during a flight can lead to fatal consequences. This case report shows the symptoms and data that can be used for early recognition of this type of illusion.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common presenting arrhythmia in the general population. Cases of SVT presenting during commercial air travel are always challenging as they might be confused with other conditions requiring different treatment strategies. We present a case of an in-flight SVT that was successfully managed using telemedicine support. CASE REPORT: A 33-yr-old woman developed chest pain and dizziness while on an international commercial flight. Vital signs obtained on an on-board telemedicine device recorded an initial heart rate and blood pressure of 220 bpm and 128/78 mmHg, respectively. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was also obtained and transmitted to the ground-based medical support (GBMS) center where an SVT was diagnosed. Vagal maneuvers were recommended which resulted in a return to sinus rhythm and stabilization of the patient. DISCUSSION: In parallel to the global increase in commercial air travel, it is expected that the incidence of in-flight arrhythmias will also increase, including SVTs. Vagal maneuvers are a safe, first-line option. While treating patients with a symptomatic tachyarrhythmia it is essential to diagnose the underlying arrhythmia, especially when initial maneuvers fail. Telemedicine, with transmission of vital signs and ECGs to GBMS centers, can enable diagnosis and guide management of in-flight SVTs, distinguishing them from other forms of cardiac arrhythmia. Undifferentiated chest pain and dizziness are common causes for flight diversions and, as such, could potentially be prevented in some instances by using telemedicine.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There are many potential human-machine interfaces for controlling complex robotics. However, restrictions in hardware, software, or human capability may pose limits on the input device degrees-of-freedom (DOF). This study examined effects on operational performance and strategy when interface DOF were limited, hypothesizing that different limitations on interface DOF would affect operator performance and technique. METHODS: Experiments used a Canadarm2 simulator with a dual-joystick interface adapted to operate under limited DOF conditions. Four interfaces were compared: full multiaxis (FM), limited translation (TL), limited rotation (RL), and without simultaneous translation/rotation or “non-bimanual” (NB). Subjects were tasked with operating the Canadarm2 in a simulated ISS control scenario to approach and grapple a moving cargo vehicle within a 90-s time limit. RESULTS: No significant difference was seen between FM and RL in task time or grapple success, and both were significantly different from TL. NB exhibited significantly increased task time from FM and RL, but no significant difference in grapple success rate. When rotating, subjects decreased time spent using multirotation for NB over FM. DISCUSSION: Similar performance between FM and RL suggests that restricting rotation may be preferred for interfaces with DOF design limits. For the NB condition, there was increased task time combined with decreased multirotation, highlighting potential use for NB in training for rotation efficiency. Two different strategies were observed during TL to overcome inability to visually track, align with, and move toward the target simultaneously. Examination of these techniques provides insight on which strategic elements were most critical for success. Hall SA, Stirling L.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sleep restriction may lead to decreased performance and increased accidents and errors. SPHERES, a small satellite testbed, was used to examine the effects of sleep restriction and situation awareness (SA) aids on a simulation of satellite operations. METHODS: Subjects ( N = 8) were trained on SPHERES, then, in a randomized order cross-over design, had 3 d of sufficient sleep (SS) or 3 d of sleep restriction (SR) before a testing session. Subjects controlled two SPHERES satellites in a space debris avoidance scenario. Dependent measures included survival time, area covered by the satellites, and satellite motion perception. RESULTS: There were significant interaction effects of sleep protocol Order (SS or SR first) and sleep Condition (SS or SR) on survival time and area covered. Post hoc tests showed longer survival time for the second testing session if the Order was SS first (Mean = 56.1 s, Median = 44.0 s) as compared to SR first (Mean = 42.7 s, Median = 33.5 s). SS-first subjects received benefit from added SA cues of the augmented display in perceiving the satellite motion. DISCUSSION: These data support that learning in a well-rested state may support development of appropriate strategies for better performance. Subjects that were SS during the first session were better able to use added SA cues provided by the augmentation and may have then developed a better mental model of the task and the system. This pilot study suggests that training guidelines for operating multiple robotic assets should permit appropriate rest before and after training to assist in mental model development and task performance.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Humans detect motion and gravity via the labyrinthine system of the inner ear, which consists of the vestibule and the semicircular canals. The vestibular system provides three major functions for maintaining balance and orientation. First, it maximizes the effectiveness of the visual system. Second, it provides orientational information necessary for performing both skilled and reflexive motor activities. Third, in the absence of vision, the vestibular system provides a reasonably accurate perception of motion and position. Although these organs provide important cues for basic orientation on the ground, they often provide misleading information during flight. A superior semicircular canal dehiscence can cause an individual to experience disorientation and vertigo-like symptoms. CASE REPORT: A 30-yr-old male student pilot experienced airsickness on his first several flights in the T-6A Texan II aircraft. Airsickness is common among student pilots in the early stages of flight training; however, the subject pilot’s symptoms lasted well beyond the normal 24 h, and included vertiginous symptoms lasting days after his last flight. His persistent symptoms required he be held out of training for further evaluation. Comprehensive vestibular and audiological testing were normal; however, a CT scan of the temporal bones showed a left superior semicircular canal dehiscence, and he was diagnosed with left labyrinthine fistula as the cause of his vertigo. He was medically eliminated from pilot training and permanently disqualified from U.S. Air Force flying duties. DISCUSSION: Spatial disorientation remains one of the deadliest factors related to aircraft mishaps every year. In this case, an abnormal presentation of airsickness that prompted further evaluation may have prevented a dangerous situation in the air. In standard airsickness, the goal is to keep the pilot flying to expedite adaptation, so this case highlights the importance of distinguishing between normal airsickness and a spatially disorienting medical condition.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The special issuance (SI) waiver is the primary mechanism for U.S. pilots who do not meet FAA standards to obtain a medical certificate. About 34,000 pilots possess an SI waiver, but there is a large gap in knowledge of the relationship of SI waivers to aviation safety. METHODS: All FAA pilot medical exams from 2002 through 2011 were matched to the National Transportation Safety Board accident database. The association of an SI waiver with accidents was explored using logistic regression models. Accident rates were also calculated using a novel technique based on pilots’ reported flight times on their applications for medical certification. RESULTS: For third-class flight exams overall, the presence of an SI waiver is associated with 8.7% lower odds of an accident than regular issuance exams. The calculated overall accident rate was 6.6 per 100,000 h. For the first and second-class exams, there was no significant association of SI waivers with safety for the overall group. The oldest and youngest pilots in the third-class group and the younger pilots in the first and second-class groups had somewhat elevated accident odds. The significance of these higher odds is uncertain, especially for the younger pilots who have a probable flight time bias. DISCUSSION: The overall FAA program of special issuance waivers shows no detrimental effect on aviation accidents and enables a large number of pilots to safely continue their aviation pursuits in spite of failure to meet specific regulatory medical standards.

METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 862 Republic of Singapore Airforce aircrew applicants tested with CCT and Ishihara PIP–ELT combination as screening. CCT repeatability was analyzed by comparing the subject’s interocular (right vs. left eye) scores measured as the coefficient of repeatability (COR), with COR differing by ≥15 points considered to be outside normal limits. RESULTS: Of the applicants, 17 (1.97%) failed to achieve a CCT score of ≥55 (5 protan, 12 deutan), while 26 (3.02%) applicants failed to achieve a score ≥75 (5 protan, 21 deutan). Of the 17 applicants who obtained a CCT score of &lt;55, 16 failed the Ishihara PIP test. The only applicant who passed the Ishihara PIP test had a CCT score of 50. Of all applicants, 1.7% had a COR of ≥15, with 93.3% of them identified as color vision deficient (CVD). Our results demonstrated excellent test repeatability, with 99.9% (835 out of 836) of color vision normal (CVN) applicants achieving a COR of &lt;15 points. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a high correlation between the CCT (passing score of ≥55) and the Ishihara PIP. Employing the CCT with a passing score of ≥75, instead of the Ishihara PIP–ELT combination, led to an increase in attrition rate of 0.7–3.0%. Chay IW, Lim SWY, Tan BBC.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pneumocephalus is intracranial air normally occurring as a consequence of trauma or cranial surgery, but rarely has been reported following the habitual use of the Valsalva maneuver. We were unable to locate any similar cases of pneumocephalus associated with high performance aircraft flight, and this case report highlights an important consequence of the inappropriate use of Valsalva on ascent to altitude. CASE REPORT: A healthy 29-yr-old F-22 instructor pilot presented with recurrent pneumocephalus following the use of the Valsalva maneuver. These episodes started after an initial use of a forceful Valsalva during an aggressive unrestricted climb to altitude. His symptoms included facial pressure and a bubbling sensation in his head followed by a severe headache for several days. After upright CT evaluation, three small sphenoid sinus defects were discovered and repaired. There was no recurrence of pneumocephalus following provocative testing after surgical repair of the sphenoid sinus defects, and the aviator returned to flying high performance aircraft. DISCUSSION: Spontaneous or Valsalva-associated pneumocephalus is an uncommon occurrence in healthy individuals. Awareness of the pathognomonic succussion splash associated with this diagnosis as well as a presentation of facial pressure and headache following flight will lead to appropriate diagnostic investigation and management. This case highlights the importance of recognizing rare diagnoses like pneumocephalus in the flying population, and future education of aerospace physiology technicians and aviators should emphasize appropriate Valsalva technique to promote flying safety and prevent similar presentations.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extensive research has demonstrated that shift-work and time of day affect one’s ability to maintain alertness and vigilance. Research has also sought to determine ways to increase alertness and decrease the effects of fatigue in high vigilance environments, such as air traffic control. This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of video game play as a fatigue countermeasure in air traffic controllers. METHODS: We tested 22 military air traffic controllers to ascertain whether video game play prior to time in the air traffic control room heightened their alertness during their shift. An oculometer, which is an objective measure of physiological arousal and visual alertness, was used to measure pupillary diameter, amplitude, latency, and velocity. Perceived alertness was assessed using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. Over a 4-wk period, the air traffic controllers participated in a counterbalanced, within-subjects design study with experimental (video gaming prior to control room) and control (no video gaming prior to control) conditions. RESULTS: We used a within-subjects, repeated measures MANOVA to compare differences in physiological and perceived alertness of individuals in the two conditions. Results indicated that video game play significantly increased physiological alertness in air traffic controllers, especially pupil diameter and velocity, and this effect was sustained for at least 30 min after they stopped playing. Perceived alertness was also increased by video game play. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that video game play could be an effective fatigue countermeasure in high vigilance occupations such as air traffic control. Fowler LA, Gustafson D.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The literature is equivocal regarding the degree of cognitive impairment incurred at the 8000-ft (2438 m) maximal cabin pressure altitude equivalence for commercial aircraft. This study elaborates upon the investigation of the 8000-ft limit by introducing the cumulative effects of repeated daily exposures thereof. METHOD: Pilots completed four daily high-altitude chamber flights at both sea level and 8000 ft. During each chamber flight, attentional processing and executive function were assessed using the Attention Network Test and the antisaccade task. RESULTS: Antisaccade task performance likely reflected a learning effect at both altitudes. Attention Network Test results, however, exhibited sensitivity to the fatigue and altitude interaction. Orienting network scores were affected by fatigue differently depending on altitude, with superior efficiency at 8000 ft compared to sea level (M = 44.9, SD = 25.0 vs. M = 29.0, SD = 18.1) in the last flight of the exposure cycle. Conflict network performance, however, suggested that while fatigue increasingly compromised executive control at both altitudes, marginally worse overall executive efficiency was observed at 8000 ft compared to sea level, notably in the last flight of the exposure cycle (M = 98.3, SD = 19.8 vs. M = 87.8, SD = 21.7). DISCUSSION: Executive control function, as measured by inhibition of interference in reconciling conflicting stimuli, degraded as a function of cumulative exposures to mild hypobaric hypoxia, though adaptive measures possibly compensated to preserve performance to a degree. This study serves as a baseline against which longer 8000-ft exposures, including long-haul flight, can be measured. Thropp JE, Buza PW.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Despite the large number of U.S. military members who conduct parachuting operations, its inherent safety risks, and the introduction of a new military parachute in 2010, little has been published in the last decade on U.S. military parachute fatalities. METHODS: Parachute fatality investigative records maintained by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center were reviewed for U.S. Army fatalities resulting from military parachuting operations from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2015. De-identified data on cases were collected, including causes, lethal injuries, and demographic, environmental, and missional factors. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: There were 13 cases which met study inclusion criteria. Most occurred during static-line operations and were jumps from a C-17 aircraft using a T-11 parachute. The two most common assigned accident codes were “improper or abnormal exit” and “unstable or improper body position,” which combined accounted for 33% of cases. Also noteworthy at 11% each were “entanglement,” “parachute malfunction,” and “dragged on the drop zone,” and at 6% each were “static line injury,” “lost or stolen air,” and “drop zone hazard.” In 69% of cases blunt force trauma was the cause of death. DISCUSSION: Incident factors included human actions, equipment failure, and the environment. Death from blunt force trauma upon impact with the ground as the most frequent lethal injury was expected for parachute operations. This descriptive study provides awareness to military leaders of circumstances in which fatalities occur. Future investigations should include data on the total number of jumps to provide a more comprehensive analysis of risk. Johnson ES, Gaydos SJ, Pavelites JJ, Kotwal RS, Houk JE.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: From a population-based perspective, reports in the peer-reviewed medical literature suggest an increase in the overall prevalence of asthma in recent decades. Applicants for military aviation training with a current or past history of asthma are generally excluded in the United Kingdom. METHODS: In order to assess the impact of the prevalence of asthma on the available pool of military service candidates, the authors collected data on annual live births between 1916 and 2016 as well as peer-reviewed publications that provided insight into asthma prevalence trends within the United Kingdom across the last century (covering birth-year population cohorts ranging from 1924 to 1995). Regression techniques were used to estimate the prevalence of individuals who could reasonably expect to be found unfit for military aviation service due to asthma-like conditions within the birth-year cohorts between 2001 and 2016. RESULTS: Between 1916 and 2016, the number of live births in the United Kingdom has averaged approximately 802,000 per year. The reported prevalence of asthma, based on the assimilated data points, ranged from 2.3 cases per 1000 individuals among the 1924 birth-year cohort, to 29.8 cases per 1000 individuals among the 1990 birth-year cohort. DISCUSSION: Based on the data and analysis presented above, asthma continues to constitute a significant public health issue in the United Kingdom. Military services must base risk mitigation decisions on accurate and precise diagnostic categorizations, and prudently balance the benefits of allowing affected individuals to participate in military service with the potential for mission degradation or compromise.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to excess manganese (Mn) can cause multiple toxicological outcomes in humans, most notably neurotoxicity. Ample epidemiological evidence suggests that chronic, low-level exposure causes subclinical cognitive effects. Because NASA astronauts will be exposed to Mars regolith, Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations (SMACs) were developed following an extensive literature review. METHODS: Multiple databases were searched for information relevant to derivation of Mn SMAC values. An additional search for Mars dust data was performed. Risk assessment approaches were applied, including adjustments for space-relevant susceptibility to Mn effects, to develop limits for 1-h to 1000-d exposures. Rover data informed the assessment and enabled calculation of allowable total dust exposure based on Mn content. RESULTS: Over 400 relevant sources were identified. Applicability of exposure characteristics and data collection methods influenced key study choice. SMACs ranging from 3 mg · m −3 (1 h) – 0.0079 mg · m −3 (1000 d) were set to protect primarily against neurocognitive and respiratory effects. Considering 0.38 wt% total Mn presence in the dust, maximum recommended total dust exposure should not exceed 790 mg · m −3 (1 h) – 2 mg · m −3 (1000 d). DISCUSSION: This literature review allowed for identification of relevant studies to inform SMAC development. Manganese is one of several components to consider when developing an appropriate total dust limit for Martian dust; other dust elements may alter Mn bioavailability. Mission-specific activities may require alteration of assumptions regarding Mn dust concentration and exposure duration. However, based on expected toxicity of particulate matter itself, the acute SMACs are protective, even with transient exposure during activities that could produce higher concentrations.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adverse weather and poor visual cues are common elements in night-time Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) operations contributing to spatial disorientation and fatal accidents. Pilots are required to make weather-related preflight risk assessments to accept or reject a flight. This study’s aim was to develop predictive risk assessment tools based on historical accident data to assist the decision-making process. METHODS: We analyzed 32 single-pilot HEMS night-time visual flight rules fatal accidents to identify contributory risk factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop prediction nomograms for nonvisual meteorological conditions (non-VMC), cause and nonsurvivable accidents as dependent variables. Risk factors such as temperature dew point spread, elevation difference, and years of HEMS pilot experience, were entered as continuous variables. Flight crew composition, pilot DTE (domain task experience) and flight rule capability, primary missions, and temperature dew point spread were entered as categorical variables. A point scoring matrix transposed model probability to likelihood and consequence severity. RESULTS: The nomograms correctly predicted the likelihood of entering non-VMC, accident cause, and sustaining a nonsurvivable accident in 75%, 55%, and 94% of cases, respectively. Using data from a recent nonsurvivable HEMS accident, the nomogram estimated a 92% probability (Very Likely) of nonsurvivable accident if visual cues were lost. CONCLUSION: These nomograms can provide preflight information to predict the likelihood of adverse safety outcomes occurring during a planned HEMS mission. While further development work is needed, this approach has the potential to improve HEMS operational safety. Aherne BB, Zhang C, Chen WS, Newman DG .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. The most common treatment for this disorder is methylphenidate, which is a disqualifying medication for flight. Candidates with previous use of methylphenidate are not necessarily disqualified from the Israeli Air Force (IAF) flight academy. METHODS: Flight cadets from 12 consecutive flight courses who have used methylphenidate at least once in the past were identified according to their medical records. The graduation ratio of cadets with previous use of methylphenidate was compared with that of the rest of the cadets. A comparison was also made with regard to the causes of disqualification from the flight course. Statistical significance was assessed using the Fischer Test. RESULTS: Among the 90 flight cadets who have used methylphenidate, only 2 (2.2%) successfully graduated from the IAF flight academy. Among the 2983 flight cadets who have no history of methylphenidate use, 461 (15.4%) successfully graduated. We found no significant differences in the disqualification causes between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The IAF flight academy graduation rate was meaningfully and significantly lower among cadets who reported previous use of methylphenidate.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The previous Spacecraft Maximal Allowable Concentrations (SMACs) for methanol were established by characterizing minor effects upon cognitive functions as a no-observable adverse effects level (NOAEL). However, an increasing awareness of the risk posed by Space-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) has caused NASA Toxicology to reexamine SMACs for methanol because exposure to it can also adversely affect ocular health. An updated review of the literature indicates that no adjustments to the SMACs due to SANS complications were required, while confirming that effects upon the central nervous system remain the appropriate basis for the SMACs for methanol. Our review, however, identified several issues that provide justification for modest SMAC reductions. It has recently been recognized that inhaled methanol may reach the brain via the olfactory system and be absorbed there into the highly toxic metabolite formaldehyde. A benchmark dose (BMD) for an extra risk of 10%, derived from an analysis of the incidences of neurological lesions in monkeys chronically exposed to methanol, is an order of magnitude less than the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) reference concentration for chronic inhalation of methanol. Reports calling attention to the relative insensitivity of traditional methods of assessing cognitive function erode confidence that adverse effects at the concentration reported as a NOAEL would have been recognizable. Therefore, an additional modest safety factor of three is applied to SMACs for methanol. Scully RR, Garcia H, McCoy JT, Ryder VE. Revisions to limits for methanol in the air of spacecraft .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Paragliding is an emerging discipline of aviation, with recreational pilots flying distances over 100 km. It remains risky. Accidents typically relate to pilot error rather than equipment failure. We measured cognition and physiological responses during simulated flight, to investigate whether errors might be due to pilot impairment, rather than misjudgment. METHODS: There were 10 male paraglider pilots (aged 19–58 yr) who undertook a simulated flight in an environmental chamber from sea level (0.209 F I o 2 ) to 1524 m (0.174 F I o 2 ), 2438 m (0.156 F I o 2 ), and 3658 m (0.133 F I o 2 ), over approximately 2 h. They experienced normobaric hypoxia, environmental cooling and headwind, completing logical reasoning, mannikin, mathematical processing, Stroop Color-Word and Tower Puzzle tasks; as well as measures of risk-taking (BART), mood (POMS), and subjective experience. RESULTS: Results were compared to ten controls, matched by age, sex, and flying experience. Physiological measures were oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, ventilation, heart rate, oxygen saturation, rectal and skin temperatures, blood glucose, blood lactate, and urine production. There were no significant differences between pilots and controls at any altitude. Results were heterogenous within and between individuals. As altitude increased, oxygen consumption and minute volume increased significantly, while oxygen saturations fell (98.3% [baseline] to 88.5% [peak]). Rectal temperatures fell by a statistically (but not clinically) significant amount (37.6°C to 37.3°C), while finger skin temperatures dropped steeply (32.2°C to 13.9°C). DISCUSSION: Results suggest cognitive impairment is unlikely to be a primary cause of pilot error during paragliding flights (of less than 2 h, below 3658 m), though hand protection requires improvement.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The value of aeromedical certification in reducing adverse medical outcomes is an especially important question for this era of increasing flight operations that do not require an FAA medical certificate. The study of this question has previously been thwarted by a lack of information about pilots when their medical certificates are not renewed. METHODS: We matched airmen in the FAA medical certification database to the U.S. Social Security Death Index to identify date of death for deceased pilots. Logistic regression models were used to explore associations of certification data with odds of death while holding a medical certificate and within 4 yr of expiration of a medical certificate. RESULTS: FAA aeromedical waivers were associated with 33% lower odds of death while holding a medical certificate and 35% increased odds of death within 4 yr after expiration of a medical certificate. Denial was associated with 21% increased odds of death in the next 4 yr. Only 13 of 47 medical conditions having significant associations were associated with increased odds of death during certification. DISCUSSION: We found that FAA aeromedical certification reduces the odds of death while holding a medical certificate compared to the 4 yr after certificate expiration. We believe this helps provide a positive answer to the question of whether medical certification reduces medically related events. Mills WD, Greenhaw RM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to high G force is a known safety hazard in military aviation as well as civilian aerobatic flight. Tolerance to high G forces has been well studied in military pilots, but there is little research directed at civilian pilots who may have medications or medical conditions not permitted in military pilots. METHODS: In this case-control study, we identified 89 fatal high-G aerobatic accidents and 4000 fatal control accidents from 1995 through 2018 from the NTSB accident database and the FAA autopsy database. We retrieved medications and medical conditions from the FAA's pilot medical databases. Logistic regression models were used to explore the associations of drugs, medical conditions, height, and medical waivers with high-G accidents. RESULTS: Seven drugs (alprazolam, clonidine, ethanol, meclizine, phentermine, triamterene, and zolpidem) reached statistical significance in our models, but had such small case counts that we consider these findings to be uncertain, except for ethanol, which was found in seven cases. Of these, only triamterene was known to the FAA. Statistically significant medical predictors included only alcohol abuse (seven cases) and liver disease (only two cases). DISCUSSION: Our analysis found that the drug ethanol and the condition alcohol abuse are significantly associated with high-G accidents. Seven other factors were statistically significant, but should only be considered as hypothesis generating due to very low case counts. Our study does not suggest that restricting pilots with otherwise permissible medications or medical conditions from aerobatics is warranted. Mills WD, Greenhaw RM, Wang JMP.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little consensus exists on the best practices for post-acute care of patients who suffer splenic injury but retain functional splenic tissue. Moreover, no published guidance or case reports exist for managing pilots in this demographic, making the flight surgeon’s task particularly difficulty as he/she attempts to apply the best available evidence for a patient population exposed to unique occupational hazards. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of an F-16 pilot who suffered a spontaneous splenic rupture due to infectious mononucleosis and required splenic artery embolization for hemodynamic stabilization. Despite the salvage of a significant portion of his spleen, the pilot was managed as an asplenic patient due to concern that: 1) splenic artery embolization compromised the function of his spleen; and 2) his status as a military aviator placed him at increased risk of infection due to frequent travel. He received appropriate vaccinations for an asplenic patient, fever precautions, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for immediate use if he developed fever. After discussion with the Aeromedical Consult Service, who felt the aviator had minimal risk of a poor outcome, he was returned to flying status. Since returning to flying status he has logged over 15 h of flight time, routinely experiencing 8–9 +G z without difficulty. DISCUSSION: This case provides a successful approach to the management of pilots of high-performance aircraft who suffer splenic injury but retain functional splenic tissue, and provides precedent for safely returning these patients to flying status following recovery.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury can be lethal if left unattended. The transportation of severely wounded combat casualties from the battlefield to higher level of care via aeromedical evacuation (AE) may result in unintended complications. This could become a serious concern at the time of evacuation of mass casualties or for prolonged field care scenarios with limited resources. METHODS: Following instrumentation (t1), anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were injured or not [75-kPa blast and 30% estimated blood-volume controlled hemorrhage] (t2). After 15 min, all rats were resuscitated with saline. During the simulated 3-h evacuation, 8000 ft (2440 m) vs. sea-level heart rate, temperature, and oxygenation (S p o 2 ) were continuously recorded. One group of rats was euthanized immediately after evacuation (t3) and another after a 72-h recovery period (t4). Hematology and metabolic levels were measured at t1, t2, t3, and t4. RESULTS: Survival was 100% in control-uninjured animals, 83% in injured animals under normobaria, and significantly reduced to 50% under hypobaria. This AE setting resulted in significantly lower hemodynamics, thermoregulation, and oxygenation parameters in the animals under hypobaria than those under normobaria. The initial lower mean arterial pressure (MAP) with the reduced oxygen level before AE were critical factors for the survival of injured animals. We observed a general increase of white blood cells and platelet ability to aggregate at t4 in all experimental groups. CONCLUSION: Physiological parameters were affected during aeromedical evacuation in all groups. This was worsened for injured animals with MAP less than 60 mmHg associated with low S p o 2 in a simulated aeromedical evacuation. This represented a high risk of mortality for severely polytraumatized animals. Arnaud F, Pappas G, Maudlin-Jeronimo E, Goforth C. Simulated aeromedical evacuation in a polytrauma rat model .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the last 10 yr, the number of ultra-haul flights—defined as flights greater than 12 h of flying time—has increased. While the medical complications of these flights are well-known, the underlying cellular effects are less clear. The primary objective of this study was to test the effects of extended mild hypobaric hypoxia on overall well-being and skeletal muscle morphology and macrophage populations. METHODS: A total of 22 male C57BL/6 mice were assigned to a normobaric (NB) or hypobaric (HB) chamber for 14–17 h. Overall mouse well-being and the general morphology and resident macrophage number in hindlimb muscles were compared between the two pressure conditions. RESULTS: During mild hypobaric hypoxia, the mice behaved normally and no changes were observed in general muscle morphology. Regarding resident macrophages, the mean antigen area of CD206 in the hindlimb muscles, lateral gastrocnemius (LG, 33.8 ± 2.0 vs. 35.3 ± 1.6), medial gastrocnemius (MG, 32.4 ± 1.6 vs. 32.6 ± 1.5), and quadriceps femoris (QF, 36.3 ± 1.2 vs. 34.3 ± 1.1) were similar between NB and HB conditions, and the number of CD68-positive cells in the LG and QF were similar between the two conditions. Significantly fewer CD206-positive cells were counted in the LG muscle under the HB condition. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that extended exposure to mild hypobaric hypoxia, similar to that of an ultra-long-haul flight, does not adversely affect healthy skeletal muscle.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gradual ascent is impractical for personnel deploying to the South Pole due to logistical challenges. Prevention of altitude illness relies on prophylactic medications such as acetazolamide and behavioral modifications including hydration and avoidance of overexertion. We present three recent cases of altitude illness that occurred in previously healthy individuals at the South Pole. CASE REPORTS: 1) A 52-yr-old woman not on prophylactics presented with headache and intractable vomiting 7 h after arriving and hiking around the station. She was treated with acetazolamide, dexamethasone, oxygen, and supportive care. Her symptoms resolved during the evacuation flight. 2) A 23-yr-old man presented with dyspnea at rest 3 d after arriving without prophylactic treatments. He had a S a o 2 of 49%, wheezes and crackles on lung exam, and interstitial infiltrates on chest X-ray. His treatment included oxygen, nifedipine, acetazolamide, and dexamethasone. His symptoms resolved during the evacuation flight. 3) A 40-yr-old man presented with dyspnea after a series of strenuous workouts since his arrival 5 d prior. He had a S a o 2 of 41%, and his chest X-ray was consistent with high altitude pulmonary edema. He was treated with oxygen, nifedipine, and fluids before descent to sea level, where his symptoms fully resolved 4 d later. DISCUSSION: These patients illustrate that altitude illness may develop despite medical screening, participant education, and availability of prophylactic medications based on published guidelines. These cases could be attributed to noncompliance and misinformation, bringing to light some of the challenges with managing more diverse populations that deploy to remote environments.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Dramatic increases in parachuting safety over the last three decades have been attributed to advances in technology and training for parachutists. However, very little is known about the physiological condition of skydivers making repeated, medium-altitude aircraft exits without using supplemental oxygen. As in aviation, human error is broadly responsible for the majority of skydiving mishaps, although it is unclear what role, if any, physiological factors contribute to these mishaps. Over the course of 2 d, a healthy, 50-yr-old male skydiver executed four normal exits (two jumps per day) from an aircraft between 13,500 and 14,000 ft (4115 and 4267 m) pressure altitude while wearing a helmet-mounted biomonitoring device (SPYDR, Spotlight Labs). On both days, after the subject's second jump, he reported feeling lightheaded and dizzy, symptoms he experiences approximately once every five jumps, and had previously attributed to the excitement of the jump. Inspection of Spo₂ and pulse data revealed that the subject was mildly hypoxic at jump altitude (Spo₂ < 90%). For all four jumps, Spo₂ did not return to normal levels until under canopy. Previous studies have evaluated the cognitive impairment of general aviation pilots operating unpressurized aircraft above 12,500 ft (3810 m) without supplemental oxygen. Alarmingly, mildly hypoxic pilots exhibited twice the rate of procedural errors as compared to normally oxygenated subjects. This study found that the skydiver exited the aircraft with mild hypoxia, which has been associated with cognitive impairment in pilots and could possibly be linked to injuries and/or fatalities.Bradke BS, Everman BR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vo 2peak has traditionally been thought to be regulated by cardiac output and arteriovenous-oxygen difference. A “muscle-centric” view suggests the cardiovascular system is secondarily responsive to the primary driver: active muscle mass. METHODS: A total of 19 recreationally active men ( N = 10) and women ( N = 9) performed a Vo 2peak test, a Vo 2peak verification test on an electrically braked cycle ergometer on the same day, and a hydrostatic weighing test to assess fat free mass after providing written informed consent. RESULTS: Vo 2peak was significantly higher in men (3.74 ± 0.6 L · min −1 ) than women (2.22 ± 0.30 L · min −1 ). Whole body fat free mass explained 91% of the variability in Vo 2peak (R 2 = 0.91) in the men and women combined, 81% of the variability in Vo 2peak in men alone, and 46% of the variability in Vo 2peak in women alone. None of these subjects were highly trained. DISCUSSION: Fat free mass, a surrogate for muscle mass, was the primary predictor of Vo 2peak in this group of recreationally active men and women. Therefore, it appears that whole body fat free mass (a surrogate for muscle mass) is the primary driver for Vo 2peak in these recreationally active men and women. These data have implications as to the type of training NASA personnel should be undertaking: resistance training as opposed to aerobic training. Lambert CP.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In helicopter critical care and emergency medical services (HEMS) transportation, organizations aim for efficiency of the dispatch process. Most HEMS organizations do not provide transport under instrument flight rules (IFR), due to equipment and training cost. Boston MedFlight (BMF) provides IFR HEMS transport. We set out to determine if response time of IFR transport was superior to ground transport. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of quality improvement data was performed. Data was collected by two observers sitting in the BMF control room in varying shifts. A process map of the dispatch process, from the dispatch call to the vehicle en route was developed. Critical points in the dispatch process were determined and a variety of time differences to determine the length of processes in the dispatch calculated. We compared median time differences between visual flight rules (VFR) flight and IFR flight, between IFR flight and ground transport, and between VFR and Ground for these points using a Mann-Whitney U -test. RESULTS: During the study collection period, 443 transports occurred, of which 109 transports happened while the observers were present: 37 ground, 57 VFR, and 15 IFR. Due to weather, six IFR transports were declined. The overall time from dispatch call to vehicle en route was significantly increased for IFR flights [median: 30 min:8 s (interquartile range 19:06–49:04)] over both VFR flights [11:36 (9:24–17:06); P vs. IFR: 0.001] and ground transports [9:39 (6:59–14.51); P vs. IFR: 0.001]. Most of this increase was accounted for by increases in the time from dispatch to crew acceptance, and from rotor start to vehicle en route. DISCUSSION: IFR conditions resulted in significantly increased dispatch times over both VFR flight and ground transport. The increase is likely a result of weather check, filing an IFR flight plan, and IFR release. Dispatch algorithms should be adjusted for this time delay of IFR transports.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aerospace Medicine is a small medical specialty. With the increasing need for aircraft pilots, continued low Earth orbit NASA operations, and the emergence of commercial spaceflight, there is a necessity for recruiting and educating the next generation of Aerospace Medicine specialists. This study was designed to create and validate a short Aerospace Medicine curriculum. METHODS: Medical students at the University of Texas Medical Branch were recruited to attend a series of six 1-h meetings covering Aerospace Medicine career options and key Aerospace Medicine topics. A survey addressing student demographics, interest in a career in Aerospace Medicine, and knowledge of key Aerospace Medicine topics was administered at the beginning and end of the curriculum. Interest in pursuing a career in Aerospace Medicine pre- and postcurriculum was compared with an independent t -test. The knowledge-based portion of the survey was also evaluated using an independent t -test. RESULTS: There were 23 participants who were recruited and filled out the initial survey and 15 participants who attended the final meeting and filled out the postcurriculum survey. Mean interest in pursuing a career in Aerospace Medicine did not change significantly (75.45% before involvement in the curriculum and 83.08% after participation). Knowledge of foundational Aerospace Medicine topics increased from 64.25% before involvement in the curriculum to 73.33% at the end of the study. There was an average of 12 participants at each meeting. DISCUSSION: This demonstrates the utility of this curriculum as an educational tool for medical students. Future efforts will focus on dissemination of the curriculum nationally and internationally. Kreykes AJ, Petersen EH, Lowry CL.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypoxia can be a problem for warfighters, compromising visual and cognitive performance. One area of study has been hypoxia-induced decrements in color vision. METHODS: The present study examined how hypoxia affected the perception of wavelengths associated with unique green and with unique yellow as well as discriminability by the blue vs. yellow (b-y) and the red vs. green (r-g) spectrally opponent color channels while breathing O 2 levels found at sea level and at 5500 m. Measurements of wavelengths producing unique green (minimizing response by the b-y channel) and unique yellow (minimizing response by the r-g channel) preceded measurements of wavelength discriminability near those unique hues. RESULTS: Relative to sea level, unique yellow shifted to shorter wavelengths (0.54 nm) and unique green shifted to longer wavelengths (2.3 nm) under hypoxia. In terms of an equal psychophysical scale, both unique hues shifted by similar magnitudes. Wavelength discriminability of both color channels was compromised by statistically reliable amounts of 16–17% under hypoxia. DISCUSSION: These results were consistent with previous studies and the inference that postreceptor, M-cone neurons were differentially compromised by hypoxia. However, these measurable changes in color vision due to hypoxia were not perceived by the subjects. Bierman A, LaPlumm T, Rea MS.

However, hoist operator training programs are relatively underdeveloped in comparison to helicopter pilot training. It is critical that this simulator teaches the necessary skills for high-level performance given the dangers associated with helicopter hoist operation. As a result, we sought to validate and identify critical aspects of skilled hoisting. METHODS: Through expert consultation, we identified several measures of hoist operation, such as mission time, cable plumb, cable tension, cable hand position, and cable displacement. We compared hoist performance between experienced and novice hoist operators in a simulated hoisting mission with two levels of difficulty (with and without wind). The experienced group (eight men/one woman) was composed of nine active or former military hoist operators who were working in commercial search and rescue. The novice group was composed of seven subjects (two men/five women) from the general population and had no previous experience with hoisting operations or the simulator. RESULTS: We found that experienced hoist operators had faster mission time, similar cable plumb, lower tension, and less variable hand position. Further, experienced hoist operators pulled the cable inward in the wind while novice hoist operators pushed the cable away. DISCUSSION: These findings suggests that this simulator captures performance differences between skill levels and, as a result, is a first step supporting the use of this simulator for hoist operator training.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Remotely guided ultrasound (US) examinations carried out by nonmedical personnel (novices) have been shown to produce clinically useful examinations, at least in small pilot studies. Comparison of the quality of such exams to those carried out by trained medical professionals is lacking in the literature. This study compared the objective quality and clinical utility of cardiac and pulmonary US examinations carried out by novices and trained physicians. METHODS: Cardiac and pulmonary US examinations were carried out by novices under remote guidance by an US expert and independently by US trained physicians. Exams were blindly evaluated by US experts for both a task-based objective score as well as a subjective assessment of clinical utility. RESULTS: Participating in the study were 16 novices and 9 physicians. Novices took longer to complete the US exams (median 641.5 s vs. 256 s). For the objective component, novices scored higher in exams evaluating for pneumothorax (100% vs. 87.5%). For the subjective component, novices more often obtained clinically useful exams in the assessment of cardiac regional wall motion abnormalities (56.3% vs. 11.1%). No other comparisons yielded statistically significant differences between the two groups. Both groups had generally higher scores for pulmonary examinations compared to cardiac. There was variability in the quality of exams carried out by novices depending on their expert guide. CONCLUSION: Remotely guided novices are able to carry out cardiac and pulmonary US examinations with similar, if not better, technical proficiency and clinical utility as US trained physicians, though they take longer to do so.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Frequent migraine headaches are disabling and aeromedically disqualifying. Four new monoclonal antibody medications, targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2018, with more expected in the coming years. These medications present new alternatives for the treatment of migraine unresponsive to other therapeutic and prophylactic agents. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 45-yr-old commercial pilot who presented with migraine headaches increasing in frequency to 1315 per month in spite of the use of propranolol for prophylaxis and sumatriptan for abortive treatment of the headaches. Upon presentation, he was not flying due to his frequent headaches and he was started on monthly subcutaneous injections of fremanezumab. Following his second injection, his headaches stopped entirely, and he has continued on the medication and not experienced another migraine headache. He underwent an aeromedical neurology evaluation and consideration for Authorization of Special Issuance of Medical Certificate, which was granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). DISCUSSION: This is the first case to our knowledge of the successful use of an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody medication in an active pilot. The pilot appears to be a super responder to the medication, having achieved complete remission of a nearly life-long condition. Though only a small portion of treated individuals will see this sort of response, these medications represent an effective additional option for migraine prophylaxis in the pilot population.

On the French Mediterranean coast, rescue is made offshore mainly by a French Navy Dauphin or at a landing zone by an emergency unit EC 135 helicopter. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed diving accidents evacuated by helicopter on the French Mediterranean coast from 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2016. We gathered data at the Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Diving Expertise (SMHEP) of the Sainte-Anne Military Hospital (Toulon, France), the 35 F squadron at Hyres (France) Naval Air Station, and the SAMU 83 emergency unit (Toulon, France). RESULTS: A total of 23 diving accidents were evacuated offshore by Dauphin helicopter and 23 at a landing zone on the coast by EC 135 helicopter without hoist. Immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) accounted for one-third of the total diving accidents evacuated by helicopter with identified causes. It was responsible for at least half of the deaths at the dive place. A quarter of the rescued IPE victims died because of early cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION: Helicopter evacuation is indicated when vital prognosis (IPE and pulmonary overpressure in particular) or neurological functional prognosis (decompression sickness) is of concern. IPE is the primary etiology in patients with serious dive injuries that are life-threatening and who will benefit from helicopter evacuation. A non-invasive ventilation device with inspiratory support and positive expiratory pressure must be used, in particular for IPE. Corgie L, Huiban N, Pontier J-M, Brocq F-X, Boulard J-F, Monteil M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: NASA has been making efforts to assess the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) washout capability of spacesuits using a standard CO 2 sampling protocol. This study established the methodology for determining the partial pressure of inspired CO 2 (P I co 2 ) in a pressurized spacesuit. We applied the methodology to characterize P I co 2 for the extravehicular mobility unit (EMU). METHODS: We suggested an automated and mathematical algorithm to find the end-tidal CO 2 and the end of inspiration. We provided objective and standardized guidelines to identify acceptable breath traces, which are essential to accurate and reproducible calculation of the in-suit inhaled and exhaled partial pressure of CO 2 (Pco 2 ). The mouth guard-based method for measurement of inhaled and exhaled dry-gas Pco 2 was described. We calculated all individual concentrations of P I co 2 inhaled by 19 healthy subjects classified into 3 fitness groups. The transcutaneous Pco 2 was monitored as a secondary measure to validate washout performance. RESULTS: Mean and standard deviation values for the data collection performance and the CO 2 metrics were presented (e.g., minimum time weighted average Pco 2 at suited workloads of resting, 1000, 2000, and 3000 (BTU h 1 ) were 4.75 1.03, 8.09 1.39, 11.39 1.26, and 14.36 1.29 (mmHg s 1 ). All CO 2 metrics had a statistically significant association and all positive slopes with increasing metabolic rate. No significant differences in CO 2 metrics were found between the three fitness groups. DISCUSSION: A standardized and automated methodology to calculate P I co 2 exposure level is presented and applied to characterize CO 2 washout in the EMU. The EMU has been operated successfully in over 400 extravehicular activities (EVAs) and is considered to provide acceptable CO 2 washout performance. Results provide a basis for establishing verifiable Pco 2 requirements for current and future EVA spacesuits. Kim KJ, Bekdash OS, Norcross JR, Conkin J, Garbino A, Fricker J, Young M, Abercromby AFJ.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nutcracker syndrome is caused by a rare anatomic variant where the left renal vein is trapped between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. Posterior nutcracker syndrome is an even rarer entity, characterized by the retro-aortic positioning of the renal vein, causing compression between the aorta and spinal vertebrae. Symptoms include microscopic or frank hematuria, flank pain, varicocele, pelvic congestion syndrome, and abdominal pain. A search of the literature did not reveal prior cases of nutcracker syndrome that became symptomatic and diagnosed secondary to the unique stressors of high gravitational force (G force) in the aviation environment. CASE REPORT: A 25-yr-old man training as an F-16 flight test engineer presented with left scrotal/testicular pain, varicocele, and intermittent gross hematuria. After an extensive workup, he was diagnosed with posterior nutcracker syndrome and underwent a left varicocele ligation with spermatic cord denervation. He was eventually able to be returned to flying duties with limitation to non-high performance aircraft. DISCUSSION: This case is particularly unique as its diagnosis was dependent on exposure to high G force conditions that may have otherwise remained asymptomatic without this environmental stressor. Education on the diagnosis of nutcracker syndrome as a differential in the setting of hematuria and pain is an important lesson learned. This case also illustrates the necessity of considering the effects of the stressful environment of high G force on even overall healthy individuals. Fortunately, due to the collaboration of medical-surgical expertise and familiarity with the requirements for operational readiness, this patient was able to resume his aviation career, albeit in a different capacity compatible with his condition.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The vestibular system is important in the pathogenesis of seasickness. Our objective is to investigate whether routine vestibular tests detect seasickness. METHODS: Included were 17 professional naval personnel (mean age of 29.76 4.73 yr) diagnosed as having seasickness and 29 healthy age- and gender-matched controls. Cervical (c) vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) and ocular (o) VEMP and bithermal caloric tests were performed after ear, nose, and throat examination, pure tone audiometry, and magnetic resonance imaging. Severity of seasickness was evaluated based on the Graybiel scale. P1 latency, N1 latency, P1N1 amplitude, and interaural asymmetry ratios (IAR) of cVEMP and oVEMP were compared between the patients and control groups. Abnormal findings in the caloric test were noted. Presence of an abnormality in any of the three vestibular tests (cVEMP, oVEMP, or caloric test) was accepted as a positive vestibular finding. RESULTS: According to the Graybiel Scale, severe malaise and frank sickness were observed in 3 patients (18.7%) and 13 patients (81.3%), respectively. Graybiel scoring could not be performed in one patient due to general discomfort and bad general condition. In the caloric test, each of three patients (17.65%) showed canal paresis, an incomplete test because of severe nausea, and vomiting and hyperactive response. There were no significant differences in P1 latency, N1 latency, P1N1 amplitude, or IAR of cVEMP and oVEMP ( P &gt; 0.05). There were three patients (17.65%) and two patients (11.76%) who had abnormal IAR for cVEMP and oVEMP, respectively.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In their seminal work, McGuire and colleagues reported an increased incidence of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in a cohort of U2 pilots and hypobaric chamber personnel. WMH burden was higher in U2 pilots with previous reports of decompression sickness (DCS), and McGuire's reports have raised concerns regarding adverse outcomes in the aftermath of hypobaric exposures. Accordingly, a NATO working group has recently revised its standard recommendations regarding hypobaric exposures, including measures to mitigate the risk of WMH. Mandatory recovery time for up to 72 h between repeated exposures has been suggested on the basis of experimental evidence. However, we argue that the evidence is scarce which supports restricting repeated exposures to mitigate WMH. It is plausible that WMH is correlated with DCS and emphasis should be made on limiting the duration of exposures rather than restricting short and repeated exposures. The profiles in the NATO recommendations are meant to mitigate the risk of DCS. Still, they will potentially expose NATO Air Force and Special Operations personnel to flight profiles that can give rise to DCS incidence above 35%. Awaiting reliable data, we recommend limiting the duration of exposures and allowing for short repeated exposures. Ottestad W, Hansen TA, Ksin JI.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypobaric decompression sickness remains a problem during high-altitude aviation. The prevalence of venous gas emboli (VGE) serves as a marker of decompression stress and has been used as a method in evaluating the safety/risk associated with aviation profiles and/or gas mixtures. However, information is lacking concerning the variability of VGE formation when exposed to the same hypobaric profile on different occasions. In this paper, intra-individual test-retest variation regarding bubble formation during repeated hypobaric exposures is presented. The data can be used to determine the sample size needed for statistical power.METHOD: A total of 19 male, nonsmoking subjects volunteered for altitude exposures to 24,000 ft (7315 m). VGE was measured using ultrasound scanning and scored according to the Eftedal-Brubakk (EB) scale. Intraindividual test-retest variation in bubble formation (maximum VGE) was evaluated in subjects exposed more than once to hypobaric pressure. The statistical reliability was examined between paired exposures using the Intraclass Correlation test. G*Power version 3.1.9.6 was used for power calculations.RESULTS: During repeated 20-30 and 70-min exposures to 24,000 ft, 42% (N = 19, CI 23-67%) and 29% (N = 7, CI 5-70%) of the subjects varied between maximum EB scores < 3 and ≥ 3. The sample size needed to properly reject statistical significance of 1 EB step nominal difference between two paired exposures varied between 29-51 subjects.CONCLUSION: The large intraindividual test-retest variations in bubble grades during repeated hypobaric exposures highlight the need for relatively large numbers of subjects to reach statistical power when there are no or small differences in decompression stress between the exposures.Ånell R, Grönkvist M, Eiken O, Elia A, Gennser M.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Airline cabin crew experience high levels of fatigue and sleepiness. Whether these are solely related to their work schedules/jetlag or are in part related to individual factors is unknown. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the aviation industry and many cabin crew have been grounded. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the causes of fatigue and sleepiness in this population.METHODS: An online anonymous survey was distributed in April-June 2020 to cabin crew who were 1) flying, 2) grounded but doing alternative work, and 3) grounded, not working, or unemployed. The survey measured fatigue, sleepiness, and mental health. It also screened their risk for insomnia, depression, and shift work disorder and assessed drug and caffeine use.RESULTS: Collected were 409 valid responses: 45 currently flying; 35 grounded but doing alternate work; and 329 not working. On average, all three groups experienced normal levels of fatigue and sleepiness. The risk for major depressive disorder was 27.4%, with 59.5% of individuals reporting abnormal levels of anxiety. Caffeine intake and the use of drugs and alcohol to facilitate sleep were common, although not different between those currently flying vs. grounded.CONCLUSIONS: With reduced workloads or not flying, cabin crew reported lowered fatigue and sleepiness compared to prepandemic findings, along with reduced risk for major depressive disorder. However, a high occurrence of negative emotional states were reported, potentially related to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. This study suggests fatigue and sleepiness is primarily related to airline operational rather than personal variables.Wen CC-Y, Nicholas CL, Howard ME, Trinder J, Jordan AS.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The applicants' self-declaration of medical history is crucial for safety. Some evidence indicates that under-reporting of medical conditions exists. However, the magnitude in a population of aviation personnel has not been reported earlier.METHODS: A total of 9941 applicants for medical certificate/attestation for aviation-related safety functions during the last 5 yr up to December 2019 were registered at the Civil Aviation Authority Norway. E-mail addresses were known for 9027 of these applicants, who were invited to participate in a web-based survey.RESULTS: Among the 1616 respondents, 726 (45%) were commercial pilots, 457 (28%) private pilots, 272 (17%) air traffic controllers, and the remaining were cabin crew or crew in aerodrome/helicopter flight information service (AFIS or HFIS, respectively). A total of 108 were initial applicants. The age group 50+ constituted the largest proportion of respondents (53%). Aeromedical certification in general was believed to improve flight safety \"to a high\" or \"very high extent\" by 64% of the respondents. A total of 188 individuals (12%) admitted having under-reported information related to one or more categories, including mental (3%) or physical health (4%), medications (2%), and drug use, including alcohol use (5%). Among these, 21 participants believed their own under-reporting \"to some\" or \"to a high extent\" affected flight safety. In total 50% of noninitial applicants reported that they knew colleagues who had under-reported information. Analyses revealed that being a commercial pilot showed a higher risk for under-reporting compared with other classes and the perception of aeromedical examiners in a supportive or authoritative role reduced the risk.CONCLUSIONS: Under-reporting of medical conditions could be significant in aviation. Further studies should be conducted to investigate the true extent of under-reporting and its impact on flight safety and what mitigating measures might be recommended.Strand T-E, Lystrup N, Martinussen M.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by disrupted sleep and excessive daytime fatigue. Associated cognitive and psychomotor decrements pose a threat to aviators' performance and flight safety. Additionally, the longer term health effects associated with the disease can jeopardize an aviator's career and negatively impact operational outputs. This study reviews OSA prevalence, related comorbid conditions in Army aviators, and analyzes the aeromedical dispositions of affected individuals.METHODS: The U.S. Army Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office (AERO) database was interrogated for all cases of OSA from June 2005 through June 2015 using ICD-9 code 327.23. Prevalence rates for OSA and other comorbid conditions were then calculated using the total number of aviators in the AERO database.RESULTS: A total of 663 unique instances of OSA were found among the aviator population (N = 24,568), giving a point prevalence of 2.69%. Four cases affected women. Mean age of initial presentation was 42.62 yr and mean Body Mass Index was 28.69. The top five most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension, lumbago, degeneration of a lumbar or lumbosacral intervertebral disc, PTSD, and testicular hypofunction.DISCUSSION: Prevalence of OSA among aviators is lower than the general population but is not uncommon. A positive diagnosis requires a waiver or can result in suspension if not managed effectively, potentially leading to a reduction in aviator numbers. Aggressive health promotion and robust medical surveillance and aeromedical disposition management by the aeromedical community is essential to reduce OSA numbers, maintain aviator health, and maximize flight safety.Goldie C, Stork B, Bernhardt K, Gaydos SJ, Kelley AM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to traumatic events could increase post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) risk among enlisted U.S. Army drone operators. Published research on PTSD risk in this population is unavailable. METHODS: We used a combined medical and administrative longitudinal dataset to examine adjusted associations between drone operator service among U.S. Army enlisted members and three PTSD indicators: whether screened via the PTSD Checklist – Civilian (PCL-C); PCL-C scores; and incident PTSD diagnoses. We compiled summary statistics for and conducted tests of differences in independent variable distributions when comparing drone operators and others. Two multivariable survival regression models and an ordinary least squares model were used to estimate adjusted associations. RESULTS: There were 1.68 million person-years of observed time in the study population ( N = 678,548; drone operator N = 2856). Compared to other servicemembers, the adjusted likelihood of undergoing PTSD screening was 35% lower [95% confidence interval (CI) for the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.56–0.76]. Among subjects who took the PCL-C, scores did not differ significantly on the basis of drone operator service (adjusted change: −1.26 points; CI: −3.41–0.89). The adjusted hazard of receiving a PTSD diagnosis was 34% lower among drone operators (CI: 0.54–0.80). DISCUSSION: These findings provide reassurance that enlisted U.S. Army drone operators are not at increased risk of PTSD. Further research is needed in order to identify the mechanisms of the decreased PTSD risk observed, and whether other or longer-term mental health risks are present among those in this occupation.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accidents during start-up and shut-down procedures of aircraft can lead to fatalities or destroyed aircraft. Start-up procedures for propeller aircraft include the possibility of hand-propping, which may increase the occurrence of injuries from propeller strikes. METHODS: A set of 142 accidents from a 10-yr period were selected from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board online database. Only fixed-wing aircraft in the “standing” phase of flight were included in the dataset. The significance of differences was determined using Pearson’s Chi-squared analysis. RESULTS: The severity of the injuries sustained in the accidents were inversely related to the amount of damage to the aircraft. Hand-propping without properly securing the aircraft was more likely to result in substantial damage to the aircraft. Pilots with less than a thousand hours of flight experience were significantly more likely to use an incorrect hand-propping procedure. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended to make the advisory on hand-propping a regulatory article of the Federal Aviation Administration so that pilots’ knowledge of this procedure is mandatory and part of their initial training, especially securing the aircraft during hand-propping. Highlighting throttle positions in both regular and hand-propping procedures may optimize checklist design and further mitigate accidents during start-up procedures. de Voogt AJ, Kalagher H, Burns S.

The current study sought to test the relationship between sleep and soldier performance during infantry battle drill training, a more naturalistic measure of performance. METHODS: Subjects in the study were 15 junior Special Operations infantry soldiers. Soldiers wore an actigraph and reported their subjective sleep duration and quality prior to close quarter battle (CQB) drills. Experienced leaders monitored each iteration of the CQB exercise and recorded the number of errors committed. RESULTS: The number of errors committed during the live ammunition iterations was negatively correlated with subjective number of hours slept and subjective sleep efficiency/quality during the month prior. Soldiers with subjective sleep duration ≥7 h had a significantly lower number of errors than soldiers with subjective sleep duration &lt;7 h (1.71 vs. 0.63 errors), and soldiers with sleep quality &lt;85% committed more errors than those with sleep quality ≥85% (1.50 vs. 0.40 errors). DISCUSSION: These data preliminarily suggest that sleep quality and duration may influence subsequent performance on infantry battle drill training, particularly for soldiers with limited experience in battle drill conduction who have not yet perfected battle drill techniques. Future studies should enact sleep augmentation to determine the causal influence of sleep on performance in this setting. Mantua J, Shevchik JD, Chaudhury S, Eldringhoff HP, Mickelson CA, McKeon AB.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced a protocol to evaluate pilots with insulin treated diabetes mellitus (ITDM) for special issuance (SI) medical certification for first-/second-class pilots. The protocol’s aim is improved assessment of ITDM control/hypoglycemia risk and relies on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. This study compares the characteristics of first-/second-class pilots with ITDM and certification outcome. METHODS: Data was collected retrospectively from the FAA Document Imaging Workflow System (DIWS) for pilots considered for a first-/second-class SI under the ITDM program between November 2019 and October 2021. Inclusion criteria required submission of information required for certification decision (SI vs. denial). We extracted data on demographics and CGM parameters including mean glucose, standard deviation, coefficient of variance, time in range (%), time &gt; 250 mg · dl −1 (%), and time &lt; 70–80 mg · dl −1 (%). We compared these parameters between pilots issued an SI vs. denial with Mann-Whitney U-tests and Fisher exact tests using R. RESULTS: Of 200 pilots with ITDM identified, 77 met inclusion criteria. Of those, 55 received SIs and 22 were denied. Pilots issued SI were statistically significantly older (46 vs. 27 yr), had a lower hemoglobin A1c (6.50% vs. 7.10%), lower average glucose (139 mg · dl −1 vs. 156 mg · dl −1 ), and spent less time with low glucose levels (0.95% vs. 2.0%). DISCUSSION: The FAA program has successfully medically certificated pilots with ITDM for first-/second-class. Pilots granted an ITDM SI reflect significantly better diabetes control, including less potential for hypoglycemia. As this program continues, it will potentially allow previously disqualified pilots to fly safely. Stanwyck LK, DeVoll JR, Pastore J, Gamble Z, Poe A, Gui GV.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accident analysis and empirical research have shown that the decision-making process of pilots after becoming lost is adversely affected by confirmation bias; this constitutes a serious threat to aviation safety. However, the underlying mechanism of confirmation bias in the context of lost procedures are still unclear. METHODS: This study used scenario-based map-reading tasks to conduct two experiments to explore the mechanism of confirmation bias in the lost procedures. In Experiment 1, 34 undergraduate students and 28 flying cadets were enrolled in a formal experiment to examine the effects of verbal-imagery cognitive style, experience level, and their interaction on confirmation bias. In Experiment 2, we further explored the influence of strategy as a core component of experience on confirmation bias with 26 flying cadets. RESULTS: The study found that individuals were subject to confirmation bias in lost procedures. Visualizers (M = 0.78, SD = 0.75) were almost twice as likely to select the disconfirmatory features than verbalizers (M = 0.37, SD = 0.49). Visualizers exhibited a lower degree of confirmation bias than verbalizers, and experience helps verbalizers to reduce their degree of confirmation bias. The protective effect of experience mainly lies in individuals’ choice of strategy. DISCUSSION: Future aviation safety campaigns could be aimed at adopting a candidate selection process that focuses more on psychological attributes by testing for cognitive style, and enriching individual experience through adequate training. Such measures would reduce confirmation bias. Xu Q, Wang M, Wang H, Liu B, You X, Ji M. Cognitive style and flight experience influence on confirmation bias in lost procedures .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND:The challenges of climate change and increasing frequency of severe weather conditions has demanded innovative approaches to wildfire suppression. Australia's wildfire management includes an expanding aviation program, providing both fixed and rotary wing aerial platforms for reconnaissance, incident management, and quick response aerial fire suppression. These operations have typically been limited to day visual flight rules operations, but recently trials have been undertaken extending the window of operations into the night, with the assistance of night vision systems. Already a demanding job, night aerial firefighting operations have the potential to place even greater physical and mental demands on crewmembers. This study was designed to investigate sleep, fatigue, and performance outcomes in Australian aerial firefighting crews.METHODS:A total of nine subjects undertook a 21-d protocol, completing a sleep and duty diary including ratings of fatigue and workload. Salivary cortisol was collected daily, with additional samples provided before and after each flight, and heart rate variability was monitored during flight. Actigraphy was also used to objectively measure sleep during the data collection period.RESULTS:Descriptive findings suggest that subjects generally obtained >7 h sleep prior to flights, but cortisol levels and self-reported fatigue increased postflight. Furthermore, the greatest reported workload was associated with the domains of 'performance' and 'mental demand' during flights.DISCUSSION:Future research is necessary to understand the impact of active wildfire response on sleep, stress, and workload on aerial firefighting crews.Sprajcer M, Roberts S, Aisbett B, Ferguson S, Demasi D, Shriane A, Thomas MJW.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Teleoperation enables performing tasks in hazardous or inaccessible environments. The relationship between spatial ability and teleoperation performance has been extensively studied; however, relatively few studies have considered examples wherein the specific influence mechanism between the two is examined. This study aims to explore how individuals' spatial ability affects teleoperation performance.METHODS: Forty subjects completed teleoperated expedition and escape tasks in a virtual unfamiliar environment according to the assigned requirements. After each expedition task, subjects' mental model about the unfamiliar environment was evaluated. The escape task performance was measured in terms of path length, completion time, and the number of collisions. The impact of spatial ability on escape task performance wherein mental model as a mediator was examined. The Bootstrapping method was used to examine the hypothesis regarding the mediating role of mental model in the influence of spatial ability on teleoperation performance.RESULTS: Subjects with higher spatial ability exhibited significantly better mental models and had fewer collisions. In addition, subjects with better mental models had significantly shorter path lengths and spent marginally less time on escape. In general, the mental model appeared important for path length and completion time, but not collisions.CONCLUSIONS: The combined results of the two tasks preliminarily proved that spatial ability affected path length of the escape task through the mental model after the exploration task. The findings are expected to aid in astronaut selection and teleoperation training for space station missions.Pan D, Liu D, Tian Z, Zhang Y.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac injury in trauma patients can be secondary to either blunt or penetrating trauma and is a significant cause of death. The commonest etiological factors for blunt cardiac injury include motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush or blast injuries. The incidence of blunt cardiac injury following falls is reported to be between 5 and 50%. CASE REPORT: A combat pilot lost his life in an aircraft accident. Although he had ejected successfully just before the aircraft caught fire and his parachute had deployed fully, it was engulfed in the ball of fire rising up from the burning aircraft wreckage, causing the parachute to burn up. As a result, the pilot had a free fall from an estimated height of 70–80 ft (21–24 m). Autopsy revealed a ruptured right atrium and endocardial tears at the right atrioventricular junction. The left side of the heart and the coronary arteries were unscathed. The histopathological finding showed evidence that the cardiac injuries sustained were antemortem. The cause of death was ascertained to be due to cardiac rupture, leading to hemorrhagic shock. DISCUSSION: Cardiac rupture in this case appears to be a case of the ‘water hammer’ effect, the right atrium being the commonest site of blunt cardiac rupture. It is possible that the individual landed on his feet after his parachute got burnt in the ball of fire and the violent compression of the lower limb and abdominal veins, caused by the sudden hyperflexion of the lower limbs over the abdomen, caused the cardiac rupture in this case. CONCLUSION: The possibility of blunt cardiac trauma should always be kept in mind while dealing with survivors of ejection at low levels. Sharma MD, Gupta N, Rajkumar T, Sharma A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: For future long-duration spaceflight missions, additional methods of loading the skeleton may be required to supplement exercise to minimize bone loss. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can elicit muscular contractions that create strain on bone. However, the potential effectiveness of NMES on the proximal femur during disuse is not known.METHODS: We measured the maximum isometric force of NMES-induced contractions of the rectus femoris and the hamstrings of 10 subjects (5 male, 5 female), sitting with the hips and knees at 90 degrees of flexion. We employed 2-D biomechanical models of the knee and hip to estimate the hip joint reaction forces, applied these forces to a generic femur finite element analysis model, and qualitatively compared the peak principal strains of the proximal femoral neck to the peak strains modeled in previous studies for other forms of exercise.RESULTS: The average peak tensile/compressive strains were 1380 ± 719 µε/-2179 ± 1130 µε and 573 ± 345 µε/-900 ± 543 µε for the male and female subjects, respectively. While results varied between studies, the strains achieved during NMES generally were comparable to those achieved during walking or stairs, with some individuals matching higher intensity activities.DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated that isometric NMES contractions of the thigh muscles can create strain in the proximal femoral neck similar to that achieved during low impact activities. While NMES alone will unlikely create a sufficient daily strain stimulus to prevent bone loss, it will likely improve the current spaceflight countermeasures by adding more frequent loading throughout the day.Abitante TJ, Bouxsein ML, Duda KR, Newman DJ.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND : Weightlessness results in negative physiological changes. Excessive iron in organisms likewise leads to numerous damages. In this study, we investigated the effect of a combination of iron overload and weightlessness simulated by tail-suspending on rats. METHODS : Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control (CON), iron overload (IO), simulated weightlessness (SW), and iron overload plus simulated weightlessness (IO+SW). After the experiment, the rats were evaluated through routine blood, serum ferritin, histology, and micro-computed tomography analyses. RESULTS : As compared to CON, a combination of IO and SW resulted in a 15.9% loss of rat bodyweight versus treatment with each alone (3.3% in IO, 11.7% in SW group). Although iron overload is mainly responsible for an increase in hemoglobin (4.7% in IO the group) and serum ferritin (71.7% in IO group) concentration, simulated weightlessness facilitates such increase (5.3% and 118.4% in IO + SW group, respectively). Similarly, iron overload resulted in severe iron deposition on the liver and spleen, and the deposition became more serious in the combined model. In contrast, the simulated weightlessness is mainly responsible for the damage to the femur. DISCUSSION : All the results demonstrated that the combined conditions exhibited a significantly different effect on rats from those with either simulated weightlessness or iron overload alone, and that these different effects are organ-dependent.Wang A, Zang J, Wang J, Nie G, Zhao G, Chen B.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hiking and trekking often occur at altitudes up to 12,000 ft altitude. The hypoxia-induced hyperventilation at altitude paradoxically reduces arterial CO 2 (P a co 2 ). A reduction in P a co 2 results in vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the brain and thus in local hypoxia. The local hypoxia likely affects cognitive function, which may result in reduced performance and altitude accidents. Recent publications have demonstrated that voluntary isocapnic hyperventilatory training of the respiratory muscles (VIHT) can markedly enhance exercise endurance as it is associated with reduced ventilation and its energy cost. VIHT may be useful in blunting the altitude-induced hyperventilation leading to higher P a co 2 and improved cognitive function. METHODS: This study examined the effects of VIHT, compared to control (C) and placebo (PVIHT) groups, on selected measures of executive functioning, including working memory and processing speed (i.e., Stroop Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and Digit Span Forward) at simulated altitude up to 12,000 ft. Associated physiological parameters were also measured. RESULTS: The Digit Span Forward Test did not show improvements after VIHT in any group. The VIHT group, but not C or PVIHT groups, improved significantly (17–30%) on the Stroop Test. Similarly the VIHT group, but not the C and PVIHT groups, improved correct responses (26%) and number of attempts (24%) on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test. In addition, reaction time was also improved (16%). CONCLUSION: VIHT improved processing speed and working memory during exercise at altitude.Quackenbush J, Duquin A, Helfer S, Pendergast DR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, Army aircrews needing refractive correction are issued the HGU-4/P aviator spectacles. However, a recently published survey found dissatisfaction with the current spectacle frame. The Aircrew Flight Frame (AFF) has been used by the Air Force for over 14 yr, with the AFF-OP (Operational) style used the longest. The purpose of this study was to evaluate AFF-OP performance and compatibility among U.S. Army aircrew under operational conditions. METHODS: At 1-, 6-, and 12-wk intervals, 73 Army aircrew members wore the AFF-OP eyewear and completed a Likert scale survey. There were 14 outcome measures surveyed, with the main outcome measure being frame preference. RESULTS: The AFF-OP was preferred significantly more than the HGU-4/P spectacle. Overall, 94% of aircrew responses preferred the AFF-OP and the three highest subjective reasons for AFF-OP preference were: 1) comfort around the ears without helmet or headset; 2) comfort around the ears with helmet or headset; and 3) the effect on ear cup seal. There were no statistically significant differences in responses over the three surveyed time intervals. DISCUSSION: Army aviation aircrew preferred the AFF-OP over the current HGU-4/P spectacles. Two of the top three highest subjective reasons for AFF-OP preference coincided with two of the top three operational eyewear problems reported in the recently published survey. If Army aircrew do not wear their issued eyewear, they may purchase their own frame “out of pocket.” However, this can lead to use of a frame that has not been tested for compatibility and may compromise performance of aircrew life support equipment.Walsh DV, Jurek GM, Capó-Aponte JE, Riggs DW, Ramiccio JA.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2012 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare produced a report titled ‘Dementia in Australia.’ 2 The report noted that the number of people with dementia in Australia would reach almost 400,000 by 2020. Australia is a jurisdiction which does not impose a mandatory retirement age for pilots. With an aging population it was hypothesized that conditions such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) were likely to be seen more commonly by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). It was decided that this was an appropriate time to retrospectively study the data held by CASA. METHODS: An interrogation of CASA databases was undertaken. Data was produced comparing percentage of Class 1 certificate holders over 60 yr of age against time. A cohort of pilots and controllers with PD was identified. The history of the cases was reviewed. RESULTS: The study confirms that the pilot population is aging in line with population trends. Over a period from 1992 to 2012, 22 cases of pilots and controllers with PD were identified. DISCUSSION: The study confirmed that PD will be of increased relevance over the next decade. Gaps between policy and practice managing past cases were identified. Updated guidelines have been published aiming to address the deficiencies identified in the study. Historically pilots and controllers have been able to maintain certification for an average of 3.75 yr. This information should be of benefit to clinicians, pilots, and controllers when considering occupation and treatment options.Clem PA, Navathe PD, Drane MA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Our prior publication suggested that elevated serum concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was protective against the development of acute mountain sickness (AMS) while an inflammatory response was contributory to its development. The use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase inhibitors (“statins”) may be of interest to those traveling to altitude—these medications will lower serum LDL concentrations, but are also reported to have anti-inflammatory properties. METHODS: Prior to flying from sea level to the South Pole (∼10,498.7 ft or 3200 m) during the austral summer months of 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, the 248 subjects provided informed consent. Questionnaires related to AMS symptoms, acetazolamide use, personal history, and anthropometrics were paired with results from blood samples. Statin use was reported by six subjects who were matched for age, sex, altitude of residence, and acetazolamide use with seven subjects not using a statin. RESULTS: No significant differences were identified in any of the matched variables between the groups. No statin users reported symptoms of AMS while 57% of participants not using a statin did report AMS symptoms ( P = 0.03). No significant difference was noted between LDL levels in the statin group (108.3 ± 61.0) as compared to the group not taking statins (104.6 ± 22.1) ( P = 0.88). DISCUSSION: Our previous results suggested that elevated LDL was protective while an inflammatory response was contributory with respect to AMS development. The present results suggest that statin use may provide protection against AMS symptoms, possibly through an anti-inflammatory property, despite its lipid-lowering capacity.Harrison MF, Johnson BD.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Modern super agile fighter aircraft are capable of producing an increasing multiaxial acceleration environment which can adversely affect the pilot. An evaluation of the performance of the restraint system during flight maneuvers will benefit restraint designs and, thus, the safety of pilots. METHODS: A finite element model of a mannequin with PCU-15/P harness restraint was used in this study to investigate how the factors, such as strap material stiffness, friction, and belt tension, affect the performance of restraint systems during impact along the −G x , −G y , and −G z directions. The corresponding maximum displacement of the mannequin's torso was computed. RESULTS: The mannequin moved beyond 74 mm sideways. The change in friction coefficient (FC) from 0.1 to 0.4 decreased the displacement of the lower torso by less than 6.7%. The displacement of the torso decreased as the stiffness of the strap or tension increased. Displacement decreased by 9.3%, 6.0%, and 2.7% for the lower torso under the G x impact, as the tightening force increased from 20 N to 80 N gradually. However, this changed slightly when the stiffness arrived at 1 E or the tension increased to 60 N. DISCUSSION: PCU-15/P harness has the poorest performance during side impact and friction plays an unimportant role in affecting its performance. The stiffness of the webbing used in the PCU-15/P harness is sufficiently high. The lap belt has more effect on limiting the movement of the pilot than the shoulder straps, and a tension of 60 N during the adjustment may be enough for conventional flight maneuvers.Du C-F, Liu X-Y, Wang L-Z, Liu S-Y, Fan Y-B.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute and chronic spinal symptoms such as neck pain may limit flying performance significantly and disqualify the pilot from flight duty. Mechanical neck pain is very common among pilots because of their exposure to vibration, +G Z forces, helmet weight, poor neck posture during air combat maneuvers, previous neck injuries, and poor treatment plans for such injuries. Successful treatment of such injuries requires appropriate therapeutic procedures as well as an aeromedical assessment. The aim of this case study was to demonstrate the benefits of conservative procedures such as spinal manipulation and mobilization therapy (SMMT) and exercise therapy (ET) in treating chronic mechanical neck pain in an Iranian commercial helicopter pilot. CASE REPORT: A 36-yr-old male patient presented to the clinic with moderate, intermittent nonradicular chronic neck pain and limited range of motion over a 2-yr period. The patient was treated with cervical and upper thoracic SMMT followed by home ET for 5 wk. After this period, the patient reported significant recovery and improvement in range of motion in his neck. DISCUSSION: Mechanical neck pain is very common among helicopter pilots. Although Air Force and Navy waiver guides recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well as SMMT and ET, there are currently very few published studies that examine the benefits of manual and exercise therapy for treating mechanical neck pain in commercial and military pilots. Based on the results of this study, it seems that SMMT and ET may be a safe and effective in treatment of uncomplicated mechanical neck pain in helicopter pilots.Alagha B.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an emerging esophageal disease associated with dysphagia and food impaction. Practice guidelines have only recently been developed. It affects 1/1000 individuals, predominantly young men. As this demographic represents a substantial portion of the military aviation population, aerospace medicine clinicians should be familiar with this diagnosis when evaluating dysphagia or impactions. CASE REPORT: A 23-yr-old Caucasian man, a U.S. Air Force air traffic controller, presented to Flight Medicine following an episode of food impaction requiring evaluation in the local emergency department. The patient reported a 5-yr history of recurrent episodes of food lodging in his throat, requiring fluid and body repositioning for resolution. Medical history was significant for eczema. Upper endoscopy revealed an abnormal esophagus with macroscopic features of EoE and biopsies were also consistent with EoE. After further work-up, the patient was diagnosed with EoE and treated. Significant symptom improvement was noted after 2 mo of therapy. DISCUSSION: This case outlines the evaluation of food impaction as well as the diagnostic criteria for EoE, which is a disease that affects patients with demographics common to the military aviation community. As the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for EoE are relatively new, it may easily be overlooked by the primary care physician, causing a delay in subspecialist consultation, thus delaying treatment. EoE is a condition with symptoms that pose high risk to the performance of aircrew duties; therefore, flight surgeons must be familiar with the aeromedical standards that accompany this diagnosis.Cochet AA Jr, Cochet AE, Francis JM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hind limb unloading (HU) is one of the ground-based models of simulated microgravity. As bacterial and viral infections could affect the immune system, the immunologic effect of HU should be studied in a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) laboratory. However, a review of the literature did not reveal any studies on the immunologic effects of prolonged HU in a murine model of allergic disease. Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of HU in a murine model of allergic asthma in a SPF laboratory. METHODS: Twenty BALB/c mice were allocated equally to Group A (control group), Group B (HU group), Group C (allergic group), or Group D (allergic + HU group). Weight gains, serum total and ovalbumin (OVA)-specific IgE, titers of IL-1, IL-5, IL-10, and IFN-γ in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and histopathologic findings of the lungs were compared. RESULTS: After 2 wk of HU, Group D showed significantly more weight loss (−2.0 ± 0.2 g) than Group C (−1.1 ± 0.4 g). Groups B and D showed significant increases in serum OVA-specific IgE as compared with Groups A and C. Group D had significantly lower titers of IL-5 (Group C: 53.0 ± 15.2 pg · ml −1 , Group D: 21.9 ± 13.9 pg · ml −1 ), IL-10 (Group C: 430.8 ± 138.3 pg · ml −1 , Group D: 217.6 ± 51.2 pg · ml −1 ), and IFN-γ (Group C: 104.3 ± 37.5 pg · ml −1 , Group D: 36.7 ± 12.8 pg · ml −1 ) in BAL fluid than Group C. Peri-bronchiolar and pulmonary infiltrations of inflammatory cells were significantly greater in Group D than in Group C. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged HU may cause significant weight loss and aggravate disease courses.Jang TY, Heo M-J, Jung A-Y, Kim YH.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study investigated whether the timing of activation affects the utility of an emergency underwater rebreather unit (RBU) when submerged in cold water. METHOD: On two successive occasions, 16 male UK Royal Marines were submerged in stirred water at 12.2°C for up to 78 s. The subjects were lowered (taking 18 s) into the water in a seated position and were instructed to take a large breath in, activate the unit, breath-hold for as long as possible, exhale into the unit, and breathe normally to and from the unit for the remainder of submersion. On one occasion the subjects were instructed to activate the RBU when the water reached chest height (Condition-1) and, on the other, prior to the feet entering the water (Condition-2). Measurements were made of the duration of breath-hold, rebreathing and submersion, exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations, skin temperature, and heart rate. RESULTS: In 16 of the 32 submersions, the breath-hold was released before the subject became fully submerged and in 8 submersions the subject requested early withdrawal from the water. Mean (SD) breath-hold duration was 14.0 (13.8) s and the duration of rebreathing was 45.9 (21.9) s. The duration of breath-hold once completely submerged was longer in Condition-1 (9.1 s) than Condition-2 (4.1 s). CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates the RBU should be activated just before the mouth becomes submerged rather than before entering the water, and that the RBU will prolong underwater stay time, thereby increasing survival prospects.House CM, Shaw AM, Roiz de Sa DG.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since 2004, in the United States, light sport aircraft (LSA) and some aircraft with standard airworthiness certificates can be operated for recreational purposes with a valid state driver’s license rather than a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-issued aeromedical certificate. There have been recent efforts to allow operation of much larger, heavier, faster, and more complex aircraft without requiring a medical certificate. The primary objective of this research was to compare hazards to flight safety identified in fatally injured pilots required to possess a valid FAA third-class medical certificate to hazards in fatally injured pilots who were not required to possess a valid medical certificate. METHODS: A search of all fatal U.S. aircraft accidents in the FAA Medical ANalysis and TRAcking (MANTRA) registry between January 1, 2011, and April 30, 2014, identified 1084 individuals. A review of accident pilots’ medical, autopsy, and toxicological data was conducted. After applying exclusion criteria, 467 pilots remained, including 403 medically certified and 64 medically uncertified pilots. RESULTS: A significant difference was found in a surrogate measure for risk between medically certified and uncertified pilots (25% vs. 59%). This difference remained significant after adjustment for age. No significant difference was found in the proportions of hazards identified on toxicological review. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the risk of an adverse medical event is reduced in pilots required to possess a valid medical certificate.Ricaurte EM, Mills WD, DeJohn CA, Laverde-Lopez MC, Porras-Sanchez DF.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Apache pilots needing refractive correction are issued modified HGU-4/P aviator spectacles. However, a recently published survey found field of view (FOV) dissatisfaction with the current spectacles when sighting in with a Helmet Display Unit (HDU). A current Air Force flight frame was modified in-lab and the purpose of this study was to evaluate the FOV with the current Apache flight frame vs. the modified flight frame. METHODS: Recruited were 21 Apache pilots to assess FOV under three conditions: 1) wearing the current Apache frame; 2) wearing the modified Apache frame; and 3) wearing no frame. The main outcome measure was total FOV of four quadrants tested: superior left (45°); superior right (135°); inferior right (225°); and inferior left (315°). RESULTS: No significant differences in FOV were seen between the two frames tested while wearing the current Apache helmet ( P = 0.33) and the new Apache helmet ( P = 0.64). However, there were significant differences in FOV between the no frame condition and the two frame conditions tested with both helmets ( P &lt; 0.001). DISCUSSION: No significant differences in FOV were seen between the two frames tested while wearing either Apache helmet. However, with both helmets there were significant differences in FOV between the no frame condition and the two frame conditions tested. This suggests that wearing no eyewear is still optimal in integrating the HDU device. With advances in contact lens technology, future research can study the viability of the latest generation of multifocal contact lenses with Apache aviators.Walsh DV, Jurek GM, McLean WE, Statz JK, Allen RL, Riggs DW.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Barotrauma is a frequent problem in aviation medicine. Eustachian tube dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of barotrauma. Function of the Eustachian tube can be indirectly assessed by multifrequency tympanometry, which provides valuable information about the resistance and permeability of the middle ear in a wide frequency range. The aim of this study was to research whether multifrequency tympanometry could be used for assessing middle ear impairments in pilots. METHODS: There were 140 pilots and pilot candidates between the ages of 20–55 with normal otoscopic examination who were evaluated by audiological test batteries. Body mass index values, flight hours, audiometric pure tone thresholds, tympanometry and multifrequency tympanometry test results were noted. RESULTS: There was statistically significant decrease in the multifrequency tympanometry measurements of the left and right ears of the pilots with 200–3000 flight hours compared to pilot candidates, and similarly, the pilots with 3000–10,000 flight hours compared to pilot candidates. DISCUSSION: Multifrequency tympanometry values changed between pilot candidates and pilots. However, the values of multifrequency tympanometry did not change due to flight hours. This test battery should not be used for follow up of pilots in the clinic.Tuncer MM, Babakurban ST, Aydin E. Middle ear resonance frequency in pilots and pilot candidates.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arterial gas embolism (AGE) is a rare condition in the flying community most often only ever seen in flight while operating at high altitude or incidents involving hypobaric chambers. This article describes a severe case of AGE that occurred in a pilot of a fourth generation fighter aircraft at ground level. The environmental control system (ECS) malfunctioned, causing an overpressurized cockpit and a subsequent explosive decompression when the pilot opened the canopy to egress. CASE REPORT: The ECS onboard fourth generation fighter aircraft is composed of many computer-controlled subsystems. When these components fail, the system can potentially overpressurize the cockpit. Combined with opening the canopy without prior venting, this overpressurization can lead to a situation akin to a diver surfacing too quickly. A pilot experienced this scenario and subsequently developed symptoms of arterial gas embolization—one form of decompression illness (DCI). We reviewed the design of the environmental control system and recommend that the cockpit must be slowly depressurized to decrease risk of injury from rapid decompression. DISCUSSION: Literature review showed three similar cases of ground-based overpressurization causing AGE symptoms, although these cases were maintenance personnel intentionally testing aircraft cabin integrity and not associated with aircraft intending flight. 7 The lessons learned from this case can be used to identify and hopefully prevent severe DCI from ground level cockpit overpressurization and to further general understanding of aircraft ECS.Zhang JX, Berry JR, Beckstrand DP.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), which has the characteristics of a serous retinal detachment (SRD) in the macular area, affects mostly men in the 30- to 50-yr age range. Some patients have persistent SRD, which may cause retinal thinning and photoreceptor impairment. CSC symptoms are gradual vision loss and/or metamorphopsia. Some commercial airline pilots are concerned about CSC symptoms, which can disqualify them from flying for months and can also reoccur. Thus, careful monitoring and treatment of CSC are critical for pilots, especially those with chronic or recurrent CSC. The Federal Aviation Administration requires uncorrected distant visual acuity in the better eye to be 20/200 or better, with correction to 20/20 or better employing lenses of no greater power than ± 3.5 diopters spherical equivalent. Multimodal imaging modalities such as spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) allow early detection of CSC noninvasively. Moreover, half-dose verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) can cure CSC in the early stage. CASE REPORTS: Five male Japanese commercial airline pilots with CSC are presented. Four of these five pilots had been disqualified from flying for several months, but after receiving half-dose PDT, they were ultimately able to resume flying commercial aircraft. DISCUSSION: Half-dose PDT can rapidly reduce serous subretinal fluid in CSC eyes. Recurrent and/or chronic CSC is seen in clinical cases. Therefore, continuous observation by SD-OCT after half-dose PDT is essential, even if the patient's vision recovers. Early, i.e., before visual acuity decreases, treatment is highly recommended.Shinojima A, Mori R, Fujita K, Yuzawa M. Treatment and monitoring of central serous chorioretinopathy in pilots .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To measure nitrogen (N 2 ) wash-out and uptake requires elaborate set-ups, especially when doing the measurements at increased or decreased ambient pressure. Here we present a transportable device for quantifying N 2 turnover in humans which can be used at different ambient pressures. METHODS: A modified close-circuit electronic rebreather was used to assess N 2 turnover. Changes in N 2 volume within the rebreathing circuit, reflecting N 2 uptake or washout, were derived from the continuously monitored total system volume and the calculated volumes of oxygen and water vapor. The calculation of continuous N 2 volume curves was performed off-line using dedicated computer software. RESULTS: Four subjects participated in the proof-of-concept tests. At steady state, the drift in calculated N 2 volume in the rebreathing circuit over a 1-h duration was minimal. Three of the subjects participated in additional N 2 steady-state measurements where 1019 mL (BTPD) of N 2 was injected into the rebreathing circuit over 20 min and the measured volume increase was 1006 ± 32 mL. Lastly, N 2 elimination was assessed during decompression to 0.5 atm and while breathing hyperoxic gas. N 2 uptake was measured during compression to 1.8 atm. The elimination and uptake curves were deemed to be realistic. DISCUSSION: A method for assessing N 2 turnover in humans has been developed and a first evaluation has been performed. It is easy to work with operationally and can be used at different ambient pressures. More research is needed in order to further validate it as a method for assessing N 2 turnover in humans.Sundblad P, Frånberg O, Siebenmann C, Gennser M.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ethyl acetate is a simple organic compound that occurs naturally and is used industrially as a solvent. It has been detected in the ISS atmosphere and is known to off-gas from building materials. As NASA astronauts have been and will be exposed to ethyl acetate during space missions, Spaceflight Maximum Allowable Concentrations (SMACs) were developed following an extensive review of the available literature. METHODS: Toxicological data relevant to SMAC development was collected from electronic databases using principles of systematic review, and from previous assessments and reviews of ethyl acetate. RESULTS: From an initial pool of over 35,000 studies, 10 were identified as studies appropriate to support SMAC development. The toxicological properties of ethyl acetate are relatively straightforward. Ethyl acetate is rapidly absorbed and converted by carboxyesterases to ethanol. At concentrations on the order of 400 ppm for 4–8 h, most volunteers experienced mild irritation but no lasting effects. In subchronic animal studies, mild sedative effects and changes in body weight and weight gain were observed at 750 ppm and above. DISCUSSION: Numerous studies were identified to support the development of both short- and long-duration SMACs. No chronic studies were available, but the high quality of the subchronic studies and the short half-life of ethyl acetate support extrapolation to longer durations. Williams ES, Ryder VE.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A flight trial was conducted to determine whether breathing 60% oxygen during high performance flight maneuvers using contemporary pilot flight equipment induces atelectasis and to explore whether cabin altitude had any influence on the extent of atelectasis identified. METHODS: On 2 separate days, 14 male aircrew flew as passengers at High [14,500–18,000 ft (4420–5486 m)] and Low [4000–6000 ft (1219–1829 m)] cabin pressure altitude in a Hawk T Mk1 aircraft breathing 60% oxygen. Sorties comprised 16 maneuvers at +5 G z , each sustained for 30 s. Lung volumes (spirometry), basal lung volume (electrical impedance tomography, EIT), and peripheral oxygen saturation during transition from hyperoxia to hypoxia (pulmonary shunt fraction) were measured in the cockpit immediately before (Pre) and after (Post) flight. RESULTS: Forced inspiratory vital capacity (FIVC) was significantly lower Postflight after High (−0.24 L) and Low (−0.38 L) sorties, but recovered to Preflight values by the fourth repeat (FIVC4). EIT-derived measures of FIVC decreased after High (−3.3%) and Low (−4.4%) sorties but did not recover to baseline by FIVC4. FIVC reductions were attributable to decreased inspiratory capacity. S p o 2 was lower Postflight than Preflight in High and Low sorties. DISCUSSION: Breathing 60% oxygen during flight results in a 3.8–4.9% reduction in lung volume associated with a small decrease in blood oxygenation and an estimated pulmonary shunt of up to 5.7%. EIT measures suggest persisting airway closure despite repeated FIVC maneuvers. There was no meaningful influence of cabin pressure altitude. The operational consequence of the observed changes is likely to be small. Tank H, Kennedy G, Pollock R, Hodkinson P, Sheppard-Hickey R-A, Woolford J, Green NDC, Stevenson A.

We also briefly document the stability of a pre-existing pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy (PPE) in the macula of his left eye (OS) during this mission. CASE REPORT: Ocular examination, including refraction, slit lamp examination, macular examination by optical coherence tomography (OCT), and tonometry were performed before and after his mission and he was questioned regarding visual changes during each portion of his flight. DISCUSSION: We documented no change in ICL position during his spaceflight. He reported stable vision during liftoff, entry into microgravity, 12 d on the ISS, descent, and landing. Our results suggest that the modern ICL with a central port is stable, effective, and well tolerated during short duration spaceflight.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A diagnosis in acute abdomen may remain elusive especially when the cause is rare. We report this interesting case of a fighter pilot presenting with acute abdominal pain. The case posed significant challenges in reaching the correct diagnosis of abdominal crunch syndrome. The syndrome is rare with only seven reports in the literature so far. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever report of this condition in an aircrew. CASE REPORT: A 37-yr-old pilot presented with severe upper abdominal pain and sweating. During examination, he developed bradycardia and was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Investigations revealed no myocardial ischemia on ECG, transaminitis, raised CPK, CKMB, and LDH. A CECT scan of chest and abdomen was normal. A GI surgery consult was sought where we connected the transaminitis and raised CPK and considered the possibility of rhabdomyolysis. On specific inquiry, the aviator gave history of unaccustomed exercise with a vigorous session of abdominal crunches a day prior. Thus, a diagnosis of abdominal crunch syndrome was concluded. DISCUSSION: The aviator did not associate his vigorous exercise with the occurrence of pain and, therefore, did not mention it. It would have avoided unnecessary investigations and delay in treatment. From the aeromedical safety aspect, had the aviator flown on the day he developed pain, there was a possibility of developing severe pain exacerbated by the G force and G suit and sudden in-flight incapacitation. From the perspective of the aircrew, it is advisable that they avoid sudden, unaccustomed exercise. Kumar A, Kaistha S.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As part of a larger project to provide recommendations regarding limitations and best practices for shifting aviators from day to night operations, a study was conducted to assess the efficacy of high energy visible (HEV) light to shift the circadian rhythm in humans. The study attempted to replicate the patterns of military aviators who could be required to shift abruptly from day to night flight operations. METHODS: Simulated flight performance and salivary melatonin levels of 10 U.S. military aviators were collected over a 3-night period using a within-subject dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) study design. Data were collected in a laboratory with participants returning home to sleep following each of the three evenings/nights of data collection. Light treatment included a single 4-h exposure of blue-enriched white light (∼1000 lux) on night 2. Data collected included melatonin levels, light exposure, sleepiness, cognitive workload, and simulated flight performance. RESULTS: The average delay in melatonin onset was 1.32 ± 0.37 h (range: 53 min to 1 h 56 min). Sleepiness ( P = 0.044) and cognitive workload ( P = 0.081) improved the night following the light treatment compared to the baseline. No systematic differences were identified in flight performance. DISCUSSION: The HEV light treatment successfully delayed the circadian phase of all participants even though participants’ ambient light levels (including daylight) outside the laboratory were not controlled. These findings were used to develop circadian synchronization plans for aviators who are asked to transition from day to night operations. These plans will be assessed in a follow-on study in an operational unit. Shattuck NL, Matsangas P, Reily J, McDonough M, Giles KB.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Computerized color contrast sensitivity (CS) tests that aim to determine presence, type, and severity of color vision deficiency have been developed and are available, but data on agreement between tests is lacking. The purpose of the present study was to determine data agreement between three computerized color vision tests.METHODS: A total of 50 subjects, 25 color vision normal (CVN) and 25 color vision deficient (CVD), were tested with the Konan CCT-HD®, NCI, and a modified version of the Innova CCT. Sensitivity and specificity were compared across systems as well as differences in log CS values and how these relate to standards used to classify occupational performance.RESULTS: Each test showed 100% sensitivity for detection of hereditary red-green CVDs as well as type (protan vs. deutan). Each test showed 100% specificity for confirming normal red-green color vision in CVNs. Innova CCT and NCI showed 100% specificity in CVNs and CVDs for S cone CS. Konan CCT-HD® showed 96% specificity in CVNs and 92% in CVDs for S cone CS.DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that each test reliably identifies hereditary CVD and confirms normal color vision. However, the three tests differ slightly in log CS values used to determine pass/fail scores of red-green color vision using a 100-point scale, and all show that protans consistently score lower than deutans on cone CS. Hence, depending on the criterion used in occupational settings, a single score may not prove equitable for individuals who have a protan deficiency.Lovell J, Rabin J.

METHOD: The General Civil Aviation Authority database was searched for all reported temporary suspensions of license between 2018–2021 and the ICD-10 codes were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 1233 incapacitations was reported with a mean license suspension of 148.4 ± 276.8 d. The mean days of suspension for the various medical specialties were 115.2 ± 188.4 for musculoskeletal conditions ( N = 392), 189.3 ± 324.8 for medicine ( N = 335), 101.6 ± 231.4 for surgery, 109.4 ± 223.5 for urology ( N = 93), 90.3 ± 128.7 for ophthalmology ( N = 68), 385.6 ± 594.3 for psychiatry ( N = 61), 150.4+285.9 for ENT ( N = 59), 419.4 ± 382.6 for obstetrics and gynecology ( N = 30), and 44.9+39 for dermatology ( N = 21).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent and often associated with chronic hypoxia. Previous studies have shown alterations of cerebral oxygenation and cardiac repolarization in COPD patients (GOLD stage II–IV). Airplane travel is common in patients with COPD; however, the clinical effects of a diminished oxygen partial pressure in aircraft cabin environments at cruising altitude remain elusive. The aim of this study was to assess changes of cerebral oxygenation as well as parameters of cardiac repolarization during a hypoxia altitude simulation combined with mild physical activity in these patients. METHODS: Patients with COPD and healthy subjects (10 per group) randomly selected from the Charité outpatient clinic conducted a hypoxia altitude simulation test which consisted of three phases. The regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO 2 ) of the frontal cortex was measured at rest using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Furthermore, oxygen saturation (S p O 2 ), blood pressure, and heart rate values, as well as a 12-lead-ECG, were recorded. Subsequently, a mild treadmill exercise program (25 W) was divided into 10 min of normoxia (pre-hypoxia), 30 min of mild hypoxia (F I O 2 = 0.15), followed by a second 10-min period of normoxia (post-hypoxia). Meanwhile, mentioned parameters were recorded in 2-min intervals. P, PQ, QRS, QT, QTc, QTd, T-peak-T-end interval (TpTe), and corrected TpTe (TpTec) were measured on three ECG complexes, each at baseline, at the end of the normoxic phase, and at the end of the hypoxic phase. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients with COPD and 10 control subjects were included in this study. S p O 2 was significantly lower in COPD patients throughout the whole test. Frontal cerebral rSO 2 was significantly lower in the left hemisphere during hypoxia altitude simulation in COPD patients (59.5 ± 8.5 vs. 67.5 ± 5.7). CONCLUSIONS: We show reduced left frontal cerebral oxygenation during hypoxia and mild exercise in patients with COPD, suggesting diminished altitude resilience and altitude capabilities. Preflight hypoxia assessment might be recommended to patients with severe COPD. Dehe L, Hohendanner F, Gültekin E, Werth G, Wutzler A, Bender TO.

We present two case reports of patients with the rare condition of facial nerve palsy occurring during aviation, along with a review of the literature, an overview of the phenomenon and the described symptoms of the cases. PubMed® including Medline® was searched using the terms nerve palsy and aviation with no restriction. In addition, two new cases of recurrent nerve palsy are described. CASE REPORTS: We describe two case reports: A 20-yr-old woman reported recurrent transient left-sided facial nerve palsy with increased duration and intensity on four subsequent flights, and a 35-yr-old woman who reported a left-sided transient facial nerve palsy 20 min after ascent. DISCUSSION: Included in the systematic review were 17 studies. Only case report studies were found. Including the two cases of facial nerve palsy described in this article, the reviewed studies represent 23 cases of peer-reviewed facial baro-palsy in aviation (ages 10 to 62 yr old). Having baro-palsy symptoms during flight is a rare condition, and the mechanism is not well understood. Some typical characteristics and possible mechanisms are discussed. PE tube insertion of the tympanic membrane has been found to be an effective treatment; however, further studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart rate (HR) indicates the number of beats per minute (bpm) of the heart, while heart rate variability (HRV) indicates the temporal fluctuation of the intervals between adjacent beats (NN). HRV expresses neuro-cardiac activity and is generated by heart-brain interactions and dynamics related to the function of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and other components (e.g., body and ambient temperature, respiration, hormones, blood pressure). We are carrying out a series of experimental investigations with the aim of studying HRV in student pilots during training. CASE REPORT: For this purpose, we used a Holter electrocardiograph equipped with three channels and five electrodes positioned on the chest of the subject who participated in our investigation. The case report refers to a student pilot who, during a flight mission with the instructor, had to face a forced landing and a flap failure. We report data based on analysis of the time domain and frequency domain related to operations on the ground before the flight, during the flight, and on the ground after the flight. DISCUSSION: Our initial conclusion is that the extent of HRV constitutes an “energy store” for better cardiac performance in eustress activities. During advanced tasks, the “Total Power” of the heart decreases because the RR intervals are forced toward low values, where the heart is less able to be modulated by its many controllers. Furthermore, this experimental protocol can be useful to flight instructors for the training process of student pilots.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recently, an analysis of Canadian seaplane accidents terminating in water (1995–2019) was conducted, but ultralight water accidents were excluded due to differences from general aviation operations. This is the first literature that reports a series of ultralight accidents that occurred in water. The purpose of this paper is to identify the circumstances surrounding ultralight water accidents in Canada and to identify actions with the potential to improve survival. METHODS: Ultralight water accidents that were reported to the Transportation Safety Board of Canada between 1990 and 2020 were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 1021 accidents that involved ultralights, 114 terminated in water, involving 155 occupants and 8 fatalities, yielding an occupant mortality rate of 5%. Of the accidents, 52% occurred during landing. There was less than 15 s warning in 78% of cases, which included five (63%) fatalities. The aircraft inverted in 40% of the accidents and, in 21%, it sank immediately. Loss of control was the terminal cause of the accident in 43% of cases, while adverse environmental conditions were reported in 38% of accidents. Little or no details were included on lifejacket or restraint harness use, status of emergency exits, water temperature, or occupant diving experience or underwater escape training. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in ultralight aircraft water accidents was less than half that of helicopter and seaplane ditchings, but the lack of warning time was similar. All pilots and passengers need to have a well-practiced survival schema before strapping in and can benefit from underwater escape training. MacDonald C, Brooks C, McGowan R, Rosberg A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: An episode of prolonged exposure to high altitude can cause hypoxia and have significant health consequences. In people with a high-altitude disorder, the body reacts by producing a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which triggers a series of physiological changes and serves a central role in the hypoxia response. Its activity is regulated by the oxygen-dependent degradation of the HIF-1α protein (HIF-1A gene). Therefore, the effects of low oxygen tension in high altitude were explored using fluorescent sensors of hypoxia. METHODS: The development of the sensor provided more sensitivity for detecting hypoxia by generating a calibration of optimized parameters such as reagent concentrations, reagent volumes, and device dimensions. RESULTS: There is a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting the changes of HIF-1α protein hypoxia using the feasibility hypoxia test. This would enable point-of-care (POC) testing and individual self-administration, resulting in faster and more accurate results that can be used for a robust diagnostic approach and enhanced health surveillance, particularly in high-altitude exposure.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aero-otitis media (AOM), also known as aural barotrauma or barotitis media, is categorized into primary AOM and secondary AOM. Because conservative treatment was ineffective, primary AOM was one of the main reasons for grounding. In 2014, the team successfully treated a pilot with primary AOM using balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET). Now, this case is reported. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 40-yr-old male transport pilot who joined a flight after catching a cold. During the descent, the right ear appeared to have stuffiness and hearing loss, accompanied by tinnitus and ear pain. The local hospital’s acoustic immittance test showed an “A” curve in the left ear and a “B” curve in the right ear. According to “secretory otitis media”, right tympanic membrane puncture and drugs were performed. After he recovered, he continued to fly, and the symptoms reappeared again. Then he was transferred to our hospital, and right BET was performed. Equalization of ear pressure in the hypobaric chamber returned to normal 2 mo after the operation. The pilot was found fit to fly. The pilot is still qualified, with more than 6000 h of flight time. DISCUSSION: AOM is linked to Eustachian tube dysfunction. BET has been a minimally invasive treatment of Eustachian tube lesions in recent years. If conservative treatments for primary AOM are ineffective, BET can be selected. While the postoperative symptoms disappeared, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and ear pressure function tests met the standards for the physical examination of pilots, allowing the determination of flight qualification.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aerobic exercise within the habitable volume of small spacecraft needed for space exploration beyond low Earth orbit is expected to challenge the capacity of environmental control systems. Moisture control is a primary concern. Crewmembers will contribute moisture to the cabin environment in the form of sweat while exercising. The effects of continuous aerobic exercise for improving and maintaining aerobic capacity is well characterized. Likewise, evidence suggests that high intensity interval exercise for shorter durations is also effective in building and maintaining aerobic capacity. METHODS: On separate days, measures of sweat and respiratory responses were made for continuous (30 min of steady state exercise at ∼75% of aerobic capacity) and two interval (4 × 4 min, 8 × 30 s) exercise protocols. RESULTS: We observed that the 4-min and 30-s interval protocols produce 16% and 66% less metabolic water loss vs. the continuous exercise protocol, respectively. These responses were highly correlated with the amount of work performed (R 2 = 0.81) and the amount of energy expenditure (R 2 = 0.83) during exercise. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that interval exercise may be a useful alternative to continuous aerobic exercise when metabolic water production is an environmental concern. The results may inform the choices of aerobic exercise countermeasure protocols for use in deep space exploration. Ryder JW, Crowell JB, Song HJ, Ewert M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although advanced coronary artery disease in young, healthy fighter pilots is uncommon, an acute cardiac event in flight could be catastrophic.CASE REPORT: After a gym workout, a 31-yr-old F-16 pilot reported severe central chest pain, one vomiting episode, and excessive sweating but no radiation of pain. Electrocardiograph showed ST elevation in V2-V6. Coronary arteriography showed a thrombotic lesion at the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery (90%) and one occluded LAD branch with thrombus; the rest of the arteries were normal and ejection fraction was 55%. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention to LAD with one drug-eluting stent was done. The pilot was discharged in stable hemodynamic condition with medication advice. Assessment revealed no significant cardiac risk factors. He did not seek medical care for two central chest pain episodes following a gym workout prior to this event because rest relieved the pain. He gave a history of using commercial protein supplements for bodybuilding in the past 6 yr.DISCUSSION: In this case report, the impact of aggressive gym workouts and chronic use of commercially available bodybuilding protein supplements on cardiovascular health is discussed, as well as aeromedical dilemmas related to this pilot's career. This case sparks debate about whether a highly motivated young pilot with an unexpected cardiac event should be subjected to regular intensive cardiac evaluation throughout his remaining flying career, with permanent flying limitations, or be motivated to pursue a career shift to facilitate noncomplicated career rehabilitation.Jeevarathinam S, Sabei SA, Wardi YA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The modern aircraft cockpit has evolved into a complex system of systems. Numerous performance evaluation metrics and techniques exist that can measure the effectiveness of cockpit components in terms of how they influence the human operator’s ability to perform tasks relevant to mission success. As no prior review of these metrics has been found in the literature, this effort attempts to do so, albeit without applying the metrics to a novel cockpit evaluation. METHODS: These metrics and techniques are discussed and presented in five defined categories as they relate to evaluating cockpit subsystems: ergonomics and anthropometrics; human-computer interaction; data management and presentation; crew resource management and operations; and ingress and egress. DISCUSSION: While this effort is significant and novel, it is not necessarily comprehensive. In conclusion, it is noted that no single holistic quantitative metric to evaluate cockpit design and performance yet exists. Utilizing some of the preexisting metrics presented to develop such a metric would be beneficial in efforts to evaluate aircraft cockpit designs and performance, as well as aiding future cockpit designs.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The advancement of human spaceflight has made urgent the need to develop medical imaging technology to ensure a high level of in-flight care. To date, only ultrasound has been used in spaceflight. Radiography has multiple advantages over ultrasound, including lower operator dependence, more rapid acquisition, typically higher spatial resolution, and characterization of tissue with acoustic impedance precluding ultrasound. This proof-of-concept work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of performing human radiographs in microgravity. METHODS: Radiographs of a phantom and human subject’s hand, knee, chest, cervical spine, and pelvis were obtained aboard a parabolic flight in microgravity and simulated lunar gravity with various subject and operator positions. Control radiographs were acquired with the same system on the ground. These radiographs were performed with a Food and Drug Administration-approved ultra-portable, wireless, battery-powered, digital x-ray system. RESULTS: The radiographs of the phantom acquired in reduced gravity were qualitatively and quantitatively compared to the ground controls and found to exhibit similar diagnostic adequacy. There was no statistically significant difference in contrast resolution or spatial resolution with a spatial resolution across all imaging environments up to the Nyquist frequency of 3.6 line-pairs/mm and an average contrast-to-noise ratio of 2.44. DISCUSSION: As mass, power, and volume limitations lessen over the coming decades and the miniaturization of imaging equipment continues, in-flight implementation of nonsonographic modalities will become practical. Given the demonstrated ease of use and satisfactory image quality, portable radiography is ready to be the new frontier of space medical imaging.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fatigue is a major contributor to aviation accidents. Sufficient sleep may be difficult to achieve under operational conditions in military aviation. Countermeasures include caffeine, however, studies evaluating its effects often do not represent daily practice with regular caffeine consumption. This study aims to establish the effect of caffeine on psychomotor performance in a realistic scenario (i.e., after a limited period of extended wakefulness). METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial included 30 aeromedically fit subjects. On trial days, subjects followed their normal routine till 17:00, after which caffeine intake was stopped. At midnight, subjects were given 300 mg of caffeine or placebo and performed the Psychomotor Vigilance Test, Vigilance and Tracking Test, and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale hourly up to 04:00 and again at 06:00 and 08:00. Four blood samples were collected. Statistical analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA or Friedman tests, marginal models, and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. RESULTS: Median time awake at midnight was 17 h (IQR 16.5–17.5 h). Performance decreased significantly less during the night in the caffeine condition versus placebo. Neither habitual intake nor daytime caffeine consumption affected this. No statistically significant correlation was identified between blood concentrations of caffeine and performance. DISCUSSION: A single dose of 300 mg of caffeine has beneficial effects on performance during the night in a realistic scenario for military aviation. Daytime caffeine consumption does not affect the effects of caffeine at night. These findings could be relevant for all industries in which optimal performance is required during nighttime after a limited period of extended wakefulness.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Wire strikes and in-air collisions with obstacles are a leading cause of accidents in the aerial application industry. While some of these collisions occur due to unseen obstacles, some pilots report being previously aware of the obstacles that they collide with. Whether or not pilots are aware of obstacles pre-collision is an important factor to inform methods of accident prevention.METHODS: Final reports from the National Transportation Safety Board were analyzed for Part 137 Agricultural Operation accidents that took place between January 2020 and December 2022. A deeper analysis of cases that involved an in-air collision with an obstacle was performed, excluding cases that were attributable to an external cause (e.g., aerodynamic stall). The pilot's awareness of the obstacle pre-accident was inferred from accident narratives if available.RESULTS: Nearly half of all accidents (N = 45 of 107) involved an in-air collision with an obstacle (e.g., wire, tree, pole) as the defining event. In cases where pilot awareness of the obstacle was determinable through the accident report, over half of pilots (N = 21 of 39) had previously seen this obstacle yet still made contact with it.DISCUSSION: In-air obstacle collisions make up a substantial portion of accidents within Part 137 Agricultural Operations. Nearly half of pilots were already aware of the obstacle before collision, indicating that inadequate preparation in scoping the field is not a predominant driver of these events. Instead, these findings suggest that other factors including distractions, high task difficulty, and errors in decision-making may contribute.Baumgartner HM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is often associated with decreased work performance and fatigue in civil pilots. However, aeromedical recommendations for the evaluation of EDS are associated with suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Currently, many studies have found an association between obesity and EDS, regardless of OSA. This study aims to determine whether there is a relationship between obesity and EDS in Indonesian civilian pilots, as well as its risks for developing OSA.METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design and was carried out at the Directorate General Civil Aviation Medical. Subjects were asked to fill out questionnaires, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to measure EDS and STOP-Bang to assess OSA risk, followed by anthropometric measurements for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference as obesity indicators.RESULTS: A total of 156 subjects were obtained, with an EDS prevalence of 16.7%. There was no significant relationship between obesity and EDS, but the prevalence of EDS was higher in obese subjects based on waist circumference than based on BMI (17.8% vs. 15.6%). Most obese pilots with EDS had a low risk of OSA (83.3% and 80%).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of EDS was found to be higher in pilots with central obesity compared to BMI-categorized obesity. The incidence of EDS was not correlated with the risk of OSA.Brahmanti RS, Sampurna B, Ibrahim N, Adi NP, Siagian M, Werdhani RA.

Deep space travel will include added risk related to stressors from the isolated, confined, and extreme environment that lies outside the boundaries of low Earth orbit. Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the standard of care for many mental health diagnoses, including anxiety and depression; however, SSRIs are also associated with several undesired side effects. The utility of nonpharmacological therapies for the management of behavioral health conditions has not yet been fully explored. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed. Relevant articles pertaining to the psychological impacts of isolated, confined, and extreme environments, use of SSRIs in spaceflight, side effects associated with SSRIs, and nonpharmacological treatments for anxiety and depression were reviewed. Over 70 studies were reviewed in total. RESULTS: Reduced bone mineral density, impaired hemostatic function, significant individual variability resulting from gene polymorphisms, and drug-drug interactions are well described adverse effects of SSRIs that may complicate their operational use in the deep space environment. Four alternative therapies for the treatment of anxiety and depression may show promise for long duration missions. DISCUSSION: Although SSRIs have long been considered standard of care treatment for many behavioral health conditions, we cannot trivialize the risk that prolonged pharmacological therapy may pose. The need to mitigate these risks by exploring alternative therapies has never been more relevant. El-Khoury BB, Ray KL, Altchuler SI, Reichard JF, Dukes CH.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Heart rate variability (HRV) indicates the temporal fluctuation of the intervals between adjacent beats. HRV expresses neuro-cardiac activity and is generated by heart-brain interactions and dynamics related to the function of the autonomous nervous system and other components. To investigate this issue, we started a series of experiments by coupling the flight tasks of student pilots and their HRV.METHODS: Before each experimental session, the participating student was fitted with a five-electrode, three-channel Holter electrocardiogram monitor. We defined three time-phases for each training mission: before flight operations on the ground, during flight operations, and after flight operations on the ground. The HRV analysis was performed by quantifying some indices of the time domain and the frequency domain.RESULTS: The analysis of RR-wave intervals revealed two types of trends: 1) students whose RR intervals decreased during flight operations compared to before flight ground operations; and 2) students whose RR intervals increased during flight operations compared to before flight ground operations. These differences found in the RR intervals produced changes in the indices of both the time and frequency domains of the two students' samples.DISCUSSION: Flight training involves regular and advanced tasks and/or emergency situations. When this happens, the total power of the heart decreases because the RR intervals are forced toward low values. Flight activity involves continuous demanding tasks that can be potentially read by an analysis of the HRV; a high HRV ensures better management of tasks that require a greater commitment of cardiovascular function.Li Volsi G, Monte IP, Aruta A, Gulizzi A, Libra A, Mirulla S, Panebianco G, Patti G, Quattrocchi F, Bellantone V, Castorina W, Arcifa S, Papale F.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Motion sickness affecting military pilots and aircrew can impact flight safety and, if severe, can lead to disqualification from flight status. However, due to the common adverse effects of motion sickness pharmaceuticals (e.g., drowsiness), medication options are severely limited. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential utility of a nonpharmaceutical method for motion sickness prevention, specifically an osteopathic manipulative technique (OMT). METHODS: A novel OMT protocol for the reduction of motion sickness symptoms and severity was evaluated using a sham-controlled, counterbalanced, between-subjects study design. The independent variable was OMT treatment administered prior to the motion sickness-inducing procedure (rotating chair). The primary dependent measures were total and subscale scores from the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire. RESULTS: The OMT treatment group experienced significantly fewer gastrointestinal (mean scores postprocedure, treatment M = 20.42, sham M = 41.67) and sopite-related (mean scores postprocedure, treatment M = 12.81, sham M = 20.68) symptoms than the sham group while controlling for motion sickness susceptibility. There were no differences between groups with respect to peripheral and central symptoms. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the treatment may prevent gastrointestinal (nausea) and sopite-related symptoms (sleepiness). These preliminary findings support further exploration of OMT for the prevention of motion sickness. A more precise evaluation of the mechanism of action is needed. Additionally, the duration of the effects needs to be investigated to determine the usefulness of this technique in training and operational settings.

The present study analyzed German military aircrew with diagnosed CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome despite close medical monitoring with the intention to further optimize individual outcomes and aeromedical disposition. METHODS: The digital information systems of the German Air Force Centre of Aerospace Medicine were searched for pilots and nonpilot aircrew with CAD and/or myocardial infarction (MI). They were retrospectively analyzed for age at initial diagnosis, body mass index, cardiovascular risk factors, diagnostic procedures, treatment, and aeromedical disposition. RESULTS: Between February 1987 and March 2023, 126 aircrew, 55% pilots and 45% nonpilot aircrew, were identified with CAD and/or MI. An accumulation of two to six risk factors was found in 77% of both groups. Most pilots (54%) received conservative treatment, 44% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and 3% coronary artery bypass grafting. In the group of nonpilot aircrew, conservative treatment was performed in 47%, coronary intervention in 37%, and bypass grafting in 16%. A total of 45 pilots (65%) returned to flying duties, albeit 39 (57%) with restrictions. In the group of nonpilot aircrew, 31 (54%) returned to flying duties. DISCUSSION: A small group of aircrew developed CAD over the years, some with severe coronary artery stenoses and MI. Further optimization of individual prognosis and aeromedical disposition should aim at appropriate CAD screening and risk factor elimination.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone mineral density (BMD) is a measure of skeletal health that may foretell disorders like osteoporosis. METHODS: To reduce bone losses on Earth, treatments include exercise, diet, and drugs. Each impact osteoblast and osteoclast activity dictates skeletal remodeling and subsequent BMD changes. BMD loss is a concern during spaceflight. For astronauts, low BMD undermines in-flight tasks and compromises their postflight health. RESULTS: While bisphosphonates exhibited promise as an in-flight bone loss treatment, study results are mixed, and this class of drugs has numerous side-effects. While the role antiresorptive agents play in reducing BMD loss is discussed, this review focuses on exercise-induced strains and nutrition, two in-flight treatments without bisphosphonates’ side-effects. DISCUSSION: Evidence supports in-flight exercise and a healthy diet with vitamin D and Ca +2 supplementation to limit BMD loss. This review suggests how exercise and nutrition may limit BMD loss during spaceflight. Also discussed is an in-flight version of the inertial exercise trainer (IET; Impulse Technologies, Knoxville TN). By imparting high bone-strain magnitudes, rates, and frequencies with less mass, footprint, and power needs than other forms of in-flight resistance exercise hardware, the IET warrants inquiry for use aboard future long-term spaceflights.

METHODS: Four male astronauts on STS-69 (1995) and four on STS-72 (1996) were exposed on Earth to an acute sequential hypoxic challenge by breathing for 4 min 18.0%, 14.9%, 13.5%, 12.9%, and 12.2% oxygen–balance nitrogen. The 18.0% O 2 mixture at sea level resulted in an inspired O 2 partial pressure (P I o 2 ) of 127 mmHg. The equivalent P I O 2 was also achieved by breathing 26.5% O 2 at 527 mmHg that occurred for several days in μG on the Space Shuttle. A Novametrix CO 2 SMO Model 7100 recorded hemoglobin (Hb) oxygen saturation through finger pulse oximetry (S p o 2 , %). There were 12 in-flight measurements collected. Measurements were also taken the day of (R+0) and 2 d after (R+2) return to Earth. Linear mixed effects models assessed changes in S p o 2 during and after exposure to μG. RESULTS: Astronaut S p o 2 levels at baseline, R+0, and R+2 were not significantly different from in flight, about 97% given a P I o 2 of 127 mmHg. There was also no difference in astronaut S p o 2 levels between baseline and R+0 or R+2 over the hypoxic challenge.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Baro-otalgia is a common complaint among passengers in an aircraft, in particular those who had a recent upper respiratory tract infection. The underlying pathophysiology is secondary to unequal aeration of the middle ear cleft with the surrounding atmosphere and it can be explained using Boyle’s Law. We describe an unusual presentation of baro-otalgia in a pilot secondary to cholesteatoma obstructing the aditus despite normal middle ear pressure equalization provided by a grommet in the ear. CASE REPORT: A 26-yr-old pilot with a presenting complaint of conductive hearing loss was diagnosed and treated for congenital cholesteatoma. His hearing improved, but 4 yr later he developed ear pain during the cruising phase of flight at an altitude of 9144 m (30,000 ft) above sea level. This pain persisted until descent to 4876 m (16,000 ft). Despite insertion of a middle ear ventilating tube, he remained symptomatic, requiring further investigation. This led to the diagnosis of recurrent cholesteatoma obstructing the aditus to the mastoid cavity. Upon surgical removal of the cholesteatoma, symptoms resolved. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that the recurrent cholesteatoma caused obstruction to normal aeration of the mastoid air cells during the changing atmospheric air pressure, thus producing pain. This is akin to sinus barotrauma instead of the usual pathophysiology underlying barotitis.Govindaraju R, Adaikappan M, Rajagopalan R. Baro-otolagia secondary to cholesteatoma .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sinusoidal lower body negative pressure (SLBNP) has been used to investigate the cardiovascular response to slow periodic changes in blood shifts, but measurements of slow fluctuations take a long time if measured for each period of SLBNP separately. Our study aimed to investigate whether the cardiovascular responses to superimposed SLBNP (S-SLBNP), which is expected to reduce the measurement time, are different from responses measured individually. METHODS: S-SLBNP was configured by superimposing two conventional SLBNPs (C-SLBNP) at 180-s and 30-s periods in the pressure range from 0 to −25 mmHg. As the S-SLBNP has double the static load of C-SLBNP, we also used offset SLBNP (O-SLBNP), which has the same static load level as S-SLBNP. Heart rate (HR), thoracic impedance (Z 0 ), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured from 11 male subjects. The transfer functions of gains from MAP to HR (Gain-HR/MAP) and from Z 0 to HR (Gain-HR/Z 0 ) were calculated as indexes of arterial baroreflex and cardiopulmonary baroreflex regulation of HR, respectively. RESULTS: The Gain-HR/MAP in the 180-s period (2.11 ± 0.17 bpm/mmHg; mean ± SEM) was larger than that of the 30-s period (1.04 ± 0.09 bpm/mmHg); however, there was no significant difference between the SLBNP conditions. The Gain-HR/Z 0 in C-SLBNP (9.37 ± 1.47 bpm/ohm) was smaller than that of the other conditions [18.46 ± 2.45 bpm/ohm (O-SLBNP); 16.09 ± 2.29 bpm/ohm (S-SLBNP)]. DISCUSSION: Using S-SLBNP could reduce the measurement time needed to examine the arterial baroreflex. However, the cardiopulmonary baroreflex was modified by the static load of SLBNP.Ishibashi K, Oyama F, Yoshida H, Iwanaga K.

The clinical features include muscle fatigability as well as ocular, bulbar, and limb weakness, which can have implications on the role of a pilot or air traffic controller. This retrospective study reviewed the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (UK CAA) experience of myasthenia gravis. METHODS: A search of the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority medical records database from 1990 to 2016 identified 11 individuals with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Data were extracted for the class of medical certificate, age at diagnosis, symptoms, acetylcholine receptor antibody status, treatment, the time from diagnosis to loss of medical certification, and the reasons for loss of certification. RESULTS: There were two Class 1 certificate holders (for professional flying) and six Class 2 certificate holders (for private pilot flying) and three air traffic controllers. The mean and median ages at diagnosis were 53 and 57 yr, respectively, with a range of 28–67 yr. The mean and median intervals from diagnosis to loss of certification were 22 and 11 mo, respectively, with a range of 0 to 108 mo. CONCLUSION: The aeromedical implications of myasthenia gravis, including complications, types of treatment, and functional impact, are considered. A policy for medical certification following a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is proposed.Jagathesan T, O’Brien MD. Myasthenia gravis and its aeromedical implications .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Blood-injection-injury (B-I-I) phobia is capable of producing inaccurate hypoxic challenge testing results due to anxiety-induced hyperventilation. CASE REPORT: A 69-yr-old woman with a history of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, restrictive spirometry, exercise desaturation requiring supplementary oxygen on mobilizing, reduced DLco, and B-I-I phobia was referred for hypoxic challenge testing (HCT) to assess in-flight oxygen requirements. HCT was performed by breathing a 15% F I o 2 gas mixture, simulating the available oxygen in ambient air onboard aircraft pressurized to an equivalent altitude of 8000 ft. S p o 2 fell to a nadir value of 81% during HCT, although it rapidly increased to 89% during the first of two attempts at blood gas sampling. A resultant blood gas sample showed an acceptable Po 2 outside the criteria for recommending in-flight oxygen and a reduced Pco 2 . Entering the nadir S p o 2 value into the Severinghaus equation gives an estimated arterial Po 2 of 6 kPa (45 mmHg), which was felt to be more representative of resting values during HCT, and in-flight oxygen was recommended. DISCUSSION: While hyperventilation is an expected response to hypoxia, transient rises in S p o 2 coinciding with threat of injury are likely to be attributable to emotional stress-induced hyperventilation, characteristic of B-I-I specific phobia and expected during the anticipation of exteroceptive threat, even in normal subjects. In summary, should excessive hyperventilation be detected during HCT and coincide with transient increases in S p o 2 , HCT should be repeated using S p o 2 only as a guide to the level of hypoxemia, and S p o 2 maintained using supplementary oxygen in accordance with alternative methods described in guidelines.Spurling KJ, McGoldrick VP.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aircrew viewing eyepiece-injected symbology on color display night vision goggles (CDNVGs) are performing a visual task involving color under highly unnatural viewing conditions. Their performance in discriminating different colors and responding to color cues is unknown. METHODS: Experimental laboratory measurements of 1) color discrimination and 2) visual search performance are reported under adaptation conditions representative of a CDNVG. Color discrimination was measured using a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm that probes color space uniformly around a white point. Search times in the presence of different degrees of clutter (distractors in the scene) are measured for different potential symbology colors. RESULTS: The discrimination data support previous data suggesting that discrimination is best for colors close to the adapting point in color space (P43 phosphor in this case). There were highly significant effects of background adaptation (white or green) and test color. The search time data show that saturated colors with the greatest chromatic contrast with respect to the background lead to the shortest search times, associated with the greatest saliency. Search times for the green background were around 150 ms longer than for the white. Desaturated colors, along with those close to a typical CDNVG display phosphor in color space, should be avoided by CDNVG designers if the greatest conspicuity of symbology is desired. DISCUSSION: The results can be used by CDNVG symbology designers to optimize aircrew performance subject to wider constraints arising from the way color is used in the existing conventional cockpit instruments and displays.Liggins EP, Serle WP.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Many countries have developed their own airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) systems for use in surveying their territorial sky in real time. However, a review of the literature suggests that no studies have been conducted to analyze the cervical spine of pilots and air-controllers of AEW&amp;C aircraft. METHODS: The study subjects were 80 pilots and air-controllers of AEW&amp;C aircraft with a period of service of &gt; 1 yr and had data on physical examinations, simple radiographs and functional scores of the axial skeleton, and questionnaires about lifestyle and working conditions. Information about physical characteristics and experience of neck pain were collected. Functional scores including the neck disability index and short-form 36-item health survey were obtained. Radiological measurements were performed for the C2-7 Cobb angle and degree of forward head posture. RESULTS: Of the 80 subjects, 33 (41.3%) had experienced neck pain and 63 (78.8%) had impaired cervical lordosis. The results of functional and radiological evaluations were not significantly different between pilots and air-controllers. In multivariate analysis, only the age was significantly related to the occurrence of impaired cervical lordosis. However, there were no significant factors related to the occurrence of neck pain. DISCUSSION: The results of this study suggest that the working environment of pilots and air-controllers of AEW&amp;C aircraft has a negative effect on their cervical spine. Age seemed to be the most significant factor affecting the occurrence of impaired cervical lordosis in these subjects.Shin YH, Yun C, Han AH.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The U.S. Air Force performs more than 6000 aeromedical transport flights annually, both internationally and domestically. Many of these flights include patients requiring pain relief medications. The risk of side effects from such medications administered at altitude is unknown, but understanding these risks is vital when selecting the safest pain management strategies to achieve optimal postflight outcomes. METHODS: Using an evidence-based medication side effect risk assessment model, we compared our patient-centric approach to an aircrew-centric approach using medications approved for use in U.S. Navy aircrew. We then determined the patient-centric side effect risk of medications commonly used during Air Force aeromedical evacuation (AE). RESULTS: The patient-centric approach to medication side effect risk assessment demonstrates that the majority of medications currently approved for use during AE have an acceptable side effect risk for the patient (18/22, 82%). Four approved drugs displayed significantly elevated patient risk, with risk scores between 2.0- and 3.2-fold greater than the statistically determined upper allowable (“acceptable”) limit and between 1.2- and 2.0-fold above the upper control (“tolerable”) limit. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that pain management strategies during AE should be tailored individually to minimize the risk associated with pain medications administered en route.Huntsberger SA, Butler WP, Chapleau RR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Keratoconus is a progressive noninflammatory ectatic corneal dystrophy, characterized by corneal thinning and increased curvature with central or paracentral tapered protrusion. Such changes in corneal morphology induce irregular astigmatism and myopia, resulting in visual acuity impairment. This report assesses cases in which keratoconus is not an absolute disabling condition for civil aviation pilots. METHODS: Six cases of keratoconus in active pilots are presented. This report includes cases which were treated with crosslinking therapy and even corneal transplantation. In such cases, the civil aviation medical authority considered four aspects in the medical assessment: best corrected visual acuity, condition stability, risk of sudden incapacitation, and pilot category. RESULTS: Six civil pilots with ages between 19 and 45 yr of age presented with keratoconus in different stages. Using the Snellen scale, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured in 12 eyes, all of them having equal or better than 20/30 (20/20, N = 9; 20/25, N = 2; 20/30, N = 1). All of them are currently fit for aviation activity and have been given an aviation medical certificate with limitation of use of corrective lenses by the Brazilian Civil Aviation Authority (ANAC in Portuguese). Among these cases, there is a pilot who had undergone treatment with crosslinking therapy and another that had undergone corneal transplantation. DISCUSSION: These cases demonstrate that keratoconus is not always a disabling condition for civil aviation pilots. Nevertheless, it has to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.Rebello A, Rodrigues B, Pereira M. Keratoconus in civil aviation pilots in a report of six cases .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human performance modeling plays an important role in the design and management of human spaceflight missions. Previous studies reported that manual control task time increased in microgravity conditions. The current study aimed to find a modeling method that can quantify and predict the task time of spacecraft control panel operation in the simulated microgravity condition. METHODS: We proposed the application of a predetermined elemental task method together with an information processing time model to quantify both physical motion time and cognitive time. The time increment due to microgravity was hypothesized to be proportional to physical motion time. The total task time in the microgravity condition could be calculated as the model time from the normal ground condition plus the predicted time increment. Human data were collected from an experiment asking participants to perform six emergency operating procedure tasks in both normal ground and simulated microgravity conditions. RESULTS: The proposed method resulted in good fitness to human data in both conditions, as shown by both regression fitness (R 2 values = 0.99) and modeling error measures (root mean square error ≤ 3.3 s; mean absolute percentage error ≤ 16.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although the method has its limitations, the current findings suggest that it has value in aerospace human factors and ergonomics applications.Cao S, Zhang Y, Guo Y, Chen S.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ''Cannon ball'' opacities on chest X-rays are a common manifestation of hematogenous dissemination of a malignant tumor in the lungs. They indicate an advanced stage of disease with a very grim prognosis in terms of cure and survival. In aerospace medicine, this aspect means the patient is unfit for flight duties. Nonmetastatic etiologies of pulmonary nodules are rare. We report a case of cannon ball opacities discovered fortuitously during an admission visit. CASE REPORT: A 23-yr-old flight attendant candidate came to the Aeromedical Expertise Center of the Military Hospital in Rabat for medical evaluation. He had no previous medical comorbidities and was asymptomatic. The physical examination was unremarkable. Chest X-ray revealed multiple poorly defined pulmonary nodular opacities, without mediastinal widening. After excluding other possibilities, such as infection or malignancy, the diagnosis of a pseudotumoral form of thoracic sarcoidosis was established by clinical and radiological findings, supported by histopathologic analysis. DISCUSSION: The pseudotumoral form of sarcoidosis is rare. It is usually seen in young people who are asymptomatic. Chest X-ray shows bilateral nodular opacities of different sizes. CT scan shows snowballs, which may or may not manifest with air bronchogram or mediastinal lymph nodes. Laboratory investigations are nonspecific. Pulmonary functions are normal or may show a restrictive pattern. Evolution is spontaneously favorable and does not require any treatment in asymptomatic patients. Aeromedical fitness in sarcoidosis disease depends on several conditions. This observation affirms the benefit of routine chest X-ray during medical evaulations to detect possible entities that may endanger flight safety.Zerrik M, Echchachoui H, Iloughmane Z, El’mhadi C, Elkhader S, Benaissa L, Chemsi M.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A recent U-2 fatigue study, in which 10 subjects completed 2 simulated long-duration missions breathing either 100% oxygen or air in a hypobaric chamber, offered an opportunity to compare subjects’ pulmonary function before and after remaining seated in a confined cockpit for 12 h. METHODS: In one U-2 mission configuration, the subject wore a full pressure suit and breathed aviator’s breathing oxygen while chamber pressure was maintained at 4572 m (15,000 ft) above mean sea level. In the second mission configuration, subjects wore standard aircrew flight equipment and breathed air while chamber pressure was maintained at 2438 m (8000 ft) above mean sea level. Subjects’ pulmonary function was assessed before and after the mission using four metrics: forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, peak expiratory flow, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio. RESULTS: Subjects showed significant declines for all four pulmonary metrics (2.7%, 6.4%, 13.9%, and 3.5%, respectively) after 12 h seated in the cockpit in both full pressure suit and aircrew flight equipment conditions. DISCUSSION: While the declines at both altitudes amounted to modest percentages of subjects’ total pulmonary capacities, they emerged after a single, acute sedentary exposure and appear to be unrelated to the percentage of oxygen in the breathing gas. This might have operational implications in confined mission environments where physiological demands are interspersed with long periods of inactivity.Beer J, Dart TS, Fischer J, Kisner J.

    "abstract": "Pilot instrument monitoring has been described as \"inadequate,\" \"ineffective,\" and \"insufficient\" after multicrew aircraft accidents. Regulators have called for improved instrument monitoring by flight crews, but scientific knowledge in the area is scarce. Research has tended to investigate the monitoring of individual pilots when in the pilot-flying role; very little research has looked at crew monitoring, or that of the \"monitoring-pilot\" role despite it being half of the apparent problem.Eye-tracking data were collected from 17 properly constituted and current Boeing 737 crews operating in a full motion simulator. Each crew flew four realistic flight segments, with pilots swapping between the pilot-flying and pilot-monitoring roles, with and without the autopilot engaged. Analysis was performed on the 375 maneuvering-segments prior to localizer intercept.Autopilot engagement led to significantly less visual dwell time on the attitude director indicator (mean 212.8-47.8 s for the flying pilot and 58.5-39.8 s for the monitoring-pilot) and an associated increase on the horizontal situation indicator (18-52.5 s and 36.4-50.5 s).The flying-pilots' withdrawal of attention from the primary flight reference and increased attention to the primary navigational reference was paralleled rather than complemented by the monitoring-pilot, suggesting that monitoring vulnerabilities can be duplicated in the flight deck. Therefore it is possible that accident causes identified as \"inadequate\" or \"insufficient\" monitoring, are in fact a result of parallel monitoring.Jarvis SR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Incidental findings in brain and spine MRI are common. In aerospace medicine, pilot selection may be affected by improved sensitivity of modern MRI devices. We investigated the occurrence of medically unfit rates caused by incidental findings in military pilot applicants using a 3-Tesla scanner as compared to the outcomes of a lower field strength 1-Tesla device based on similar screening protocols. METHODS: A total of 3315 military pilot applicants were assessed by a standardized German Air Force Imaging Screening Protocol and retrospectively subdivided into two cohorts, one of which was assessed by 1-Tesla MRI (2012-2015; N 1782), while in the second cohort (2016-2019; N 1808), a 3-Tesla MRI was used. Cohorts were statistically analyzed relating to three entities of incidental findings: 1) intervertebral disc displacements, 2) intracerebral vessel malformations, and 3) other abnormal findings in the brain. RESULTS: Pooled prevalences of incidental findings in medically unfit applicants significantly increased by use of 3-Tesla MRI as compared to lower resolution 1-Tesla MRI. Regarding the spine, prevalences more than doubled (1.46 vs. 4.99%; P &lt; 0.05) for intervertebral disc displacements. Similarly, prevalences of cerebral vessel malformations as well as other abnormal CNS incidental findings considerably increased by use of 3-Tesla MRI (0.28 vs. 1.67%; P &lt; 0.05, and 5.12 vs. 9.80%; P &lt; 0.05). Effect sizes and correlations were substantial in all conditions analyzed (Cohens d &gt; 0.8; Pearsons r &gt; 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a strong dependency of incidental cerebrospinal findings on image resolution and sensitivity of MRI devices used for screening, which is enhanced by refined imaging protocols and followed by increased medical unfit rates in prospective aviators. Adjusted strategies in the assessment of such lesions are needed to redefine their natural history and physiological impact, and to optimize screening protocols for future pilot selection.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A topic in aviation medicine that attracts much attention from the scientific community as well as from the media concerns medical incidents on board commercial airline flights. It was noticed that many papers on the subject were written by authors whose specialization was outside that of aviation medicine and that they sometimes made basic errors concerning the application of scientific principles of the subject. A review was undertaken to determine if there were any patterns to the observed errors and, if so, to consider whether recommendations might be provided that could reduce their frequency. METHOD: A literature search was undertaken of MEDLINE using PubMed for English-only articles published between January 1, 1974, and February 1, 2019, employing the following search terms: air emergency, air emergencies, air passenger, air travel, aircraft, airline, aviation, commercial air, flight, and fitness to fly. In addition, other relevant papers held in the personal collection of the authors were reviewed. RESULTS: Many cases of misinterpretation or misunderstanding of aviation medicine were found, which could be classified into eight main categories: references; cabin altitude; pressure/volume relationship; other technical aspects of aircraft operations; regulations; medical events; in-flight deaths; and automated external defibrillator. CONCLUSION: Papers were identified as having questionable statements of fact or of emphasis. Such instances often appeared to result from authors being unfamiliar with the subject of aviation medicine and/or the commercial aviation environment. Simple steps could be taken by authors to reduce the future rate of such instances and recommendations are provided. Thibeault C, Evans AD.

Personality characteristics may play a key role in distinguishing those women who pursue a career as a special operations aircrew member and succeed in this pursuit. Having access to normative personality data can potentially support psychologists in assessing AFSOC female aircrew and subsequently making informed recommendations to leadership.

RESULTS: Results indicated significant differences between female AFSOC aircrew and female civilians on four of the five NEO Personality Inventory domains: Neuroticism ( M 74.9 vs. M 87.1), Extraversion ( M 123.7 vs. M 112.8), Openness to Experience ( M 122.6 vs. M 111.0), and Conscientiousness ( M 136.0 vs. M 120.6), respectively. The comparison between female AFSOC aircrew and male AFSOC aircrew revealed significant differences across three of the five domains: Neuroticism ( M 74.9 vs. M 65.1), Openness to Experience ( M 122.6 vs. M 115.0), and Agreeableness ( M 119.6 vs. M 112.7), respectively. DISCUSSION: Implications for assessment and interpretation of psychological testing are discussed. This paper provides a unique perspective and insight into those who pursue and excel in this career field. Identifying specific personality traits in our AFSOC female aircrew allows for tailored care and support when evaluating readiness in special operations aircrew for optimizing performance.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypobaric hypoxia training utilizing the environmental chamber is often preceded by prebreathing of 100% oxygen with the goal of reducing decompression illness (DCI). We aimed to study the impact of prebreathing 100% oxygen for 30 min prior to hypobaria exposure to 7600 m (25,000 ft) on the incidence rate of DCI, as well as the impact of prebreathing on hypoxia symptoms felt during training.METHODS: Records of participants who underwent hypobaric hypoxia training in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) from 2011 to 2014 (before introduction of prebreathing) were compared to those who underwent similar training from 2014 to 2017 (after introduction of prebreathing) to determine the incidences of DCI for both groups. Participants who underwent hypobaric hypoxia training from January 2017 to July 2017 completed a survey to assess the impact of prebreathing on the presentation and severity of hypoxia symptoms.RESULTS: Two DCI events were recorded in 1530 hypobaric chamber exposures without prebreathing while two DCI events were recorded in 1729 exposures with prebreathing. There was no significant difference in the incidence of DCI between the two groups. The survey findings showed no significant difference in the presentation and severity of hypoxia symptoms with 30 min of prebreathing.DISCUSSION: Incidence of DCI remains low during hypobaric chamber training, with no statistical difference with or without prebreathing. Possible reasons were the short duration of hypobaric exposure of 10 min during hypoxia training, and that 30 min of prebreathing was insufficient to further decrease or eliminate the risk of DCI in short duration hypobaric exposures.Cheok LJ, Goh BLY, Soh FW, Chuan BTB.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Flight Crew Health Stabilization Program (HSP) was historically implemented to minimize infectious disease transmission to astronauts in the immediate prelaunch period. The first ever commercial application and adaptation of the NASA HSP was implemented during the Crew Demo-2 mission in the time of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This article details and discusses the first commercial implementation and adaptation of the HSP prior to the Crew Demo-2 launch. METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive analysis of the application of NASA disease prevention protocols for human spaceflight during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the context of the pandemic, extra precautions added to the HSP included daily symptom surveys completed by Primary Contacts of the crew, COVID-19 RT-PCR testing, and improved quarantine protocols. RESULTS: Of the 91 SpaceX Primary Contacts who completed a total of 2720 daily symptom surveys prior to launch, 22 individuals (24.2) and 198 surveys (7.3) returned positive for potential symptoms of COVID-19. Two individuals were removed due to symptoms indistinguishable from COVID-19. Through this survey, systematic quarantine, and PCR testing, the Crew Demo-2 mission was successful with no known infectious diseases transmitted. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the commercial implementation of the NASA Health Stabilization Program by SpaceX with adjustments required during the COVID-19 pandemic was a success, with protocols allowing identification and removal of potentially infectious persons from the program. The principles of the HSP may provide an adequate infectious disease playbook for commercial spaceflight operations going forward.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During active phases of manned spaceflight there is a possibility of a spacecraft landing at any point traversed by its orbital path on the Earth. Survival training after emergency landing is an important and vital part of pre-mission preparations. In this paper we analyze medical issues associated with winter survival training in marshy and forested terrain. METHODS: From 2011 to 2019, 50 International Space Station crews participated in winter survival training. Crewmembers included Roscosmos, NASA, CSA, ESA, and JAXA astronauts, spaceflight participants, and instructors. Medical protocols and training final reports were analyzed for conditions and medical events. RESULTS: The health status of crewmembers during training was nominal. Temperature sensation was reported as comfortable or moderately cold during daytime and moderately cold or cold during nighttime. S p O 2 (blood oxygen saturation) and heart rate recorded during training did not exceed normal values. S p CO (blood carbon monoxide saturation) generally was within normal limits. All participating crewmembers lost some bodyweight, from 0.15.5 kg (average 2.1 kg). Over the course of winter survival training there were 32 medical and environmental events requiring medical intervention. For two of the crewmembers requiring medical intervention, training was subsequently canceled. DISCUSSION: Winter survival training has successfully prepared spaceflight crews for the possibility of off-nominal landings in challenging terrain under adverse conditions. As this training involves high fidelity flight-like survival equipment and assigned flight crewmembers, the medical problems described here should closely reflect type and prevalence of events during an actual contingency scenario.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) is a mode of transportation designed to expedite the transport of a patient. Compared to other modes of emergency transport and other areas of aviation, historically HEMS has had the highest accident-related fatality rates. Analysis of these accident data has revealed factors associated with an increased likelihood of accident-based fatalities. Here we report the results of an analysis on the likelihood of a fatality based on various factors as a result of a HEMS accident, employing a Bayesian framework. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using data extracted from the NTSB aviation accident database from April 31, 2005, to April 26, 2018. Evidence from Baker et al. (2006) was also used as prior information spanning from January 1, 1983, to April 30, 2005. RESULTS: A Bayesian logistic regression was implemented using the prior information and current data to calculate a posterior distribution confidence interval of possible values in predicting accident fatality. The results of the model indicate that flying at night (OR 3.06; 95 C.I 2.14, 4.48; PoD 100), flying under Instrument Flight Rules (OR 7.54; 95 C.I 3.94, 14.44; PoD 100), and post-crash fires (OR 18.73; 95 C.I 10.07, 34.12; PoD 100) significantly contributed to the higher likelihood of a fatality. CONCLUSION: Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of the most influential factors associated with an increased likelihood of a fatal accident occurring. We found that over the past 35 yr these factors were consistently associated with a higher likelihood of a fatality occurring. Simonson RJ, Keebler JR, Chaparro A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aerobatic flight operations involve a higher level of risk than standard flight operations. Aerobatics imposes considerable stresses on both the aircraft and the pilot. The purpose of this study was to analyze civilian aerobatic aircraft accidents in Australia, with particular emphasis on the underlying accident causes and survival outcomes. METHODS: The accident and incident database of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau was searched for all events involving aerobatic flight for the period 19802010. RESULTS: A total of 51 accidents involving aircraft undertaking aerobatic operations were identified, with 71 aircraft occupants. Of the accidents, 27 (52.9) were fatal, resulting in a total of 36 fatalities. There were 24 nonfatal accidents. In terms of injury outcomes, there were 4 serious and 9 minor injuries, and 22 accidents in which no injuries were recorded. Fatal accidents were mainly due to loss of control by the pilot (44.4), in-flight structural failure of the airframe (25.9), and terrain impact (25.9). G-LOC was considered a possible cause in 11.1 of fatal accidents. Nonfatal accidents were mainly due to powerplant failure (41.7) and noncatastrophic airframe damage (25). Accidents involving aerobatic maneuvering have a significantly increased risk of a fatal outcome (odds ratio 26). DISCUSSION: The results of this study highlight the risks involved in aerobatic flight. Exceeding the operational limits of the maneuver and the design limits of the aircraft are major factors contributing to a fatal aerobatic aircraft accident. Improved awareness of G physiology and better operational decision-making while undertaking aerobatic flight may help prevent further accidents. Newman DG.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the mid-1970s, NASA required a robust training program for physicians responsible for the medical needs of the Shuttle astronauts. Personnel at NASA worked closely with academicians and subject matter experts at Wright State University (WSU) to develop and establish a residency program in aerospace medicine. This academic training program was initiated in 1978 and closed in 2018. The objective of this historical piece is to catalog, for posterity, the impact this training program has had on national and international human spaceflight and aviation. METHODS: A thorough review of all available historical documents and oral histories provided by contemporaries were reviewed in detail, including a search of every available resident’s thesis and all available historical documents and reports at WSU and NASA Headquarters. RESULTS: Over the past 40 yr, WSU has graduated 172 individuals with an M.S. degree focused on aerospace medicine, of which 84 were residents. Nearly 50% of these residents have worked closely with NASA. Many others became integrated into academia, the aviation industry, or international space programs. DISCUSSION: With the growth in interest for government and commercial spaceflight, the field of aerospace medicine is poised to grow. Although it is not well known outside of the Aerospace Medicine community, the legacy of this pioneering, 40-yr civilian-based program is of significant value. If not recorded in an easily locatable and accessible manner, many of the challenges and outcomes from this residency could be lost until future generations have to spend the money, time, and effort to relearn them.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Normative performance (NP) describes the pilots adherence to tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Until now, there has not been a global NP measurement technique for beyond visual range (BVR) air combat, and the methodology and technology related to the evaluation of NP have fallen behind the pace of the overall technical progress of distributed mission operations (DMO) training.METHODS: Platform-independent core air combat tasks were identified. The execution of these tasks is directed with TTPs. BVR air combat missions were flown in a DMO simulator system and the design NP was varied between missions. Observers viewed debriefs of these missions and attempted to identify TTP-regulated air combat tasks. Once identified, they scored the pilots NP in those tasks. The scoring was based on the level of TTP adherence and the impact a nonadherence had on the mission accomplishment.RESULTS: All observers were able to identify most of the TTP-regulated air combat tasks. There was a strong positive correlation between the observed and design NP scores. The overall Kappa indicated a fair agreement between the observers. The percentage of observers NP assessments which agreed with the design NP varied from 49.60 to 85.28% in different air combat missions. On average, 73.9%6 of the observers NP scores agreed with the design NP scores.CONCLUSIONS: Observers were able to accurately identify TTP-regulated tasks and score NP of these tasks during an air combat debrief. There was a moderate agreement between the observers NP scores.Mansikka H, Virtanen K, Mkinen L, Harris D. Normative performance measurement in simulated air combat.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sinus barotraumas are a common condition in aviation medicine, sometimes compromising flight safety and even permanently grounding aircrew. Considering this and the ever-increasing amount of commercial aviation, a thorough examination is required. METHODS: In this survey study, an anonymous, electronic questionnaire was distributed to commercial aircrew of the three major commercial airlines operating in Finland ( N = 3799), covering 93% of the target population (i.e., all commercial aircrew operating in Finland, N = 4083). Primary outcomes were self-reported prevalence, clinical characteristics, and health and occupational effects of sinus barotraumas in flight. Secondary outcomes were adjusted odds ratios (OR) for frequency of sinus barotraumas with respect to possible risk factors. RESULTS: Response rate was 47% ( N = 1789/3799), with 61% ( N = 1088) of the respondents having experienced sinus barotraumas in flight. Of those affected, 59% had used medications, 18% had undergone surgical procedures, and 53% had been on sick leave due to sinus barotraumas (38% during the last year) in flight. Factors associated with sinus barotraumas were female sex [OR, 2.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35–4.50] and a high number of upper respiratory tract infections (≥3 vs. &lt;3 URTIs/yr: OR, 3.61; 95% CI 2.65–4.93). CONCLUSION: Sinus barotraumas were reported by 61% of commercial aircrew. They caused an increased need for medications, otorhinolaryngology-related surgical procedures, and sickness absence from flight duty. The possible risk factors were female sex and a high number of URTIs/yr. Lindfors OH, Ketola KS, Klockars TK, Leino TK, Sinkkonen ST. Sinus barotraumas in commercial aircrew .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diphyllobothriasis is estimated to afflict 10–20 million people worldwide; however, this is the first case reported in a United States military aviator. Among the largest parasites of humans, the “fish tapeworm” grows from 2–15 m in length, can live &gt;20 yr in the intestines, and is contracted through consumption of uncooked, unfrozen freshwater or anadromous fish species. CASE REPORT: A 32-yr-old male F-22 pilot presented with mild stomach cramping, bloating, nausea, and intermittent loose stools. Symptoms were relieved with bismuth subsalicylate until several days later when the patient, during otherwise normal bowel movements, extracted multiple broken segments of tapeworm. Although physically asymptomatic, he was psychologically disturbed. Based on the large number of ova with characteristic shape, size, color, and operculum, coupled with the flattened body, yellowish coloration, and rectangular proglottids with centrally located “rosette” uteri, he was diagnosed with diphyllobothriasis (likely D. latum or D. nihonkaiense ). Successful treatment with a single oral dose of praziquantel (&gt;10 mg · kg −1 ) was confirmed by negative stool examination over 60 d posttreatment. He likely contracted the parasite from ingesting salmon sushi or sashimi while previously stationed in Japan. DISCUSSION: Despite only mild physical symptoms, the pilot’s psychological distress and distraction from knowing about the meters-long tapeworm was significant. Prompt treatment was paramount to resumption of military operations. Aviators should be educated and encouraged to eat only well-cooked or previously frozen fish, especially when indulging in cultural cuisine. Kasteler SD.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During ground operations, rotary-wing aircraft engines and subsystems produce noise hazards that place airfield personnel at risk for hearing damage. The noise exposure levels outside the aircraft during various operating conditions, and the distances from aircraft at which they drop to safe levels, are not readily available. The current study measured noise levels at various positions around the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter for three operating conditions typically used when the aircraft is on the ground. METHODS: Microphones were positioned systematically around the helicopter and A-weighted sound pressure levels (SPLs) were computed from the recordings. In addition, the 85-dBA SPL contour around the aircraft was mapped. The resulting A-weighted SPLs and contour mapping were used to determine the noise hazard area around the helicopter. RESULTS: Measurements reported here show noise levels of 105 dB or greater in all operating conditions. The fueling location at the left rear of the aircraft near the auxiliary power unit (APU) is the area of greatest risk for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Additionally, sound field contours indicate noise hazard areas (&gt;85 dBA SPL) can extend beyond 100 ft from the helicopter. CONCLUSIONS: This report details the areas of greatest risk for auditory injury around the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. Our findings suggest the area of hazardous noise levels around the aircraft can extend to neighboring aircraft, particularly on the side of the aircraft where the APU is located. Hearing protection should be worn whenever the aircraft is operating, even if working at a distance. Jones HG, Greene NT, Chen MR, Azcona CM, Archer BJ, Reeves ER.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sopite syndrome is a poorly understood symptom complex characterized by drowsiness and lethargy relating to motion sickness. Though often occurring in conjunction with the classic symptomatology of motion sickness, the literature suggests that sopite syndrome is a separate entity that may occur independently of the feelings of nausea characteristic of traditional motion sickness. Additionally, the syndrome can last long after symptoms of nausea have subsided and can be debilitating to some patients. Due to the frequent concomitance of sopite syndrome and the classic symptoms of motion sickness, the syndrome may frequently go unidentified and there is a paucity of data recording its exact incidence in the available literature. CASE REPORT: In this study, we report a case of sopite syndrome identified in a 23-yr-old student naval aviator who was ultimately unable to overcome his symptoms and adapt to the dynamic environment of flight. DISCUSSION: This process is particularly relevant to student aviators and others involved in transportation settings where the existence of even mild performance challenges may create the potential for operational hazards. Because the training of aviators and flight officers is historically one of the most expensive investments undertaken by the Department of the Navy each year, documenting unique manifestations of this common problem and addressing them early in the training pipeline may help reduce the time and financial burden associated with student naval aviator attrition in the later stages of training.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: +G z tolerance is traditionally determined in centrifuges with open-loop G control, i.e., the centrifuge is under operator control (open loop), and thus the test subject is unable to influence the G z load. In modern centrifuges, however, the subject is commonly able to continuously control the G z load (closed loop). It is a widespread opinion among fighter pilots that +G z tolerance is higher under closed- than open-loop G control. The aims were to investigate whether +G z tolerance is higher in closed- than open-loop G control, and whether it is possible to use closed-loop G control during precise determination of +G z tolerance. METHODS: Relaxed +G z tolerance was determined in eight men during rapid G z -onset rate (ROR) under three conditions: 1) OL-VFB, open loop with visual feedback; 2) OL-NFB, open loop with no visual feedback; and 3) CL, closed loop. Straining +G z tolerance was determined in 10 men during ROR in OL and CL conditions. RESULTS: Relaxed +G z tolerance did not differ between CL (3.66 G z ), OL-VFB (3.70 G z ) and OL-NFB (3.64 G z ). Straining +G z tolerance was similar in the CL (8.5 G z ) and OL (8.6 G z ) conditions. In the CL condition, the G z load varied substantially and was on average lower than in the OL conditions, at any stipulated G-time profile. DISCUSSION: There is no systematic difference in relaxed or straining +G z tolerance as determined in closed- vs. open-loop G-controlled systems. During closed-loop control, precision and reproducibility are too low to recommend it for accurate determination of relaxed G tolerance. Grönkvist M, Levin B, Eiken O.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Effective voice communication is essential when operating aircraft. Because of the loud operating environment in fighter cockpits, it has been a challenge to provide effective communication while simultaneously protecting the hearing sense. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using bone conducting transducers (BCT) in place of legacy communications systems in fighter cockpits. METHODS: A military flight helmet was modified and outfitted with BCT and air-conducting speakers. BCT were independently tested against air-conducting speakers using a clinical audiometer under three conditions: without earplugs, with earplugs, and with earplugs in the presence of 100-dB broad-spectrum noise. Three test subjects were given an audiological examination using tones of varying intensity ranging from 100 Hz to 8000 Hz. The lowest hearable intensity indicated by button press was recorded for each frequency. RESULTS: In the presence of 100-dB ambient noise, bone conducting transducers performed better than air-conducting speakers at all frequencies. Hearability of BCT by audiogram was, on average, 10–20% lower intensity (dB) than air-conducting speakers. DISCUSSION: Currently, USAF pilots wear two layers of hearing protection; i.e., the helmet's integrated earcup and some form of ear plug (e.g., foam earplug or custom-molded earbud). Our results suggest that bone conducting audio transducers may be better for layered hearing protection than air-conducting speakers when used with foam earplugs. Given the cost, complexity, and non-interoperability of custom-molded earphones, helmet-integrated bone conducting transducers and foam earplugs may be a better option for sustained airborne operations.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Different aspects of the aviation system, such as pilot’s fitness, supervision, and working conditions, interact to produce or protect against flight safety hazards. Machine learning methods such as Random Forests may help identify system characteristics with the potential to affect flight safety from the large number of candidate predictors that results when multiple system levels are considered simultaneously. METHODS: There were 54 pilot-related and occupational candidate predictors of simulator flight performance in 2 malfunction scenarios completed by 51 male European helicopter emergency medical services pilots derived from pilots’ self-report questionnaires and aeromedical examination records. In a cross-sectional explorative analysis, the Random Forest method was used to screen for informative predictors. Predictors scoring above the critical threshold for the conditional permutation variable importance (VI) statistic were selected. RESULTS: In five predictors, the VI statistic averaged across 2000 Random Forest runs exceeded the selection threshold: higher perceived rewards (VI = 0.0691) and predictability (VI = 0.0501) at work were associated with higher performance scores, and higher physiological dysregulation (VI = 0.0495) and alanine aminotransferase (VI = 0.0224) with lower scores. Performance also differed between the simulators at the two training sites (VI = 0.0298). DISCUSSION: Random Forests may usefully complement previously applied methods for the identification of human factors safety hazards. The identified performance predictors suggest further areas with potential for safety improvements. Bauer H, Nowak D, Herbig B.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas with potential for detriment to spaceflight operations. An analytical model was developed to investigate if a maximum CO contamination of 1 ppm in the oxygen (O 2 ) supply reached dangerous levels during extravehicular activity (EVA). Occupational monitoring pre- and postsuited exposures provided supplementary data for review. METHODS: The analytical model estimated O 2 and CO concentrations in the extravehicular mobility unit (EMU) based on O 2 and CO flow rates into and out of the system. The model was based on 3 h of prebreathe at 15.2 psia, 8 h of EVA at 4.3 psia, and 1 h at 15.2 psia for suit doffing. The Coburn-Forster-Kane equation was used to calculate crewmember carboxyhemoglobin saturation (COHb%) as a function of time. Monitoring of hemoglobin CO saturation (S p co) with a CO-oximeter was conducted pre- and post-EVA during operations on the International Space Station and in ground-based analog environments. RESULTS: The model predicted a maximum P CO in the EMU of 0.061 mmHg and a maximum crewmember COHb% of 2.1%. Operational S p co measurements in mean ± SD during ground-based analog testing were 0.7% ± 1.8% pretest and 0.5% ± 1.5% posttest. S p co values on the ISS were 1.5% ± 0.7% pre-EVA and 1.1% ± 0.3% post-EVA. DISCUSSION: The model predicted that astronauts are not exposed to toxic levels of CO during EVA and operational measurements did not show significant differences between S p co levels between pre- and post-EVA.

It is described most commonly in divers; however, it can occur in aviation incidents, which this case report will discuss. CASE REPORT: Following an acute cabin depressurization incident, 36 patients presented to a small outpatient clinic with multiple symptoms, including fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. These patients were evaluated, triaged, and some were able to be successfully treated with supplemental oxygen in clinic. Eight of the patients had symptoms that were either persistent or concerning enough that they were referred to the dive medical clinic, where the dive medical team diagnosed six of the patients with Type II decompression sickness and referred them for hyperbaric oxygen chamber therapy. All patients who received hyperbaric therapy experienced at least some relief of symptoms, with most reporting some residual fatigue after the therapy. DISCUSSION: This case provided both lessons in triage and management of multiple patients in a small outpatient clinic, as well as the challenges in making the diagnosis of decompression sickness.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Manual rendezvous and docking (RVD) is challenging for the astronauts, and automation is used to aid this operation. However, the automation mode in the final approaching stance of RVD is quite different. This paper is aimed at investigating the effect of automation on performance, workload and situation awareness (SA) among novice and expert operators in RVD. METHODS: A two-factor mixed experimental design was adopted. There were 15 novices and 12 experts who participated in the experiment. All subjects were required to finish six tasks of two automation levels: manual RVD and automation-aided RVD. The Performance was assessed by docking result and control process. Workload and SA were measured by NASA Task Load Index and Situation Awareness Rating Techniques (SART). Repeat measures ANOVA and the simple effect test were used to analyze the effect of automation, skill level, and the interaction between them on performance, workload, and SA of operators. RESULTS: Novices exhibited performances inferior to experts, but the skills gap was attenuated as automation was introduced. Moreover, automation can enhance performance, reduce workload, and enhance SA for novices, but potentially deteriorate task performance and SA for the experienced. Mediation analysis results indicated automation was a significant predictor of workload and SA, b = -0.576 and b = 0.503, and workload and SA were significant predictors of docking result, b = -0.590 and b = 0.348. CONCLUSION: Automation can be detrimental to various elements of the functioning of highly experienced operators. Moreover, automation affects docking result by affecting workload and SA.

This scenario is based on a real case of an astronaut who had previously flown in space and developed acute pancreatitis after being dehydrated from wilderness survival training. Many astronauts experience life threatening illness and injury before and after flight and, as space missions become longer and more remote, it is only a matter of time before these events occur during a mission. Future exploration space mission planners need to anticipate that these common catastrophic medical events will occur. CASE REPORT: You are a flight surgeon working on console at Mission Control during a long duration lunar mission. You have completed extensive space, military, and civilian aerospace medical training to address almost any anticipated medical event and can summon advice from medical experts located around the world. One crewmember is a 37-yr-old man who just completed an 8-h moonwalk and now describes a constant 7/10 dull epigastric pain with radiation around the left flank to his back. His pain is getting progressively worse and he is presently sitting with his trunk flexed and knees drawn up in extreme distress. Working with the flight director, you must decide in the next 12 h whether to recommend the multibillion-dollar mission be aborted and have the crew return to Earth immediately to save your patient.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Joint Base Charleston’s C-17 Globemaster III mission is executed by 400 active-duty members from three operational and support wings. Aircrew and mission-essential personnel travel to locations with endemic diseases which are mostly eradicated in the United States. Recently, two members contracted malaria after missions in Africa which required advanced hospital care. Personnel were provided chemoprophylaxis, but the members who contracted malaria were among several who chose not to take it. This preliminary survey assessed aircrew malaria prophylaxis adherence and examined potential factors contributing to nonadherence. METHODS: JB Charleston aircrew members who visited the Flight and Operational Medicine Clinic between January and April 2018 were administered a retrospective, online survey. Researchers performed descriptive statistics and Chi-squared analysis. RESULTS: Most respondents were pilots under 30 yr of age and were prescribed malaria chemoprophylaxis while on a mission. More than two-thirds of respondent aircrew members did not take the medication as prescribed or did not take it at all. Of those, over half of respondents stated too many pills/too many days and medication side effects as the main reasons for nonadherence. Furthermore, almost 70% of adherent members experienced negative medication side effects such as nausea and heightened dreams. There was no statistical relationship between crew position, age, side effects, and prophylaxis adherence. DISCUSSION: Numerous factors contribute to poor prophylaxis regimen compliance among aircrew members. This study highlighted the need for risk-based policy validation, improved patient education, prophylaxis enforcement, process improvements to facilitate adherence, and evaluation of perceived vs. actual risk.

The aim of this study was phonometric analysis at different altitudes of the acoustic output of a widely used earphone model, along with its consequences on audiological investigations conducted under such environmental conditions. METHODS: The transfer function of a TDH-39P earphone was analyzed with an artificial ear under nine different altitude levels, from sea level up to 35,000 ft, inside a hypobaric chamber. A specific phonometric system not sensitive to environmental pressure changes was used. Other potentially confounding factors, such as environmental temperature and humidity, were continuously monitored. RESULTS: No relevant temperature or humidity changes were detected. The sound pressure level generated by the earphone under hypobaric conditions was found considerably affected by air density changes. These data produced a correction table aiming at recalibrating the earphone’s output at each audiometric octave test frequency within the 250–8000 Hz range. Quite different characteristics of response were observed at different audiometric frequencies. Such findings were particularly evident for altitudes exceeding 12,000 ft. DISCUSSION: The development of a frequency-selective and altitude-related correction factor for acoustic stimuli is an essential aspect when hearing threshold measurements in hypobaric environments are performed.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A fundamental responsibility of aerospace medicine is the analysis and mitigation of the human component’s risk to the aviation system. Medications are part of this risk mitigation process and are present within a multitude of work environments, including aviation. For example, during fiscal year (FY) 2013–2015, the Army Aeromedical Activity (AAMA) received 8596 medication waiver requests. During this same time period the U.S. Army Medical Department’s Patient Administration Systems and Biostatistics Activity reported the organization prescribed over 187,668 prescriptions for opioids, 133,475 prescriptions for SSRIs, 116,649 prescriptions for muscle relaxants, and 71,723 prescriptions for hypnotics to its active duty soldiers in the outpatient setting. METHODS: A conceptual model to mitigate the risk of adverse reactions to medications by severity score was developed based off the methodology published by Prudhomme et al. RESULTS: The mean severity score of the 50 historically safe medications in the Army aviation community is 7346. The standard deviation of the population is 7300. The difference between safe and unsafe drugs determined by subject matter experts (SME) is highly significant when tested with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. CONCLUSION: The visual representation of the data from this conceptual model clearly demonstrates room for improvement from current methods. Historically, utilizing SME opinion has created a system with deficiencies related to high variance, inconsistencies, and perceived ambiguity. There is need for a model addressing adverse drug reactions that has concrete strengths of transparency, simplicity, and speed of use. Cronrath CM, Klick MP, Merfeld CM, Gaydos SJ.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Human access to space is expanding rapidly in the commercial environment, with various private companies offering commercial flights to spaceflight participants (SFPs). SFPs are more likely than career astronauts to have medical conditions novel to spaceflight and may not have undergone as rigorous a medical screening process as that used for career astronauts, representing new and unstudied risks in the spaceflight environment. We report participation of a subject with recent median sternotomy for aortic valve replacement and atrial septal defect closure in centrifuge-simulated dynamic phases of orbital and suborbital spaceflight. CASE REPORT: A 40-yr-old man with a history of congenital bicuspid aortic valve and atrial septal defect with successful repair 8 mo prior participated in an ongoing human centrifuge research study. The subject had the opportunity to participate in up to five centrifuge runs in an 8-h period, with profiles simulating commercial spaceflight. Maximum exposures included +4.0 G z , +4.5 G x , 6.1 G resultant, and maximum onset rate &lt; 0.5 G z · s −1 and +1 G x · s −1 . Physiological data acquisition included hemodynamics, electrocardiogram, neurovestibular exams, and postrun questionnaires covering motion sickness, disorientation, and similar. The subject tolerated the physiological aspects of hypergravity well, noting progressive sternal pain with increasing +G x , ultimately leading him to opt out of the final profile. DISCUSSION: Postcardiothoracic surgery risks to SFPs are largely unknown, especially within 12 mo of a significant surgical procedure. This case provides an approach for risk stratification, preparticipation evaluation, and medical management of a postsurgical patient with significant cardiac history in spaceflight and analog environments.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aircraft are manufactured according to design parameters that must account for the size and physical characteristics of the pilot. While cockpit dimensions, seats, restraints, and related components do not change substantially over the airframe lifecycle, it is conceivable that the occupant may, even if initially well-suited. This investigation focused on longitudinal body mass index (BMI) changes within a cohort of British Army Air Corps pilots. METHODS: The study was a retrospective examination of electronic medical record data to assess longitudinal change within a representative cohort of Army pilots. Voluntary subjects were assigned unique subject numbers matched with individual electronic medical record data. Subject’s age, service length, height, weight, and BMI were extracted from routine historical aviation medical exams. RESULTS: Among 106 British Army Air Corps pilots, the mean age was 35.3 yr (SD = 7.4) with average length of service as a pilot of 9.0 yr (SD = 5.2). Within the observed cohort, the mean change in individual weight over time was an increase of 4.6 kg (SD = 7.3). Height remained relatively stable with a mean increase of 0.6 cm (SD = 1.9). Given the increase in weight, BMI was noted to increase longitudinally with a mean of 1.3 kg · m −2 (SD = 2.4). DISCUSSION: British Army pilots experience increases in BMI over time much like the general population. Results of this study serve to inform future policy related to the body composition of aviation applicants, the retention of previously qualified pilots, and the safety concerns of crashworthiness design specifications.

In the early years, a physician with expertise in aerospace medicine was assigned to the Space Task Group and then to NASA. One of these individuals was Dr. Stanley White, a U.S. Air Force physician. To capture more of the early space medicine pioneers, a contract was established between the National Library of Medicine and the principal investigator at the University of Cincinnati to conduct a series of interviews with these early pioneers. An interview with Dr. White took place in his home while he was in hospice care. This audiotaped interview and other written and oral histories within NASA archives and the literature were reviewed to support this work. A series of questions were prepared for the interaction with Dr. White. These questions provided further clarification on his background and contribution. Responses to questions elicited open-ended discussion. The conversation provided a historical summary of Dr. White’s contribution to NASA as one of its first flight surgeons. Doarn CR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sleep inertia is the transition state during which alertness and cognitive performance are temporarily impaired after awakening. Magnitude and time course of sleep inertia are characterized by high individual variability with large differences between the cognitive functions affected. This period of impairment is of concern to pilots, who take sleep or nap periods during on-call work hours or in-flight rest, then need to perform safety-critical tasks soon after waking. This review analyzes literature related to sleep inertia and countermeasures applicable for aviation. METHODS: The large part of scientific literature that focuses on sleep inertia is based on studies in patients with chronic sleep inertia. We analyzed 8 narrative reviews and 64 papers related to acute sleep inertia in healthy subjects. DISCUSSION: Sleep inertia is a multifactorial, complex process, and many different protocols have been conducted, with a low number of subjects, in noncontrolled laboratory designs, with questionnaires or cognitive tests that have not been replicated. Evidence suggests that waking after sleep loss, or from deeper stages of sleep, can exacerbate sleep inertia through complex interactions between awakening and sleep-promoting brain structures. Nevertheless, no meta-analyses are possible and extrapolation to pilots’ performances is hypothetical. Studies in real life or simulated operational situations must be conducted to improve the description of the impact of sleep inertia and kinetics on pilots’ performances. Taking rest or sleep time remains the main method for pilots to fight against fatigue and related decreases in performance. We propose proactive strategies to mitigate sleep inertia and improve alertness. Sauvet F, Beauchamps V, Cabon P. Sleep inertia in aviation . Aerosp Med Hum Perform. 2024; 95(4):206–213.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: U.S. Army aviators are required to maintain a level of physiological fitness as part of their qualifying process, which suggests that they are generally physically healthy. However, it has not been statistically proven that they are more “physiologically fit” than the general population. METHODS: This retrospective study compares physiological measurements of U.S. Army aviators from the Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office database to the U.S. general population using the Center for Disease Control’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. To enable an accurate comparison of physiological metrics between U.S. Army aviators and the U.S. general population, aviators were categorized into the same age groups and biological genders used for segmentation of the national population data. RESULTS: On average, pulse rate was 4.85 bpm lower in male aviators and 6.84 bpm lower in female aviators. Fasting glucose levels were, on average, 10.6 mg · dL −1 lower in aviators compared to the general population. Key metrics like pulse rate and fasting glucose were lower in aviators, indicating cardiovascular and metabolic advantages. However, parameters like cholesterol showed less consistent differences. DISCUSSION: While aviation physical demands and administrative policies selecting for elite physiological metrics produce improvements on some dimensions, a nuanced view accounting for the multitude of factors influencing an aviator’s physiological fitness is still warranted. Implementing targeted health monitoring and maintenance programs based on assessments conducted more frequently than the current annual flight physical may optimize aviator safety and performance over the course of a career.

The aim of the study was to enhance the safety of this operation during a mission. METHODS: To examine this, N = 8 cosmonauts had to perform the manually controlled docking task simultaneously with an acoustic monitoring task. The P300 component was evoked by the acoustic stimuli of the secondary task. The docking task had to be executed at three difficulty levels: low (station not turning); medium (station turning around one axis); and difficult (station turning around three axes). In the secondary task, subjects had to discriminate between a low and a high tone, which occurred with a probability of 90% and 10%, respectively. Subjects had to count the high tones. After the 10th high tone, they had to inspect the power supply by giving an oral command. RESULTS: A methodology for event-related potentials was successfully demonstrated under space conditions. The P300 amplitude was largest and the latency shortest during the medium difficult task. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that P300 can be recorded during the complex manual docking task in space and could be used to assess individual available cognitive capacity of cosmonauts during a space mission.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although an unintended aircraft landing on water (referred to as ditching) is a rare event, the potential for occupant injury/fatality increases immediately following the event due to adverse conditions. However, to date, few studies have addressed the subject. Herein, ditching events and post-ditching survival were investigated. METHODS: Ditchings (1982–2022) in the United States were identified from the National Transportation Safety Board database. Occupant injury severity, aircraft type, pilot experience, flight conditions, and number of occupants were extracted. Poisson distribution, the Chi-squared test (2-tailed), Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance were employed. RESULTS: A total of 96 ditchings were identified. A systematic survey was hampered by the lack of a standardized reporting matrix in the reports. In total, 77 reports were included in the analysis. Across all ditchings, 128 of 169 (76%) occupants survived ditching and were rescued. Importantly, the initial ditching event was survived by 95% of all occupants. However, 32 (19%) occupants died post-ditching by drowning (21/32 cases) or for undetermined reasons. Considering probability per ditching event, in 26 (34%) of all ditchings, one or more occupants was/were fatally injured. DISCUSSION: Initial survival of the emergency ditching is high. Drowning was the leading cause of death after ditching and reduced the overall survival to 76%. Further investigation is needed to identify risk factors for fatal outcomes and/or improve probability of survival after ditching. Schick VC, Boyd DD, Hippler C, Hinkelbein J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The rapid development of the space industry requires a deeper understanding of spaceflight’s impact on the brain. MRI research reports brain volume changes following spaceflight in astronauts, potentially affecting cognition. Recently, we have demonstrated that this evidence of volumetric changes, as measured by typical T1-weighted sequences (e.g., magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence; MPRAGE), is error-prone due to the microgravity-related redistribution of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. More modern neuroimaging methods, particularly dual-echo MPRAGE (DEMPRAGE) and magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence utilizing two inversion pulses (MP2RAGE), have been suggested to be resilient to this error. Here, we tested if these imaging modalities offered consistent segmentation performance improvements in some commonly employed neuroimaging software packages. METHODS: We conducted manual gray matter tissue segmentation in traditional T1w MRI images to utilize for comparison. Automated tissue segmentation was performed for traditional T1w imaging, as well as on DEMPRAGE and MP2RAGE images from the same subjects. Statistical analysis involved a comparison of total gray matter volumes for each modality, and the extent of tissue segmentation agreement was assessed using a test of similarity (Dice coefficient). RESULTS: Neither DEMPRAGE nor MP2RAGE exhibited consistent segmentation performance across all toolboxes tested. DISCUSSION: This research indicates that customized data collection and processing methods are necessary for reliable and valid structural MRI segmentation in astronauts, as current methods provide erroneous classification and hence inaccurate claims of neuroplastic brain changes in the astronaut population.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is a current belief in aviation suggesting that aerobic training may reduce G-tolerance due to potential negative impacts on arterial pressure response. Studies indicate that increasing maximal aerobic capacity ( o 2 max) through aerobic training does not hinder G-tolerance. Moreover, sustained centrifuge training programs revealed no instances where excessive aerobic exercise compromised a trainee’s ability to complete target profiles. The purpose of this review article is to examine the current research in the hope of establishing the need for routine o 2 -max testing in air force pilot protocols. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, the Aerospace Medical Association, and Military Medicine was conducted. Keywords related to “human performance,” “Air Force fighter pilots,” “aerobic function,” and “maximal aerobic capacity” were used in various combinations. Articles addressing exercise physiology, G-tolerance, physical training, and fighter pilot maneuvers related to human performance were considered. No primary data collection involving human subjects was conducted; therefore, ethical approval was not required. RESULTS: The o 2 -max test provides essential information regarding a pilot’s ability to handle increased G z -load. It assists in predicting G-induced loss of consciousness by assessing anti-G straining maneuver performance and heart rate variables during increased G-load. DISCUSSION: o 2 -max testing guides tailored exercise plans, optimizes cardiovascular health, and disproves the notion that aerobic training hampers G-tolerance. Its inclusion in air force protocols could boost readiness, reduce health risks, and refine training for fighter pilots’ safety and performance. This evidence-backed approach supports integrating o 2 -max testing for insights into fitness, risks, and tailored exercise. Zeigler Z, Acevedo AM.

His visual acuity was 10/20 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left. During examination, ptosis and exophthalmos were noticed in the right eye. Ocular movements were free in all cardinal directions and there was downward displacement in the right eye. There was no diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1.5- to 2-cm well-defined contrast-enhancing mass in the lateral extraconal orbit. His medical flight certificate was suspended for 3 mo due to decreased visual acuity and superior visual defect. Superior orbitotomy was performed without any complication. Ptosis and CSR had regressed 1 wk after surgery. All systemic and ophthalmological examinations met aviation medical certificate requirements. He returned to flight on the condition of being checked every 3 mo. At the 1-yr follow-up, there was no sign of recurrences of SFT or CSR. DISCUSSION: SFTs are slow-growing neoplasms that can manifest symptoms related to mass effect. In the current literature, there are no reported cases of the coexistence of orbital SFT and CSR or pilots able to resume flight duties only 1 wk after a successful orbitotomy and tumor resection surgery.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: An Australasian Airline’s Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Program demonstrates abstinence rates that exceed those of general AOD programs. The reasons for this are unclear. The purpose of this research was to develop a theory as to why this program is successful. METHODS: A qualitative examination following grounded theory methodology was undertaken. AOD program patients and healthcare professionals were interviewed until content saturation was reached. Data analysis followed grounded theory to identify the key concepts associated with the program’s success. RESULTS: The core theory that emerged highlighted the pivotal roles of a strong employee–company relationship, shared values, and a safety-focused culture in explicating the program’s success. This moves beyond the “carrot and stick” model of motivation, where belonging to this organization and safety consciousness serve as powerful drivers for abstinence. Challenges and barriers highlighted some unique challenges to the program in managing the coronavirus pandemic and the difference in approach to substance use in community spaces versus safety-critical employment. DISCUSSION: This research expands the understanding of this AOD program’s success in a safety-critical industry, emphasizing the elements of a working relationship that are beyond positive or negative reinforcement.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional dyspepsia is a disorder of gut–brain interaction that has the potential to impact aviation performance. Proton pump inhibitors are well-tolerated but are only effective in one half of cases. Second-line treatments, including tricyclic antidepressants, are associated with drowsiness and are not routinely approved for use in aviators. We present a case of a Naval Flight Officer with functional dyspepsia who was successfully treated with amitriptyline and returned to flying status. CASE REPORT: A 23-yr-old male Naval Flight Officer presented with postprandial fullness and epigastric pain. His symptoms were refractory to trials of acid suppression and lifestyle modification. An extensive evaluation by Gastroenterology, including upper endoscopy, did not reveal an organic cause of his symptoms and he was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia. The patient’s symptoms resolved with a trial of amitriptyline. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no medication effect on cognitive performance. A waiver to resume flying duties on amitriptyline was submitted to the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute and was approved. DISCUSSION: We present the second known waiver issued in U.S. Naval aviation history for the use of amitriptyline to treat a gastrointestinal disorder. Amitriptyline is not commonly waived due to the potential for unacceptable cognitive side-effects in the flight environment. However, neuropsychological testing to assess for a possible medication effect on performance can be used to inform an aeromedical disposition and, in this case, allowed for a return to flight status.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The absence of a consistent downward G vector can make separation of gases from liquids challenging, such as in field medicine without stable upright equipment or during spaceflight. This limits the use of medical equipment and procedures like administration of intravenous (IV) fluids in microgravity and can make field medicine hazardous. Administering IV fluids and medications in microgravity requires a technique to separate air from the liquid phase. Current commercial filters for separation of gases are incompatible with high flow and blood. We present a novel filter designed to provide adequate air clearance without a consistent downward G vector. METHODS: Inline air-eliminating filters were designed for use with IV fluid tubing in microgravity using computer-aided design software and printed using nylon 12 on an EOS Selective Laser Sintering 3D printer. A 0.2-μm membrane filter was adhered around a central, hollow pillar with external spiral baffles allowing separation and venting of air from the fluid. Results were compared against commercially available inline air-eliminating filters. RESULTS: The 3D-printed filters outperformed the commercial filters in both percentage of air removed and flow rates. The centrifugal, baffled filter had flow rates that far exceeded the commercial filters during rapid transfusion. DISCUSSION: IV fluid administration is an often underappreciated and a necessary basic requirement for medical treatment. An air-eliminating filter compatible with blood and rapid transfusion was developed and validated with crystalloid solutions to allow the successful administration of IV fluid and medication without a consistent downward G vector.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Agricultural aircraft operations are associated with unique challenges. In particular, these include maintaining awareness of obstacles associated with flight at very low altitudes. Wire strikes are a common cause of accidents in these operations. METHODS: Focus groups were completed during the 2022 Ag Aviation Expo hosted by the National Agricultural Aviation Association with pilots who had experienced wire-strike events ( N = 22). The researchers coded the transcripts using a human factors framework. RESULTS: Notably, unplanned “trim passes” were a key stage of flight during wire-strike events. Cognitive risk factors that may have affected their performance included situation awareness, decision-making choices, and pressure to perform. Over half of subjects reported being aware of the wire before collision. Possible prevention strategies include not spraying the field due to safety risks, paying better attention to where they were in the field, and avoiding deviation from the planned route. DISCUSSION: Wire-strike events often occur due to momentary lapses in attention, even when the pilot is already aware of the wire. This study shows that targeted approaches to prevent wire strikes in agricultural aviation operations require addressing a number of cognitive risks and human factors, rather than implementing increased preflight surveillance. These results have implications for preventing future wire-strike accidents based directly on pilot perceptions, both within agricultural operations and general aviation more broadly.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The benefits of using head-up displays (HUDs) include reducing head-down time during critical flight phases, enhancing awareness of the external environment, and improving in-flight crew performance. However, the monochromatic nature of HUDs, increased head rotation, and longer gaze movement paths might affect pilots’ reactions to different types of alerts. METHODS: Pilot workload and behavior differences were examined between HUD and head-down display (HDD) configurations in three alert scenarios. The study was carried out in an A320 flight simulator and 12 pilots participated. RESULTS: Except for one engine-on-fire scenario, pilot workload when using a HUD was significantly lower than using an HDD. In one engine-on-fire (3.98 s vs. 3.57 s) and one gear-disagree (5.42 s vs. 4.69 s) scenario, pilot response time to alerts using HUD was significantly longer than using an HDD. The angle deviations were significantly smaller when using HUDs in both go-around-under-crosswind (2.67° vs. 3.37°) and one engine-on-fire scenario (1.22° vs. 1.89°). DISCUSSION: The HUD is suitable for a lengthy process of manual flight control inputs, which not only reduces workload but also promotes control accuracy. For tasks that rely on automation, the benefits for workload become less obvious. In addition, head rotation and reorientation of attention adversely affected the response time to non-time-critical warnings and cautions. For instantaneous control with high precision requirements, HUDs did not demonstrate a significant advantage. Zheng Y, Lu Y, Jie Y, Fu S.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Biomarker responses to intensive decompression indicate systemic proinflammatory responses and possible neurological stress. To further investigate responses, 12 additional brain and lung biomarkers were assayed. METHODS: A total of 15 healthy men (20 to 50 yr) undertook consecutive same-day ascents to 25,000 ft (7620 m), following denitrogenation, breathing 100% oxygen. Venous blood was sampled at baseline (T0), after the second ascent (T8), and next morning (T24). Soluble protein markers of brain and lung insult were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with plasma microparticles quantified using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and high mobility group box protein 1 were elevated at T8, by 36% and 16%, respectively, before returning to baseline. Levels of soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products fell by 8%, recovering by T24. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor rose by 80% over baseline at T24. Monocyte microparticle levels rose by factors of 3.7 at T8 and 2.7 at T24 due to early and late responses in different subjects. Other biomarkers were unaffected or not detected consistently. DISCUSSION: The elevated biomarkers at T8 suggest a neuroinflammatory response, with later elevation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor at T24 indicating an ongoing neurotrophic response and incomplete recovery. A substantial increase at T8 in the ratio of high mobility group box protein 1 to soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products suggests this axis may mediate the systemic inflammatory response to decompression. The mechanism of neuroinflammation is unclear but elevation of monocyte microparticles and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 imply a key role for activated monocytes and/or macrophages.

Cooling vests represent a viable solution. The study aim was to compare effectiveness of the same amount of cooling power to the upper body (UB) or whole body (WB) in alleviating thermoregulatory and physiological stress, enhancing cognitive function, and reducing ratings of thermal discomfort and exertion, during 60 min of exercise in a hot environment (40°C, 40% relative humidity) while wearing firefighter turnout gear. METHODS: Eight healthy individuals (27.5 ± 3 y) participated in three conditions with either no cooling (Control) or active cooling with a liquid perfused shirt (UB cooling), or with a liquid perfused shirt and pants (WB cooling). In each trial, subjects performed three sets of 15 min of stepping (20 steps ⋅ min −1 ) and 5 min of rest. RESULTS: Both cooling strategies were beneficial compared to having no cooling at all. Subjects could only complete two exercise bouts during Control, but they completed all three bouts with active cooling. WB cooling provided an advantage over UB cooling for core and skin temperature, and thermal comfort and sensation. The advantage in minimizing the increase in core temperature was only evident during the third exercise bout. DISCUSSION: Active cooling is advantageous under these conditions. WB cooling provided some benefits vs UB cooling during heavy intensity exercise; however, it is uncertain whether these benefits would be observed during light-to-moderate exercise, which more likely reflects an actual firefighting scenario.

We sought to determine the effect of communication delays and text-based communication on emergency medicine physician (EMP) performance of a simulated surgical procedure and the ideal training paradigm for remote surgery. METHODS: In this study, 12 EMPs performed an appendectomy on a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator after tutorial. EMPs were randomized into two groups: one (bedside) group performing with bedside directing from a surgeon and the second (remote) group performing with text-based communications relayed to the surgeon after a 210-s time delay. Both groups performed a second simulated surgery 7 mo later with 240-s delay. Collected data included time to completion, number of movements, path length, economy of motion, percentage of time with appropriate camera positioning, texts sent, and major complications. RESULTS: The remote group took significantly longer to complete the task, used more total movements, had longer path length, and had significantly worse economy of motion during the initial trial. At the 7-mo simulation, there were no significant differences between the two groups. There was a nonsignificant increase in critical errors in the remote group at follow-up (50% vs. 20% of trials). DISCUSSION: EMPs are technically able to perform a surgical operation with delayed just-in-time telementoring guidance via text-based communication. However, the ideal paradigm for training non-surgeons to perform surgical operations is unclear but is likely real-time bedside training rather than remote training.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Real-time cardiovascular imaging during hypergravity exposure has been historically limited by technological and physical challenges. Previous efforts at sonographic hypergravity imaging have used fixed ultrasound probes; the use of hand-held ultrasound, particularly performed by minimally trained laypersons, has been less explored. Here we will discuss handheld sonography to self-visualize carotid vascular and cardiac changes during hypergravity. METHODS: Three subjects with variable ultrasound experience ranging from no familiarity to extensive clinical experience used handheld ultrasound at rest and under stepwise +G z hypergravity exposures (maximum +3.5 G z ) to visualize carotid vascular changes. Subxiphoid cardiac ultrasound was obtained by the most experienced subject. Subjects had variable prior hypergravity experience; all were trained in anti-G straining techniques. Sonographically inexperienced subjects underwent a brief (&lt; 5 min) familiarization with the ultrasound probe, user interface, and desirable viewing window immediately prior to centrifugation; real-time coaching was provided. Ultrasound images were correlated to self-reported symptoms and hemodynamic data. RESULTS: Handheld ultrasound performed as desired; all subjects were successful at obtaining ultrasound images with adequate capture of windows of interest. Subxiphoid imaging efforts were limited by probe overheating and associated with variable quality of imaging due to probe displacement from straining techniques; the subject noted transient, mild discomfort and ecchymosis after imaging in the subxiphoid region. DISCUSSION: Even individuals with minimal or no ultrasound experience successfully obtained usable images under centrifuge conditions. While there were some limitations, this technical demonstration provides initial validation of handheld sonography as an available tool for real-time cardiovascular imaging in a hypergravity environment.

The aim of HRT is to enhance the ability of aircrew to recognize and recover from an unexpected in-flight hypoxic exposure; however, there is a paucity of research evaluating the efficacy of HRT and whether current training approaches are optimal. Rather, the benefits of HRT are routinely promulgated based on opinions and anecdotes. Here, we raise some of our concerns with HRT practices in order to stimulate further discussion and research.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: When a pilot is referred for nasal polyposis, his/her flight fitness may be questionable. The objective of this retrospective study was to describe a case series of barotrauma in a pilot population exhibiting nasal polyposis and to discuss the decisions about their flight fitness. METHODS: There were 17 pilots with nasal polyposis who were referred to the Head and Neck Department of the National Pilot Expertise Center. The study was declarative on the occurrence of ear and sinus barotrauma during the last 5 yr. Nasofibroscopy was performed to determine the stage of the nasosinus polyposis. RESULTS: Out of 17 pilots, 1 did not obtain flight fitness clearance. Among the 16 who received fitness clearance to fly, 2 had restrictions on their flight fitness. Out of 17 patients, 8 had sinus barotrauma and 13 had middle ear barotrauma. A total of 21 cases of sinus barotrauma were reported, 17 involving the frontal sinus and 4 involving the maxillary sinus. Also reported were 48 cases of middle ear barotrauma. DISCUSSION: Flight fitness was based on the recurrence of barotrauma episodes, their severity, in-flight incapacitation due to hyperalgesic sinusitis or otitis, and the failure of medical and/or surgical treatments. In our series, nasal polyposis did not seem to be a risk factor for severe barotrauma. The results made it possible to determine a patient’s fitness to fly and any restrictions. The published studies on the resumption of flight for patients who have nasal polyposis and our experience suggest that nasal polyposis may allow a safe pursuit of aviation activity.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arterial gas embolism (AGE) may occur while breathing compressed air and failing to exhale during ascent to compensate for gas expansion as pressure decreases. Trauma to the lungs from over-pressurization may result in air bubbles entering the pulmonary veins and subsequently the systemic circulation, causing obstructed blood flow and inflammatory cascades. AGEs are known to always manifest within 10 min of surfacing from depth. In underwater egress training (UET), which is mandatory for U.S. Marines, service members learn to escape from a tilt-wing or rotor aircraft after it submerges and inverts in water. CASE REPORT: We report a case of cerebral AGE in which the victim experienced neurological symptoms more than 1 h after completing UET at a depth between only 3.28–6.56 ft (1–2 m). The patient was treated with a U.S. Navy Treatment Table 6 and experienced complete resolution of symptoms. DISCUSSION: This case is one of only two AGEs reported with symptom onset occurring after 10 min of surfacing from depth to be published. AGE at depths between 1–2 m has only been reported on three other occasions, and dysbarism injuries during UET are also exceedingly rare. This case demonstrates a situation in which all three events occurred, highlighting the need for increased awareness and clinical consideration of delayed AGE in similar scenarios despite the commonly held belief that AGEs do not occur outside of 10 min of surfacing.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has recently revised assessment pathways for applicants with attentional problems because of an increasing recognition that ADHD is a clinical condition with a broad symptom spectrum; some individuals may have a historical diagnosis which has been in remission for several years, while others may be using psychostimulants to enhance mental focus. This commentary compares major depression as a reference and its Federal Aviation Administration certification/clearance policy with those policies associated with ADHD. Major depression can be considered a model example of a mental disorder where appropriate treatment strategies such as medication have been demonstrated not to have adverse effects upon aviation safety. We wish to highlight that when reviewing certification and assessment practice guidelines for the assessment of pilots with ADHD, decisions must be based upon robust scientific evidence that has been obtained in aviation.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Undiagnosed depression in the aviation industry can have catastrophic consequences such as aircraft-assisted suicide. Depression is often underreported, especially when subjects are aware they are reporting on depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether scores on a depression screening tool would vary if it was disguised as a “life stress” questionnaire in a sample of Australian commercial pilots. METHODS: A total of 109 subjects were assigned into either a “Life Stress” survey or a “Depression” survey, both containing the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales depression screening tool among other questions relating to either depression or stress to determine any variation in depression scores. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in which the covert group that completed a “life-stress” survey scored higher average depression scores than the control group completing an overt depression inventory. Prevalence of depression was consistent with the general population, with 25% of pilots meeting the threshold for depression within the control group, and this number increased to 41% when using a covert measure to assess depression. DISCUSSION: This research adds further weight to the potential underreporting of depression in pilots as a function of stigma and fear associated with the label “depression”. Regulators and organizations must proactively minimize exposure to psychological harm, negating the reliance on self-reporting to control psychological risk and recruitment methods must aim to reduce bias against those with disabilities. Nonpunitive environments for pilots to self-assess and report psychological issues will allow better outcomes from expedited treatment. Minnock SDT, Thomas MJW.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ejection seats are designed to be a lifesaving device for aircrew in emergencies. Modern ejection seats are widely prevalent in fighter and bomber aircraft and are occasionally associated with acceleration injury from axial loading (G z ) during the catapult phase of ejection, limb flail injury due to windblast, or parachute landing fall, especially if the ejection is outside of the seat’s performance envelope. CASE REPORT: We present the first known case in the medical literature of a military pilot who survived a low-altitude, high-angulation (&gt;90° of bank angle) ejection where the pilot’s ejection seat parachute did not deploy due to contact with the ground before completion of the ejection sequence. The patient’s initial exam upon arrival at a trauma center was significant for a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3T, with evidence of cranial and extremity trauma. The patient presented with respiratory acidosis and required upsizing of his endotracheal tube placed in the field. The patient’s injury list included bilateral subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages, a Hangman’s fracture, spinal burst fractures, and extensive extremity fractures. After a prolonged hospital stay, the patient was discharged to rehabilitation. The patient made a functional and neurological recovery, including return to independent completion of his activities of daily living. DISCUSSION: This case provides evidence of favorable outcome after a low-altitude, high-angulation ejection without parachute deployment. This case details the medical and traumatic pathology medical personnel should expect from an ejection that occurs outside of the seat’s performance envelope.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: As military environments integrate more complex technological systems, operators increasingly require more assistance from automation. When used properly, automation can significantly enhance performance; however, proper use is predicated on the operator’s trust in the automation (TIA). TIA, like trust among people, is influenced by biological, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects. While options for measuring TIA have rapidly expanded in the past decade, there has been little consideration for how well these measures perform in operational environments. METHODS: A 10-yr literature review was conducted to identify TIA measures and rate their appropriateness for operational aeromedical environments. Articles from Google Scholar, EBSCO, and the Defense Technical Information Center databases were included, focusing on user-reported, physiological, and behavioral measures. Study quality was rated by aeromedical research scientists, while aeromedical appropriateness was evaluated by rated military pilots. Measures were categorized as High Recommendation, Cautious Recommendation, or Not Recommended based on these evaluations. RESULTS: Of the measures reviewed, 28 were recommended for operational use, 23 received cautious recommendations, and 6 were not recommended. The recommended measures demonstrated high research quality and suitability for aeromedical environments. The cautious recommendations highlighted measures with specific limitations that need to be considered in operational settings, while the not recommended measures lacked sufficient evidence for reliable use in these contexts. DISCUSSION: Several high-quality TIA measures appear suitable for operational aeromedical settings. While these recommendations offer a starting point for testing TIA in aeromedical settings, further research is required to test how well these measures perform in an operational environment.

METHODS: Using the public National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) accident database from January 1, 2001, through August 31, 2018, a regression model was developed to identify factors that may predict Chute use. RESULTS: In accidents occurring after January 1, 2013, pilots were 5 times more likely to use the Chute, while 2.9 times less likely to use the Chute when the accident involved pilot-related causes. The presence of passengers did not predict Chute use. Injuries were likely to be more severe when the Chute was used outside the Chute altitude envelope. DISCUSSION: In contrast to General Aviation (GA) overall, accidents outcomes in aircraft equipped with a Chute have seen great improvements between 2013 and 2018, with increased use of the Chute and improved injury outcomes. Results suggest that changes to pilot training in 2012 have increased the social acceptance of Chute use. Results highlight increased risk of injury outcomes for Chute use in accidents that occur outside the Chute altitude envelope. Kirby J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In Canada, aviators and seafarers are required to be medically fit by international and domestic standards to be issued a medical certificate by Transport Canada (TC). In the event of denial or restriction, individuals have the right to a review by an independent decision-maker with medical expertise/training in marine and/or aviation medicine. This paper presents the results of cases submitted to the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada over 19 yr. METHODS: The Tribunal’s repository of medical records was searched and 112 adjudicated cases were reviewed. RESULTS: Since 2000, 55 (49%) cases were in the aviation sector and, since 2010, 57 (51%) cases were in the marine sector. The mean age of applicants was 49 and 54 yr for seafarers and pilots, respectively. Mental illness, cardiovascular disease, visual, and neurological disease were the most common reasons for a medical certificate restriction/denial. The Tribunal upheld the refusal to issue or renew a medical certificate in 89 (79%) cases and 23 (21%) cases were referred back to TC. CONCLUSIONS: Mental illness is the most frequent diagnosis that precipitates a request. The international literature is sparse on the number, causes, and results of the appeal process. Our findings and the application of the medical standards in Canada are generally comparable with those of the United Kingdom. It was not possible to make more than indirect comparisons to those of the United States. Brooks C, MacDonald C. Medical cases adjudicated by the Transportation Appeal Tribunal of Canada: 2000–2018 .

METHODS: We conducted a survey of cabin crew to identify the anticipated use of GBMS in 2017. We compared the anticipated use to actual use as reported in cabin crew records submitted to the GBMS team and cabin crew logs from May 2013 to April 2016. RESULTS: Among 766 team leaders and assistant leaders, 211 individuals answered the questionnaire. A total of 915 instances of GBMS use were reported during the study period. There were no significant differences between anticipated and actual use in terms of the reasons for needing GBMS, with medication prescription being the most common reason. However, there were significant differences in the specific symptoms that triggered contact with GBMS. Pediatric and digestive symptoms were under-predicted, while neuropsychiatric and cardiac symptoms were over-predicted. DISCUSSION: Cabin crew tended to require GBMS to assist with pediatric and digestive conditions more often than anticipated. Furthermore, digestive and pediatric symptoms often require prescription medications. Kim JH, Choi-Kwon S. Ground-based medical services for in-flight emergencies .

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study was intended to determine the effect of skin cooling on breath-hold duration and predicted emergency air supply duration during immersion. METHODS: While wearing a helicopter transport suit with a dive mask, 12 subjects (29 ± 10 yr, 78 ± 14 kg, 177 ± 7 cm, 2 women) were studied in 8 and 20°C water. Subjects performed a maximum breath-hold, then breathed for 90 s (through a mouthpiece connected to room air) in five skin-exposure conditions. The first trial was out of water for Control (suit zipped, hood on, mask off). Four submersion conditions included exposure of the: Partial Face (hood and mask on); Face (hood on, mask off); Head (hood and mask off); and Whole Body (suit unzipped, hood and mask off). RESULTS: Decreasing temperature and increasing skin exposure reduced breath-hold time (to as low as 10 ± 4 s), generally increased minute ventilation (up to 40 ± 15 L · min −1 ), and decreased predicted endurance time (PET) of a 55-L helicopter underwater emergency breathing apparatus. In 8°C water, PET decreased from 2 min 39 s (Partial Face) to 1 min 11 s (Whole Body). CONCLUSION: The most significant factor increasing breath-hold and predicted survival time was zipping up the suit. Face masks and suit hoods increased thermal comfort. Therefore, wearing the suits zipped with hoods on and, if possible, donning the dive mask prior to crashing, may increase survivability. The results have important applications for the education and preparation of helicopter occupants. Thermal protective suits and dive masks should be provided.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The current U.S. Army aviator anthropometric screening process for rotary-wing cockpit compatibility was codified over 30 yr ago. Critical to the process are the anthropometric standards that define what is acceptable for U.S. Army flight school applicants. The purpose of this study was to assess and optimize the efficiency of the standards in screening for anthropometric cockpit compatibility while maintaining safety. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed. Anthropometry and disposition data of flight school applicants from 2005 to 2014 were taken from the Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office database to determine efficiency of the process. Data on mishaps from 1972 to 2017 were retrieved from the Risk Management Information System database to determine the safety benchmark of the existing process, to which adjusted standards would be held. Adjustments to standards were modeled that would more efficiently pass applicants over the period studied without exceeding the established acceptable safety level. RESULTS: There were 40,136 (98.28%) applicants who passed the standards, while 702 (1.72%) failed. Most (98.52%) applicants who failed the standards and applied for an anthropometry exception to policy (ETP) received one. The models would pass up to 396 (99.25%) applicants who received ETPs without exceeding the established number of mishaps attributable to the anthropometry standards, which was found to be zero. DISCUSSION: The screening process is efficient and effective, but could be improved. Adjusting the standards could increase process efficiency by passing more applicants during their flight physical and widening the applicant pool, while maintaining the current level of safety.

METHODS: In altitude chamber, 66 male pilots were exposed to 7000 and 7500 m. Heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were continuously monitored. Psychomotor performance was assessed using the computational task. The hypoxic symptoms were investigated by a questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean duration time of hypoxia was 323.0 56.5 s at 7000 m and 218.2 63.3 s at 7500 m. The 6-min hypoxia training was completed by 57.6% of the pilots and 6.1% of the pilots at 7000 m and at 7500 m, respectively. There were no significant differences in pilots heart rates and psychomotor performance between the two exposures. The S p o 2 response at 7500 m was slightly severer than that at 7000 m. During the 7000 m exposure, pilots experienced almost the same symptoms and similar frequency order as those during the 7500 m exposure. CONCLUSIONS: There were concordant symptoms, psychomotor performance, and very similar physiological responses between 7000 m and 7500 m during hypoxia training. The results indicated that 7000-m hypoxia awareness training might be an alternative to 7500-m hypoxia training with lower DCS risk and longer experience time.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Hypergolic propellants can be released in large amounts during space launch contingencies. Whether propellant-contaminated suit fabric poses a significant risk to rescue crews, due to off-gassing, has not been explored in detail. In this study, we addressed this issue experimentally, exposing space suit fabric to propellants (dinitrogen tetroxide [N 2 O 4 ] and monomethyl hydrazine [MMH]). METHODS : The NASA Space Shuttle Program Advanced Crew Escape System II (ACES II) is similar to the NASA Orion Crew Survival System (OCSS) and was utilized here. Suit fabric was placed and sealed into permeation cells. Fabric exterior surface was exposed to constant concentrated hypergolics, simulating permeation and leakage. Fabric was rinsed, and permeation and off-gassing kinetics were measured. Experimental parameters were selected, simulating suited flight crewmembers during an evacuation transport without cabin air flow. RESULTS : The fabric allows for immediate permeation of liquid or vaporized MMH and N 2 O 4 . NO 2 off-gassing never exceeded the AEGL-1 8-h level (acute exposure guideline level). In contrast, MMH off-gassing levels culminated in peak levels, approaching AEGL-2 10-min levels, paralleling the drying process of the fabric layers. DISCUSSION : Our findings demonstrate that MMH off-gassing is promoted by the drying of suit material in a delayed fashion, resulting in MMH concentrations having the potential for adverse health effects for flight and rescue crews. This indicates that shorter decontamination times could be implemented, provided that suit material is either kept moist to prevent off-gassing or removed prior to medical evacuation. Additional studies using OCSS or commercial crew suits might be needed in the future. Schwertz H, Roth LA, Woodard D. Propellant off-gassing and implications for triage and rescue.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased frequencies of physiological episodes have been a significant concern for Naval Aviation for the last several years. These include several aircraft platforms, but no previously documented E-2D Hawkeye events. This report documents an episode in an E-2D, with multiple aircrew affected at the same time. CASE REPORT: While deployed aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier, five E-2D Hawkeyes aircrew were simultaneously exposed to the same over-pressurization during a routine sortie. Out of the five aircrew, four immediately reported hypoxic-like neurocognitive symptoms of mental slowing, difficulty concentrating, and headache. They were evaluated and treated using standard protocol according to the Physiologic Event Clinical Practice Guidelines set by the Naval Safety Center. All aircrew were treated with 100% ground level oxygen with resolution of symptoms. DISCUSSION: Although rare, physiological events may occur in multipassenger platforms such as the E-2D Hawkeye. Utilizing and strictly adhering to standard clinical practice guidelines provided an efficient process of evaluation by different flight surgeons concurrently that avoided a possible delay in treatment. After, eliminating other potential etiology for the crews symptoms, a pressure-related mechanism of injury appears to be the most probable cause. Ko SY, Rice GM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study sought to determine the incidence, severity, and time-course of simulator sickness (SS) among Asian military pilots following flight simulator training. METHODS: A survey was conducted on Republic of Singapore Air Force pilots undergoing simulator training. Each subject completed a questionnaire immediately after (0H), and at the 3-h (3H) and 6-h (6H) marks. The questionnaire included the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) and a subjective scale to rate their confidence to fly. RESULTS: In this study, 258 pilots with a median age of 31.50 yr (range, 2155 yr) and mean age of 32.61 6.56 yr participated. The prevalence of SS was 48.1% at 0H, 30.8% at 3H, and 16.4% at 6H. Based on a threshold of an SSQ score &gt;10, the prevalence of operationally significant SS was 33.3% at 0H, 13.2% at 3H, and 8.1% at 6H. The most frequent symptoms were fatigue (38.1%), eye strain (29.0%), and fullness of head (19.9%). There was no significant difference in mean scores between rotary and fixed wing pilots. Older, more experienced pilots had greater scores at 0H, but this association did not persist. A correlation was found between SSQ score and self-reported confidence. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to report the prevalence of operationally significant SS in Asian military pilots over serial time points. Most pilots with SS are able to subjectively judge their fitness to fly. Sensitivity analysis suggests the true prevalence of SS symptoms at 3H and 6H to be closer to 23.8% and 12.0%, respectively.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a global health problem with gradually increasing prevalence. No large-scale, systematic, and comprehensive study on AR among civil aviation aircrew of China has been reported. We aimed to demonstrate the prevalence of and risk factors for self-reported AR among Chinese civil aviation aircrew. METHODS: This study randomly surveyed 4059 civil aviation aircrew members from 12 cities in mainland China. A structured questionnaire was tailored, designed, and electronically delivered to all participants. Based on self-reported results, prevalence of and risk factors for AR were calculated/analyzed. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported AR was 23.38%. Among aircrew members, 10.37% presented with ear barotraumas, whereas 9.95% reported symptom aggravation during flight. Of aircrew members, 10.32% had symptoms related to flight duration, whereas 4.43% of symptoms related to flight altitude. Significant differences between rhinorrhea and sneezing, as well as between nasal itching and sneezing, were observed in the Total Nasal Symptoms Scores (TNSS). The Rhino-conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) showed significant correlation between each section. TNSS was significantly related to RQLQ. Both TNSS and RQLQ significantly correlated with flight time. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of self-reported AR among civil aviation aircrew is higher than the general population in China. The severity of nasal symptoms and complications are significantly associated with quality of life and flying duties. Bai Y, Hu M, Ma F, Liu K, Xu H, Wu X, Wang H.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Short-term fluid loading is used as part of post-spaceflight medical procedures and clinical treatment in hospitals. Hypervolemia with hemodilution induced by rapid fluid infusion reportedly impaired dynamic cerebral autoregulation. However, the effects on intracranial pressure (ICP) remain unknown. Therefore, we estimated ICP noninvasively (nICP) to examine whether rapid fluid infusion would raise ICP.METHODS: Twelve healthy male volunteers underwent two discrete normal saline (NS) infusions (15 and 30 ml · kg-1 stages, NS-15 and NS-30, respectively) at a rate of 100 ml · min-1. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity (CBFv) waveform from the middle cerebral artery obtained by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was recorded, as was the arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform at the radial artery obtained by tonometry. We then used these waveforms to calculate nICP, cerebral artery compliance, and the pulsatility index (PI) in an intracranial hydraulic model.RESULTS: nICP increased significantly in both infusion stages from preinfusion (preinfusion: 7.6 ± 3.4 mmHg; NS-15: 10.9 ± 3.3 mmHg; NS-30: 11.7 ± 4.2 mmHg). No significant changes were observed in cerebral artery compliance or PI. Although ABP did not change in any stage, CBFv increased significantly (preinfusion: 67 ± 10 cm · s-1; NS-15: 72 ± 12 cm · s-1; NS-30: 73 ± 12 cm · s-1).DISCUSSION: Hypervolemia with hemodilution induced by rapid fluid infusion caused increases in nICP and CBFv. No changes were observed in cerebral artery compliance or PI related to cerebrovascular impedance. These findings suggest that rapid fluid infusion may raise ICP with increased CBF.Kurazumi T, Ogawa Y, Takko C, Kato T, Konishi T, Iwasaki K.

In various air forces the causes for medical disqualification of Flight Academy candidates are different, mainly due to differences in the selection process and criteria. In the present study, we examined the medical conditions leading to disqualification of candidates for the IAF Flight Academy.METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 3281 military Flight Academy candidates who underwent medical evaluation in the IAF Aeromedical Center between June 2016 and March 2018. For each disqualified candidate, we examined the cause or causes for disqualification divided into categories.RESULTS: Out of 3281 Flight Academy candidates, 519 candidates (15.8%) were disqualified. The most prevalent cause for disqualification were ophthalmological conditions, which constituted more than half of the disqualifications (55.0%). Among the ophthalmological conditions, nonsatisfactory visual acuity constituted more than half (57.4%). The following most prevalent causes were asthma (7.9%), allergic rhinitis (7.3%), renal and urinary conditions, and otolaryngologic conditions (5.2% each).DISCUSSION: The leading cause for disqualification of Flight Academy candidates was ophthalmological conditions, similar to other air forces.

This study aims to determine the prevalence of hyperuricemia in civil pilots in Indonesia and the identification of risk factors for hyperuricemia in civil pilots in Indonesia.METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional method from the medical records of civil pilots at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, who were examined on 1 November 2019 through 30 April 2020. Data collected from medical records included: laboratory data of uric acid, age, total flight hours, Body Mass Index (BMI), and alcohol consumption. Hyperuricemia is a plasma urate concentration > 420 µmol · L-1(7 mg · dl-1).RESULTS: The research sample amounted to 5202 pilots; 18.4% had hyperuricemia. Pilots who have total flight hours ≥5000 have a reduced risk of hyperuricemia by 24% compared to pilots with total flight hours <5000. Obese and overweight pilots had a 2.98 times and 1.36 times, respectively, greater risk of hyperuricemia than pilots who had a normal BMI. Based on BMI criteria classification of WHO Asia Pacific, obese is ≥25 and overweight is 23-24.9. Furthermore, compared to pilots who did not consume alcohol, pilots who consumed alcohol had a 14.68 times greater risk of developing hyperuricemia.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hyperuricemia in civil pilots in Indonesia is 18.4%.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effectiveness and identified the cutoff values of the computer-based Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue (CFM-100) test for screening color vision deficiencies in the pre-employment examination of civil aviators in China.METHODS: Firstly, subjects were stratified into normal, color weakness, and color blindness with the Ishihara pseudoisochromatic plate test (IPPT) by two ophthalmologists. Then they randomly completed CFM-100 and Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue (FM-100) tests. Total error scores (TES) and the time taken for the CFM-100 and FM-100 were analyzed and the cutoff values for the CFM-100 were determined.RESULTS: Of 218 subjects, 159 were normal while 59 were diagnosed with dyschromatopsia. The TES of the CFM-100 were congruent with those of the FM-100 (20.0 ± 18.8 vs. 20.6 ± 17.7, 160.9 ± 66.0 vs. 151.1 ± 66.4). The testing time for the CFM-100, however, was less than the FM-100 (10.3 ± 2.8 min vs. 12.9 ± 2.9 min, 7.8 ± 2.5 min vs. 12.6 ± 3.3 min). The correlation coefficient R was 0.93 and Cohen's kappa was 0.89 for the two methods. Further analyses defined 34 as the cutoff value to differentiate excellent from fair color discrimination (sensitivity 58.0%, specificity 94.7%) and 101 as the cutoff value to judge fair vs. poor (sensitivity and specificity both 98.8%) for the CFM-100. The cut-off value was 72 for distinguishing normal from defective color vision (sensitivity 96.6%, specificity 98.7%) and 110 was for distinguishing color weakness from color blindness (sensitivity 97.6%, specificity 97.7%) for the CFM-100.CONCLUSIONS: The CFM-100 is an effective method for the diagnosis of dyschromatopsia with high sensitivity in screening airline pilots.Zhang Y, Ma J, Cheng S, Hu W.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Head tracking movements are common in interceptive tasks. The benefits of these movements are unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare coincidence anticipation timing (CAT) responses for a simulated approaching object when the eyes were used in tracking the object and when the head was used in tracking the object. METHODS: A total of 29 subjects participated. A Bassin Anticipation Timer consisting of a track of sequentially illuminated lights was used to simulate an approaching object at velocities of 223 cm · s −1 to 894 cm · s −1 . Each velocity was used 10 times under 2 conditions. In one condition, subjects were told to turn the eyes with the stimulus. In the other condition, subjects viewed the stimulus through apertures and were told to turn the head with the stimulus. Subjects pushed a button to coincide with illumination of the final light on the track. RESULTS: Signed CAT errors, unsigned CAT errors, and variable CAT errors were compared between the head movement (HM) and eye movement (EM) conditions. No significant differences were noted for the signed errors (mean signed error at 894 cm · s −1 ; 10.3 ± 75.4 ms (HM), −16.1 ± 51.0 ms (EM). However, the unsigned and variable errors were significantly larger at some stimulus velocities in the head movement condition [mean unsigned error at 894 cm · s −1 : 82.6.0 ± 45.9 ms (HM), 59.0 ± 22.4 ms (EM); mean variable error at 894 cm · s −1 ; 78.0 ± 37.8 ms (HM), 49.2 ± 17.1ms (EM)]. DISCUSSION: Head movement did not result in improved CAT performance compared to eye movements. Further work will be required to determine whether these results are generalizable to situations where head tracking is required but apertures are not worn. Ross E, Kinney M, Fogt N.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The previous Spacecraft Maximal Allowable Concentrations (SMACs) for propylene glycol were established based on a study of rodents exposed to propylene glycol (PG) aerosol for 6 h/d, 5 d/wk for 90 d. This study has been used as the basis for the few existing limits, but all exposure concentrations were well above the saturated vapor concentration of ∼100 ppm for pure propylene glycol at room temperature. For this reason, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry noted that the method used to generate the aerosols for the two published studies of animal exposures are not relevant to exposure conditions for the general public, and most regulatory agencies have not established inhalation limits for propylene glycol, citing lack of data. Since publication of the PG SMACs in 2008, an acute inhalation study was conducted in healthy human subjects which allows us to revise our assessment. This manuscript provides the rationale for increasing the prior limits for PG in spacecraft air from 32 and 17 ppm to 64 and 32 ppm for off-nominal scenarios/releases (1-h and 24-h limits) and from 9, 3, and 1.5 ppm to 32 ppm for all nominal timeframes (7, 30, and 180 d). Due to a lack of longer-term exposure data, NASA has elected to eliminate the 1000-d SMAC limit at this time.Ryder VE, Williams ES. Revisions to limits for propylene glycol in spacecraft air.

ATCs working a 3-shift pattern presented an efficient performance and fewer perseverative errors in the WCST (3-shift: -0.63 ± 0.38 vs. 4-shift: -0.45 ± 0.43), that did not rise to significance. In a comparison between executive brain functions and technical qualifications, the controllers who worked in the TWR (Aerodrome Control Tower) only, and those who worked in both the TWR and APP (Approach Control Service) showed no differences in the number of completed categories and in perseverative errors.DISCUSSION:The executive brain functioning of the ATCs, such as mental flexibility, strategic planning and inhibitory control, were identified as being above average when compared to the general population. While alterations in work shifts appear to have a negative (but nonsignificant) impact, newer ATCs showed stronger scores than more experienced ATCs on the WCST.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modafinil, as a wake-promoting agent, is commonly used to relieve fatigue during military operations. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding the effects of modafinil on the equilibrium and vestibular organs, especially when prescribing this drug to flight crewmembers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the equilibrium- and vestibular-related safety effects of modafinil. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 10 healthy male volunteers received a single 200-mg oral dose of modafinil or placebo. Equilibrium and vestibular functions were assessed 2 h after oral administration by the sensory organization test (SOT), adaptation test (ADT), and video head impulse test (v-HIT). RESULTS: There was no change in the equilibrium scores of the six SOT conditions or the composite scores between the modafinil and placebo groups. Statistically significant differences were not observed for the sway energy score (SES) in the toe-down test. In the toe-up test, the SES decreased by 16.7% in the modafinil group relative to the placebo group in trial 2, while the differences in other trials were not statistically significant. In the v-HIT, there was no significant difference in the gain of each semicircular canal between the two groups. DISCUSSION: A single 200-mg dose of modafinil did not cause any impairment to vestibular function, equilibrium ability, or adaptive balance response; in fact, modafinil might have a positive effect on adaptation function in healthy volunteers. These findings preliminarily suggest that there is no hidden risk of vestibular dysfunction among aviation employees using modafinil. Liu F, Zhang M, Chen T, Zhai L, Zhang Z, Xue J.

They include both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, an aspect that allows for a comparison of these two types of aircraft in similar operations.METHODS: A total of 95 accident reports from 2008 until 2018 were extracted from the NTSB online database, with each mentioning commercial sightseeing as their operation.RESULTS: Out of a total of 95 accidents, 16 were fatal with a total of 58 people suffering fatal injuries. On average 3.625 people died in each fatal accident. There were significantly more accidents in Alaska and Hawaii than expected. There were significantly more accidents caused by the maintenance crew in helicopters than in airplanes, but significantly more pilot-related accidents in fixed-wing aircraft compared to helicopters. Despite favorable light and weather conditions, 37 accidents reported the environment as a contributing factor to the accident.CONCLUSION: Sightseeing accidents show a pronounced difference between helicopters and airplane accidents that point to different approaches when improving safety in either category. Although night and instrument meteorological conditions are largely absent in the dataset, wind conditions and unsuitable terrain are frequently mentioned. The experience of the pilots and the specific geography of the sightseeing area are likely to affect operational safety the most. The specific dangers of unsuitable terrain affect both helicopters and fixed-wing operations and may be assuaged by specific training or briefings.de Voogt AJ, Hummel Hohl C, Kalagher H.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The practice of self-medication among military fighter aircrew could compromise flight safety because of the adverse effects that can occur in flight. However, data on this subject is scarce. The aim of this study was to identify the determinants of the practice in this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among the French Air Force fighter aircrew based on an anonymous questionnaire distributed electronically. The questions included personal characteristics, opinions, and relations with the healthcare domain as well as the use of self-medication in general and before a flight. RESULTS: Between March and November 2020, 170 questionnaires were reviewed for an overall return rate of approximately 34%. Our data showed an absolute self-medication rate of 97.6%, but the frequency of its use was rare or nonexistent in 53.5% of cases. Factors associated with a more frequent use of self-medication were the function of pilot, age under 35, having a regular prescription, lacking intentionality toward getting enough sleep, having confidence in the medical profession, and some specific clinical situations. The consumption of 97 medications was recorded and 49 before a flight. DISCUSSION: Despite the limitations due to the design of this survey, results suggest that the use of self-medication in fighter aircrews is a reality, but that the frequency of its use is less common. This practice is probably the result of a complex interaction between many personal factors. However, its impact on flight safety remains uncertain. du Baret de Limé M, Monin J, Leschiera J, Duquet J, Manen O, Chiniard T. Self-medication among military fighter aircrews .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Occupational hazards facing high performance aircraft pilots (\"fighter\" pilots) can cause injury, time lost from flying, and voluntary or involuntary career termination. The high cost of training and retaining fighter pilots has spurred interest in the cost effectiveness of preventative and rehabilitative health solutions.METHODS: We investigated the potential cost effectiveness of a 5-yr, $24.9M U.S. preventative health program using equivalent annual worth (EAW) analysis. The program benefits were assessed with a combination of actual and estimated medical cost data and projected pilot retention improvement rates. Sensitivity analysis of variables such as discount rate, medical cost avoidance, and pilot retention improvement rate was conducted.RESULTS: Annualized costs of approximately $5M U.S. were used as the basis of comparison for annualized benefits. A medical cost database was searched to find expected annual direct medical (outpatient) costs related to injury of roughly $531K U.S. for the pilots covered by the program. Using Centers for Disease Control recommendations, approximately $4.7M U.S. was estimated to be the annual work loss cost. The program would presumably reduce a significant portion of these annual costs, but not all. Assuming various proportions of reduced costs by the program, the EAW was found to be consistently negative. However, when pilot retention improvement is included, EAW is positive using conservative assumptions.DISCUSSION: While outpatient and work loss costs will unlikely be completely covered by preventative health programs in this context, a minor improvement in pilot retention (about 1-3 additional retentions per year) produces a net positive annual benefit.Erneston CG, Fass RD, Ritschel JD, Cox AM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sympathetic stimulation is known to be associated with transient alterations of blood glucose (BG) concentration; spaceflight acceleration may be similarly associated with alterations of BG, potentially posing a risk to diabetic individuals engaging in future spaceflight activities. Despite prior studies demonstrating diabetic subjects' tolerance to centrifuge-simulated spaceflight, data are lacking regarding blood glucose response to hypergravity. It remains unclear whether hypergravity or associated physiological response may pose a risk to diabetics. Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) offer a means of noninvasive glucose monitoring and may be useful in spaceflight and analog environments. Here, we describe the results of continuous glucose monitoring during centrifuge-simulated spaceflight.METHODS: Subjects participated in 1-5 centrifuge-simulated spaceflight profiles (maximum +4.0 Gz, +6.0 Gx, 6.1 G resultant). Data collection included heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, continuous glucose via CGM, intermittent fingerstick BG, and postrun questionnaires regarding symptoms related to hypergravity exposure.RESULTS: CGM data were collected from 26 subjects, including 4 diabetics. While diabetic subjects had significantly higher BG compared to nondiabetics, this was not associated with any difference in symptoms or tolerance. Transient hypergravity-associated CGM glucose alterations did not affect tolerance of the centrifuge experience. CGM data were found to be reliable with occasional exceptions, including four instances of false critical low glucose alarms.DISCUSSION: While further study is necessary to better characterize CGM fidelity during hypergravity and other spaceflight-related stressors, CGM may be a feasible option for spaceflight and analog settings. As in prior studies, individuals with well-controlled diabetes appear able to tolerate the accelerations anticipated for commercial spaceflight.Ong KM, Rossitto JJ, Ray K, Dufurrena QA, Blue RS.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Catheter ablation is a widely used and effective treatment option for many tachyarrhythmic disorders. This study analyzes all ablation cases in German military aircrew over a 17-yr period. Recurrence of different arrhythmias and ablation complications were analyzed with an aim of refining specific recommendations for aircrew employment.METHODS: All cases of catheter ablations in pilots and nonpilot aircrew examined at the German Air Force Centre of Aerospace Medicine from 2004 to 2020 were analyzed for sex, age, concomitant diseases, ablated arrhythmias, complications, recurrences, time elapsed from ablation to reablation, number of ablations, and aeromedical disposition, including restrictions in case of a return to flying duties.RESULTS: There were 36 aircrew who underwent catheter ablation; 7 were ablated for 2 or more different arrhythmias; 10 underwent more than one ablation. Ablated arrhythmias included atrioventricular (AV) nodal re-entrant tachycardias, accessory pathways, focal atrial tachycardias, typical and atypical atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and premature atrial and ventricular complexes. Recurrence rates differed between the arrhythmias and were lowest in AV re-entrant tachycardias. Complication rates were low.CONCLUSION: In this aircrew cohort, nearly all aircrew were able to return to flying duties following ablation, albeit some with restrictions. Restrictions depended on the underlying arrhythmia, the ablation procedure, and the symptoms prior to ablation. A basic understanding of different arrhythmias, ablation techniques, and long-term success rates is essential for the AME and for the responsible licensing authority. Close cooperation with an electrophysiologist is necessary prior to and after ablation to ensure optimal management of aircrew with arrythmias.Guettler N, Nicol E, Sammito S.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the well-being of professional pilots using a survey that included the World Health Organization (WHO)-5 Well-Being Index.METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to pilots between June 17-August 2, 2021. Pilots self-categorized as: airline transport pilot (ATP), commercial pilot, or both. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate differences between variables. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of impaired well-being.RESULTS: A total of 639 individuals returned the survey. The majority of respondents were ATPs and a majority identified as male. The average well-being score was 68.0 out of 100 possible, with 22% of respondents meeting the threshold definition of impaired well-being. The odds of having impaired well-being were not dependent on gender. In unadjusted analysis, the odds of impaired well-being were higher for those flying as commercial pilots as compared to airline transport pilots/both. Age was also strongly associated with impaired well-being, with younger pilots having greater odds of impaired well-being as compared to older pilots. Only a little over half of the surveyed pilots agreed or strongly agreed that pilot risk of occupational exposure to COVID-19 was appropriately controlled.CONCLUSION: This survey suggests an important connection between pilot age and impaired well-being scores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies targeting the well-being of younger pilots will be of interest. Additionally, measures to reduce occupational risk of COVID-19 exposure may be helpful in view of the substantial fraction of pilots expressing concern regarding that risk.Stratton E, Haddon R, Murad MH, Petterson T, Nelson M, Cowl CT.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Stereopsis is usually required in military aviators and may become increasingly important with reliance on newer technologies such as binocular Helmet-Mounted Displays (HMDs) and stereo displays. The current stereo test used to qualify UK military aircrew (TNO test) has many limitations. To address these limitations, two computer-based digital versions of a random dot stereogram (RDS) were developed: a static version (dRDS-S), and a version in which the dots appear to move dynamically within the depth plane (dRDS-D), both capable of measuring stereo acuity to threshold. METHODS: There were 41 participants who performed all 3 stereo tests, TNO and both digital dRDS tests, on two separate occasions. RESULTS: The best (lowest) mean stereo acuity threshold was measured with dRDS-S (33.79 arcseconds, range 12.64–173) and the worst mean stereo acuity thresholds were measured with the TNO test (91 arcseconds, range 60–240). Both dRDS tests were strongly correlated, but neither correlated with the TNO test. Both dRDS tests were more reliable, as indicated with tighter limits of agreement. DISCUSSION: With a large floor effect at 60 arcseconds, the TNO test was unable to characterize any finer degree of stereo acuity. Both dRDS tests demonstrated better test-retest reliability and addressed many of the limitations seen with the TNO test. The dRDS tests were not correlated with the TNO test, which suggests that the TNO test does not provide the accuracy or reliability for use as a meaningful aeromedical screening test. The dRDS tests will enable research to investigate the relationship between stereo acuity and operational performance. Posselt BN, Seemiller E, Winterbottom M, Baber C, Hadley S.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease, now complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic, remains a leading cause of death and risk for sudden incapacitation for pilots during flight. The capacity for aeromedically significant cardiovascular sequelae with potentially imperceptible clinical symptoms elicits concern both during and following resolution of acute COVID-19 in pilots. OBJECTIVE: We summarize the current state of knowledge regarding COVID-19 cardiovascular implications as applied to the aviation environment to better understand their significance toward flight safety and application toward a focused cardiovascular screening protocol following recovery from infection. METHODS: A narrative review of the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 infection was performed using the PubMed literature search engine and existing organizational guidelines. In addition, to established medical aviation benchmarks, surrogate populations examined included high performance athletes (as a correlate for high G-forces), and scuba divers (as an environmental work analog). Conditions of primary concern included myocardial injury, proarrhythmic substrates, risk of sudden death, myopericarditis, pulse orthostatic lability in response to vigorous activity, cardiovagal dysfunction, and thromboembolic disease. LITERATURE REVIEW: Cardiovascular screening guideline recommendations post-infection recovery are suggested based on profile stratification: airperson flight class, tactical military, and aerobatic pilots. This provides an approach to inform aeromedical decision making. CONCLUSION: Aviation medical examiners should remain cognizant of the clinically apparent and occult manifestations of cardiovascular dysfunction associated with COVID-19 infection when applying return-to-work screening guidelines. This will ensure high flight safety standards are maintained and sudden incapacitation risk mitigated during and following the ongoing pandemic.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Different types of remote expeditions often require an expedition crew to conduct medical emergency assessments without prior medical training. Modern technology offers new devices that support diagnosis with a simple guided user instructions interface. It is not yet clear how quickly medically untrained individuals can acquire the required skills with such a device. This study investigated the time and quality of obtained outcomes, as well as the mental workload when using a vital signs monitor and its guided procedure interface during a simulation of a medical emergency event. METHODS: There were 50 individuals (25 medically inexperienced, 25 medically trained) who participated in this study. In a randomized order subjects measured electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and body temperature. The procedure was repeated after a 20-min break. Completion time, data validity, and mental workload were analyzed. RESULTS: Average times to obtain stable and reliable signals of all recorded vital signs were significantly shorter for both groups during the second attempt and for medically experienced individuals in comparison to medically inexperienced individuals. The number of errors did not change between attempts for both groups. The mental workload was higher during the first attempt in both groups for most vital sign acquisitions. DISCUSSION: Automated devices could be easily and quickly used by members of a given expedition, even if the crew lacks advanced medical training. With relatively little training provided by a built-in guidance system, medically untrained individuals can achieve a basic level of proficiency in reliably obtaining valid vital signs.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Real-time cardiovascular imaging during hypergravity exposure has been historically limited by technological and physical challenges. Previous efforts at sonographic hypergravity imaging have used fixed ultrasound probes; the use of hand-held ultrasound, particularly performed by minimally trained laypersons, has been less explored. Here we will discuss handheld sonography to self-visualize carotid vascular and cardiac changes during hypergravity. METHODS: Three subjects with variable ultrasound experience ranging from no familiarity to extensive clinical experience used handheld ultrasound at rest and under stepwise +G z hypergravity exposures (maximum +3.5 G z ) to visualize carotid vascular changes. Subxiphoid cardiac ultrasound was obtained by the most experienced subject. Subjects had variable prior hypergravity experience; all were trained in anti-G straining techniques. Sonographically inexperienced subjects underwent a brief (&lt; 5 min) familiarization with the ultrasound probe, user interface, and desirable viewing window immediately prior to centrifugation; real-time coaching was provided. Ultrasound images were correlated to self-reported symptoms and hemodynamic data. RESULTS: Handheld ultrasound performed as desired; all subjects were successful at obtaining ultrasound images with adequate capture of windows of interest. Subxiphoid imaging efforts were limited by probe overheating and associated with variable quality of imaging due to probe displacement from straining techniques; the subject noted transient, mild discomfort and ecchymosis after imaging in the subxiphoid region. DISCUSSION: Even individuals with minimal or no ultrasound experience successfully obtained usable images under centrifuge conditions. While there were some limitations, this technical demonstration provides initial validation of handheld sonography as an available tool for real-time cardiovascular imaging in a hypergravity environment.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While there are numerous factors that may affect pilot attentional performance, we hypothesize that an increased expiratory work of breathing experienced by fighter pilots may impose a “distraction stimulus” by creating an increased expiratory effort sensation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which increasing expiratory pressure time product or expiratory effort sensation impacts attentional performance. METHODS: Data was collected on 10 healthy participants (age: 29 ± 6 yr). Participants completed six repetitions of a modified Masked Conjunctive Continuous Performance Task protocol while breathing against four different expiratory threshold loads. Repeated measures analysis of variances and generalized additive mixed effects models were used to investigate the effects of expiratory threshold load conditions on expiratory pressure time product, expiratory effort sensation, and the influence of altered end tidal gases on Masked Conjunctive Continuous Performance Task scores. RESULTS: The overall median hit reaction times were significantly longer as the expiratory threshold loads increased. Specific shape-conjunctive and non-conjunctive median hit reaction times were longer with increased expiratory effort sensation. Additionally, increased expiratory effort sensation did not significantly change commission error rates, but did significantly increase omission error rates. DISCUSSION: The findings of our work suggest that both progressively greater expiratory threshold loads during spontaneous breathing and expiratory effort sensation may impair subjects’ attentional performance due to longer reaction times and increased stimuli recognition error rates.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Most airline pilots reported having suffered from sleep disorders and fatigue due to circadian disruption, a potential risk to flight safety. This study attempted to uncover the actual scenario of circadian disruption and working load status among airline pilots. METHODS: In study 1, 21 pilots were invited to participate in a 14-d sleep monitoring and a dual 2-back test to monitor their sleep patterns and cognitive function level. To provide an in-depth view, data from scheduled flights, including 567 airline pilots, was analyzed in Study 2. The present study used cluster analysis to reflect the distribution of the flight scheduling characteristics, including working time and actual working hours. A simulation model was then developed to predict the pilots’ 1-mo sleep-wake pattern. RESULTS: The results indicated that sleep problems were prevalent in this population, especially the night before an earlier morning shift. Regarding the cognitive test, they scored the lowest on earlier morning shifts compared with daytime and evening shifts. It was found that over 70% of the flight schedules can lead to circadian disruption, and 47.44% of the pilots worked under high-load status. DISCUSSION: Airline pilots inevitably work irregular hours and the current policies for coping with circadian disruption seem inefficient. This study thus calls for urgency in improving scheduling and fatigue management systems from the circadian rhythm perspective. Yang SX, Cheng S, Sun Y, Tang X, Huang Z.

    "abstract": "Emergency medical kits (EMK) are provided to clinicians who volunteer on commercial aircraft during a medical emergency. The contents of the EMKs are mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States and, internationally, by the International Civil Aviation Organization and the country of airline origin. The mandatory contents of the kits have not been updated by the Federal Aviation Administration since 2006, and the EMKs continue to lack key equipment such as automated blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, pulse oximeters, and epinephrine autoinjectors. Of further concern is a lack of standardized and centralized reporting for in-flight medical events that, if it existed, could better inform the contents of the kits. This commentary is intended to advocate for an update to the EMKs in the United States given the authors' experiences with in-flight medical events.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Flight attendants are constantly exposed to high-stress environments that could lead to the development of depression. The COVID-19 pandemic brought out new risk factors that could affect flight attendants’ mental health, such as reduced flight hours and fear of the disease itself, which other studies have shown was associated with depression. We aimed to find out whether reduced flight hours, fear of COVID-19, and other factors were associated with depression in flight attendants during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Directorate General Civil Aviation Medical Center Indonesia and Garuda Sentra Medika in 2022. We included flight attendants who were still employed before and after the start of the pandemic. Data were collected using several questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire-12 to screen for depression and Fear of COVID-19 for fear levels. RESULTS: We obtained data from 159 respondents, of whom 25.2% of them had depression. Multivariate analysis showed that the reduction of flight hours 1 yr after the start of the pandemic and fear of COVID-19 were found to significantly increase the likelihood of depression by 2.3 times and 3.9 times, respectively. DISCUSSION: During the pandemic, depression was found to be highly prevalent among flight attendants and was associated with the reduction of flight hours and fear of COVID-19.

    "abstract": "Background: Hot air ballooning incidents are relatively rare, however, when they do occur they are likely to result in a fatality or serious injury. Human error is commonly attributed as the cause of hot air ballooning incidents; however, error in itself is not an explanation for safety failures. This research aims to identify, and establish the relative importance of factors contributing towards hot air ballooning incidents. Methods: Twenty-two Australian Ballooning Federation (ABF) incident reports were thematically coded using a bottom up approach to identify causal factors. Subsequently, 69 balloonists (mean 19.51 years’ experience) participated in a survey to identify additional causal factors and rate (out of seven) the perceived frequency and potential impact to ballooning operations of each of the previously identified causal factors. Perceived associated risk was calculated by multiplying mean perceived frequency and impact ratings. Results: Incident report coding identified 54 causal factors within nine higher level areas: Attributes, Crew resource management, Equipment, Errors, Instructors, Organisational, Physical Environment, Regulatory body and Violations. Overall, ‘weather’, ‘inexperience’ and ‘poor/inappropriate decisions’ were rated as having greatest perceived associated risk. Discussion: Although errors were nominated as a prominent cause of hot air ballooning incidents, physical environment and personal attributes are also particularly important for safe hot air ballooning operations. In identifying a range of causal factors the areas of weakness surrounding ballooning operations have been defined; it is hoped that targeted safety and training strategies can now be put into place removing these contributing factors and reducing the chance of pilot error.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Deep dives using rebreather devices result in oxygen exposures that carry a risk of cerebral oxygen toxicity. Elevation of arterial CO 2 levels increases this risk. CO 2 retention may occur during the deep working phases of dives, but it has not been investigated in ‘real world’ dives at the end of resting decompression when oxygen exposures are peaking, often to levels higher than recommended maxima. METHODS: We conducted an observational field study to measure end tidal CO 2 (P et co 2 ) in divers surfacing after decompression. Sixteen rebreather divers conducted two dives and two completed one dive (a total of 34 dives) to depths ranging from 44–55 msw. Bottom times ranged from 35 to 56 min and time spent on decompression ranged from 40 to 92 min. The first breaths on reaching the surface after removing the rebreather mouthpiece were taken through a portable capnograph. The P et co 2 was recorded for the first breath that produced a clean capnography trace. P et co 2 measurement was repeated for each subject 2–3 h after diving to give paired observations. RESULTS: There were no differences between mean surfacing P et co 2 [36.8 mmHg (SD 3.0)] and the mean P et co 2 made later after diving [36.9 mmHg (SD 4.0)]. One subject on one dive returned a surfacing P et co 2 higher than a nominal upper limit of 45 mmHg. DISCUSSION: We found no general tendency to CO 2 retention during decompression. It is plausible that breaching oxygen exposure limits during resting decompression is less hazardous than equivalent breaches when exercising at deep depths.Mitchell SJ, Mesley P, Hannam JA.

This study explored a better way at ground level to simulate pure oxygen PPB at 59,055 ft (18,000 m) by comparing the physiological changes during PPB with pure oxygen and low oxygen at ground level. METHODS: Six subjects were exposed to 3 min of 69-mmHg PPB and 3 min of 59-mmHg PPB with pure oxygen and low oxygen while wearing the thoracic counterpressure jerkin inflated to 1× breathing pressure and G-suit inflated to 3 and 4× breathing pressure. Stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), and peripheral oxygen saturation (S p o 2 ) were measured. Subjects completed a simulating flying task (SFT) during 3-min PPB and scores were recorded. RESULTS: HR and SV responses differed significantly between breathing pure oxygen and low oxygen. CO response was not significantly different for pure oxygen and low oxygen, the two levels of PPB, and the two levels of G-suit pressure. S p o 2 declined as a linear function of time during low-oxygen PPB and there was a significant difference in S p o 2 response for the two levels of PPB. The average score of SFT during pure oxygen PPB was 3970.5 ± 1050.4, which was significantly higher than 2708.0 ± 702.7 with low oxygen PPB. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia and PPB have a synergistic negative effect on both the cardiovascular system and SFT performance. PPB with low oxygen was more appropriate at ground level to investigate physiological responses during PPB and evaluate the protective performance of garments.Liu X, Xiao H, Shi W, Wen D, Yu L, Chen J.

A test flight was then conducted to quantify this risk during the transfer of an Ebola patient from West Africa to Italy. CASE REPORT: A mannequin was inserted inside an ATI and instrumented to provide acceleration parameters throughout the test flight. The analysis of the data predicted a MS incidence of about 2% for a 6-h flight, so the decision to use anti-MS drugs only in selected cases was taken (i.e., those with positive past history of MS, gastrointestinal disorders, or residual carsickness due to previous ambulance run). On this basis, an actual aeromedical evacuation of an Ebola patient was successfully performed without the use of any anti-MS drugs. DISCUSSION: During aeromedical evacuation with ATI systems, the patient’s risk of MS should be evaluated on an individual basis and calibrated according to the specific exposure to motion evoked by the flight platform used. Due to the possible onset of untoward effects, prevention with anti-MS drugs in these patients should be limited to selected cases.Lucertini M, Autore A, Covioli J, Biselli R, D’Amelio R.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Warfighters involved in mounted operations often experience prolonged periods of tissue loading, leading to injury. Determining how anatomical structures are affected during loading aids in the prevention and treatment of injury. The purpose of this study was to develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible seat system that simulates a UH-60 Blackhawk in-flight sitting posture. METHODS: Eight men were scanned with a 3.0 Tesla MRI. Scans were collected with and without 6.38 psi of pressure applied to the buttocks via two air bladders and an MRI-compatible robot controller system. RESULTS: Scans revealed that 6.38 psi of pressure applied to the buttocks significantly decreases total soft-tissue thickness beneath the left and right ischial tuberosities by 3.6 and 3.8 mm, respectively. DISCUSSION: At operational load bearing pressures seen in the UH-60, the soft tissue structures of the buttocks are compressed. These findings aid in our understanding of the etiology of repetitive trauma disorders in aircrew due to prolonged sitting. This study serves as the foundation for future work examining the anatomical changes associated with prolonged restricted sitting and other operational activities. A better understanding of the anatomical characteristics associated with mounted operations is invaluable to the prevention and treatment of injuries reported by warfighters and civilian populations.Games KE, Kollock RO, Windham J, Fischer GS, Sefton JM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When an aircrew member is referred for otosclerosis, his flight fitness may be questionable. The objective of this retrospective study was to describe a case series of otosclerosis in an aircrew population and to discuss the decisions about their flight waivers. METHODS: There were 27 aircrew members who were referred to the ENT-Head and Neck Surgery Department of the National Pilot Expertise Center. Their medical files were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: Out of 16 patients who had surgery, 2 did not obtain a flight fitness waiver afterwards. Among the 14 who received waivers, 12 had no restrictions on their flight fitness. Among the nonoperated patients, 1 of 11 did not obtain a waiver. Seven patients were declared medically fit to fly without a waiver and three obtained a waiver. DISCUSSION: Fitness was based on auditory and balance statuses and the follow-up of these findings. A postoperative CT-scan and the operative report were used to determine the quality of stapes surgery. Professional speech audiometry in noise might be as interesting. The results made it possible to determine a patient’s fitness to fly with a waiver, which is more or less associated with restrictions. In our series, only 3 aircrew members out of 27 did not obtain a flight fitness waiver. The few published studies on the resumption of flight for patients who underwent surgery and our experience in France with similar waivers in commercial and military aviation suggest that under certain conditions and after relevant vestibulocochlear assessment, stapes surgery may allow for a safe recovery of aviation activity.Ballivet de Régloix S, Gauthier J, Pons Y, Maurin O, Genestier L, Kossowski M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In a previous study, pressurized sleeves and gloves were found to substantially diminish or eliminate G-induced arm pain. Since this equipment presumably acts similarly to a G suit for the arms and hands, it was hypothesized that higher inflation pressures might provide an additional increment of G protection. METHODS: In a human-rated centrifuge, 15 well trained subjects using Combat Edge and ATAGS G-protective equipment were exposed to gradual and rapid onset relaxed G exposures as well as rapid onset straining and simulated aerial combat maneuver G exposures up to + 9 G z with and without pressurized sleeves and gloves. RESULTS: The pressurized sleeves and gloves did not show any improvement in G tolerance or endurance compared to the control. However, significantly lower heart rates (6–12%) and subjective effort (11%), along with slightly less peripheral vision loss, suggest a decreased work load when wearing the pressurized sleeves and gloves. A trend to shorter time on target in a tracking task was found with the pressurized sleeves and gloves, likely due to decreased mobility of the hands, thus affecting control stick input. CONCLUSIONS: G tolerance and endurance were not improved by the pressurized sleeves and gloves. However, a lower heart rate and a decreased subjective effort level and peripheral vision loss indicated that the subjects did not have to work as hard with this equipment.Morgan TR, Balldin U, Fischer JR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bicuspid aortic valve disease (BAV) is the most common cardiac valve pathology. BAV is associated with aortic root disorders. The literature has few case reports identifying this condition during routine physical exam. CASE REPORT: A 42-yr-old military reservist flight medic presented for his annual military flight physical. He was found to have a faint cardiac murmur. His past family and medical history were remarkable for familial essential hypertension and being told at age 9 that he had a “murmur.” He was referred for cardiology consultation, echocardiography, stress testing, and a computerized tomography angiogram (CTa), which identified BAV with a 4.3-cm aortic root aneurysm. A follow-up at 1 yr was recommended. In the interim he developed severe aortic valve insufficiency, a 4.6-cm aortic root aneurysm. The valve and aortic root were repaired and a single left anterior descending coronary artery lesion was bypassed during surgery. The flight medic made a full recovery but was not returned to flight status. DISCUSSION: This case emphasizes the importance of periodic reassessment by thorough history and careful cardiac auscultation during flight physicals. BAV aortopathy is an uncommon condition seen in the military aviation community. Most flight surgeons will not have the opportunity to identify it specifically via auscultation. This patient had over nine annual flight physicals prior to the one reported and no pathology was ever identified through routine auscultation. The potential role of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for survey of vascular and valve status of aviation personnel merits further research.Fredricks TR, Benseler JS.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The occurrence of any intracranial bleeding is highly significant from an aeromedical risk perspective and potentially career-ending for a military aviator. Where it arises from head trauma, there is always concern regarding ongoing risk of post-traumatic epilepsy. CASE REPORT: A 26-yr-old male military aviator with persistent headache was found to have small right frontal and parietal subacute subdural hematomas, most likely precipitated by minor head trauma and possibly exacerbated by other concurrent physiological stressors. The hematomas resolved with conservative management and the aviator made a full recovery. DISCUSSION: The association between traumatic subdural hematomas and the occurrence of post-traumatic epilepsy is well documented, and this, together with the possibility of recurrent bleeding, must be considered the significant aeromedical risks. However, this case presents an unusual situation of small subdural hematomas in isolation with no other features suggestive of significant traumatic brain injury. Relevant medical literature was found to be substantially lacking, and no other similar case reports of aviators could be found. An aeromedical decision-making process is discussed in relation to returning the aviator to flying duties in a restricted capacity.Cable GG. Subdural hemorrhage in a military aviator .

    "abstract": "U.S. combat activities in Iraq and Afghanistan saw the implementation of multiple ad hoc systems incorporated onto commercial aerial platforms for supporting operations. The use of manned platforms, many of which were never intended for the long-duration missions to which they have been applied, has had human factor and aviation life support equipment (ALSE) implications. The physiological stress-inducing nature of high temperatures (> 40 C) is one such concern. This study assessed cockpit temperatures in one such platform during actual combat missions over Iraq.Three missions were flown in Iraq during 2011 on an ad hoc aerial platform and dry bulb temperature readings were recorded periodically at head height at different crew stations. Relative humidity was also recorded.Temperatures demonstrated wide variability during mission profiles, ranging from > 40°C to 15°C. Ground heat-soaked cabin temperatures were measured as high as 48°C. High temperatures could be experienced for up to an hour prior to departure.While ad hoc aerial platform use has operational merits, the lack of adequate crew life support systems on such platforms can pose thermal risks to the aircrews. More detailed investigation is needed to determine core temperature response of aircrews during such operations and platform specific ALSE requirements to better support aircrew mission effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Isolated perivesicular hematomas are uncommonly described and not an injury typically reported in the literature after parachuting or skydiving. CASE REPORT: Herein, we described a series of three patients with isolated perivesicular hematomas sustained after military parachuting. All three patients were managed nonoperatively after a somewhat prolonged hospital course. Despite the lack of orthopedic injuries, all required physical therapy consultation and required an assisting device to aide with ambulation at the time of discharge. For all three individuals, follow-up imaging months after the injury demonstrated a continued presence of the hematoma. Clinically, the patients continued to have ambulatory and urological difficulties for several months after their injury. DISCUSSION: This injury pattern is uncommonly reported in the literature. An appropriate index of suspicion must be maintained or there may be a delay in diagnosis. Management of these injuries requires coordinated care between the trauma service, urology, and physical therapy.Plackett TP, Lynn DC, Zagol BR, Malone BA, Detro JF, Seery JM, Deveaux PG, Sawyer EM, Ellison RW.

Since suprasellar masses are not uncommon, their possible effects should be addressed. CASE REPORT: We present an incidental finding of 11.5 mm × 14.4 mm, hyper-intense on T2 and iso-intense on T1-weighted images, of a suprasellar mass in a 19-yr-old man. This finding led to the re-evaluation of his position as a military flight cadet, followed by his later disqualification. DISCUSSION: No medical waiver regarding asymptomatic suprasellar mass exists. We have carefully examined the differential diagnosis and generated a profile for each possible diagnosis consisting of risks for sudden incapacitation, progression likelihood, and the effect of an aerial environment on a brain lesion. We were able to draw up a medical waiver for some of the possible diagnoses (namely, Rathke’s cyst or craniopharyngioma) for nonhigh performance aircraft.Doron O, Carmon E.

    "abstract": "The occurrence of an acute stroke syndrome during a long-distance flight demands critical decisions from the crew and attendant physicians. One in particular is whether the flight should be continued or be detoured to a nearby airport.We describe a 42-yr-old woman who suffered from a severe stroke in a commercial airplane over the Sahara. The captain, together with a physician aboard and the next of kin, decided not to detour to north African or south European airports, but to continue flying to Frankfurt, Germany (final destination; remaining flight time 4 h), where an efficient transfer infrastructure and an advanced medical standard were presumed. At the hospital, the patient was successfully treated by means of catheter-based mechanical thrombus extraction. The patient was free of neurological deficits at discharge.The geographically unbalanced availability of complex but highly effective therapies such as mechanical recanalization in acute stroke challenges decision making in aviation medicine. In selected cases it might be beneficial to continue flying to cities with advanced medical standards instead of deviating to nearby airports. Foerch C, Mayer CA, Berkefeld J, You S-J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aviation medical specialists should be aware that commercial airline aircraft engineers may undertake a 'dive equivalent' operation while conducting maintenance activities on the ground. We present a worked example of an occupational risk assessment to determine a minimum safe preflight surface interval (PFSI) for an engineer before flying home to base after conducting an Excessive Cabin Leakage Test (ECLT) on an unserviceable aircraft overseas. METHOD: We use published dive tables to determine the minimum safe PFSI. RESULTS: The estimated maximum depth acquired during the procedure varies between 10 and 20 fsw and the typical estimated bottom time varies between 26 and 53 min for the aircraft types operated by the airline. Published dive tables suggest that no minimum PFSI is required for such a dive profile. DISCUSSION: Diving tables suggest that no minimum PFSI is required for the typical ECLT dive profile within the airline; however, having conducted a risk assessment, which considered peak altitude exposure during commercial flight, the worst-case scenario test dive profile, the variability of interindividual inert gas retention, and our existing policy among other occupational groups within the airline, we advised that, in the absence of a bespoke assessment of the particular circumstances on the day, the minimum PFSI after conducting ECLT should be 24 h.Houston S, Wilkinson E.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High altitude retinopathy (HAR) includes a number of diseases related to high altitude such as acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE). High altitude retinopathy is mainly characterized by retinal hemorrhages, usually sparing the macular region, a condition specifically known as high altitude retinal hemorrhages (HARH). The pathogenesis of HARH is unclear. Many studies show that lack of oxygen causes an inadequate autoregulation of retinal circulation, causing vascular incompetence. Other retinal changes described in HAR have been reported, such as optical disk edema, optic disc hyperemia, cotton wool exudates, venous occlusions, and macular edema. CASE REPORT: In this paper we present a case of an aviator who developed a unilateral maculopathy through subhyaloid lipid accumulation on a climb to the top of Mt. Everest. The clinical findings are suggestive of an apparent case of temporary altitude-induced visual disruption maybe by the same presumable pathogenesis of HARH. Right eye visual loss was perceived at 5150 m when he was trying to take a photograph 40 d into the expedition. DISCUSSION: The maculopathy developed by this patient adds to the discussion on the pathogenesis of HARH, especially the aspect of this maculopathy and its complete resolution. It seems that autoregulation failure could lead to exudation and lipid deposits in the foveal area. Although macular damage is not a common signal in HARH, checking visual acuity during high altitude expeditions remains an important procedure to avoid late diagnosis as unilateral blindness may not be detected early.Rosas Petrocinio R, Gomes ED.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Powered parachutes are becoming a popular form of sport flying. No previous study has reviewed injuries in this sport. The purpose of this study was to describe the injuries associated with powered parachute flying, the flight factors involved in an incident, and the impact an incident has on current sport involvement. METHODS: National Transportation Safety Board incident reports involving powered parachutes between 2004 and 2015 were reviewed. Internet searches were performed to contact involved pilots to find further information. RESULTS: There were 71 incidents reported involving 117 people. Of these, 10 incidents involved 14 fatalities (12.0%). Of the 14 fatalities, 11 (78.5%) occurred in midflight. Pilot error was the most common finding for an incident and accounted for 53/71 incidents (74.6%). The main error was misjudging the distance required for takeoff and landing. This accounted for 37/71 incidents (52.1%). Orthopedic extremity injuries were the most common severe injuries reported. Surgical intervention was needed in 43.8% of injuries and 48.0% of those involved fractures. The median return to work was 14 d (range 0–180 d). Only 4/53 (7.5%) of the pilots contacted continued to fly powered parachutes. DISCUSSION: Powered parachute participants are at risk for unique injuries compared to other forms of flight. A powered parachute injury can have a significant impact on future pilot involvement in the sport. This study provides evidence for design changes in the aircraft and helps direct pilot training. This information can improve the safety and well-being of participants so they can continue to fly powered parachutes.Skelley NW, Yarholar LM, Richardson LC.

CASE REPORT: Almost 13 yr earlier the candidate had acquired spinal cord damage at neurological level L1 after falling 4 m (13 ft) from out of a window. The CT scans showed luxation of the 12 th thoracic vertebra with fracture and dislocation of the 1 st lumbar vertebra. He went for surgery, where fixation of the 12 th thoracic vertebra to the 1 st lumbar vertebra was performed. He developed syringomyelia 1 yr postoperatively and was re-operated on twice in the following years. He was now in a wheelchair, but engaged himself in several sport activities such as sledge-hockey and sit-skiing, participating in several Paralympics. DISCUSSION: With respect to the general principles of aviation medicine, several considerations had to be taken into account before a medical certification could be given. The risks associated with an F-16 flight in relationship to the candidate's general health and the fixation of his spinal cord had to be evaluated. Also, his ability to perform required tasks during the flight and in case of an emergency was an important issue discussed. Finally, the candidate’s medical and physical condition should not present a considerable risk to flight safety. After extensive specialist consultations and in-depth discussions, the candidate was given medical certification to fly back seat in a F-16.Chahal-Kummen M, Strand T-E, Owe JO, Gulliksen E, Wagstaff AS.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effects of seasickness on working performance during motion exposure have been reported, while the aftereffects on working ability and life quality decline (WLD) still remain unclarified. METHODS: Two cohorts of healthy male Chinese subjects received either a single (SSV) or repeated (RSV) sea voyage training program on different vessels. A seasickness incidence (SSI) questionnaire was administered to assess the prevalence of seasickness symptoms (vomiting, nausea, other, or no symptoms). A WLD questionnaire was used to survey the general feeling of WLD (severe, moderate, slight, and none) by a 4-point score as well as the incidence rate (IR) of specific WLD items within 24 h after landing. RESULTS: The RSV cohort had lower overall IR of WLD than the SSV cohort (54.64% vs. 63.78%, N 657 for both cohorts). The landing ship trainees in both cohorts showed higher general WLD score and higher IRs of physical fatigue, sleep disorder, and spontaneous locomotion decrement than those trained on the small vessels. Subjects with vomiting or nausea had higher general WLD score and higher IRs of concentration distraction, physical fatigue, anorexia, and spontaneous locomotion decrement than those with no symptoms. Higher IRs of firing accuracy decline (SSV: 21.35% vs. 7.13%, 9.14%; RSV: 22.11% vs. 9.28%, 5.27%), equipment operation disturbance (SSV: 16.85% vs. 3.57%, 6.85%; RSV: 20.47% vs. 7.85%, 7.03%) were also observed in the vomiting subjects than those with other symptoms and no symptoms. DISCUSSION: Significant WLD after landing was associated with transportation types, seasickness severity, and habituation during sea voyage training.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The neurological impact (or lack thereof) of certain medical histories and imaging findings is important to understand in the context of air and spaceflight. There are a number of neurological conditions that, if present in pilots and astronauts, carry variable (and sometimes adverse) functional implications for safety and overall mission success. In this systematic overview, the authors will refer to the relevant clinical and radiological features of brain tumors and vascular anomalies, cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension, concussion and the traumatic brain injury (TBI) spectrum, hematomas, cerebrospinal fluid circulation anomalies including hydrocephalus and sequestrations, spinal degenerative changes, and cerebral ischemia and demyelination. It is notable that these last two conditions have recently been reported to be a complication in some people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A paradigm for practical neurological workup of symptomatic pilots and astronauts will be discussed, as will the controversial notion of pre-emptive radiological screening (vs. not screening) in asymptomatic or clinically occult situations. The concepts of medical surveillance in the setting of known or diagnosed pathologies, and expert panel review and simulator and flight checks in complex neurological cases, are also elaborated on in this paper. We believe this overview will contribute toward the enhancement of a broad understanding of neurological conditions, their clinical workup, and their precautionary management in the setting of aviation and aerospace.Khurana VG, Jithoo R, Barnett M.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone density loss affects astronauts in long-duration spaceflight. The OsteoStrong Company has shown increased hip (14.95%) and lumbar (16.6%) area bone mineral density (aBMD) after 6 mo of exercises with their loading devices. The devices were tested on one subject as a pilot study. CASE REPORT: The subject performed 15 min of osteogenic exercises weekly for 24 wk. Total and regional aBMD, BAP (bone formation biomarker), NTX (bone resorption biomarker), forces exerted on devices, and weekly maximum weights lifted were collected. The control data was the subjects own lifting records 1.5 yr prestudy. The subject increased forces exerted on the devices in the upper extremity (97%, 197 to 390 kg; 435 to 859 lb), lower extremity (43%, 767 to 1097 kg; 1690 to 2418 lb), and spinal compression (22%, 275 to 336 kg; 607 to 740 lb). The monthly strength gain rate increased for snatch (2.3 vs. 0.71 kg; 5 vs. 1.56 lb), clean and jerk (2.5 vs. 0.4 kg; 5.5 vs. 0.88 lb), back squat (3.74 vs. 0 kg; 8.25 vs. 0 lb), front squat (2.15 vs. 0.2 kg; 4.75 vs. 0.47 lb), and deadlift (3.97 vs. 1.09 kg; 8.75 vs. 2.4 lb). The BAP increased by 39% (10.4 to 14.5 4 ug L 1 ) and NTX decreased by 41% (13.4 to 7 nmol L 1 BME). aBMD increased in the head (6%), arms (4.3%), trunk (6.3%), ribs (3.8%), and pelvis (11%). There were no differences in body weight, legs, spine, and whole-body aBMD on the full-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). There were no differences in lumbar, hip, and femoral neck aBMD on the regional DXA. DISCUSSION: The osteogenic loading apparatus used for 15 min weekly increased strength for the one individual in this preliminary study.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND : The first skin physiological pilot experiment (SkinA) on a single astronaut showed a deterioration of the skin. In a follow-up experiment (SkinB) we showed that skin physiological parameters improved on average. However, it is well known that sports have positive effects on the skin, that astronauts prefer special sports devices, and do sports with different intensity. The aim of this study was to analyze the different sports activities of SkinB astronauts and to find out whether they have an influence on the skin physiological parameters. METHODS : The cumulative distance covered on the treadmill and on the cycle ergometer as well as the repetition of arm-related exercises have been calculated and possible correlation between sports activities and skin physiological parameters have been analyzed. RESULTS : The average distance covered for all six astronauts per day is 1364 AU on the treadmill T2, and 11,077 AU on the cycle ergometer CEVIS. In addition, the astronauts performed an average of about 73 repetitions of all arm-related exercises daily. Here, we were able to show very well how differently the astronauts on the ISS train. In addition, a decreasing trend in skin volume can be observed in astronauts with increasing activity on the bicycle and more repetitions on arm-related exercises. CONCLUSION : Increased activity on the cycle ergometer and increased arm-related exercises have a medium negative impact on the parameter skin volume and thus reflects more fluid content in the skin. No correlations between sports activities and skin moisture/skin barrier function could be found. Braun N, Hunsdieck B, Theek C, Ickstadt K, Heinrich U.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Exposure to microgravity reduces muscle mass, volume, and performance. The ingestion of protein, especially combined with carbohydrate intake and exercise after ingestion, improves net muscle protein synthesis and increases muscle mass. However, there are few studies on this relationship during and after a long-term spaceflight. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of protein and the combined effects of carbohydrate intake on muscle performance following long-term spaceflight. METHODS: This study is a retrospective cohort study involving secondary analysis of data stored in the NASA Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health Repository. Multivariable analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of protein intake on physical performance by considering covariates potentially associated with each model. RESULTS: After adjusting for sex, age, flight week, energy intake, and preflight physical performance, protein intake was found to be significantly associated with concentric measurements for knee extension ( 51.66), ankle plantar flexion ( 32.86), and eccentric measurements for ankle plantar flexion ( 79.85) at 5 d after landing. Significant associations remained after controlling for exercise effect. No significant interaction between protein and carbohydrate intake was observed in either model. DISCUSSION: Protein intake during spaceflight was related to physical performance for knee extension and ankle plantar flexion, even after taking exercise effect into consideration. However, protein and carbohydrate intake provided no synergetic benefit. This suggests that high protein intake, about twice the current average intake, may serve as a countermeasure to offset the negative effects of long-duration spaceflights. Nozawa Y, Wagatsuma Y.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome (SJMS) is a specific form of bronchiolitis obliterans that occurs rarely, but represents recognized sequelae of common pediatric respiratory illness, and presents as unilateral hyperlucency on chest imaging. This case study describes such an incidental radiographic finding identified during the assessment of chest wall discomfort in a military pilot. CASE REPORT: A 35-yr-old military pilot presented to his flight surgeon with vague intermittent chest discomfort. Initial evaluation revealed an abnormal chest radiograph with unilateral hyperlucency and mild expiratory airflow limitation on pulmonary function testing. The evaluation also included computed tomography imaging with contrast infusion and echocardiography, though the presenting complaint had resolved. The airman was referred to our clinic for further evaluation and aeromedical recommendations regarding returning to flight duties. He was diagnosed with SJMS and recommended to be returned to flight duties. DISCUSSION: SJMS can be challenging to recognize to the untrained eye. An inflammatory response from viral or bacterial infection in childhood results in dysfunctional growth of the affected region of the lung, causing radiographic asymmetry. Although destruction of the alveoli and emphysema may occur, for most cases, there are minimal clinical sequelae. SJMS is not known to be progressive and is not associated with systemic conditions. The pilot likely had the abnormal chest radiograph at the time of commission and had not experienced any in-flight complications. His chest pain had resolved without intervention and SJMS was determined to be unlikely to impact his flight performance (such as response to supplemental oxygen) or life expectancy.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study examines the relationship between seat restraints and injuries of children and infants who were passengers on an aircraft and gives a detailed analysis of children whose behavior contributed to an accident. METHODS: A total of 58 accident reports from 1980 until 2015 were extracted from the NTSB online database in which children were mentioned. In at least 10 cases the childs behavior contributed to the accident. RESULTS: Violations of regulations by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) as well as the age and number of children and infants on board were each reported inconsistently. Violations of regulations were significantly more common when accidents occurred during the takeoff phase. Child behaviors that caused accidents included distraction of crew, not wearing a seatbelt, and running into dangerous areas. CONCLUSIONS: Pilots and crew, especially in General Aviation, need to be made aware of the need to enforce FAA regulations concerning child restraint systems. It is recommended that children both on the ground and inside an aircraft have adult supervision in addition to supervising aircraft crew to prevent distractions that harm the safe operation of an aircraft.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of repeated pressure alterations on cochlear structures in rats in an attempt to understand indirectly the inner ear status of flight crew who are repeatedly exposed to pressure alterations.METHODS: There were 12 adult Wistar albino rats equally divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (controls) and Group 2 (study group). The animals in Group 2 were exposed to repeated pressure changes in a pressure cabin which is regulated by manometers. The animals in Group 1 were placed in the cabin without being exposed to pressure changes. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing was performed in all animals at the beginning and at the end of the study. After 12 wk the animals were sacrificed and their cochleas were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).RESULTS: In the study group, hearing decreases at 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 6 dB at 8 kHz, and 32 kHz were encountered at the end of 3 mo. On SEM evaluation of the control group, the outer hair cells (OHC) and stereocilia were normal throughout the cochlea. In the study group, there were irregularities in lateral surface connections and separations, collapse, and adhesions in the basal segment of the cochlea and partial loss of stereocilia throughout the cochlea.CONCLUSION: Repeated alterations in the atmospheric pressure can lead to damage in the inner ear with subtle or evident hearing loss. Frequent flyers like air workers may be at risk of inner ear damage, which may be considered an occupational health problem.Eroglu S, Dizdar HT, Cevizci R, Cengiz AB, Ogreden S, Bulut E, Ilgezdi S, Dilci A, Ustun S, Sirvanci S, Kaya OT, Bayazit D, Caki BO, Oktay MF, Bayazit Y.

The case describes a 56-yr-old experienced pilot who showed a slow and subtle decline in cognitive function and muscle control in the cockpit. On further examination, the pilot’s erratic behavior and movement along with lab abnormalities pointed toward McLeod Syndrome. CASE REPORT: The pilot was recommended for evaluation by his fellow crewmembers due to his fidgetiness, clumsiness, and lack of focus during critical portions of flight. The pilot reported having a long-standing history of elevated CK levels. Further lab investigations revealed acanthocytes on blood smear while neurological evaluation detected chorea. The combination of clinical and laboratory features along with genetic test results were all consistent with McLeod Syndrome. DISCUSSION: The case highlights how subtle behavioral and motor coordination changes can be a warning sign for an underlying progressive neurological disorder that requires further workup and referral.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Military aviators are likely to be first diagnosed with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) during military service. Current recommendations support continuing flying with restrictions, but risks may be significant. The aim of the study was to document the long-term results of aviators newly diagnosed with IBD. METHODS: A prospective observational study over a 23-yr period included all Israeli Air Force (IAF) aviators with IBD. Primary end point was the qualification and safety to continue operational flying following IBD diagnosis. RESULTS: Subjects were 16 male aviators with an average follow-up of 130 mo. Average age was 27 (2045) and average time from symptoms onset to final diagnosis was 7.3 mo. Eight (50%) patients had Crohns disease (CD), and the other eight had ulcerative colitis (UC). Eight (50%) were high performance platform aviators. Two patients received biologic treatment, two were treated with repeated corticosteroid courses, and four with immunosuppressive therapy. Two patients underwent surgery and four needed different lengths of hospitalizations. Eight (50%) aviators (3 CD, 5 UC) were grounded for a mean of 177 d (5590). Altogether grounding for IBD aviators was 46/2087 mo (2.2%). Most grounding periods were short term and reversible. All aviators continued flying under annual monitoring or as needed and no compromise of their abilities was documented. CONCLUSIONS: All aviators were able to continue flying and no events of sudden incapacitation or severe disabling flares have been seen among patients.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: En route care (ERC) is a military aeromedical mission designed to transport a patient to a higher level of care. With the exception of one manual, there are no other formal Navy ERC guidelines, leaving the service to provide such missions ad hoc. Based on the authors’ review of available literature, it seems no prior research has been done on Navy rescue swimmers performing ERC, though many search and rescue (SAR) missions take place without designated medical personnel. This study specifically examines the type of provider involved in Navy ERC missions and the types of cases involved with the purpose of influencing Navy policy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study examining 829 air evacuations performed by Navy SAR flight crews from 2016 to 2019 was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 829 cases reviewed, patients were more likely to be active-duty personnel (51%) than civilian (47%), and there were 2.5 times more male than female patients. There were more trauma (54%) than medical (43%) patients, with Basic Life Support (BLS) level care (60%) delivered twice as often as Advanced Life Support (ALS) (28%). Search and Rescue Medical Technicians (SMTs) and rescue swimmers provided 83% of ERC, with rescue swimmers supporting 33% of all ERC missions alone. DISCUSSION: The results of this study are in contrast to previous ERC studies, in which rescue swimmer-only transports were excluded from the data. The results raise the question, do rescue swimmers need to be trained to a higher level of care? Henry SM, Stanfield MM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cryptogenic stroke leading to cerebellar infarction is a rare but serious cause of acute nausea and vomiting. This has the potential of devastating consequences if this occurs in aviators during flight. We present a case of cryptogenic stroke causing incapacitating nausea and vomiting in a U.S. Air Force pilot. CASE REPORT: A 36-yr-old active-duty U.S. Air Force male pilot developed acute onset severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting during initial descent. Initial computed tomography imaging was normal and his initial assessment yielded a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. MRI-Brain at 1 mo revealed a small right inferomedial cerebellar infarct. Echocardiography revealed a patent foramen ovale and bilateral atrial enlargement. He made a full neurological recovery and was eventually returned to active flight status with Flying Class IIC waiver. DISCUSSION: Cryptogenic stroke caused by patent foramen ovale (PFO) is uncommon. However, this is increased in patients younger than 50 yr of age. This can lead to an acute incapacitation with varying degrees of dysfunction. There is controversial discussion of treatment options for secondary stroke prevention with PFO. However, there is no significant literature on primary prevention in these patients. A small subset of patients benefit from closure of PFO and most patients benefit from antiplatelet therapy after a stroke occurs. There may also be a significant subset of patients with PFO that may benefit from antiplatelet therapy as a primary prevention of stroke. Lytle ME, Martin BR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Planning, whether preflight or in-flight, is a cause of accident that is presumably almost entirely preventable. Planning skills on the part of the pilot should assist in avoiding dangerous situations with regards to light conditions, weather, fuel shortage, and/or improper weight and balance. Fuel planning is noted as especially unnecessary, as fuel planning is not considered a complex skill but part of proper flight preparation and in-flight planning.METHODS: A total of 196 accident reports from 2015 until 2020 were extracted from the NTSB online database in which the probable cause included either preflight or in-flight planning as a cause attributed to the pilot. Of those accidents, the majority (N = 131, 67%) were attributed to fuel planning and were further analyzed.RESULTS: Fuel-planning related accidents were significantly less often fatal compared to all planning-related accidents and all fuel-related accidents. The majority of fuel planning accidents resulted in fuel exhaustion. Additionally, the cause attributed to the accidents was frequently the skill-based error of \"fuel planning (pilot)\" and the crew resource management issue of \"fuel-fluid level\". Specific information regarding the pilot's fuel plan was only available in 52 (40%) of the accident reports.CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of fuel-related planning accidents suggests that this aspect of pilotage is underestimated and requires more attention both in training and in standard operating procedures. In particular, more detailed information regarding the pilot's fuel plan is necessary in order to determine which step in the process most frequently results in an accident.Kalagher H.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the clinical course and consequences of COVID-19 initially evolved in the context of severe presentations and among those with comorbidities. However, understanding the outcomes of milder infections in healthy individuals is important for safe return-to-duty in extreme environments or to occupations requiring significant fitness. We reviewed the literature to characterize the nature and timing of persistent and emergent clinical sequelae in milder COVID-19 cases to facilitate development of post-COVID-19 screening and surveillance protocols. METHODS: We searched databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane COVID-19 study register, gray literature, clinical trial registries, and relevant health and disease prevention sources for publications from 2019 to February 18 th , 2021, documenting COVID-19 sequelae. Articles were included if the COVID-19 severity was mild and there were no, or only minor, pre-existing comorbidities. Persistent and emergent sequelae were then stratified based on time since diagnosis. RESULTS: Among those with mild COVID-19, sequelae were shown to emerge or persist for months following presumed recovery. Among those with no comorbidities, cardiac, hematological, and respiratory sequelae emerged after 1-2 mo, and primarily cardiac abnormalities persisted at ≥ 3 mo. Among those with minor comorbidities, persistent respiratory abnormalities, fatigue, dyspnea, and headache were common, and mental health symptoms emerged by 1-2 mo postinfection. DISCUSSION: After presumed recovery from mild COVID-19, a range of symptoms can persist and later emerge. Whether these are new or previously unrecognized is unclear. Under-recognized COVID-19 sequelae may increase the risk of subtle or sudden incapacitation and have implications for return-to-work (RTW) screening and surveillance for safety-critical roles.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe acute hypoxia results in a rapid deterioration of cognitive functioning and thus poses a risk for human operations in high altitude environments. This study aimed at investigating the effects of oxygen system failure during a high-altitude high-opening (HAHO) parachute jump scenario from 30,000 ft (9144 m) on human physiology and cognitive performance using a noncontact eye-tracking task.METHODS: Nine healthy male volunteers (ages 27-48) were recruited from the Norwegian Special Operations Commandos. Eye-tracking data were collected to derive information on cognitive performance in the context of rapid dynamic changes in pressure altitude while performing a modified King-Devick test. The baseline data was collected at 8000 ft (2438 m) while breathing 100% oxygen during decompression. For every test, the corresponding arterial blood gas analysis was performed.RESULTS: The study subjects endured severe hypoxia, which resulted in significant prolongations of fixation time (range: 284.1-245.6 ms) until 23,397 ft (131 m) and fixation size (range: 34.6-32.4 mm) until 25,389 ft (7739 m) as compared to the baseline (217.6 ± 17.8 ms and 27.2 ± 4.5 mm, respectively). The increase in the saccadic movement and decrease in the saccadic velocity was observed until 28,998 ft and 27,360 ft (8839 and 8339 m), respectively.DISCUSSION: This is the first study to investigate cognitive performance from measured oculometric variables during severe hypobaric hypoxia in a simulated high-altitude airdrop mission scenario. The measurement of altered oculometric variables under hypoxic conditions represents a potential avenue to study altered cognitive performance using noncontact sensors that can derive information and serve to provide the individual with a warning from impending incapacitation.Pradhan GN, Ottestad W, Meland A, Kåsin JI, Høiseth LØ, Cevette MJ, Stepanek J.

    "abstract": "To examine the causes and factors of airplane landings on highways and the dangers to occupants of vehicles on the ground.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board online database provided 133 accidents involving a highway landing dating from 2000 to 2013. Supplemental information was sought in online media archives, which reported on 53 of these accidents. Collisions with highway-related objects, other options for landing, and witness accounts were added categories extracted from the narrative statements and media reports.Highway landings occur mostly due to mechanical failures, ineffective preflight or in-flight planning, and fuel exhaustion, in addition to a lack of alternate landing options for a pilot of a fixed-wing aircraft. Most of the landings (N = 108) lead to minor or no injuries at all. A significant proportion of 7 out of 19 collisions with powerlines resulted in a fatality, as opposed to other types of accidents. Collisions with motor vehicles (N = 29) caused minor (N = 23) and serious (N = 2) injuries to people on the ground. Main online media archives covered less than half of all accidents (39.8%).While highway landings are not a recommended landing alternative, mitigation strategies should include a focus on avoiding powerlines and vehicles on the ground. Unfortunately, online media archives are not yet a consistent source of information for general aviation accidents.Holzman E, de Voogt A.

METHODS: The authors reviewed medical records of student pilots with barotrauma. The grade of barotrauma was assigned using Teed’s classification. This study included nasal symptoms, endoscopic findings of the nasal cavity, and clinical course (duration, recurrence). The relationship between middle ear barotrauma and the nasal airway was also evaluated. RESULTS: There were 57 cases in 51 pilots included. There were 49 cases (86.0%) that showed unilateral disease and 4 subjects experienced relapse. Two subjects (3.9%) had chronic rhinosinusitis and four subjects (7.8%) had allergic rhinitis. Ear fullness was reported in all cases, while hearing loss and persistent ear pain were reported in 3 cases (5.3%) and 19 cases (33.3%), respectively. Stuffy nose (26 cases, 45.6%) and rhinorrhea (24 cases, 42.1%) were relatively common. Most cases were Grade 0 (23 cases, 40.3%) or Grade III (27 cases, 47.4%) according to Teed’s classification. Septal deviation was observed in 12 cases (21.0%), while turbinate hypertrophy was seen in 53 cases (93.0%) and increased nasal discharge in 33 cases (57.9%). The grade of barotrauma varied significantly according to the severity of turbinate hypertrophy and nasal discharge. The mean duration of disease was 6.8 d. DISCUSSION: Nasal symptoms and endoscopic findings showed some association with the grade and duration of barotrauma. Most cases resolved within a week; however, barotrauma showed persistence or relapse in some cases.Sohn JH, Cho KR. Middle ear barotrauma in student pilots .

    "abstract": "Around 25% of people involved in a helicopter accident in water do not survive. From time to time, physicians and their medical staff are required to fly over water in a helicopter to attend one or more seriously ill patients. Many will have had little or no experience of the issues involved if the helicopter has an accident in the water. Also as Family Practitioners, Aeromedical Examiners, and Flight Surgeons, they are asked to provide advice to patients, travel agents, and airline booking agents about whether an overwater helicopter flight is advisable or not.From 50 yr of helicopter accident evidence in the scientific literature, government agency reports, and statistics from the military safety centers and the offshore oil industry, the critical hazards involved and risks to medical staff and their patients have been identified.Patients most at risk are those who suffer from cardiovascular or respiratory disease, have physical disabilities, have a very large body size, and anyone who is a non-swimmer. Medical staff are at risk if they are not familiar with the procedure for escape from a flooded inverted cabin and difficulties after escape from the fuselage with life jackets, life rafts, and sometimes the necessity to swim ashore.With 50 yr of hindsight, many of the deaths were preventable, and many lives can be saved if a series of very simple mental and physical preventive actions are taken by anyone stepping on to a helicopter that flies over water.Brooks CJ, MacDonald CV.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In aviation psychology, there is a constant need for the cognitive evaluation of pilots as part of operational fitness and safety criteria. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with comparison between the performance of Israeli Air Force pilot cadets ( N = 318) and U.S. Air Force pilot training candidates ( N = 512) as assessed by a cognitive battery was undertaken. The data of the comparison group was collected from Callister, King, and Retzlaff, as published in 1996. RESULTS: In general, the means in the three components composing the battery—speed, accuracy, and throughput variables—indicated that the Israeli Air Force pilot cadets' scores were higher than those of the U.S. Air Force pilot candidates' scores in 50 of 53 variables. Nonsignificant differences were found in Accuracy of shifting attention-arrow color (SATAC), pathfinder-combined (PFC), and pathfinder-letter (PFL). CONCLUSIONS: The difference in performance between the two groups may be due to differences in population characteristics. However, these results need to be considered cautiously, as the groups were sampled at a sizeable time gap (1996 for the U.S. Air Force vs. 2013 for the Israeli Air Force), with each time period characterized by different cultural and technological influences.Gordon S, Goren C, Carmon E, Shelef L.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Disabled submarine (DISSUB) survivors may face elevated CO 2 levels and inert gas saturation, putting them at risk for CO 2 toxicity and decompression sickness (DCS). Propranolol was shown to reduce CO 2 production in an experimental DISSUB model in humans but its effects on DCS in a DISSUB rescue scenario are unknown. A 100% oxygen prebreathe (OPB) reduces DCS incidence and severity and is incorporated into some DISSUB rescue protocols. We used a swine model of DISSUB rescue to study the effect of propranolol on DCS incidence and mortality with and without an OPB. METHODS: In Experiment 1, male Yorkshire Swine (70 kg) were pressurized to 2.8 ATA for 22 h. Propranolol 1.0 mg · kg −1 (IV) was administered at 21.25 h. At 22 h, the animal was rapidly decompressed and observed for DCS type, onset time, and mortality. Experimental animals ( N = 21; 69 ± 4.1 kg), PROP 1.0 , were compared to PROP 1.0 -OPB 45 ( N = 8; 69 ± 2.8 kg) with the same dive profile, except for a 45 min OPB prior to decompression. In Experiment 2, the same methodology was used with the following changes: swine pressurized to 2.8 ATA for 28 h; experimental group ( N = 25; 67 ± 3.3 kg), PROP 0.5 bis , propranolol 0.5 mg · kg −1 bis (twice) (IV) was administered at 22 h and 26 h. Control animals ( N = 25; 67 ± 3.9 kg) received normal saline. RESULTS: OPB reduced mortality in PROP 1.0 -OBP 45 compared to PROP 1.0 (0% vs. 71%). PROP 0.5 bis had increased mortality compared to CONTROL (60-% vs. 4%). DISCUSSION: Administration of beta blockers prior to saturation decompression appears to increase DCS and worsen mortality in a swine model; however, their effects in bounce diving remain unknown.Forbes AS, Regis DP, HallAA, Mahon RT, Cronin WA.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The few prior studies of time perception underwater have reached contradictory conclusions as to how, and if, time perception becomes distorted when submerged. The current paper expands upon this limited data by describing two studies of prospective time production in scuba divers. METHODS: Study 1 ( N = 32) compared performance on a 30-s interval time production task in deep water (35 m–42 m/∼115–138 ft) with a shallow water control (3–12 m/∼10–39 ft). Using the same task, study 2 ( N = 31) tested performance at the surface and at a range of depths underwater (1 m/3 ft; 11 m/36 ft; 20 m/66 ft; 30 m/98 ft; 40 m/131 ft). RESULTS: Study 1 revealed time production to be significantly longer in deep water compared to shallow water. In study 2 time production at the surface was not significantly different from that at 1 m, but productions at 11–40 m were significantly longer than at both 1 m and on the surface. Time productions between 11–40 m did not differ significantly. DISCUSSION: It was concluded that divers judge less time to have passed underwater than is objectively the case from a depth of 11 m, but that this effect does not deteriorate significantly once past 11 m. The cause of this distortion of time perception underwater was suggested to be the action of gas narcosis.Hobbs MB, Kneller W. Distortion of prospective time production underwater .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the use of statin therapy in U.S. Air Force (USAF) aviators with isolated hypercholesterolemia in terms of compliance with clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and effectiveness in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. METHODS: This was a mixed design, 8-yr retrospective study that included 8185 participants with isolated hypercholesterolemia, of which 1458 (17.81%) were prescribed statin monotherapy. RESULTS: Overall agreement between CPG recommendations and patient-clinician decision makers was 0.920 (95% confidence interval: 0.955, 0.959) and 0.891 (95% confidence interval: 0.843, 0.851) per 2002 and 2013 CPGs, respectively. Overall agreement was primarily driven by the negative proportion of specific agreement; positive agreement was moderate for the 2002 CPG and poor for the 2013 CPG. LDL-C levels marginally decreased for all participants except non-CPG-recommended statin users per the 2002 CPG. CHD risk was minimally reduced for all participants per the 2002 CPG with the exception of CPG-recommended statin users, for whom risk increased; CHD risk decreased for CPG-recommended statin users, but increased for non-CPG-recommended statin users per the 2013 CPG. No one statin medication was found to be more clinically effective in reducing LDL-C or CHD risk, regardless of dose intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Aerospace medicine practitioners are following CPG recommendations for statin therapy. Statins provided minimal benefit, however, and CPG recommendations proved irrelevant in reducing LDL-C and CHD risk in this population of Air Force aviators. This result is attributable, in part, to the young age of the study cohort and the short follow-up period.Tvaryanas AP, Mahaney HJ, Schroeder VM, Maupin GM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Creation of the cosmonaut in-flight physical training process is currently based on the leading role of support afferents in the development of hypogravity changes in the motor system. We assume that the strength of support afferents is related to the magnitude of the ground reaction forces (GRF). For this purpose it was necessary to compare the GRF magnitude on the Russian BD-2 treadmill for different locomotion types (walking and running), modes (active and passive), and subjects. METHODS: Relative GRF values were analyzed while subjects performed walking and running during active and passive modes of treadmill belt movement under 1 G ( N = 6) and 0 G ( N = 4) conditions. RESULTS: For different BD-2 modes and both types of locomotion, maximum GRF values varied in both 0 G and 1 G. Considerable individual variations were also found in the locomotion strategies, as well as in maximum GRF values. In 0 G, the smallest GRF values were observed for walking in active mode, and the largest during running in passive mode. In 1 G, GRF values were higher during running than while walking, but the difference between active and passive modes was not observed; we assume this was due to the uniqueness of the GRF profile. DISCUSSION: The maximum GRF recorded during walking and running in active and passive modes depended on the individual pattern of locomotion. The maximum GRF values that we recorded on BD-2 were close to values found by other researchers. The observations from this study could guide individualized countermeasures prescriptions for microgravity.Fomina E, Savinkina A.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebellar infarction is an uncommon but serious cause of isolated acute vestibular symptoms, particularly in young, healthy individuals, and can easily be overlooked. We present two cases of cerebellar infarction in U.S. Air Force pilots, one of which occurred during flight. CASE REPORTS: A 41-yr-old man developed acute vertigo, disequilibrium, nausea, and headache, with progressive slow symptomatic improvement, and presented to medical attention 4 d after symptom onset. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed right inferomedial cerebellar infarction. Echocardiography discovered patent foramen ovale and atrial septal aneurysm. A 40-yr-old man developed severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting during initial aircraft descent. Head computed tomography scan was performed acutely and was normal. Initial assessment was benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Brain magnetic resonance imaging 1 mo after symptom onset showed a small right inferior cerebellar infarction. Patent foramen ovale and bilateral atrial enlargement were seen on echocardiography. Both pilots made full neurological recoveries and were eventually returned to flight status. DISCUSSION: Central causes of isolated acute vestibular symptoms are uncommon and are often not considered in otherwise healthy individuals. Cerebellar infarction is one of these uncommon but increasingly recognized causes of acute vestibular symptoms. As evaluation and management of central causes are much different from peripheral conditions, prompt localization confirmation is paramount. Accurate evidence-based bedside screening methods are available for rapid localization. Awareness of the possibility of central etiologies and careful clinical evaluation with application of bedside screening methods in patients with acute vestibular symptoms will reduce the number of inaccurate diagnoses.Hesselbrock RR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A syrinx is a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord. They can lead to a variety of symptoms, including limb weakness and back pain. Incidental finding of syringomyelia provides a challenge for clinicians due to the wide variety of possible symptoms. In military aviation, neurological findings in pilots can result in extensive investigation that can lead to potentially invasive management. Conversely, the potential for chronic progression of a spinal syrinx and subsequent neurological deterioration makes early identification critical. Ultimately, the discovery of a lesion may have implications for flying status and operational capability. CASE REPORT: A 25-yr-old man working as a navy Seahawk helicopter pilot presented with episodes of right arm paraesthesia and pain between the scapulae. On at least one occasion, these symptoms woke him at night. Upon magnetic resonance imaging, dilatation of the central canal in a syrinx-like pattern in the lower cervical region was noted. Neurology review suggested the finding was persistent and unlikely to be responsible for his symptoms. No surgical input was recommended. His symptoms were attributed to mild cervical spondylosis, which resolved with ongoing physiotherapy, and he was returned to flying status. DISCUSSION: This case highlights several issues involved with the incidental finding of a syringomyelia. Surgical intervention has been known to worsen symptoms. Conversely, studies have identified minimal radiological progression in cases of idiopathic syringomyelia, with fewer individuals displaying neurological deterioration. For aircrew, potentially unnecessary neurosurgical intervention poses risks to a flying career and overall operational capability.Schiemer A. Idiopathic syringomyelia in a military helicopter pilot .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medication use by naval aviators, either prescription or over-the-counter, is not always relayed to the flight surgeon, resulting in unsafe flying environments. Many medications have debilitating effects that prohibit their use during aviation. Education and availability of resources on approved medications for flight status personnel is lacking. METHODS: A retrospective search of the Department of Defense Composite Health Care System (DoD CHCS) was conducted from five geographic locations. Basic epidemiological information was obtained to determine the most common medications ( N = 70) prescribed to active-duty flight status personnel. Analysis determined their medication category, flight status designation, and a generalized location comparison. A similar control medication list for nonflight status personnel was generated from one location. RESULTS: Analysis found that many medications prescribed to aviators are not approved for use in aviation and are similar to those of nonflight status personnel. There were 8 of the top 15 (53%) and 40 of the 70 (57%) most commonly prescribed medications of flight status personnel which were not approved. Similarly, 49% of total prescriptions ( N = 15,652) were not approved. Little difference was found in medications among nonflight and flight status personnel, as 11 of the top 15 prescription medications (73%) were identical. DISCUSSION: This research demonstrates the need for education regarding certain medications and their prohibited use during flight. Results will provide the Flight Surgeon common medications prescribed to aviators to aid them in providing a safer flying environment.Ropp LG, Haight SP, Prudhomme MB, Ropp EL.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few researchers have studied symptomatic younger to middle-aged women with pelvic organ prolapse. The association between highly strenuous activity and prolapse symptoms is largely theoretical. It is also known that a genetic component likely contributes to early-onset pelvic organ prolapse, but prevention and treatment with respect to this has not been explored. Service restrictions differ for active duty women who are diagnosed with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 33-yr-old Gravida 1 Para 1 fighter pilot who developed symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse after a vaginal delivery. Her prolapse symptoms initially prevented her from flying due to exacerbation of pain and pressure. Her exam demonstrated Stage III pelvic organ prolapse. She was treated with a course of physical therapy and ring with support pessary which allowed the patient to return to flight status after 5 mo. After completing the course of physical therapy, her physical exam improved to Stage II pelvic organ prolapse. A few months later, the patient reported that distracting vaginal pain recurred with the highest G forces. Coincidently, the patient was also diagnosed with pulmonary sequela of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and disqualified from flight status. DISCUSSION: This case illustrates the capability of decreasing pelvic organ prolapse with conservative measures, even in extreme environments, but it also identifies a possible association between an elastase activity defect and susceptibility to pelvic organ prolapse.Buckley K, Gann J, Barbier H, Greer J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to reuse available datasets to conduct an analysis of potential predictors of U.S. Air Force aircrew nonavailability in terms of being in “duties not to include flying” (DNIF) status. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of U.S. Air Force aircrew on active duty during the period from 2003–2012. Predictor variables included age, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), clinic location, diagnosis, gender, pay grade, and service component. The response variable was DNIF duration. Nonparametric methods were used for the exploratory analysis and parametric methods were used for model building and statistical inference. RESULTS: Out of a set of 783 potential predictor variables, 339 variables were identified from the nonparametric exploratory analysis for inclusion in the parametric analysis. Of these, 54 variables had significant associations with DNIF duration in the final model fitted to the validation data set. The predicted results of this model for DNIF duration had a correlation of 0.45 with the actual number of DNIF days. Predictor variables included age, 6 AFSCs, 7 clinic locations, and 40 primary diagnosis categories. DISCUSSION: Specific demographic (i.e., age), occupational (i.e., AFSC), and health (i.e., clinic location and primary diagnosis category) DNIF drivers were identified. Subsequent research should focus on the application of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention measures to ameliorate the potential impact of these DNIF drivers where possible.Tvaryanas AP, Griffith C Jr. Modeling predictors of duties not including flying status .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recently developed wearable monitoring devices can provide arterial oxygen saturation (Spo2) measurements, offering potential for use in aerospace operations. Pilots and passengers are already using these technologies, but their performance has not yet been established under conditions experienced in the flight environment such as environmental hypoxia and concurrent body motion. METHODS: An initial evaluation was conducted in 10 healthy subjects who were studied in a normobaric chamber during normoxia and at a simulated altitude of 15,000 ft (4572 m; 11.8% oxygen). SpO2 was measured simultaneously using a standard pulse oximeter and four wearable devices: Apple Watch Series 6; Garmin Fēnix 6 watch; Cosinusso Two in-ear sensor; and Oxitone 1000M wrist-worn pulse oximeter. Measurements were made while stationary at rest, during very slight body motion (induced by very low intensity cycling at 30 W on an ergometer), and during moderate body motion (induced by moderate intensity cycling at 150 W). RESULTS: Missed readings, defined as failure to record an Spo2 value within 1 min, occurred commonly with all wearables. Even with only very slight body motion, most devices missed most readings (range of 12–82% missed readings) and the rate was higher with greater body motion (range 18–92%). One device tended to under-report Spo2, while the other devices tended to over-report Spo2. Performance decreased across the devices when oxygenation was reduced. DISCUSSION: In this preliminary evaluation, the wearable devices studied did not perform to the same standard as a traditional pulse oximeter. These limitations may restrict their utility in flight and require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a major problem in aviation medicine because it is responsible for sleepiness and high cardiovascular risk, which could jeopardize flight safety. Residual sleepiness after the treatment is not a rare phenomenon and its management is not homogenous in aviation medicine. Thus, we decided to perform a study to describe this management and propose guidelines with the help of the literature. METHODS: This is a retrospective study including all aircrew members with a history of OSAS who visited our aeromedical center between 2011 and 2018. Residual sleepiness assessment was particularly studied. RESULTS: Our population was composed of 138 aircrew members (mean age 50.1 ± 9.6 yr, 76.8% civilians, 80.4% pilots); 65.4% of them had a severe OSAS with a mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at 8.5 ± 4.7 and a mean apnea hypopnea index of 36.2 ± 19.2/h. Of our population, 59.4% performed maintenance of wakefulness tests (MWT) and 10.1% had a residual excessive sleepiness. After the evaluation, 83.1% of our population was fit to fly. DISCUSSION: An evaluation of treatment efficiency is required in aircrew members with OSAS. Furthermore, it is important to have an objective proof of the absence of sleepiness. In this case, ESS is not sufficient and further evaluation is necessary. Many tests exist, but MWT are generally performed and the definition of a normal result in aeronautics is important. This evaluation should not be reserved to solo pilots only. Monin J, Rebiere E, Guiu G, Bisconte S, Perrier E, Manen O.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aircrew in-flight bladder relief remains an understudied stressor; specifically the effects of withholding urination on flight-relevant cognitive performance. This quasi-experimental study investigated whether voluntary urinary retention over a 3-h period negatively impacted cognitive performance. METHODS: We assessed vigilance using the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and measured the P3b event-related potential (ERP) in response to PVT stimuli. We also measured working memory (WM) performance using a change detection task and assessed the contralateral delay activity during the WM task using electroencephalography (EEG). Subjects ( N = 29) completed a baseline test on both tasks, following bladder voiding and immediately after consuming 0.75 L of water. Subjects performed tasks at 1, 2, and 3 h post-void and urgency to void one’s bladder was assessed regularly. A total of 17 subjects were able to complete the entire study protocol. Repeated-measures ANOVAs assessed changes in PVT and WM outcomes. RESULTS: Reaction time (RT) on the PVT was significantly impaired (5% slower) with longer urinary retention time and showed a 2.5-fold increase in the number of lapses (RT &gt; 500 ms) with increased retention time. Together these results indicate that sustained attention was impaired with increased voluntary urine retention. We did not see significant changes in WM performance with our manipulations. Additionally, neural measures acquired with EEG for both tasks did not show any significant effect. DISCUSSION: As measured with the PVT, sustained attention was impaired during 3 h of voluntary urinary retention, highlighting the need for further development of adequate bladder relief systems in military aviation.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In spaceflight, acute urinary retention (AUR) could develop as a sequela of medication use, urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, or intentional urine holding. While AUR is generally treated with bladder decompression, urinary catheterization could be difficult operationally in terms of training and proficiency, supplies, and lack of space or privacy. This report discusses a case in which tamsulosin and lorazepam were used successfully on an offshore ship while awaiting medical evacuation, a situation that could arise in remote locations where aerospace operations are conducted. CASE REPORT: A 52-yr-old man with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea but no formal diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia was unable to urinate for over 16 h while on a deep-sea fishing vessel approximately 200 nmi offshore. By phone, the physician providing remote medical direction diagnosed AUR in the setting of possible infection and prescribed acetaminophen, ciprofloxacin, and a trial of tamsulosin as the ship did not have any medical personnel trained to perform urinary catheterization and there were no catheter supplies available. Lorazepam was later added for anxiolysis and potential smooth muscle relaxation. Within 1 h of initial medication administration, the patient successfully voided a large quantity of urine, which tested positive for infection by urine dipstick. The patient was continued on antibiotics and evacuated to a medical facility onshore for further management. DISCUSSION: Pharmacological treatment could be considered as a temporizing measure where operational constraints limit the ability to perform urinary catheterization to relieve acute urinary retention.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The geographical circumstances, such as mountains and ocean, and specific aviation operations, especially sightseeing, make the state of Hawaii stand out in aviation. These conditions support a regional approach to aviation accident analysis. METHODS: Accident reports of aviation accidents collected from the online National Transportation Safety Board database were used to study a 10-yr time period between 2008 and 2017. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher proportion of fatal accidents during night, dawn, and dusk (6 out of 13) than during daytime (13 out of 74). In addition, a significantly higher proportion of accidents occurred in diminished light conditions among fixed wing airplanes (11 out of 48) as opposed to other aircraft (2 out of 39), and among twin-engine aircraft (6 out of 12) as opposed to single-engine aircraft (7 out of 74). Out of seven weight-shift control aviation accidents, four were reported to be fatal; the latter all took place during instruction. DISCUSSION: Light conditions are the main environmental concern in Hawaiian aviation that particularly affect twin-engine fixed wing aircraft and warrant specific attention in advanced training exercises. Helicopter operations have not exhibited a diminished safety record since the 1990s, showing a lasting effect of a previous safety intervention. A relatively high number of fatal weight-shift control aircraft accidents requires further research in other parts of the United States. de Voogt AJ, Brause J.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neck pain and injury are common problems in military high-performance aircraft and helicopter aircrews. A contributing factor may be the reclined sitting position in cockpits. This study aimed to determine the effect of typical cockpit ergonomics on cervical proprioception, assessed by using the cervical joint position error (cJPE). METHODS: A total of 49 healthy male military employees (mean age 19.9 ± 2.2 yr) were examined. Measurements of the cJPE were obtained in the flexion, extension, and rotation directions in an upright and in a 30°-reclined sitting position. Each condition comprised three trials, with an additional 3-kg head load to mimic real world working conditions. RESULTS: A smaller cJPE was noted in the 30°-reclined sitting position (mean cJPE = 3.9 cm) than in the upright sitting position (mean cJPE = 4.6 cm) in the flexion direction. The cJPE decreased significantly in all movement directions across the three trials; for example, in the flexion direction in the 30°-reclined sitting position: Trial 1/2/3 mean cJPE = 5.0/3.8/3.1 cm. CONCLUSION: It seems that a reclined seating position has a positive influence on cJPE. However, the result is weak. In both sitting positions and all three directions, the first tests of the cJPE showed the highest values. Already after one or two further measurement runs, a significantly reduced cJPE was observed. This rapid improvement might indicate that an exercise similar to the cJPE test may improve the pilots' cervical proprioception and possibly reduce the risk of injury or pain.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A study was performed to evaluate a cockpit flight simulation suite for measuring moderate altitude effects in a limited subject group. Objectives were to determine whether the apparatus can detect subtle deterioration, record physiological processes throughout hypobaric exposure, and assess recovery. METHODS: Eight subjects trained to perform precision instrument control (PICT) flight and unusual attitude recovery (UAR) and completed chamber flights dedicated to the PICT and UAR, respectively. Each flight comprised five epochs, including ground level pressure (GLP), ascent through altitude plateaus at 10,000, 14,000, and 17,500 ft (3050, 4270, and 5338 m), then postexposure recovery. PICT performance was assessed using control error (FSE) and time-out-of-bounds (TOOB) when pilots exited the flight corridor. UARs were assessed using response times needed to initiate correction and to achieve wings-level attitude. Physiological indices included S p o 2 , heart rate (HR), end tidal O 2 and CO 2 pressures, and respiration metrics. RESULTS: Seven subjects completed both flights. PICT performance deteriorated at altitude: FSE increased 33% at 17,513 ft and 21% in Recovery vs. GLP. Mean TOOB increased from 11 s at GLP to 60 s in Recovery. UAR effects were less clear, with some evidence of accelerated responses during and after ascent. CONCLUSIONS: The test paradigm was shown to be effective; piloting impairment was detected during and after exposure. Physiological channels recorded a combination of hypoxia, elevated ventilation, and hypocapnia during ascent, followed by respiratory slowing in recovery. Findings indicate precision piloting and respiration are subject to changes during moderate altitude exposure and may remain altered after S p o 2 recovers, and changes may be linked to hypocapnia.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spatial disorientation (SD) remains a stubborn and formidable challenge among rotary wing (RW) aircrews, particularly during times of high workload and deceptive visual cues. With tri-Service agreement, British RW Forces employ a layered training approach that now includes simulator-based immersive scenarios. METHODS: Ten bespoke RW SD training scenarios were developed for the AW159 Wildcat helicopter simulator by a multidisciplinary team. Scenarios were embedded within advanced training packages that were not solely focused on SD. A voluntary, anonymous survey instrument was distributed post-SD sortie to assess hazard awareness, training effectiveness, role and mission relevance, and perceived ability to respond to future SD threat. A corresponding assessment from the simulator instructor was used for independent determination if the crew became disoriented during the training. RESULTS: Over a 6-mo training cycle, 69 surveys were completed. Seven-point Likert-scale assessments yielded elevated median scores (6.0, respectively) across all four categories, suggesting favorable aircrew perceptions of training objective success. Elevated scoring of previous SD training received suggests good penetrance among the RW community surveyed. Of all sorties flown, the majority of aircrew (68%) became disoriented at some point during the sortie. DISCUSSION: This report provides limited evidence in support of bespoke SD training scenarios within a synthetic training environment. The merits include flexible ability to address root causes, provision of an interactive and immersive environment, and compatibility with extant tactics and mission configurations. SD simulator-based training can serve as an important component of a layered, multimodal approach. Bushby AJR, Gaydos SJ.

He did not mention the previous waiver or subsequent civilian surgical corneal treatment for Salzmann’s nodular degeneration and was diagnosed with gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy. Eventually all information was disclosed, and the diagnosis was changed to postoperative changes from previous Salzmann’s nodule removal, which is disqualifying for Marine Corps pilot applicants. DISCUSSION: Corneal dystrophy and degeneration are disqualifying conditions for military pilot applicants. A detailed history, to include surgical history, must be disclosed by the applicant.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During a deployment of a fighter unit, aircrew began to exhibit ear discomfort and episodes of auricular irritation and ulceration. All affected were using the Attenuating Custom Communications Earpiece System (ACCES). Discomfort was previously discussed in the literature, but neither the prevalence of discomfort nor the occurrence of skin ulcerations had been previously described.METHODS: An anonymous paper questionnaire was used with three fighter squadrons while deployed in 2019. A total of 59 aircrew in the F-15C/E and F-16 airframes participated; aircrew not using ACCES were excluded.RESULTS: Response rate was 57.3%, spread evenly among airframes, with 78% being pilots. A majority of respondents (79.7%) stated they had ACCES problems in the deployed setting. Among those noting problems in the deployed setting, 89% reported ear discomfort and a smaller portion reported skin redness, erosion, and bleeding.DISCUSSION: This study was able to provide a small sample estimate of the prevalence of ear problems among fighter aircrew ACCES users while deployed. This sample exhibited an increase in prevalence of ear discomfort during the deployment. It also showed pathological features absent in home-station flying, such as skin redness and erosion. However, the sample size and study design prevented risk factor characterization, confounder control, or causal inference. While ACCES may contribute to these problems, other confounders such as air characteristics, recall bias, aircrew motivation to report problems, and baseline dermatologic pathology could not be excluded. This data should serve as a baseline for larger studies, which are better equipped for confounder control and assessment of other potential risk factors.Strawbridge PA, Steinkraus LW, Girsch RM.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Fighter pilots must withstand high G z -forces that can damage the cervical spine. Strength of the cervical musculature is of vital importance when it comes to preventing these G-induced neck injuries. However, there is very little evidence on valid neck muscle strength measurement methods for fighter pilots. The aim of this study was to examine the validity of a commercial force gauge attached to a pilot’s helmet for measuring isometric neck muscle strength. METHODS: A total of 10 subjects performed maximal isometric cervical flexion, extension, and lateral flexion with the helmet-attached gauge and with a weight stack machine, which was used as a reference. Electromyography (EMG) activities were recorded from the right and left sternocleidomastoids and cervical erector spinae muscles during all measurements. Paired t -tests, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Wilcoxon’s test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Difference of mean force values between the devices was statistically significant in all directions. Pearson correlation coefficient varied between 0.73 and 0.89 and it was highest in cervical flexion. EMG activities were significantly different only in the left CES during flexion. DISCUSSION: The helmet-attached gauge is a valid tool for measuring isometric neck muscle strength and is best used as a means to compare individual differences in strength levels or to track the progress of strength development.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: With increasing engagement of commercial spaceflight participants in spaceflight activities, the evaluation of individuals with medical conditions not previously characterized in the spaceflight environment is of particular interest. Factors such as acceleration forces experienced during launch, reentry, and landing of spacecraft could pose an altered risk profile in some individuals due to known disease. Bleeding diatheses present a unique concern in the spaceflight environment given hypergravity exposure and, particularly, the potential for injury resulting from transient or impact acceleration. CASE REPORT: A 26-yr-old Caucasian man with severe hemophilia A and no detectable endogenous Factor VIII (FVIII) volunteered for participation in hypergravity exposures simulating spaceflight. His treatment regimen included 50 IU · kg −1 FVIII-Fc fusion protein intravenous administration every 96 h, with supplemental FVIII administration as needed for injury or bleeding. The subject experienced two profiles at the National Aerospace Training and Research Center (NASTAR), with maximum exposure +4.0 G z , +4.5 G x , 6.1 G resultant, and maximum onset rate &lt;0.5 G z · s −1 and +1 G x · s −1 . The subject reported no abnormal events during the profiles other than brief mild vertigo. No petechial hemorrhage, ecchymosis, or other bleeding was noted during or after profiles. Supplemental FVIII was not required before, during, or after exposure. DISCUSSION: Inherited bleeding disorders present several potential concerns that must be evaluated prior to spaceflight participation. Cautious review and management of medical history, adherence and barriers to treatment, duration of spaceflight and longitudinal management concerns, and a thorough and detailed risk/benefit assessment may provide a future pathway for inclusion of individuals with hematological disorders in commercial spaceflight.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the bond strength of fiber posts with different mixing methods and insertion into root canal techniques in long-term hypobaric pressure changes. METHODS: We chose and decoronated 42 teeth with straight and single root canals. After post-space preparation, the posts were cemented with hand-mixed and auto-mixed resin cements that were inserted into the canals with an endodontic file (lentilo), dual-barrel syringe, and root canal tip (14 for each group). After cementation, each group was divided into two subgroups ( N = 7): the control (ambient pressure) group and the hypobaric pressure group. The samples were exposed to hypobaric pressure 90 times. They were cut into 2-mm-thick segments and the push-out bond strength test was performed using a Universal Testing Machine. One-way ANOVA tests, Bonferroni tests, and Student- t -tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The environmental pressure changes and insertion techniques affected the bond strength values. The auto-mixed with root-canal tip group showed the highest push-out bond strength values in both hypobaric (dual-barrel syringe group: 10.01 MPa; root-canal tip group: 11.61 MPa) and control (dual-barrel syringe group: 12.29 MPa; root-canal tip group: 14.58 MPa) group. In all root segments, the bond strength values of hypobaric groups were lower than atmospheric pressure groups. The most frequent failure type was adhesive between dentin and cement in all groups. DISCUSSION: Dentists should use auto-mixed self-adhesive resin with a root canal tip for post cementations in patients likely to be exposed to hypobaric pressure changes.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Military aircrew frequently report cervico-thoracic pain and injury. The relationship between risk factors and future pain episodes is, however, uncertain. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for cervico-thoracic pain and to determine the 1-yr cumulative incidence of such pain. METHODS: A total of 47 Swedish aircrew (fighter and helicopter pilots and rear crew) without pain in the cervico-thoracic region were surveyed about work-related and personal factors and pain prevalence using the Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol questionnaire. They also performed tests of movement control, active cervical range of motion, and isometric neck muscle strength and endurance. Aircrew were followed for a year with questionnaires. Logistic regressions were used to identify potential risk factors for future cervico-thoracic pain. RESULTS: Previous cervico-thoracic pain (OR: 22.39, CI: 1.79–280.63), lower cervical flexion range of motion (OR: 0.78, CI: 0.64–0.96), and lower neck flexor muscular endurance (OR: 0.91, CI: 0.83–0.99) were identified as risk factors for reporting cervico-thoracic pain. At follow-up, 23.4% (CI: 13.6–37.2) had reported cervico-thoracic pain during the 12-mo follow-up period. DISCUSSION: The Musculoskeletal Screening Protocol can identify risk factors for cervico-thoracic pain. The link between cervico-thoracic pain and previous pain, as well as lower performance of neck range of motion and muscular endurance, highlights the need for primary and secondary preventive action.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The 1% rule has long been a standard threshold for aerospace medical risk acceptance, but medical literature has noted multiple shortcomings with this threshold. Previous studies have suggested a risk matrix approach in aeromedical decision-making. General use of risk matrices for risk assessment is already codified in the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Based on this, the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) Aeromedical Consultation Service (ACS) generated and evaluated the ACS Medical Risk Assessment and Airworthiness Matrix (AMRAAM). METHODS: The ACS adapted existing USAF standards to build the AMRAAM, gathered expert feedback, and sampled 100 previously adjudicated cases to compare legacy case dispositions to AMRAAM dispositions using polychoric correlation. RESULTS: The AMRAAM disposition showed strong agreement with legacy dispositions (ρ* = 0.9424). One case was discarded as it did not meet inclusion criteria. Of the 99 remaining cases, 88 had perfect agreement between legacy and AMRAAM dispositions. With the AMRAAM, eight cases were less restrictive and three were more restrictive (two due to an erroneous omission in the legacy disposition). DISCUSSION: The AMRAAM produces disposition recommendations that are highly consistent with the legacy approach informed by the 1% rule, with discordant AMRAAM dispositions tending to be more permissive. The USAFSAM AMRAAM allows a more dimensional risk evaluation than the 1% rule, communicates aeromedical risk consistent with nonmedical USAF organizations, and harmonizes aeromedical risk with the level of risk the USAF has defined for all flying systems. The ACS will use the AMRAAM as standard practice in future aeromedical risk assessments. Mayes RS, Keirns CJ, Hicks AG, Menner LD, Lee MS, Wagner JH, Baltzer RL.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Astronauts exercise to reduce microgravity-induced bone loss, but the resultant skeletal loading may not be sufficient to reduce fracture risk on an extended Mars mission. Adding additional exercise increases the risk of a negative caloric balance. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) induces involuntary muscle contractions, which load the skeleton. The metabolic cost of NMES is not fully understood. On Earth, walking is a common source of skeletal loading. If the metabolic cost of NMES were equal to or less than walking, it could offer a low metabolic cost option for increasing skeletal loading. METHODS: We measured the oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced from 10 subjects during 5-min bouts of walking at 2 mph, 3 mph, and 2 mph on a 6° incline, and of NMES to the legs at duty cycles of 1 s on and 5 s, 4 s, or 3 s off. Metabolic cost was calculated using the Brockway equation and the percent increase above resting for each NMES bout was compared to walking. RESULTS: Metabolic cost increased 64.9 ± 52.8% from rest in the most intense NMES duty cycle (1 s/3 s) and 120.4 ± 26.5%, 189.3 ± 59.5%, 281.7 ± 66.8%, for the 2 mph, 3 mph, and incline walking, respectively. The metabolic cost did not differ significantly between the three NMES duty cycles. DISCUSSION: The increase in metabolic cost of the fastest NMES bout was less than that of the slowest walk, indicating that numerous NMES bouts offer a way to increase skeletal loading at a modest metabolic cost. This might allow for more daily skeletal loading cycles, potentially further reducing bone loss. Abitante TJ, Alemi MM, Newman DJ, Duda KR.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Critical care for exploration space missions may require intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation therapy. Resource constraints may limit availability of standard, Earth-based infusion technologies. The effect of variable acceleration on infusion flow rates using simple fluid resuscitation supplies was investigated. METHODS: Infusions of water or blood analog (40% glycerol) from a 1 L IV bag were performed using pressure bag augmentation at 0, 150, or 300 mmHg. The solution bag rested on an adjustable mount, configured to different heights to simulate relevant gravitational accelerations (1 G, Martian G, lunar G, and 0 G). The bag emptied through an IV line with a 14- or 20-gauge angiocath into a 3-mmHg venous pressure reservoir. Flow rates were measured using an in-line flow probe. Three determinations were made for each test condition. RESULTS: Temporal flow rate data for all test conditions displayed one-phase exponential decay. At 300 mmHg pressurization, maximum infusion rates ranged from 92–222 mL ⋅ min −1 for water and from 21–49 mL ⋅ min −1 for blood analog. All reduced gravity conditions had significantly longer infusion times in comparison to 1 G for both test solutions. DISCUSSION: Reduced acceleration significantly altered flow rates and infusion times for fluid resuscitation. Fluid resuscitation protocols specify a desired volume to infuse for a target time (e.g., 20–30 mL ⋅ min −1 for a 75-kg adult). This data demonstrates that this protocol parameter can be achieved with infusion pressure bag augmentation alone and provides information for the refinement of fluid resuscitation protocols for exploration space missions.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In military aviation, due to high-altitude flight operations, hypoxia training is mandatory and nowadays is mainly done as normobaric hypoxia training in flight simulators. During the last decade, scientific data has been published about delayed recovery after normobaric hypoxia, known as a \"hypoxia hangover.\" Sopite syndrome is a symptom complex that develops as a result of exposure to real or apparent motion, and it is characterized by yawning, excessive drowsiness, lassitude, lethargy, mild depression, and a reduced ability to focus on an assigned task.CASE REPORT: In this study, we present the case of a 49-yr-old pilot who participated in normobaric hypoxia refreshment training in an F/A-18C Hornet simulator and experienced delayed drowsiness, even 3 h after the training.DISCUSSION: This case report demonstrates the danger of deep hypoxia. Hypoxia training instructions should include restrictions related to driving a car immediately after hypoxia training. In addition, hypoxia may lower the brain threshold for sopite syndrome.Varis N, Leinonen A, Perälä J, Leino TK, Husa L, Sovelius R.

His contributions to space and medicine of extreme environments had a profound impact on human space exploration. He fostered collaboration in many areas of space–human factors, especially in the areas of renal function, endocrinology, and fluids and electrolytes. The joint efforts between NASA and the Soviet/Russian Space Program constitute the foundation for mutual respect and scientific endeavors that continue to transcend the world’s political events.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), travelers are typically subject to quarantine, which is often associated with poorer mental health (MH). While the protective benefits of community-based exercise are widely recognized, the degree to which this extends to the confined setting is unknown. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effect of exercise on MH in isolating or quarantining adults. METHODS: A literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews limited to January 2019–September 2021 inclusive yielded five eligible studies. RESULTS: Data comprised a total of 2755 college and university students, most of whom were confined. Depending on the scale used, 24.9–76.7% of respondents demonstrated impaired MH, which improved with physical activity (PA), especially when regular and moderate or vigorous. The frequency, duration, and participants of exercise increased as lockdown progressed. One study showed that while sleep, diet, and PA all have an impact on MH, PA was the factor most strongly correlated with MH. DISCUSSION: Physical fitness should be optimized before and maintained during quarantine while exercise space and equipment should be accessible. Importantly, the sustainability of persistent quarantine must be considered given the pervasiveness of COVID-19. Chu V, Newman DG.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many current cell phone (mobile phone, smartphone) batteries are lithium-ion. These batteries can overheat and catch fire under certain conditions. If it happens during a flight or air activity, this might compromise aviation safety. We report a case of a man whose phone caught fire during a parachute jump. CASE REPORT: The individual, a member of Police Special Forces, is required to regularly perform parachute jumps. During the incident flight, the man had a cell phone in a pocket that ignited during the jump. He was able to land and then extract the phone with burns requiring acute medical care and later a skin graft. DISCUSSION: This is a cautionary tale of lithium-ion batteries in flight. Many other situations could also occur with these batteries. There is little medical documentation of the risk of fire with lithium-ion batteries causing injuries during flight operations. To reduce the risk of fire, the devices should be powered down and phones should not be worn directly touching the skin. Damaged devices are more prone to overheating. des Robert V, Saint-Jean L, Corcostegui S-P, Romary E, and Derkenne C. Burnt by his cellphone during a parachute jump .

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The chronic effects of regular exposure to high acceleration levels (G-force) on the neuro-cardiovascular system are unclear. We compared the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac autonomic modulation between nonpilots (NP) vs. military fighter (FP) and transport (TP) pilots. Additionally, we correlated the cardiac autonomic indices with the cardiorespiratory fitness and flight experience of FP. METHODS: A total of 21 FP, 8 TP, and 20 NP performed a tilt test (TT), during which beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. RESULTS: No difference was detected between groups for changes in MAP and heart rate variability indices during the TT. However, the analysis of areas under the curves showed a greater increase in MAP in FP vs. TP and NP. Conversely, there was a greater decrease in indices reflecting vagal modulation in TP vs. FP and NP (rMSSD, pNN50, and SDNN), and a greater increase in heart rate and sympathovagal balance in TP vs. other groups (LF/HF). The maximal oxygen uptake was strongly correlated with the vagal reserve in FP (r = −0.74). Moreover, the total flying hours of FP were positively correlated with resting HFnu (r = 0.47) and inversely correlated with resting LFnu (r = −0.55) and LF/HF (r = −0.46). CONCLUSION: FP had a higher pressor response to TT than TP and NP. Vagal withdrawal and sympathovagal increase induced by TT in FP were similar vs. NP and attenuated vs. TP. Greater cardiorespiratory fitness and accumulated flying hours in FP seemed to favor lower sympathetic and greater vagal modulation at rest. dos Santos Rangel MV, de Sá GB, Farinatti P, Borges JP.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: +G z tolerance is an important aspect for the success of fighter aircrew as it reflects the ability of the neuro-cardiovascular response to compensate and prevent adverse manifestations such as gray-out, black-out, and G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) under high-G stress. METHODS: The data for aircrew taking the Operational Training in Aerospace Medicine for Fighters course at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine Indian Air Force (IAF) from January 2017 to December 2020 were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the existing training goal to recommend a G-tolerance standard for fighter aircrew. RESULTS: During the study period, 334 aircrew took the Operational Training in Aerospace Medicine for Fighter course. Only three aircrew failed to achieve the training goal of the course (failure rate &lt;1%). There was a significant difference in the relaxed gradual onset rate tolerance of aircrew experiencing G-LOC and not experiencing G-LOC during the training. The odds of experiencing G-LOC at 9 G after clearing the 7-G and 8-G profiles were 4.4 and 4.7, respectively. DISCUSSION: It is generally accepted that aircrew having higher G tolerance have less chance of G-LOC in the air. There is a need to have an operational definition of G tolerance for fighter aircrew that aligns with the operational training goal of the organization. The G tolerance of IAF aircrew is as per the institutional definition of the IAF Institute of Aerospace Medicine. The high-G training has stood the test of time and has served well for the IAF.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Military personnel extensively use night vision goggles (NVGs) in contemporary scenarios. Since NVGs may induce or increase injuries from falls or vehicular accidents, biomechanical risk assessments would aid design goal or mitigation strategy development.METHODS: This study assesses injury risks from NVG impact on cadaver heads using impactors modeled on the PVS-14 NVG. Impacts to the zygoma and maxilla were performed at 20° or 40° angles. Risks of facial fracture, neurotrauma, and neck injury were assessed. Acoustic sensors and accelerometers assessed time of fracture and provided input variables for injury risk functions. Injuries were assessed using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS); injury severity was assessed using the Rhee and Donat scales. Risk functions were developed for the input variables using censored survival analyses.RESULTS: The effects of impact angle and bone geometry on injury characteristics were determined with loading area, axial force, energy attenuation, and stress at fracture. Probabilities of facial fracture were quantified through survival analysis and injury risk functions. These risk functions determined a 50% risk of facial bone fracture at 1148 N (axial force) at a 20° maxillary impact, 588 N at a 40° maxillary impact, and 677 N at a 20° zygomatic impact. A cumulative distribution function indicates 769 N corresponds to 50% risk of fracture overall.DISCUSSION: Results found smaller impact areas on the maxilla are correlated with higher angles of impact increasing risk of facial fracture, neck injuries are unlikely to occur before fracture or neurotrauma, and a potential trade-off mechanism between fracture and brain injury.Davis MB, Pang DY, Herring IP, Bass CR.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During spaceflight, it is important to consider the mechanisms by which surgeries and medical procedures can be safely and efficiently conducted. Instruments used to carry out these processes need to be sterilized. Thus, we have designed and tested a three-dimensional-printed (3D-printed) portable sterilizer that implements far ultraviolet-C (Far UV-C) light radiation to disinfect bacteria and microorganisms from surgical instruments. METHODS: The sterilizer was 3D-printed with polylactic acid filament. Effectiveness was assessed through three trials at differing times of sterilization and compared against a control group of no sterilization and against Clorox wipes. Cultures were incubated on agar dishes and counted with ImageJ. RESULTS: Increasing time under Far UV-C light radiation increased the percentage of sterilization up to 100% at 10 min. The 3D-printed sterilizer was significantly better than Clorox wipes and control. DISCUSSION: As sterilization will be necessary for surgical procedures in microgravity and upmass is a significant concern, we have successfully demonstrated a 3D-printable portable sterilizer for surgical instruments that achieves 100% success in using Far UV-C light to disinfect its surface of bacteria with a 10-min sterilizing time. Further research is necessary to test this design in microgravity and with differently sized and shaped instruments. Kovalski E, Salazar L, Levin D, Kamine TH.

The brain has a period of 5–6 s from the onset of high +G z exposure, called the functional buffer period, during which transient ischemia is tolerated without loss of consciousness. We tried to establish a method for predicting G-LOC within the functional buffer period by using machine learning. We used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a popular classification algorithm in machine learning. METHODS: The subjects were 124 flight course students. We used a linear soft-margin SVM, a nonlinear SVM Gaussian kernel function (GSVM), and a polynomial kernel function, for each of which 10 classifiers were built every 0.5 s from the onset of high +G z exposure (Classifiers 0.5–5.0) to predict G-LOC. Explanatory variables used for each SVM were age, height, weight, with/without anti-G suit, +G z level, cerebral oxyhemoglobin concentration, and deoxyhemoglobin concentration. RESULTS: The performance of GSVM was better than that of other SVMs. The accuracy of each classifier of GSVM was as follows: Classifier 0.5, 58.1%; 1.0, 54.8%; 1.5, 57.3%; 2.0, 58.1%; 2.5, 64.5%; 3.0, 63.7%; 3.5, 65.3%; 4.0, 64.5%; 4.5, 64.5%; and 5.0, 64.5%. CONCLUSION: We could predict G-LOC with an accuracy rate of approximately 65% from 2.5 s after the onset of high +G z exposure by using GSVM. Analysis of a larger number of cases and factors to enhance accuracy may be needed to apply those classifiers in centrifuge training and actual flight.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Sleep is an indispensable physiological phenomenon. The complexity of sleep and the time it occupies in human life determine that its quality is positively correlated with human health. Since polysomnography was used in spaceflight in 1967, the sleep problem during astronaut flight has been studied in depth for more than 50 yr, and many solutions have been proposed, but astronauts have always had sleep problems during orbital flight. Insufficient sleep and changes in the rhythm of human sleep-wake activity will lead to disturbance of the human body’s internal rhythm indicators, which will lead to psychological and emotional fluctuations and reduced cognitive ability, decision-making ability, teamwork, and work performance. NASA has identified operational errors due to sleep deprivation and altered circadian rhythms as an important risk factor in the key biomedical roadmap for long-term flight, so the importance of sleep monitoring in spaceflight is self-evident. On-orbit sleep-monitoring methods include both subjective and objective aspects. We review objective sleep-monitoring technology based on its application, main monitoring physiological indicators, intrusive advantages, and limitations. This paper reviews the subjective and objective sleep evaluation methods for on-orbit applications, summarizes the progress, advantages, and disadvantages of current ground sleep-monitoring technologies and equipment, and looks forward to the application prospects of new sleep-monitoring technologies in spaceflight.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research has shown that excessive sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has been associated with being overweight and obese and the military is not immune to this disorder. Being overweight/obese is one of the characteristics that comprise a condition known as Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). The global prevalence of MetS in the military population is estimated to be 21%, which varies depending upon the armed forces type and specialty. The purpose of this study is to identify the subset of the aviation population that may develop MetS at some future point and to put forth suggestions on how best to combat this and maintain operational readiness. METHODS: Data were collected by means of an anonymous 44-item survey administered and completed by 302 students enrolled in Aviation Preflight Indoctrination at the Naval Air Station Base in Pensacola, FL. RESULTS: Results indicated that 70.86% of students reported SSB consumption, with 95.3% preferring caffeinated to decaffeinated SSBs. 11.7% of personnel met the “at risk criteria” of consuming SSBs four times per week or greater (four 12-oz cans or more per week). DISCUSSION: Findings from this study indicate that approximately 11.7% of aviation pilots or flight officers are “at risk” of developing MetS. Given that it takes up to 4 yr to train a new fighter pilot, this could become a significant readiness issue on par with the impact seen with pilots leaving the services through natural attrition.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: G tolerance has been widely assessed using Peripheral Light Loss (PLL), but this approach has several limitations and may lack sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of a foveal visual endpoint for centrifuge research (Grating Loss; GL) and assess its repeatability, reliability, and usability with PLL as a reference. METHODS: A total of 11 subjects undertook centrifuge assessment. Gradual onset sessions (GOR; 0.1 G · s −1 ) measured both endpoints simultaneously and were performed twice, consisting of six determinations with anti-G suits activated (GOR-On) and six without (GOR-Off). Four determinations of each endpoint were also taken during rapid onset runs (ROR; 3 G · s −1 ). Usability was scored subjectively. RESULTS: The GL endpoint was reached 0.3–0.5 G z lower than PLL with each endpoint correlating strongly in GOR-Off (r = 0.93), GOR-On (r = 0.95), and ROR (r = 0.86). The GL had excellent test–retest repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient: GOR-Off/On = 0.99, ROR = 0.92) and low within-subject variability. Between-subject variance equaled PLL in all conditions. Subjective usability endpoint ratings were equal for all conditions. DISCUSSION: For the 11 individuals tested, the GL was a reliable, repeatable, and usable endpoint, with similar performance to PLL. GL may prove useful as a supplementary endpoint for human centrifuge research as a secondary data point or to reduce fatigue in repeated measurements.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The present study examined long-term retention and transfer of knowledge and skills, as well as the effect of cognitive load on retention and transfer, using a sample of astronaut candidates and two comparison groups. The first comparison group, recruited from Johnson Space Center, was similar in age, education, and general health to the astronaut candidate group; the second comparison group included university undergraduate students. METHODS: This study employed two different tasks—a simple perceptual-motor task involving data entry and a complex memory updating task requiring both prospective and retrospective memory. Subjects completed multiple sessions involving both tasks over a 500-d period, with test sessions involving transfer and/or a cognitive load manipulation. For the perceptual-motor task, transfer involved changes to the stimuli that increased intrinsic cognitive load or changes to the required motoric procedures. For the memory updating task, extraneous cognitive load was increased by the addition of a concurrent secondary task. RESULTS: For both the perceptual-motor and memory updating tasks, astronaut candidates and candidate-like subjects performed more accurately, with greater speed, and were less impacted by increased cognitive load than undergraduate students. Despite the generally superior performance of astronaut candidates and candidate-like subjects, they were more likely to experience negative transfer on the perceptual-motor task, whereas undergraduate students demonstrated positive transfer. DISCUSSION: Candidate-like subjects provided a more accurate approximation of astronaut candidate performance than did undergraduate students, especially with regard to negative transfer effects and cognitive load.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: High-altitude [&gt;2400 m (7874 ft)] acclimatization has been well studied with physiological adaptations like reductions in body weight and exercise capacity. However, despite the significance of moderate altitude [MA, 1524–2438 m (5000–8000 ft)], acclimatization at this elevation is not well described. We aimed to investigate differences in mice reared at MA compared to sea level (SL). We hypothesized that MA mice would be smaller and leaner and voluntarily run less than SL mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice reared for at least three generations in Laramie, WY [2194 m (7198 ft), MA], were compared to C57BL/6J mice from Bar Harbor, ME [20 m (66 ft), SL]. We quantified body composition and exercise outputs as well as cardiopulmonary morphometrics. Subsets of MA and SL mice were analyzed to determine differences in neuronal activation after exercise. RESULTS: When body weight was normalized to tibia length, SL animals weighed 1.30 g ⋅ mm -1 while MA mice weighed 1.13 g · mm -1 . Total fat % and trunk fat % were higher in MA mice with values of 41% and 39%, respectively, compared to SL mice with values of 28% and 26%, respectively. However, no differences were noted in leg fat %. MA animals had higher heart mass (119 mg) and lower lung mass (160 mg) compared to SL mice heart mass (100 mg) and lung mass (177 mg). MA mice engaged in about 40% less voluntary wheel-running activity than SL animals. DISCUSSION: Physiological differences are apparent between MA and SL mice, prompting a need to further understand larger scale implications of residence at moderate altitude.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is no consensus on whether cardiopulmonary reserve affects the risk of gravity-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) or almost loss of consciousness (A-LOC). Few previous studies have used cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to assess cardiopulmonary reserve function (CPRF) of fighter aviators. We compared CPET-related parameters in G-LOC/A-LOC and non-G-LOC/A-LOC fighter aviators to explore the effect of cardiopulmonary reserve function on G tolerance. METHODS: A total of 264 male fighter aviators with more than 500 h of flight experience participated in the study, all of whom underwent CPET and human centrifuge testing. We divided the aviators into two groups based on whether they experienced G-LOC/A-LOC during the human centrifuge test and compared the CPET parameters between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 37 aviators (14%) experienced G-LOC/A-LOC. There were no significant differences in age (26.65 ± 4.30 vs. 26.01 ± 4.95), height (173.68 ± 4.21 vs. 173.55 ± 3.37), weight (69.51 ± 6.22 vs. 69.63 ± 6.01), or body mass index (23.06 ± 2.11 vs. 23.11 ± 1.82) between the two groups. Forced vital capacity (FVC) (4.95 ± 0.87 vs. 4.65 ± 0.79) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) divided by FVC (FEV 1 /FVC) (79.88 ± 7.24 vs. 83.72 ± 9.24) of pulmonary function of the G-LOC/A-LOC group was significantly lower than that of the non-G-LOC/A-LOC group. There was no significant difference in CPET-related parameters between the two groups. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, FEV 1 /FVC may be a factor affecting aviators’ G-LOC/A-LOC, meaning aviators with slightly lower ventilation are more likely to experience G-LOC/A-LOC. However, oxygen uptake and exercise blood pressure, oxygen pulse, etc., may not be the main factors influencing G-LOC/A-LOC. Lan X, Zhu W, Du J, Wang J, Yang M, Xu Y, Cao Y.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Management of aeromedical risk is essential for flight safety. Given the many operator stressors for pilots, militaries maintain a vested interest in selecting aircrew applicants who meet rigorous initial medical standards. Very little published literature exists regarding the extent of medical disqualifications or precluding conditions for initial candidates. METHODS: For the British Army, pilot selection is a phased, multistep process that includes Phase I medical screening followed by a comprehensive Phase II medical exam. De-identified summary data were retrospectively reviewed for medical fitness and disqualifying categories for the 5-yr period of 2018–2022, inclusive. For those ultimately deemed unfit for aviation service, etiology was grouped into general categories. RESULTS: Approximately one-third (30.2%) of candidates were disqualified at Phase I initial medical screening with leading categories of attrition due to respiratory etiology, especially a history of asthma or reactive airway disease, followed by ophthalmology. For the Phase II medical exam cohort, 21.0% were medically disqualified with most attrition from anthropometry and ophthalmology. There were no statistical differences in disqualifications for gender or pathway of entry (civilian vs. serving personnel). DISCUSSION: Major categories of medical attrition were similar to that of other nations, yet the published literature in this area is surprisingly tenuous. Given the desire for evidence-based medical selection standards, it is important for regular review of processes and standards such that the risks of known physiological challenges are judiciously weighed with the benefits of a large, diverse pool of selection as well as force structure and recruitment demand.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive treatments are increasingly prescribed in a variety of diseases. This issue concerns airmen. METHODS: To assess the problem, we conducted an observational retrospective study in the aircrew population examined in 2014 at the Aeromedical Center of Percy Military Hospital. RESULTS: Airmen treated with immunosuppressive drugs accounted for 0.5% of the total population ( N = 13,326). Rheumatic and digestive diseases were the main etiologies, respectively 43% and 35% of cases. One-third of airmen took such medications during at least 3 yr and three-quarters of airmen were declared fit to fly, with some limitations. DISCUSSION: Due to their working conditions, airmen are exposed to a real infectious risk, which is, however, difficult to evaluate. The risk is obviously increased by immunosuppressive drugs and may affect flight safety. Aeromedical evaluation should consider this problem. Vaccination plays a central role in the prevention of infectious risk. Based on French recommendations, we propose a vaccination schedule for these particular patients.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acetabular labral tears in the hip have become an increasingly common finding in active duty members due to improved diagnostic capabilities. This has led to a dramatic increase in operative management despite a lack of evidence to support clear long-term benefits. Literature review demonstrated overwhelmingly positive short-term outcomes for labral repairs; however, scattered case reports exist demonstrating debilitating outcomes in young patients, ultimately resulting in total hip arthroplasty. CASE REPORT: A 27-yr-old pilot originally presented with groin pain. Initial X-ray demonstrated a CAM lesion of the right hip and subsequent MRA showed an acetabular labral tear. The patient underwent open arthrotomy with labral repair and femoroplasty with minimal improvement in symptoms. Repeat imaging over 2 yr showed early onset osteoarthritis with rapid progression and a recurrent labral tear. Due to the significant progression of osteoarthritis, the patient was given the choice between a repeat labral repair and total hip arthroplasty. The patient elected for hip arthrotomy with labral repair and extensive synovectomy, which yielded minimal improvement in symptoms. DISCUSSION: Acetabular labral tears have become a hot topic in the field of orthopedics as a result of a surge in diagnoses likely due to improvements in imaging, most notably MRAs. This has led to considerable debate regarding how to best manage this condition. The literature overwhelmingly shows positive short-term outcomes for surgical management; however, long-term follow-up studies are lacking. The literature has demonstrated multiple case reports resulting in significant complications as a result of these operations, including chondrolysis and eventual need for total hip arthroplasty. Therefore, patient selection is critical as the population tends to be young and active, and the potential complications can be catastrophic. In any case, it is clear that further research is required. Sardon CJ, Resnick ML. Severe arthritic changes following acetabular labral repair and femoroplasty in an air force pilot .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the association of statin use and musculoskeletal conditions within the population of U.S. Air Force active duty aviators. METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort analysis of aviators between 2004–2014 as identified from personnel data. Based on pharmacy data, participants were divided into two groups: statin users (received a statin for at least 90 d) and nonusers (never received a statin throughout the study period). Using participants’ baseline characteristics, a propensity score was generated and used to match statin users to nonusers in a 1:6 ratio. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratio for a musculoskeletal condition. RESULTS: A total of 19,330 participants met study criteria (131 statin users and 19,199 nonusers). Of these, 112 statin users were matched to 672 nonusers. Among matched pairs, statin users were not at significantly increased risk (odds ratio: 1.239; 95% confidence interval: 0.768, 1.999) for musculoskeletal conditions. Likewise, there was no observed significant association between specific musculoskeletal disease diagnosis groups and statin use. CONCLUSIONS: In this aviator population, there was not an increased overall likelihood of musculoskeletal conditions for statin users relative to propensity score-matched nonusers. A well-designed prospective cohort analysis or clinical trial is needed to ascertain possible adverse effects of statins on performance in the aviation environment.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Analysis of mishap data is an obvious measure of performance for those who wish to improve flight safety and affect aviation capability development within military forces. METHODS: This study examined rotary-wing accident information held by UK Ministry of Defence authorities for the 16-yr (inclusive) period from January 2000 through December 2015 in order to ascertain incidence patterns. Serious accidents of military registered aircraft operated by Joint Helicopter Command, the Royal Navy, the Search and Rescue Force, and the Defence Helicopter Flying School were included in the analysis. A secondary intent of the review was to examine the influence of broad-based organizational changes on the overall incidence of rotary-wing accidents across the U.K. Ministry of Defence that grew out of the report published by Charles Haddon-Cave, QC, following his wide-ranging investigation into the catastrophic crash of Royal Air Force Nimrod XV230 that occurred during a routine mission in Southern Afghanistan. RESULTS: During the 16-yr period between January 2000 and December 2015, 53 rotary-wing accidents occurred. The overall accident rate was 2.32 accident events per 100,000 flight hours. Spatial disorientation accidents remain a prevalent risk in this study, being acknowledged in 43% of accidents. Prior to the Haddon-Cave report, the accident rate was 2.81 events per 100,000 flight hours. Following the report, the accident rate decreased to 1.24 events per 100,000 flight hours. DISCUSSION: The decrease in the accident rate between 2000 and 2015 shares a temporal association with the adoption and operationalization of the recommendations found in Haddon-Cave’s report.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain and discomfort reported during sitting is a significant problem for aviators during prolonged missions. Previous work has determined that areas of local pressure exist during prolonged sitting in UH-60 seat systems; however, no work has examined the effects of this local pressure on measures of neurological and circulatory function. METHODS: A total of 30 healthy subjects completed the study in which focal pressure was applied in three conditions (no pressure, pressure to the ischial tuberosity, and pressure to the posterior thigh). We applied pressure using a purpose-built pressure application system allowing subjects to sit in a position mimicking the sitting position in a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and measurements were taken before, during, and after pressure application. We measured neurological function with the soleus Hoffmann reflex and sural nerve conduction velocity, and circulatory function with dynamic infrared thermography. RESULTS: We found a decrease in soleus Hoffmann reflex by 0.87 V and 0.52 V during pressure application at the posterior thigh and ischial tuberosity, respectively. No changes in nerve conduction velocity were found among the conditions during or after pressure application. Limb temperature increased 0.42–0.44°C during pressure application, but began to return to baseline once pressure was removed. DISCUSSION: This study examined the development of neurological and circulatory alterations due to local pressure application in an aviation specific functional position. These results may be used in the development of future interventions to mitigate the negative effects of localized pressure in military aviators. Games KE, Lakin JM, Quindry JC, Weimar WH, Sefton JM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In September 2004 a new pilot certificate, sport pilot, was established, which enabled pilots to fly with a valid driver’s license in lieu of a valid third-class medical certificate. In 2016 Mills and DeJohn published a paper in which they demonstrated that sport pilots had a higher accident rate than private pilots with Class 3 medical certificates. They concluded that this privilege should not be extended to a broader range of pilots due to the higher accident rate. They failed to investigate why these pilots crashed. This short communication aims to fill that gap. METHODS: The NTSB database was reviewed for the entire period that sport pilot has been available, and reasons for the accidents were determined, both for sport pilots and private pilots with Class 3 medicals. RESULTS: Sport pilot accidents were caused by medical incapacitation 3.7% of the time. Private pilots with Class 3 medicals had accidents that cited medical incapacitation 2.5% of the time. DISCUSSION: Medical incapacitation represents either a probable cause or contributing factor in aviation accidents less than 5% of the time. There is a slightly higher rate of this incapacitation among pilots not receiving regular aeromedical evaluations, but the difference was not statistically significant. Mulvey JR.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate current U.S. Army rotary-wing aviators’ perspectives of cockpit automation in terms of safety features and effects on the retention of basic flying skills. In doing so, future lines of research can utilize this information to develop programs for the transitioning and training of advanced aircraft into the Army. METHODS: An anonymous, 125-item questionnaire was completed by 214 U.S. Army aviators. A subset of five items related to perceptions of automation were examined based on experience level and are reported here. The majority of subjects were male aviators with a mean age of 33 yr. RESULTS: Results suggest a difference in perceptions of some of the safety features, with 8 and 12% more of the experienced pilots reporting safety concerns on two items. A 13% difference in the perceptions of effects of automation on skills retention items were found based on experience level. More experienced aviators’ responses identified possible distrust of several automation features. DISCUSSION: The findings of this survey identified perspectives of automation which differed based on experience level. Specifically, more experienced individuals indicated some distrust of automation features and a possible overconfidence in basic flying skills. This can be used to further develop research aimed at the transition of advanced technology to aviators. Feltman KA, Kelley AM, Curry IP. Army aviators’ perceptions of advanced cockpit aircraft .

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) remains a major cause of morbidity in several parts of the world. Aircrew with immune-active hepatitis are unfit for flying duties due to the risk of acute hepatic decompensation; those who have begun on treatment are generally also disqualified from flying duties due to the potential side effects of antiviral treatment. As treatment endpoints for nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUC) are typically achieved after prolonged therapy, aircrew treated for CHB may be subjected to an extended period of flying restriction. METHODS: We present a retrospective case series of seven aircrew who were returned to flying duties while on varying combinations of NUC for the treatment of CHB. All seven aircrew were comanaged by the flight surgeon and hepatologist, reviewed by a panel of flight surgeons, and had achieved normalized liver function tests prior to resumption of flying duties; two out of the seven aircrew had detectable serum Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA when reinstated back to flying duties. Only one aircrew member experienced side effects from the NUC treatment. This was promptly evaluated and managed prior to resumption of flying duties to ensure flight safety. DISCUSSION: Aircrew with CHB infection can be safely allowed back to flying duties, especially when their conditions have been well controlled via treatment with any of the NUC regimes. While there are limited studies evaluating the use of NUC in aircrew performing flight duties, our study has shown that NUC are generally well tolerated and have a good safety profile which is compatible with flying duties.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spontaneous aneurysm of the superficial temporal artery in a helicopter pilot while operating in the extreme cold climatic conditions of a very high altitude area led to a thorough search for etiological possibilities related to this case. CASE REPORT: A 38-yr-old military helicopter pilot, while flying at altitudes ranging from 4500 m to 6000 m (15,000 to 20,000 ft) reported with an acute onset of a subcutaneous swelling on his left temple. History and clinical profile did not suggest any traumatic, hematologic, or vasculitic etiology. His inflammatory markers, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, complement levels, and whole-body PET scan did not suggest any evidence of vasculitis. Presence of any other intracranial aneurysms was also ruled out. He underwent curative excision biopsy, which showed perivascular inflammation. He was diagnosed as a case of left superficial temporal artery aneurysm. The recovery period was uneventful and the follow-up color Doppler flow imaging of the temporal artery and acute phase reactants was normal. DISCUSSION: Spontaneous aneurysms involving the superficial temporal artery is a very rare diagnosis. Occurrence of such an aneurysm in a young pilot without any identifiable predisposing factors led the authors to hypothesize a possible etiological combination of environmental and mechanical factors along with aviation stresses with the likely compounding role of the helmet. Management and aeromedical aspects of this unique case are discussed in this paper. Sekhar BM, Sheoran S, Routh D, Sharma S.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In February 1970, halfway through a Polaris submarine war patrol in SSBN-02 HMS Renown (port crew), a Petty Officer presented to the sick bay in excruciating pain with a broken upper left molar tooth. The zinc oxide/clove oil mixture would not stick on to the vertical face of the fracture. In preparation for such events, Royal Navy (RN) submarine medical officers are taught excellent fundamental dental skills. In this case, it seemed a very difficult job to extract the remains of the tooth. The author reports the first known use of glass fiber/resin in the RN to crown and treat a fractured molar, cover the root, and save the tooth, and to recommend that all military and civilian medical staff working anywhere in isolation with no dental facility locally be given similar training to that which RN submarine medical officers receive before being sent on extended dives.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Internal jugular phlebectasia (IJP) is an uncommon entity with only about 100 reported cases and with very few available cases in the literature. The current case study is about a male trainee fighter pilot incidentally diagnosed to have IJP. With limited literary evidence, it was a complex task to predict the prognosis of IJP and its implications on fighter flying. CASE REPORT: In order to confirm the diagnosis, a preliminary study was carried out to find out the normal and expanded area of the internal jugular vein (IJV) of 30 volunteers. The expanded area of the right IJV of the trainee pilot fell beyond 1 SD of the study population, confirming the diagnosis of IJP in the trainee pilot. DISCUSSION: Aeromedical concerns were the anti-G straining maneuver, positive pressure breathing for G, negative G z , modified Valsalva maneuver, and rapid decompression. Considering the potential progression of IJP by repeated exposure to aviation stresses, the trainee pilot was re-assigned to helicopters. Khatua SS, Sannigrahi P, Dahiya M, Rastogi P, Raheem A.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Space is a special environment in which microgravity and cosmic rays are the primary factors that induce gene mutations of microorganisms. In our previous studies, a single point mutation in the gene dprA was found in an Enterococcus faecium strain of LCT-EF258 after spaceflight. DNA processing protein A (DprA) plays a prominent role in the horizontal transfer of genes among bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, Bacillus subtilis, and Rhodobacter capsulatus ). However, the function of DprA in E. faecium remains unknown. Furthermore, E. faecium could acquire antibiotic resistance through the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, but it is unclear whether dprA mutants could affect this process in E. faecium . METHODS: In this study, we constructed a plasmid containing the vancomycin resistance gene vanA and then transferred the gene vanA into the dprA-mutant strain LCT-EF258 and the control strain LCT-EF90 using the electroporation technique. We then used Discovery Studio TM software to construct the 3D protein structure. RESULTS: The results showed that the horizontal transfer efficiency of the vancomycin resistance gene vanA in the dprA-mutant E. faecium decreased. And the hydrophobic core of the mutant DprA became stable and the binding affinity between the mutant DprA and ssDNA reduced. DISCUSSION: This study is an exploration of bacterial gene mutation after spaceflight. The dprA mutant could affect the ability of E. faecium to acquire exogenous resistance gene vanA, which offered us an interesting path to block the dissemination of resistance genes between strains.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Handling cases of chest pain aboard commercial flights is challenging for crewmembers, onboard medical volunteers, and ground-based doctors providing remote advice. Obtaining an electrocardiogram (ECG) in-flight could help in dictating the management of such cases. The ability to diagnose or rule out ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) would have clinical and prognostic implications. The feasibility of obtaining good quality ECG tracings by flight attendants in flight is not known. METHODS: A series of 200 consecutive ECG tracings transmitted to a ground-based medical support provider were independently reviewed by four observers who ranked the ECG tracings according to a quality score (QS) criteria, as well as trying to identify or rule-out cases of STEMI. RESULTS: ECG quality was considered good enough to extract useful information in 170 of 200 tracings (85%). Seven cases of STEMI were identified. A STEMI was confidently ruled out in 104 cases. Additional abnormalities of variable clinical importance were also detected. DISCUSSION: ECGs are essential in the prehospital management of chest pain cases. ECGs obtained in flight by airline flight attendants were mostly of diagnostic quality, allowing confirmation or ruling out of STEMI, as well as detecting arrhythmias of clinical significance in case management.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study explores the safety risk due to delayed detection of hazardous health conditions that would result from increasing the duration of U.S. first-class aeromedical certificates from 6 mo to 12 mo for pilots ages 40 yr old through 60 yr old. METHODS: All pilots who submitted a U.S. first-class application in 2014 with no electrocardiogram and with the previous exams 4.5 to 7.5 mo prior were selected from the FAA pilot medical database. Proportions of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) denial pathology codes and Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) deferrals were compared for these exams within and between age groups from 40 yr old through 75 yr old. The absolute incidence rates for delayed detection were calculated and relative incidence of these proportions was compared graphically. RESULTS: The relative risk between age groups for delayed identification of disqualifying medical conditions showed that the 56–60-yr-old group would be at about twice the risk as the 40–45-yr-old group. The absolute incidence for the 56–60-yr-old group was 0.46% for denial conditions and 0.60% for AME deferrals over 6 mo. DISCUSSION: Increasing FAA first-class medical certificate duration from 6 mo to 12 mo would put 56–60-yr-old pilots at double the currently accepted risk for delayed detection of significant medical conditions. The absolute risk for this 6-mo delayed identification for the 56–60-yr-old group would average 0.53%. Mills WD, DeJohn CA.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Establishing animal models of ear barotrauma (EB) to provide evaluation criteria for Eustachian tube dysfunction. METHODS: Using expansive sponges, 70 rabbits’ right pharyngeal openings of the auditory tubes were blocked to cause dysfunction in the right Eustachian tubes. The right tympanic cavities of 65 rabbits were the Model Group (Subgroups 1–13) and these rabbits’ left tympanic cavities were the Nonblockage Group. Hypobaric chamber tests (HCTs) at various vertical speeds (100 m · s −1 , 75 m · s −1 , 50 m · s −1 , and 15 m · s −1 ) and altitudes (13,123 ft and 6562 ft) were conducted. The remaining five rabbits’ right tympanic cavities were the Control Group and no HCTs were conducted. After HCTs, observations were made on rabbits’ behavioral changes, oto-endoscope and tympanometry results, and pathological changes of the tympanic mucosae. RESULTS: 1) Rabbits in Subgroups 1–12 demonstrated EB, while Subgroup 13 and the Control Group did not. 2) Histopathology showed EB caused by rapid ascent/descent at 100 m · s −1 was more severe than that of 75 m · s −1 and 50 m · s −1 ( P &lt; 0.01), and that there were no significant differences in EB caused by rapid ascent/descent at 75 m · s −1 and 50 m · s −1 ( P &gt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in pathological injuries at the altitudes of 6562 ft and 13,123 ft ( P &gt; 0.05). 3) Based on tympanic membrane structures, tympanometry, and histopathological results, rabbits’ EB can be classified into mild, moderate, and severe.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) helicopter aircrew get Helicopter Underwater Egress Training (HUET) using a Modular Egress Training Simulator (METS™) in order to be prepared for escaping the aircraft when ditching into water. In the current situation the retraining intervals are only chosen on an arbitrary basis for different backgrounds of the crew (maritime and regular flight crew). The frequency of refresher training depends on the expected degree of retention, but evidence-based research on required intervals between refresher courses is scarce. Ideally, training should be based on the amount of retention of acquired competencies. METHODS: Retrospective questionnaires were filled in by 132 helicopter aircrew who followed the HUET course(s) at the Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape (SERE) school in Gilze-Rijen (Netherlands). They assessed themselves on competencies and gave their opinion on the preferred interval. RESULTS: Maritime crew report increasing competence levels with the number of refresher courses followed. According to the opinion of all aircrew, retraining intervals may take longer than 18 (first refresher) to 30 mo (fourth refresher). Maritime and regular flight crew differ in preferred retraining intervals (up to 22 mo and up to 33 mo, respectively). DISCUSSION: This study provides indications to reconsider the retraining interval and to differentiate between maritime and regular flight crew based on aircrew’s opinions and self-assessments. As competence levels still increase with the number of courses followed, it is recommended to reconsider the current fixed intervals of once a year or once every 3 yr for maritime and regular flight crew, respectively.

CASE REPORT: We report a case of inaugural tonic-clonic generalized seizure while refueling an NH 90 helicopter by an aeronautical technician standing under the rotating main rotor on a sunny day at a South of France naval air station. The stroboscopic effect of the helicopter blades was identified as one of the factors involved in the induction of this seizure. DISCUSSION: This aeronautical factor identified here during ground hot refueling must be considered for patients predisposed to epileptic seizures who are being evacuated by helicopter, but also for the medical screening of flight members. This is even more important within the military aeronautical environment, justifying electroencephalogram testing implementation on initial aeronautical medical evaluation in France.

Rodolfo Margaria (1901–1983), director of the Institute of Human Physiology at the University of Milan, was one of the most eminent and focused his studies on the mechanics of human locomotion in subgravity, in particular on the Moon’s surface. Long before the real Moon landing, Margaria was able to correctly theorize how astronauts would walk on lunar soil, what would be the optimal pattern of progression, as well as determine the optimum and maximum speed at one-sixth of the Earth's gravity. On 21 st July 1969 at 02:56 UTC, great excitement was aroused by the television images of Neil Armstrong's first steps on the Moon.

CASE REPORT: A 24-yr-old male foreign national student aviator from a central Asian country was at Fort Rucker for flight training. He presented to the clinic with a chief complaint of sore throat and cough for 2 d. He was afebrile but reported a history of a “throat” mass which was previously evaluated by a U.S. military otolaryngologist. Said mass was approximately 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm, irregular appearing, inflamed, and protruding from the inferior aspect of the right tonsil. Previous biopsy report revealed a squamous cell papilloma and, after consideration of the pilot’s training program, active surveillance of the lesion was mutually agreed upon until the student’s training had concluded and definitive excision was performed. DISCUSSION: A robust history and physical exam including an occupational, social, and environmental exposure history is crucial to diagnosis. Foreign national patients often have unique backgrounds that merit consideration when developing a differential diagnosis, assessment, and plan. In the field of Flight Medicine, a patient’s occupational demands are essential to his or her care. In particular, any potential obstruction of the airway during flight must be considered, even if a pathology does not represent an immediate threat to the pilot’s health.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Statement of Demonstrated Ability (SODA) is a type of U.S. aeromedical waiver used for disqualifying conditions that are not expected to change. About 21,000 (2%) U.S. pilots possess a SODA waiver. METHODS: We matched all pilot medical exams from the FAA’s medical certification database from 2002 through 2011 to their respective accidents in the National Transportation Safety Board accident database. The association of SODA waivers and SODA conditions with the odds of an accident were explored using logistic regression techniques. RESULTS: For 3 rd class flight exams, the presence of a SODA waiver was not associated with the odds of an accident. For the 1 st and 2 nd class exams, the accident odds ratio (OR = 1.45) was statistically significant. Crop dusting operations accounted for 17 of the 40 accidents where SODAs were present and returned a significant accident OR = 1.68. SODAs were not associated with the odds of accidents during other commercial operations. Six SODA conditions (amputation, internal eye, external eye, visual fields, bone and joint, and miscellaneous) were also found to have elevated ORs but were based on very small accident counts. NTSB investigators and the authors reviewed all accidents and none thought the SODA condition to be contributory. DISCUSSION: SODA waivers were not associated with increased accident odds except for crop dusting operations. Six specific SODA conditions also had elevated odds of an accident, but there was no evidence they contributed to the accidents. Overall, U.S. pilots with SODA waivers appear to have a satisfactory safety record. Mills WD, Davis JT. U.S. Statement of Demonstrated Ability aeromedical waivers .

As a young Air Force pilot, Don Shields flew the B57 aircraft through the actual nuclear cloud during nuclear weapons blast explosions in Operation Dominic. The data he collected was of vital importance to our country's nuclear weapons program. Don Shields knew of the tremendous risk of radiation but served our country at the call of duty. After his military service, Don Shields served as the subject matter expert for the Apollo lunar module and worked directly with Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin in training them on the module. During the Apollo 11 mission, Don Shields was being interviewed by Walter Cronkite on the epic Moon landing coverage. Unfortunately, later in life Don Shields suffered from cataracts and leukemia, both of which are known to be related to high radiation exposures. During his old age, Don Shields volunteered at the NASA Ames Museum and inspired generations of young individuals towards the space mission. Douglas DB, Cagle Y.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: For many years, anticoagulant therapy had been deemed unacceptable for civilian pilot medical certification in the United Kingdom under the Joint Aviation Authorities Requirements and, therefore, mechanical valve implants were disqualifying. In 2012, this restriction was removed by implementation of the European Union requirements. This study was undertaken to assess the medical evidence available to develop a certificatory policy following mechanical valve implants in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A literature review was performed for complication rates following the implantation of mechanical aortic and mitral valves. This study was confined to the three major types of valve commonly used in current clinical practice: the ATS, the Carbomedics, and the St. Jude Medical valves. RESULTS: We identified 28 papers on aortic valve replacements and 22 papers on mitral valve replacements. Data were extracted for the late complication rates for endocarditis, paravalvular leak, thromboembolism, hemorrhage, and structural valve dysfunction. The total calculated incidence of a late complication was 3.8% per annum for aortic valves over a mean follow-up period of 57 mo and 5.2% per annum for mitral valves over a mean follow-up period of 61 mo. Both of these exceed the maximum 1% per annum medical incapacitation risk considered acceptable for professional multicrew pilot operations. CONCLUSION: Confounders and sources of error in estimating the risks and methods to mitigate these are considered. A certificatory policy is proposed and the UK experience of mechanical valve replacements is described. Jagathesan T, O’Nunain S, O’Brien M.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While NASA requires that commercial spaceflight vehicles provide onboard emergency oxygen supplies for crew, there are currently no requirements in place regarding thermal constraints of delivered gas. The question has been raised whether or not onboard emergency oxygen supplies must be warmed prior to administration to the crew, as inclusion of warming capabilities will increase the complexity and mass of life support systems in the vehicle. We sought to identify the risk of various inhaled oxygen temperatures and resultant pulmonary inflammatory response in potentially injured crewmembers. METHODS: A systematic review of published literature was conducted concerning thermal regulation of inhaled gases, reactive airway response, and inflammatory reactions. In particular, we sought literature that correlated inhaled gas temperature to airway response to identify a temperature threshold that would avoid deleterious sequelae. RESULTS: Cold air inhalation can induce acute bronchoconstriction, increased respiratory rate, and associated dyspnea and hypoxia. Physiological response to cold air varies between healthy lungs and injured tissues, and increased inflammation is associated with increasing airway reactivity. Most studies suggest that inhaled gas temperatures below 10°C may induce deleterious physiological sequelae. DISCUSSION: Best practices would include maintenance of inhaled gas temperatures to &gt;10°C to avoid poor physiological response, preferably as close to physiological norms as possible. Given that inhaled gas temperature may be altered by transit through an oxygen delivery system, measurement of actual delivered gas temperature should occur at the point of crewmember inhalation.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When a pilot is referred for presbycusis, his flight fitness may be questionable. The objective of this retrospective study was to describe a case series of presbycusis in a pilot population and to discuss the decisions about their flight waivers. METHODS: There were 19 pilots who were referred to the ENT-Head and Neck Surgery Department of the National Pilot Expertise Center. Their medical files were retrospectively examined. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, 5 did not obtain flight fitness waivers. Among the 14 who received waivers, 7 had no restrictions on their flight fitness. DISCUSSION: Flight fitness was based on the maximum percentage of speech recognition and the slope of the curve for speech recognition in speech audiometry in noise and the follow-up of these findings. The results made it possible to determine a patient’s fitness to fly with a waiver, which may be associated with restrictions. In our series, only 5 pilots out of 19 did not obtain a flight fitness waiver. The few published studies on the resumption of flight for patients who had presbycusis and our experience in France with similar waivers in commercial and military aviation suggest that under certain conditions and after relevant cochlear assessment, presbycusis may allow for a safe pursuit of aviation activity .

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the comfort of aircraft passengers during long flights and to determine the effects of the seatback angle and the seat pitch on passengers’ upper body muscles (neck, shoulder, and lower back) and subjective comfort. METHODS: All subjects sat on an aircraft seat for 2 h with different levels of seatback angle and seat pitch. Subjective discomfort scores and root mean square (RMS) and mean power frequency (MPF) values were used to evaluate muscle fatigue, and all data were calculated for every 15-min interval. RESULTS: Significant increases of MPF for all three muscles were found at 30 min, along with significant increases in the perceived levels of discomfort (PLD) over 2 h. Besides, a 120° seatback angle and a 34˝ seat pitch resulted in lower PLD values for the lower back and hip areas than smaller ones (significant difference). DISCUSSION: It took around 30 min before pronounced discomfort in the upper body regions occurred during flight. The larger parameters of seatback angle and seat pitch may significantly contribute to the easing of subjective discomfort. Moreover, a decrease in MPF coupled with a concomitant increase in RMS does not appear to be a reliable indicator of discomfort rate. The need for further development of discomfort indicators which are more directly related to muscular activation is recognized. Pei H, Yu S, Ding M, Bai Z.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aircrew-aircraft compatibility is important in military aviation for flight safety. Anthropometric aircrew selection standards in RAFO were embedded from the selection standards of western defense forces as the aircrafts were imported from there. Henceforth efforts were made to fit local native aviators into aircrafts not initially designed for them. In view of this, this study was carried out to obtain the anthropometric data of Oman aircrew recruits and compare these with published western and eastern data with a hope to understand and highlight the aircrew-aircraft mismatch issues, if any. METHODS: The anthropometric data of 2296 Omani recruits from 2003 to 2012 were collected and their statistical distribution of data was collated. Published data from the UK and Singapore were used to carry out the comparative distribution of five anthropometric dimensions. RESULTS: Minimal differences were noted between Oman and Singaporean recruits whereas differences were most pronounced between Oman and Western populations (UK). Aircrew cadets from Oman, Singapore, and UK differed significantly in standing height. The UK cadets (M = 177.4 cm) showed the highest standing height followed by Oman cadets (M = 171.9cm), and then Singapore cadets (M = 168.5 cm). DISCUSSION: This study has provided opportunities to recognize the discrepancies involved in selection of Middle Eastern aircrew for western cockpits. This adds impetus to the scope for application of military recruitment standards suitable to the native population in aiding the ideal man-machine interface. This approach shall consider national policy, the significant anthropometric trends of the general population, and the procured aircraft profile of the country.

The reasons for flight-related neck pain are multifactorial; however, there are currently no evidence-based guidelines for its prevention or clinical management. This case study describes the novel use of a synthetic training device in the rehabilitation of a Chinook crewman with chronic neck pain. CASE REPORT: The patient is a 34-yr-old rear crewman with 10 yr flying experience in the Chinook helicopter. He has a history of intermittent neck and shoulder pain since 2009 following a rugby injury. Over the years he has self-managed recurrent episodes of neck pain. However, in November 2017 his pain was so severe that he could no longer continue flying. This pain made him unfit for flying duties for 18 mo and he received intensive rehabilitation and injection therapy. RAF Odiham’s new flying simulator was used in his return to flying program, so enabling him to become fully fit and return to all flying duties. DISCUSSION: Management and treatment of chronic flight-related neck pain is challenging.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias in the general population and is considered disqualifying aeromedically. This study is a unique examination of significant outcomes in aviators with previous history of both AF and stroke. METHODS: Pilots examined by the FAA between 2002 and 2012 who had had AF at some point during his or her medical history were reviewed, and those with an initial stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) during that time period were included in this study. All records were individually reviewed to determine stroke and AF history, medical certification history, and recurrent events. Variables collected included medical and behavior history, stroke type, gender, BMI, medication use, and any cardiovascular or neurological outcomes of interest. Major recurrent events included stroke, TIA, cerebrovascular accident, death, or other major events. These factors were used to calculate CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores. RESULTS: Of the 141 pilots selected for the study, 17.7% experienced a recurrent event. At 6 mo, the recurrent event rate was 5.0%; at 1 yr, 5.8%; at 3 yr 6.9%; and at 5 yr the recurrent event rate was 17.3%. No statistical difference between CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores was found as it pertained to number of recurrent events. DISCUSSION: We found no significant factors predicting risk of recurrent event and lower recurrence rates in pilots than the general population. This suggests CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores are not appropriate risk stratification tools in an aviation population and more research is necessary to determine risk of recurrent events in aviators with atrial fibrillation.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Loss of spacecraft atmosphere (LOA) during Earth-Moon transit may require up to 144 h of pressure suit operations. This work investigates the feasibility of DCS treatment in this paradigm and discusses the operational and engineering implications. METHODS: Three scenarios of LOA-induced DCS were considered: a permanent LOA secondary to a 0.25-in (0.64 cm) hole (unrecoverable cabin leak), a transient LOA, and a permanent LOA with early suit over-pressurization (beyond suit specification). Each was simulated in the context of the current Orion spacecraft operational concept with regards to atmosphere and anticipated cabin depress profile. Probability of DCS symptom resolution ( P (SR)) was estimated using the previously derived Hypobaric DCS Treatment Model, with ΔP calculated from a Three Region Well-Stirred Tissue (3RWT) bubble dynamics model. Analysis was conducted and analogies drawn from experiences with the development and testing of the Orion Crew Survival System (OCSS). RESULTS: Maintaining 8 psia at 100% F i o 2 following LOA resulted in an eventual halt and regression of bubble growth with a P (SR) of 87% (at 8 h, time to symptom onset (T s ) = 105 min, with ambulation). If cabin atmosphere was not restored and psia dropped to 4.3, bubble growth returned, but again eventually slowed and regressed over time ( P (SR) = 75% at 21 h). If the leak is repaired within the 8-h period, 8 psid (psia = 22.7) resulted in P (SR) of greater than 95%. Similarly, if the suit was over-pressurized (12 psid/psia) within 3 h after LOA, P (SR) exceeded 95%. DISCUSSION: A launch/entry pressure suit represents a contingency option for DCS management in the event of LOA. Greene MR, Jacobs SE.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Aerial ports are being modernized with automated technologies, but the impact on musculoskeletal injury (MSKI) is unknown. METHODS : In this retrospective cohort study of U.S. Air Force aerial port technicians and traffic management technicians, we compared reported injury rates from January 2006–December 2016 and Veterans Benefits Administration disability compensation claims awarded from January 2001–March 2017. Ton-adjusted injury rates, associated lost/affected duty time, and percent risk attributable to lack of automation were compared at Dover Air Force Base (which features base-specific automation), Travis Air Force Base, Ramstein Air Base, and Yokota Air Base. RESULTS : Injuries most often occurred during aircraft/flight line activities and were typically sprains/strains, with extremities being most affected. Among aerial port technicians there were 8.0 injury reports per 1000 person-years compared to 5.2 per 1000 among traffic management technicians (incidence rate ratio = 1.5; 95% CI: 0.9, 3.0). Of the aerial port technicians with a compensation award, 70.7% included an MSKI component, whereas 75.7% of traffic management awards included an MSKI component. Aerial port technicians at Dover AFB experienced 1.4 injury reports per 1000 personnel per 1000 cargo-tons per year, lower than the other ports: 3.2 (Travis); 3.7 (Ramstein); and 7.6 (Yokota). Overall, 56% of injuries at Travis, 62% at Ramstein, and 82% at Yokota could be attributed to absence of Dover-like automation. However, mean lost/affected duty days at Dover (12.4) far exceeded those at the other bases (range: 4.5–8.6).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ejection injuries involving the eyes have become uncommon due to effective protection by helmets and visors. We report a unique case of intraocular lead foreign body injury occurring after ejection from a Hawk aircraft in a pilot who had his helmet and visor on.CASE REPORT: A 40-yr-old male pilot sustained facial injuries after ejection from a Hawk aircraft. He had multiple foreign bodies embedded in the skin around his jaw, corneal foreign bodies, and self-sealed corneal and lens entry in left eye, with one foreign body lodged within the lens and two in the vitreous behind the lens. The foreign bodies showed low reflectivity on CT scan suggestive of plastic. However, spectroscopic and electron microscopic analysis of pieces removed from the cornea confirmed the material to be predominantly lead, which came from the miniature detonator cord (MDC). An electroretinogram (ERG) showed reduction of scotopic b wave amplitude in the affected eye. The pilot underwent intravitreal foreign body removal successfully through pars plana vitrectomy. Post-removal vision recovered from 20/60 to 20/20 with ERG also showing recovery of scotopic b wave amplitude from 100 μV to 180 μV.DISCUSSION: Though systemic toxicity due to high blood levels of lead are well known, this case is unique in demonstrating direct retinal toxicity because of intravitreal lead foreign body. It also raises aeromedical concerns about the hazards of MDC splatter despite full protection with helmet and visor.Khan MA, Gaur D, Murthy PC, Pandey A.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Healthy individuals may present with acute pulmonary edema when exposed to extreme environments (high-altitude or deep diving) or while performing strenuous exercises. Recent data support the hypothesis that these forms of acute pulmonary edema might be due to a limited number of stimuli, often overlapping each other, inducing pulmonary capillary stress failure. DISCUSSION: Pathophysiology of nontoxic pulmonary edema occurring in healthy people is still incompletely understood, but recent data suggest a role of three factors (hypoxia, increase in ambient pressure, and physical exercise) that, alone or in combination, may increase pulmonary capillary pressure up to a level overcoming the mechanical resistance of the blood-gas barrier. Evidence has been recently provided to support the existence of a genetic pattern predisposing healthy subjects to pulmonary edema. This paper reviews the evidence supporting a common background for pulmonary edema triggered by extreme environments or heavy effort; a preventive and therapeutic strategy will also be proposed. From these data, hypotheses on the pathophysiology of other forms of noncardiac related pulmonary edema, as those associated with obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome or during post-surgery intensive care, will be proposed.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although the impact of microorganisms on their hosts has been investigated for decades, recent technological advances have permitted high-throughput studies of the collective microbial genomes colonizing a host or habitat, also known as the microbiome. This literature review presents an overview of microbiome research, with an emphasis on topics that have the potential for future applications to aviation safety. In humans, research is beginning to suggest relationships of the microbiome with physical disorders, including type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. The microbiome also has been associated with psychological health, including depression, anxiety, and the social complications that arise in autism spectrum disorders. Pharmaceuticals can alter microbiome diversity, and may lead to unintended consequences both short and long-term. As research strengthens understanding of the connections between the microbiota and human health, several potential applications for aerospace medicine and aviation safety emerge. For example, information derived from tests of the microbiota has potential future relevance for medical certification of pilots, accident investigation, and evaluation of fitness for duty in aerospace operations. Moreover, air travel may impact the microbiome of passengers and crew, including potential impacts on the spread of disease nationally and internationally. Construction, maintenance, and cleaning regimens that consider the potential for microbial colonization in airports and cabin environments may promote the health of travelers. Altogether, the mounting knowledge of microbiome effects on health presents several opportunities for future research into how and whether microbiome-based insights could be used to improve aviation safety.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cabin pressurization is the process by which aircraft maintain a comfortable and safe environment for passengers flying at high altitudes. At high altitudes, most patients can tolerate changes in pressurization; however, passengers at high risk of hypoxia may experience ischemic events. The purpose of this study was to evaluate variations in pressurization of commercial aircraft at cruising altitude and describe its relevance in relation to patients with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). METHODS: Altimeters were used to measure altitude and cabin altitude at cruising altitude aboard 113 commercial flights, including 53 narrow-body and 60 wide-body aircraft. RESULTS: Cabin altitude ranged from 4232 ft to 7956 ft at cruising altitudes ranging from 30,000 ft to 41,000 ft. The mean cabin altitude for all flights was 6309 876 ft. Narrow-body aircraft had a significantly higher mean cabin altitude (6739 829 ft) compared to wide-body aircraft (5929 733 ft). For all flights, the mean cruising altitude was 35,369 2881 ft with narrow-body aircraft cruising at a lower altitude of 34,238 2389 ft compared to wide-body aircraft at 36,369 2925 ft. Newer generation aircraft had a mean cabin altitude of 6066 837 ft, which was lower than the mean cabin altitude of older aircraft (6616 835 ft). DISCUSSION: Innovation in flight design has offered the ability for aircraft to fly at greater altitudes while maintaining lower cabin altitude. Those at high risk of hypoxia-induced complications may consider aircraft type when air travel is required. Nazarali S, Liu H, Syed M, Wood T, Asanad S, Sadun AA, Karanjia R.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: From 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) permitted pilots who have had a heart transplant to be considered for recertification under special issuance at the third-class level. The objective of this study was to evaluate certification safety and determine if any adverse outcome occurred in this airman group as a consequence of this policy. METHODS: Methods involved collecting data from the FAA Document Imaging Workflow System to identify airmen undergoing cardiac transplantation since 2007, and examining medical and safety-related outcomes through the National Transportation Safety Board-related accident database and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Death Index. RESULTS: Included in the study were 36 airmen, with 16 recertified at the class 3 level and 20 denied certification. No aviation accidents or recorded deaths occurred in the group of 16 airmen undergoing recertification. Of these airmen, 13 underwent a second successful recertification and 6 underwent a third attempt, with 5 being successful. Two airmen have declared their intention to fly under BasicMed. Of the 20 airmen denied recertification, 16 were denied for failure to provide information. There were three deaths in this denied group. DISCUSSION: The policy allowing third-class heart transplant recipient recertification appears to be safe. Aviation safety is not being compromised by allowing these airmen to resume flying, with the exception that recertification should continue under the special issuance system and not through BasicMed.

Clinical management of this condition has unique aeromedical considerations and an impact on subsequent aeromedical disposition. A comprehensive decision matrix would greatly benefit aviation medicine practitioners in the management of aircrew and personnel in flying-related vocations who are diagnosed with SLE. CASE REPORT: We describe the aeromedical management of a military air traffic controller who was diagnosed with SLE after presenting with cutaneous lupus, nonscarring alopecia, symmetrical small joint polyarthropathy, leukopenia, and presence of SLE-specific antibody. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine and low-dose systemic glucocorticoids, and allowed to return to duties with a proximity restriction and a bar on field deployments and night duties. DISCUSSION: Several SLE manifestations may have either incapacitating or distracting effects on aircrew and personnel in flying-related vocations. Some medications used in the treatment of SLE may similarly impact on an individuals ability to safely execute flight or air traffic control duties. We propose an aeromedical disposition decision flowchart that would guide aviation medicine practitioners in the management of individuals diagnosed with SLE to ensure optimal and safe performance in their respective occupational settings.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Olfactory meningiomas are typically benign, slow-growing intracranial tumors with subtle presentations that result in delayed diagnosis. To date, only a few published reports describe meningiomas in airmen. None specifically mention olfactory meningiomas or detail the associated presence of cognitive impairment. CASE REPORT: This was a 55-yr-old commercial pilot with over 20 yr of flight experience who presented for a fitness-for-duty evaluation due to alarming performance at work and neurocognitive concerns. On examination, the patient had an odd affect and anosmia. Imaging showed a large, frontal, midline intracranial mass consistent with an olfactory meningioma. DISCUSSION: Fitness-for-duty cases are often challenging and even more so when neurocognition is called into question. Symptoms may be subtle and gradual in onset, making recognition and diagnosis difficult. Dementia, alcohol or substance misuse/abuse, and psychiatric diagnoses are often the first conditions considered when evaluating new cognitive impairment in a pilot. This case highlights the importance of keeping a broad differential, including intracranial masses, conducting a thorough neurological examination, and the judicious use of brain imaging.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emergency helicopter landing at sea is dangerous. Specialized training, known as helicopter underwater escape training (HUET), prepares occupants to quickly exit the helicopter, which often inverts and sinks. In most jurisdictions, helicopter occupants are equipped with a helicopter underwater egress breathing apparatus (HUEBA) to provide sufficient air for escape. HUET trainees report that the HUEBA is easy to use, but it is well known that learners are often overconfident in their judgement of learning. To better understand how the HUEBA affects HUET sequence performance, we investigated whether using the HUEBA influences the sequence movement time and number of errors. METHODS: Twelve participants (7 men and 5 women, mean age 25.33 9.57 SD) with no prior experience with HUET performed consecutive trials of the HUET sequence, 5 with the HUEBA and 5 without the HUEBA. Video of each trial recorded the total movement time and enabled movement time analyses of each component of the sequence: crossing arms, tucking the head, pushing the window, inserting the regulator, and releasing the seatbelt. These recordings were also used to score performance errors according to a checklist. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that using a HUEBA increased the total movement time and time to release the seatbelt by 0.36 and 0.39 s, respectively, in comparison to without the HUEBA. DISCUSSION: Our study illustrates that using the HUEBA during the HUET sequence increases total movement time and time to release the seatbelt. However, this difference is marginal and unlikely to have practical significance during underwater escape. King M, Sanli E, Mugford K, Martina S, Brown R, Carnahan H.

METHODS: A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used. The sample included 70 flight attendants of an international airline company in Taiwan. The experimental group ( N 34) received an FMI, while the control group ( N 36) had no intervention. Fatigue management knowledge, attitude, behavior intention, self-efficacy, and fatigue intensity were assessed at baseline and 1 wk later. Single-factor analysis of covariance and Jensen Neman methods were used to assess the differences in outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Attitude and self-efficacy in the experimental group were significantly improved after the FMI [standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.96; 1.98]. The intervention also reduced their fatigue intensity (SMD 6.05) and both knowledge and behavioral intention scores were increased in more than 80% of subjects in the experimental group.

Of cases, 1020% are idiopathic or due to occult causes and a majority of the remainder are associated with diabetic disease. The evaluation and disposition of an aviator has not been reported previously. This case will document the work-up and safe return to flight of a patient. CASE REPORT: A 33-yr-old male MH-60R pilot presented with acute blurred vision in the left eye and eye pain which began at his desk. His review of systems was otherwise negative. His medical history was noncontributory. On initial examination his vital signs and external ocular exam were normal. He was immediately referred to the optometry clinic, where a dilated funduscopic examination (DFE) with scleral depression demonstrated a large floater OS composed of streaks of blood and tobacco dust. His DFE was otherwise normal with no retinal tears or vitreous detachments. On repeated DFEs, his intraoccular pressures remained normal and his hemorrhage resorbed without decreased visual acuity or field deficits. A hematologic work-up was negative. After 4 mo of observation, the patient was returned to flight status without further recurrence. DISCUSSION: No known associations exist between aeronautical duties and spontaneous vitreous hemorrhages. The stressors aviators are subjected to, such as high vibrations and increased g forces, may make them more likely to suffer intraocular microvascular damage that could lead to retinal detachment, vitreous detachment, and bleeding. Further reports are needed to determine the risks of recurrence in aviators and their differences from typical spontaneous vitreous hemorrhage patients. Wallace SA.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was the analysis of human musculoskeletal system energy costs of normal walking and walking under reduced weight loading. METHODS: There were 15 subjects who participated in the study. We analyzed the biomechanical parameters of walking under different musculoskeletal system loads. The subjects walked on a treadmill at a pace of 90 steps/min under various loading conditions: 1) 100% bodyweight loading, corresponding to the terrestrial surface; 2) 38% bodyweight loading, corresponding to the surface of Mars; and 3) 17% bodyweight loading, corresponding to the surface of the Moon. Joint angles and angular velocities were recorded from the hip, knee, and ankle. RESULTS: We analyzed changes in joint phase trajectories and the ratio of kinetic extension energy to kinetic flexion energy in the joints. We observed changes in kinetic energy parameters associated with both flexion and extension motions in the joints of the feet while walking under various loads. In terrestrial conditions (walking under 100% bodyweight), flexion kinetic energy in the hip joint prevailed over extension kinetic energy by 90%, with a small variation equal to 22%. If weight loading decreased up to 17% (lunar conditions), the difference between flexion and extension kinetic energies diminished, and eventually reached only 9%. The ratio of flexion energy and extension energy in the ankle joint equalized under lower loading conditions. Thus, 38% bodyweight loading was sufficient for approximation of flexion and extension energy values. DISCUSSION: Our results revealed that phase trajectories shifted toward smaller joint angles and a decreased ratio between extension kinetic energy and flexion kinetic energy in the knee joint of all subjects. However, significant differences in the ratio of flexion and extension kinetic energy in the knee joint under bodyweight support were not found. The methods used for musculoskeletal system assessments that were proposed in our work can be used in clinical practice to evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation measures in a patients musculoskeletal system disorders.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recent epidemiological studies of U.S. Army aviators have suggested higher than anticipated rates of hyperlipidemia and metabolic disorder. The goal of this study was to determine whether this finding has persisted in 20162018 and to subsequently determine whether this trend is genuine and warrants further evaluation. METHODS: Data were requested from the U.S. Army Aeromedical Electronic Resource Office (AERO) and retrieved from the publicly available Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) utilizing similar inclusion/exclusion criteria, where possible, as the earlier studies. For each year 20162018, incidence rates (per 1000 person years) for hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome were retrieved from DMSS, while percentages of aviators with these conditions were retrieved from AERO. The DMSS incidence rates were also age stratified. No formal analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Results from DMSS showed overall rates of hyperlipidemia ranging from 3.18 to 6.83 per 1000 person-years and for metabolic syndrome from 0.16 to 0.69 per 1000 person-years. The age stratified rates increased proportionally with age. AERO data showed a range of 0.81.5% of aviators had hyperlipidemia and for metabolic syndrome this ranged from 0.31 to 0.45%. These rates are broadly comparable to the previous studies findings. DISCUSSION: This studys findings suggest no continued increase in hyperlipidemia or metabolic disorder in aviators. While the exact cause is unknown, one could speculate a number of sources such as preferences in testing or encouragement from specific commanders or flight surgeons. Goldie C, McGhee J, Kelley AM.

Rhabdomyolysis has not been reported in Chinese civil aircrew, but in our case report a male civil copilot contracted rhabdomyolysis after excessive exercise, showing potential for morbidity in pilots. CASE REPORT: After excessive exercise, a 29-yr-old male civil aviation copilot complained of serious myalgia and weakness in lower limb muscles and gross hematuria, whose values of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), myohemoglobin (Mb), creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (-HBDH) were conspicuously increased. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal signal intensities in the lower limbs. The patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. He was treated with hydration and urine alkalinization. When his condition was stabilized, the patient was discharged. After remaining asymptomatic for 3 mo and getting documentation of normalized lab results, he was granted a first-class medical certificate and returned to work. DISCUSSION: This was the first case of rhabdomyolysis reported in Chinese civil aircrew. Excessive exercise in an overweight pilot may induce rhabdomyolysis. This condition can be controlled and cured by early and effective treatment. Rhabdomyolysis could occur in a population suffering from overweight, obesity, or hyperlipidemia. This case fits in with several other cases of military pilots exercising excessively. The progression could lead to acute kidney injury without prompt and effective intervention. And common symptoms like muscular weakness or myalgia may induce sudden in-flight incapacitation, so early medical intervention should be adopted. Moreover, recurrence of rhabdomyolysis should be considered when resuming flying duties. Liu X, Meng X, Zhang C, Chen J, Li P, Wu X, Fan H. Rhabdomyolysis in a civil aviation pilot.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While Fairbanks, AK, USA, is a remote location with significant constraints on medical resources and specialty care, a small U.S. Air Force clinic was able to provide a pilot with definitive care for neurological decompression sickness. CASE REPORT: A 31-yr-old female patient presented to her flight surgeon in Anchorage, AK, USA, with migrating polyarthropathy and headaches 48 h after a flight which included planned aircraft decompression for high altitude low opening (HALO) jump operations. In order to get definitive treatment in a hyperbaric chamber, the patient typically would have to be flown to Seattle, WA, USA. This transfer of care would cost the Air Force approximately 150,000 and may have led to more complicated disease. Fortunately, Eielson Air Force Base (AFB) in Fairbanks had previously procured a Hyperlite hyperbaric chamber specifically for this situation. After consultation with a hyperbaric specialist, the team decided that the most appropriate course of action was to transfer her by car 6 h north from Anchorage to Fairbanks. On initiation of the Hart treatment table, she experienced immediate reduction in joint pain with a reversal of neurological symptoms. DISCUSSION: This patients care could not have been done without the procurement of a hyperbaric chamber. This case demonstrates the utility and necessity for these capabilities at more facilities that manage significant flying operations. Military bases should ensure that hyperbaric treatment capabilities are available within a close proximity. Petruso MJ, Philbrick SM.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maxillofacial shields (MFSs) are an available piece of aviation protective equipment designed to integrate into aircrew helmets and protect the face from wind and flying debris. Aviators have anecdotally reported that MFSs have provided blunt impact protection during impact events (i.e., a crash); however, no such cases have been formally documented in the literature. CASE REPORTS: Two cases were identified where aircrew wearing MFSs were involved in mishaps resulting in maxillofacial blunt impacts. In the first case, an OH-58 pilot struck the cyclic with his head/face during a crash. In the second case, a CH-47 crew chief was struck in the face by a maintenance panel dislodged from the aircraft. In both cases the MFS was damaged, but neither service member experienced injuries as a result of impact to the face. DISCUSSION: The cases illustrate the effectiveness of the MFS against blunt impact during aviation mishaps. While MFS use is currently optional for aircrew, it is believed that increased MFS use would result in fewer or less severe facial injuries as well as decrease the associated time and monetary losses due to injury.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: An aviation safety management system should consider and mitigate against all potential risks to flight safety. In addition to in-flight incapacitation, pilots falling below regulatory standards who are assessed as unfit may have represented a risk prior to that assessment. An analysis was undertaken of Class 1 certificate holders to determine factors correlated with unfit assessments.METHODS: Fitness assessments of pre-existing Class 1 certificate holders following medical examinations (to EASA Part-MED standards) or between medicals were studied between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2019. Assessments where the outcome was 'fit' (N= 99,406) were compared with those where the outcome was 'unfit' (N= 7925). Analyses for correlation between unfit assessments against age, declared coexisting medical conditions, and the number of days since last assessed as fit were undertaken using SPSS.RESULTS: Unfit assessment likelihood and age were strongly correlated; there is, however, evidence for the 'healthy worker effect', with a fall in unfit assessments between 60-65 yr of age. There was no association between coexisting medical condition declaration and the likelihood of becoming unfit. The time interval between a fit and unfit assessment was significantly lower when comparing 20-60 and 61-63 yr old individuals.DISCUSSION: The analysis of unfit assessments shows strong correlation with increasing age and the possible presence of the healthy worker effect among commercial pilots. The decreased time from a previous fit assessment to an unfit assessment supports the reduced certificate validity period of Class 1 applicants over 60 yr of age.Cairns MK.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: After traumatic brain injury (TBI), cognitive, behavioral alterations and seizures frequently occur. Beside instrumental examinations, neuropsychological testing is the common clinical practice for detecting cognitive deficits. However, in highly skilled individuals, subtle changes with a large impact on fitness to fly may be neglected. CASE REPORT: A 28-yr-old Italian Air Force pilot with almost 700 flying hours suffered a TBI. After 2 yr of cognitive retraining programs, as the neuropsychological evaluation executed in a public hospital was within the standards and repeated EEGs had all been normal, the pilot was allowed to resume flying duties. During the refresh flight training, he was not considered proficient for solo flight and was again referred to the Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IMAS), where, due to the absence of a neuropsychologist, the pilot was referred to a public hospital. Again, he was within the normal range and received a fitness to fly with limitations. Nevertheless, the flight instructors noticed the presence of cyclic errors. Consequently, he was sent for a third time to the IMAS, where the cooperation between a neuropsychologist and a flight surgeon allowed a tailored testing. DISCUSSION: With a proper evaluation, the subject showed deficits in topographic visuospatial learning and in prospective memory. After 5 yr, he was finally declared permanently unfit to fly. Specific neuropsychological batteries, simulated flight tests, and aeromedical evaluations are described here. Verde P, Guadagno AG, D’Angelo A, Vitalone R, Di Vita A, Piccardi L.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Precision medicine is an approach to healthcare that is modifying clinical management by leveraging technological advances in genomics that assess a patient's genetic information to identify unique predispositions. While the civilian sector is integrating genomics widely to personalize diagnosis and treatment, the military medical environment has reacted more slowly. The operational requirements of military service encourage a tailored approach for focusing military precision medicine on occupation-specific conditions. Here, we present a survey of the genomic landscape related to military aerospace medicine.METHODS: We collated observations from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relating genetic markers to conditions that may negatively influence flight operations and for which the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine's Aeromedical Consult Service (ACS) provides aeromedical waiver guidance. Our sources for identifying relevant literature were the GWAS Catalog, the Atlas of GWAS Summary Statistics, and PubMed/Google Scholar searches.RESULTS: Using the ACS guidance as a starting point, we found 1572 papers describing 84 clinical conditions with genetic associations. The earliest aeromedical GWAS publication was in 2006, increasing to 225 publications in 2019. We identified 42,020 polymorphisms from more than 84 million participants across the studies.CONCLUSION: Our study revealed areas where deeper investigations into how genetic markers manifest in clinical diagnosis, prevention, or risk management could lead to increased medical readiness. Additionally, our results show those clinical areas for which guidance could include genetic risk considerations.Chapleau RR, Regn DD, de Castro MJ.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pilot fatigue is a significant concern in aviation, where efforts are directed at improving rosters, developing models, and improving countermeasures. Little attention has been given to in-flight detection of fatigue/drowsiness. The aims of this research were to determine whether drowsiness is an issue and explore whether infrared reflectance oculography could prove useful for continuous inflight monitoring.METHODS: Nine university-based pilot trainees wore activity monitors and completed diaries, prior to a simulated navigational exercise of approximately 4 h, during the secondary window of circadian low. During the flight they wore a head-mounted device. Oculographic data were collected and converted into a single number, using the Johns Drowsiness Scale (JDS), with increasing values indicating greater drowsiness (range 0.0 to 10.0).RESULTS: Peak JDS values reached 6.5. Values declined from shortly before top of descent, continuing until landing. Two of the nine participants (22.2%), reached drowsiness levels at or above a cautionary warning level, below which is considered safe for driving a motor vehicle.DISCUSSION: The results of this study revealed the timeline and levels of fatigue that might be experienced by student pilots; showing that drowsiness is a potential issue for student pilots operating in flying conditions similar to those in the simulation. Analysis indicated that pilots are likely to experience levels of drowsiness above a cautionary warning level when modeling predicted effectiveness below 90%, indicating a potential drowsiness issue for pilots. It was concluded that oculography is worthy of further investigation for use as an objective fatigue detection tool in aviation.Corbett MA, Newman DG. Student drowsiness during simulated solo flight.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the event of decompression using an isobaric differential cockpit pressurization system, oxygen concentration breathed pre-decompression must be greater than required for the given cockpit altitude in order to prevent hypoxia. The model for determining oxygen concentration requirements advanced by Dr. John Ernsting, when graphed against cockpit altitude, creates a hypoxia safety \"notch\" which has become a standard requirement for aircraft oxygen systems. Although variables in the Ernsting notch model are not fixed, they are often presented as such.METHODS: Model equations are presented to evaluate the effects of different cockpit pressurization, oxygen regulator PBA schedules, and changes to the physiological state of the aircrew.RESULTS: Increased cockpit differential pressure, regulator breathing pressure, and aircrew respiratory quotient decreased pre-decompression oxygen concentration requirements by up to 6%, eliminating the hypoxia safety \"notch.\" Although effects were small, reducing alveolar carbon dioxide pressure decreased oxygen concentration requirements while reducing respiratory quotient increased oxygen concentration requirements. A 10-mmHg increase in the minimal oxygen hypoxia threshold increased the pre-decompression oxygen concentration requirement 8 to 12% depending on cockpit altitude.CONCLUSION: Variation in cockpit and regulator pressure schedules which stray outside the parameters used by Ernsting need to be independently calculated. During flight, an individual's physiological \"notch\" will be dynamic, wavering in response to changes in metabolic load, respiratory dynamics, and environmental conditions. Consideration of aircrew activity should be factored in when considering minimal oxygen concentration for pre-decompression hypoxia protection in the design of aircrew life support systems.Dart TS, Morse BG.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fighter pilots undergo extensive medical screening but may still miss rare diseases like latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). LADA patients have circulating autoantibodies directed against pancreatic beta cell antigens and present with frank diabetes late in life which may elude conventional military flight screening. CASE REPORT: Two fifth-generation fighter pilots, a 38-yr-old man (patient 1) and a 27-yr-old man (patient 2), with no significant past medical histories developed symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, episodic polyuria, and arthralgia. Patient 1’s symptoms were initially thought to have been caused by COVID-19, but he subsequently tested negative for viral infection. Lab work instead showed elevated TSH, HgbA1C 11.4%, positive GAD-65, anti-TPO, and anti-islet cell antibodies. Patient 2 developed symptoms following a military deployment and a 72-h diarrheal illness. Due to flight status, patient 2 did not seek expert medical attention for several months, but lab work found HgbA1C of 10.4%, positive GAD-66, and ZnT8 antibodies. Both patients were started on insulin therapy. Patient 1 was also started on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and retired from flying duties. Patient 2 eventually transitioned to metformin without insulin and returned to flying duties with an aeromedical waiver. DISCUSSION: Our patients maintained peak physical fitness throughout their selection and aviation careers, which likely delayed their clinical presentation. Current USAF flight rules prohibit insulin use with flying fighter aircraft. Early antibody screening during pilot selection may be a cost-effective means of diagnosis as traditional screening techniques are unlikely to detect LADA.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) results in progressive replacement of right ventricular myocardium with fibrofatty tissue. This condition commonly presents with sudden cardiac death, cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular tachycardia among young adults. Considering the likelihood of sudden incapacitation, a diagnosis of ARVC usually signals the end of a career in aviation. However, the morbidity pattern among those diagnosed later in life may differ as compared to the young. CASE REPORT: A private pilot, in his 60s, applied for renewal of an ICAO Class 2 medical certificate a decade after his previous medical certificate had expired. He declared history of hospitalization due to a heart-related condition. Further information revealed that he had been diagnosed as a case of ARVC and that he had declined to be implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Recent clinical examination and related cardiovascular investigations were normal except echocardiogram findings of left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial enlargement. The treating cardiologist, in the absence of history of syncope and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction or sustained ventricular tachycardia, considered this condition to be stable with minimal risk of malignant arrhythmia. DISCUSSION: This case report discusses aeromedical decision making in a pilot found to have ARVC late in life. Despite the progressive nature of the condition with its attendant risk of incapacitation, considering the age at diagnosis and absence of any high-risk features of ARVC, the regulator decided to issue the medical certificate with safety pilot restriction to enable this pilot to return to aviation activities.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Israel began vaccinating with the booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in July 2021, before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the vaccine in September 2021. The first and second vaccines were shown to have several side effects that could possibly affect aircrews’ fitness to fly. Thus, the Israel Air Force (IAF) decided on a disqualification period of 24 h following the first vaccine, and 48 h following the second vaccine. The aim of this study was to determine the disqualification period following the booster dose of the vaccine. METHODS: A survey was conducted among IAF aviators in the Aeromedical Center (AMC) in order to characterize the side effects and their duration following a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster dose. RESULTS: The most common local side effect was injection site pain. The most common systemic side effects were general weakness, fatigue, and myalgia. Duration of side effects was up to 48 h from vaccine administration among the majority of aircrew members. CONCLUSION: The IAF AMC policy for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine booster dose recipients is to disqualify from flight for 48 h following the vaccination.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Optimal human performance and health is dependent on steady blood supply to the brain. Hypergravity (+G z ) may impair cerebral blood flow (CBF), and several investigators have also reported that microgravity (0 G) may influence cerebral hemodynamics. This has led to concerns for safe performance during acceleration maneuvers in aviation or the impact long-duration spaceflights may have on astronaut health. METHODS: A systematic PEO (Population, Exposure, Outcome) search was done in PubMed and Web of Science, addressing studies on how elevated +G z forces or absence of such may impact cerebral hemodynamics. All primary research containing anatomical or physiological data on relevant intracranial parameters were included. Quality of the evidence was analyzed using the GRADE tool. RESULTS: The search revealed 92 eligible articles. It is evident that impaired CBF during +G z acceleration remains an important challenge in aviation, but there are significant variations in individual tolerance. The reports on cerebral hemodynamics during weightlessness are inconsistent, but published data indicate that adaptation to sustained microgravity is also characterized by significant variations among individuals. DISCUSSION: Despite a high number of publications, the quality of evidence is limited due to observational study design, too few included subjects, and methodological challenges. Clinical consequences of high +G z exposure are well described, but there are significant gaps in knowledge regarding the intracranial pathophysiology and individual hemodynamic tolerance to both hypergravity and microgravity environments.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess test-retest reliability of the Pieterse return to flight duty protocol for cabin crew to return to flight duties.METHOD: Flight attendants between 20-50 yr old were included if they underwent rehabilitation at the musculoskeletal rehabilitation unit for a musculoskeletal injury, surgical treatment for orthopedic trauma or industrial injuries, and were assessed by the treating physical therapist and aviation medical examiner to be ready for return to work. Test-retest reliability was calculated with the Fleiss kappa coefficient.RESULTS: Included were 18 flight attendants (10 men, 34.9 ± 6.3 yr; 8 women, 34.2 ± 3.4 yr). Eight participants were rehabilitated following upper extremity injury, eight following lower extremity, and two following both upper and lower extremity injury. Perfect test-retest reliability was observed for nine items; kappa values above 0.9 were observed for three items; one item had a kappa value above 0.8 and two items had a kappa value of 0.78. The results for all 15 items were highly significant, demonstrating that the Fleiss kappa coefficients were significantly different from zero. The kappa coefficient strength of agreement was almost perfect for 13 and substantial for the remaining 3 items. Overall test-retest reliability was 0.95.DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated almost perfect test-retest reliability for 13 items and substantial reliability for two items, with an overall test-retest reliability of 0.95 for a return to flight assessment for flight attendants. The Pieterse protocol is a reliable tool to establish return to work for cabin crew.Hohmann E, Tetsworth K, Pieterse R.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Heel-lift is a subjectively reported fit issue in planetary spacesuit boot prototypes that has not yet been quantified. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) could quantify heel-lift but are susceptible to integration drift. This work evaluates the use of IMUs and drift-correction algorithms, such as zero-velocity (ZVUs) and zero-position updates (ZPUs), to quantify heel-lift during spacesuited gait. METHODS: Data was originally collected by Fineman et al. in 2018 to assess lower body relative coordination in the spacesuit. IMUs were mounted on the spacesuit lower legs (SLLs) and spacesuit operator’s shank as three operators walked on a level walkway in three spacesuit padding conditions. Discrete wavelet transforms were used to identify foot-flat phase and heel-off for each step. Differences in heel-off timepoints were calculated in each step as a potential indicator of heel-lift, with spacesuit-delayed heel-off suggesting heel-lift. Average drift rates were estimated prior to and after applying ZVUs and ZPUs. RESULTS: Heel-off timepoint differences showed instances of spacesuit-delayed heel-off and instances of operator-delayed heel-off. Drift rates after applying ZVUs and ZPUs suggested an upper time bound of 0.03 s past heel-off to measure heel-lift magnitude with an accuracy of 1 cm. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that IMUs may not be appropriate for quantifying the presence and magnitude of heel lift. Operator-delayed heel-off suggests that the SLL may be expanding prior to heel-off, creating a false vertical acceleration signal interpreted by this study to be spacesuit heel-off. Quantifying heel-off will therefore require improvements in IMU mounting to mitigate the effects of SLL, or alternative sensor technologies. Boppana A, Priddy ST, Stirling L, Anderson AP.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Spacecraft maximum allowable concentrations (SMACs) provide guidance on allowable chemical exposures for nominal and emergency situations aboard spacecraft. SMACs are set to mitigate or preclude potential crew health effects and performance degradation. Hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas is highly irritating. Inhaled HF produces irritation primarily in the upper respiratory tract. HF is not routinely present in spacecraft atmospheres. However, it can be produced in spacecraft due to overheating or combustion events involving materials containing fluorinated organics.METHODS: Toxicological data relevant to SMAC development were collected from electronic databases using principles of systematic review, and from previous assessments and reviews of HF.RESULTS: The human inhalation data of Lund (short-term) and Largent (subchronic) showed that HF at approximately 3 ppm caused very mild respiratory irritation. NASA HF SMACs are based on these findings.DISCUSSION: The 1-h and 24-h SMACs are set at 3 ppm, a value consistent with NASA short-term SMAC criteria where crew may experience mild irritation. The 7-d, 30-d, 180-d, and 1000-d SMACs are set at 0.3 ppm to protect against any long-term crew health or performance effects that could be produced from HF exposures.Lam C-W, Ryder VE.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Although hypobaric hypoxia training (HHT) is an essential component of aviation physiology training, it poses a risk of decompression sickness (DCS). DCS can sometimes be observed as a cluster of cases, which is referred to as epidemic DCS. In this report, we aim to evaluate an epidemic DCS episode that occurred following two consecutive HHT sessions.METHODS: A total of 16 trainees, all of whom were medical doctors, attended the aviation medicine training course in the aeromedical research and training center. They went through HHT in two sessions, each with eight trainees.RESULTS: Following two HHT sessions, five Type 1 DCS cases occurred among 18 personnel (16 trainees and 2 inside observers). DCS incidence rate was found to be 27.77%. They were successfully treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT).DISCUSSION: Since the DCS incidence rate was found to be higher than the average in such a short period of time, this cluster of cases was labeled as epidemic DCS. We carried out a thorough investigation into all possible causes by following some templates that were developed to conduct comprehensive investigations into epidemic DCS episodes. According to the psychological arguments discussed here, we placed a special emphasis on hysterical and psychosocial components, among other probable factors. In cases where the possibility of hysteria and placebo-nocebo responses exist, it is appropriate to conduct the training and treatment processes with these factors in mind. No matter what the triggering factor is and how the symptoms manifest, HBOT remains crucial in the treatment of DCS.Demir AE, Ata N.

In this review, we summarize the different genetic variants for AD from the perspective of screening purposes within the U.S. Air Force aviation community. Using a PRISMA-informed systematic review approach, we found 13 papers reporting genetic associations with AD. We report 98 genetic associations with AD, of which 4 had a greater than twofold increased odds of developing the condition when present. These 98 variants were found in 45 associated genes, including LRRC32, OVOL1, and IL13, which were each replicated in 3 studies; as well as RTEL1 and ZNF365, which were each replicated in 2 studies. A polygenic risk model created based upon these variants or genes could contribute to a risk screening protocol for military aviation candidates, potentially helping minimize risk for candidates at increased genetic risk for AD or other atopic diseases (e.g., asthma, allergic rhinitis).

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Altitude chambers are used for training aircrews in a hypobaric hypoxic environment to better prepare them for pressurization and oxygen malfunction incidents during flights. However, adverse effects may occur during training sessions, with decompression sickness (DCS) being a major concern. The aim of this study was to examine the risks of different adverse effects during altitude chamber trainings (ACT) in the Israeli Air Force (IAF) facility and to compare them to other training facilities. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1627 individuals in the IAF who were trained in the altitude chamber between 2015 and 2019. Data regarding adverse effects and training safety were extracted. Literature review of altitude chamber trainings was performed and adverse effects rates were compared. RESULTS: There were a total of 91 adverse effects cases in the IAF during the study period. The overall risk rate for an adverse effect was 5.59%. The most common adverse effect was middle ear and sinus barotrauma (69.3% of adverse effects cases), followed by breathing problems (14.3%) and DCS cases (9.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Mitigating the risk for DCS should be major concern during ACT. We recommend setting a standard protocol for an ACT which includes a 45-min preoxygenation period, a maximal ascent rate of 3000 ft · min −1 (914 m · min −1 ), and setting a maximum altitude of 25,000 ft (7620 m) for fixed-wing trainees.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Women of child-bearing age make up an ever-increasing element of the aeromedical workforce in Australia and the UK. However, policy relating to the management of risk for pregnant employees in this sector is often missing or inadequate, with many women facing detrimental impacts on their career progression and financial well-being. For women who choose to continue flying, there is a lack of transparent guidance about the risks of flying within a helicopter in an aeromedical role. While grounding pregnant employees removes some risks, it is at the cost of autonomy and brings other adverse effects for the employee and employer. Updated reflections on this important topic will empower the audience to make informed discussions around pregnancy in aeromedical roles. TOPIC: Applying principles from literature surrounding commercial, military, and medical aviation, the risks to pregnant employees and the fetus are reviewed. These risks are complex and dynamic depending on gestation and underlying medical problems; thus, individualization of risk management is of key importance. In low-risk pregnancies, incapacitation risk is below the usual threshold adopted for safety-sensitive aviation activities. Based on available evidence we have quantified risks where possible and provide guidance on the relevant factors to consider in creating a holistic risk-management framework. The greatest unknown surrounds the risk from vibration, noise, and winching. These are reviewed and suggestions given for discussing this risk. We also highlight the need for policy providing acceptable nonflying options to remove the pressure to continue flying in pregnancy. APPLICATION: Based on a literature review we have generated a framework for understanding and assessing risk relating to pregnant employees in the aeromedical sector. This is intended for use by aeromedical organizations, pregnant employees, and their treating medical practitioners to provide rational and sensible policy and guidance.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Of the body senses, vision is the most important for safe flight. Keratoconus causes progressive blurring and distortion of vision, which threatens the career of a civilian or military aviator. The goal of this retrospective study was to describe a series of keratoconus cases in a pilot population and to discuss decisions about their flight waivers. METHODS: To assess the impact of keratoconus on flying careers, we reviewed the records of all aviators with keratoconus examined in an Aeromedical Center over the past 5 yr. RESULTS: The files of 19 pilots [13 line pilots and 6 military pilots (3 fighter pilots)] were collected and analyzed. Of the 19 patients, 2 did not obtain flight fitness waivers. Among the 17 who received waivers, correction for defective distant vision (glasses or contact lenses) was imposed on 5 aviators. DISCUSSION: Keratoconus is a medical condition with aeromedical significance that should be detected by aeromedical examiners. A flight license can only be considered if the disease is stable and with satisfactory visual quality. Double pass aberrometry may be helpful to determine flight fitness. This study shows that keratoconus is not always a disability for aviators. Most of them are able to continue their flying careers safely. However, it must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-G acceleration experienced during launch and re-entry of suborbital spaceflights may present challenges for older or medically susceptible participants. A detailed understanding of the associated physiological responses would support the development of an evidence-based medical approach to commercial suborbital spaceflight. METHODS: There were 24 healthy subjects recruited into ‘younger’ (18-44 yr), ‘intermediate’ (45-64 yr) and ‘older’ (65-80 yr) age groups. Cardiovascular and respiratory variables were measured continuously during dynamic combinations of +Gx (chest-to-back) and +Gz (head-to-foot) acceleration that simulated suborbital G profiles for spaceplane and rocket/capsule platforms. Measurements were conducted breathing air and breathing 15% oxygen to simulate a cabin pressure altitude of 8000 ft. RESULTS: Suborbital G profiles generated highly dynamic changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output. G-induced hypoxemia was observed, with minimum arterial oxygen saturation &lt; 80% in a quarter of subjects. Increased age was associated with greater hypoxemia and reduced cardiac output responses but did not have detrimental cardiovascular effects. ECG changes included recurrent G-induced trigeminy in one individual. Respiratory and visual symptoms were common, with 88% of subjects reporting greyout and 29% reporting blackout. There was one episode of G-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC). DISCUSSION: Suborbital acceleration profiles are generally well tolerated but are not physiologically inconsequential. Marked hemodynamic effects and transient respiratory compromise could interact with predisposing factors to precipitate adverse cardiopulmonary effects in a minority of participants. Medically susceptible individuals may benefit from expanded preflight centrifuge familiarization that includes targeted physiological evaluation in the form of a ‘G challenge test’.

Methods and results At-ear noise levels were measured at 4 positions in the cabin of the Black Hawk under various flight conditions and at 13 positions outside the Black Hawk under various ground running conditions using the Head Acoustic Measurement System (Head, GmbH). The attenuation properties of the hearing protection devices (HPDs) normally worn by aircrew and maintenance crews (the ALPHA helmet and the Roanwell MX-2507 Communications headset) were also assessed. At-ear sound pressure levels that would be experienced by personnel wearing their normal HPDs were determined at the positions they would normally occupy in and around the aircraft. Conclusion Results indicate that HPDs do not provide adequate hearing protection to meet current hearing conservation regulations which allow a permissible noise exposure of 85 dB(A) for an 8-h day.",

Noninferiority and equivalence testing require estimates of a metric called delta: the margin of meaningful difference. Inappropriate delta margins can lead to invalid conclusions, thereby creating uncertainty about a studys scientific credibility. We recommend that a working group be convened with the following goals: 1) to evaluate delta values currently in use in aviation; 2) to determine if it is possible to develop a systematic, evidence-based, and replicable process to derive delta values based on statistical properties from population data, rather than a mixture of evidence- and opinion-based processes; and 3) based on the findings of the second goal, update the current delta values in use in aviation. This working group should include, at a minimum, government agencies and other key stakeholders using these values within operational settings. Lamp ACM, Rempe MJ, Belenky GL.

This is a report of a pilot with this condition with a discussion of the challenges for the regulator in the assessment for medical certification of pilots with a neurological disability. CASE REPORT: A pilot with CMTX1 declared his condition to the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority when his brother was diagnosed with the same condition. Apart from high arched feet and some difficulty playing sports, he had no problems until his mid-forties, when he very slowly developed increasing weakness with foot dorsiflexion and later wasting and weakness of the small hand muscles. He reported no problems with any flying activity. On clinical examination, it seemed likely that the disability would have an impact on his ability to undertake all the flying tasks of a commercial pilot, including those required in emergencies. DISCUSSION: A modified Medical Flight Test (MFT) specifically tailored by the regulator to test areas of functional impairment allowed the successful certificatory assessment of a pilot with this condition; an approach which could apply to any pilot with a rare neurological disability.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether reductions in cerebral oxygenation, caused by subthreshold G-forces (up to 4 G z and of limited durations that do not lead to LOC), would affect visual perception and working memory performance. METHODS: Sixteen subjects performed visual perception and working memory tasks both before and during G z exposures (1, 2.2, 3, 4 with leg pressurization, 4 with leg and abdomen pressurization) within a human-use centrifuge. RESULTS: As measured using near-infrared spectroscopy, blood oxygenation over medial prefrontal cortex was similar in the 1 and 2.2 G z conditions, but was reduced to a similar extent in the 3 and 4 G z conditions. In parallel, visual perception accuracy was reduced in the 3 and 4 G z conditions, with no difference between the 3 and 4 G z conditions. No change in reaction time was seen. Conversely, neither accuracy nor reaction time changes were observed for the visual working memory task. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that although visual working memory is not affected, the ability to visually discriminate between stimuli is reduced at G-forces as low as 3 and 4 G z . This may have important ramifications for pilots who are routinely subjected to such forces. Croft RJ, Klegrd R, Tribukait A, Taylor NAS, Eiken O.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Decompression sickness (DCS) can occur during unpressurized flight to altitudes &gt;18,000 ft (FL180; 5486 m). To our knowledge, this has not been studied in general aviation (GA). This knowledge gap may have public health and safety implications because the most popular models of GA aircraft by sales volume are capable of flying &gt;FL180. METHODS: Data from a 1-yr period in a commercial flight tracking database were analyzed to identify flights &gt;FL180 in unpressurized, piston aircraft in the United States. Peak altitude and duration at that altitude were used to calculate DCS risk employing the U.S. Air Force (USAF) Altitude Decompression Sickness Risk Assessment Computer (ADRAC). Registration numbers were cross referenced in publicly available federal databases to identify any events that might be attributable to impairment due to DCS. A web-based survey of practices and associated symptoms was also made available to GA pilots through an online discussion forum. RESULTS: During the data collection period, 1696 flights occurred. The DCS risk was calculated to be 1.9 4.2%. There were 42 responses to the survey. Of these, 25 (59.5%) pilots reported having flown at altitudes &gt;FL180 and 21 (84%) of them reported symptoms possibly attributable to DCS. None sought medical attention. No safety events were identified for any of the aircraft during the study period. CONCLUSION: The risk of DCS in the GA community is not zero. As GA aircraft performance profiles advance and sales increase, this may have significant implications from a public health and safety perspective. Further study is warranted.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Research has shown that astronauts performing extravehicular activities may be exposed, under certain conditions, to undesired electrical hazards. This study used computer models to determine whether these undesired induced electrical currents could be responsible for involuntary neuromuscular activity caused by either large diameter peripheral nerve activation or reflex activity from cutaneous afferent stimulation. METHODS: A multiresolution variant of the admittance method along with a magnetic resonance image millimeter resolution model of a male human body were used to calculate the following: 1) induced electric fields; 2) resistance between contact areas in a Extravehicular Mobility Unit spacesuit; 3) currents induced in the human body; 4) the physiological effects of these electrical exposures; and 5) the risk to the crew during extravehicular activities. RESULTS: Using typical EMU shock exposure conditions, with a 15V source, the current density magnitudes and total current injected are well above previously reported startle reaction thresholds. This indicates that, under the considered conditions during a spacewalk in the charged ionospheric plasma of space, astronauts could experience possibly harmful involuntary motor response and sensory pain nerve activation.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: When an aircraft banks pilots will reflexively tilt their heads in the opposite direction, known as the optokinetic cervical reflex (OKCR). This is elicited by the appearance of the horizon and is an attempt to keep the moving horizon stable on the pilots retina to help maintain spatial orientation. The appearance of the horizon and the visual environment changes at higher altitudes and there is little research studying the effects of this. Our hypothesis was that increasing altitude would alter the visual cues present and decrease the OKCR. METHODS: There were 16 subjects who flew two flights in a flight simulator while their head tilt, aircraft altitude, and angle of aircraft bank were recorded. The flights were at an altitude of under 1500 ft above ground and above 15,000 ft above ground. RESULTS: Aircraft bank caused head tilt in the opposite direction at both altitudes. A two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests showed that 86% of aircraft bank angles from 0 to 90 in either direction had a head tilt that was statistically significantly smaller at high altitude. DISCUSSION: This study shows that there appears to be a difference between the OKCR at low and high altitude. Pilots at higher altitude seem to exhibit a smaller head tilt for the same aircraft bank angle. More research is required to fully understand why there is a decrease in the OKCR at high altitude, as well as the actual consequences of the decreased reflex on pilot orientation.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ketamine is a rapidly acting general anesthetic which is globally used in surgical analgesia, as well as in the management of pain. It is also used as a recreational drug. Because of its widespread use in surgical settings, the use of this drug presents an aeromedical problemin addition, of course, to the underlying condition for which it has been used. The literature around the mechanisms and side effects of ketamine is reasonably mature, and it is possible to make fairly dependable risk management decisions about return to flying based on the information available. Accordingly, following ketamine use it is recommended that aviators be grounded for 48 h following Aviation Medical Examiner review. If review is unavailable, the aviator should be grounded for 1 wk to allow sufficient time to identify the existence of prolonged side effects, such as psychomimetic effects or cognitive changes.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The paragliding reserve parachute system is safety-critical but underused, unstandardized, and known to fail. This study aimed to characterize reserve parachute deployment under radial acceleration to make recommendations for system design and paraglider pilot training. METHODS: There were 88 licensed amateur paraglider pilots who were filmed deploying their reserve parachutes from a centrifuge. Of those, 43 traveled forward at 4 G simulating a spiral dive, and 45 traveled backward at 3 G simulating a rotational maneuver known as SAT. Tests incorporated ecologically valid body, hand, and gaze positions, and cognitive loading and switching akin to real deployment. The footage was reviewed by subject matter experts and compared to previous work in linear acceleration. RESULTS: Of the pilots, 2.3 failed to extract the reserve container from the harness. SAT appeared more cognitively demanding than spiral, despite lower G. Participants located the reserve handle by touch not sight. The direction of travel influenced their initial contact with the harness: 82.9 searched first on their hip in spiral, 63.4 searched first on their thigh in SAT. Search patterns followed skeletal landmarks. Participants had little directional control over their throw. CONCLUSIONS: Paraglider pilots are part of the reserve system. Maladaptive behaviors observed under stress highlighted that components must work in harmony with pilots natural responses, with minimal cognitive demands or need for innovation or problem-solving. Recommendations include positioning prominent, tactile reserve handles overlying the pilots hip; deployment bags extractable with any angle of pull; deployment in a single sweeping backward action; and significantly increasing reserve deployment drills.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Syncope is both incapacitating and unpredictable, presenting a significant challenge in aircrew assessment. Previous UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) guidance lacked transparency and relied heavily on specialist in-house cardiology and neurology opinion. A new algorithm was developed which elaborated and formalized the decision-making process. An analysis of its impact on historic cases was undertaken to ensure it aligned with previous certificatory outcomes. METHODS: The medical literature on syncope and the approaches of other national aviation authorities were reviewed to help inform the development of a new algorithm. Using syncope cases in the CAA database, regulatory outcomes generated using the new algorithm were compared with previous decisions in terms of time off from flying (TOF) and Operational Multi-Crew Limitation (OML) duration. RESULTS: There were 40 historic syncope cases (25 existing certificate holders,15 initial applicants) which were reassessed using the new algorithm. The mean TOF for existing pilots using the new algorithm was 7.1 9.8 (mean SD) vs. 4.2 3.5 mo under the old guidance with an OML duration of 21.4 34.9 vs. 24.5 25.2 mo. One less initial applicant experienced a delay to certification. Four cases with underlying pathology were detected using old and new guidance. DISCUSSION: The reassessment of cases showed no statistically significant difference in TOF and OML duration; this is a positive finding from a regulatory perspective, enabling algorithm-led decision-making with less reliance on in-house expertise. A similar approach may be useful in future updates to other areas of regulatory practice. Anderton RA, Mitchell SJ, ONunain SS. Syncope in commercial pilots and new regulatory guidance.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the effect of head-down tilt (HDT) on vascular autoregulation in different age groups and determine its effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) and central corneal thickness (CCT).METHODS: Included were 43 eyes of 23 men. The optic nerve head and parafoveal vascular densities were measured by optical coherence tomography angiography before and after 20 min 10 HDT. Also, the study comprised an examination of the IOP and CCT in a subset of 8 participants (14 eyes) in the sitting position and during 15 min of 10 HDT.RESULTS: Grid-based inside disc all-vessel density (GBID) was statistically significantly lower after the HDT test in subjects under 30 yr (1.26). Whole image and peripapillary capillary vessel density (WICVD, PCVD), and whole image and peripapillary all-vessel density (WIAVD, PAVD) were significantly higher after the HDT test in subjects ages 30-39 yr (1.34, 2.16, 1.05, 1.72, respectively). Inside disc capillary, all-vessel density (IDCVD, IDAVD) and GBID were significantly higher after HDT in subjects over 40 yr (2.48, 2.15, 1.52, respectively). In a subset of eight participants, IOP was significantly higher (3.7 mmHg) and CCT was unchanged after 15 min of HDT.CONCLUSION: Our study showed that simulated microgravity induced optic nerve head vessel density at the inside disc area, especially in persons over 40 years. In addition, IOP was increased by HDT, although no change in CCT was observed.Özelbaykal B, Öğretmenoğlu G, Tunçez I.H.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) that increases risk for clinically significant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This common (1:220) disease is present within the fighter pilot community and hesitation to treat this condition at younger ages results in a higher risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), the presence of which can be catastrophic for flying safety. CASE REPORT: A 40-yr-old asymptomatic F-15 pilot presented with persistently elevated LDL-C levels &gt; 190 mg dL 1 and a significant family history of CAD. Coronary artery calcium, CT angiography, and finally, invasive angiography were used to further stratify him as having mild CAD. Initiation of statin therapy significantly lowered his LDL and subsequent risk for disease progression, allowing him to return to flying. DISCUSSION: Early recognition and treatment of HeFH is imperative for lowering the risk of ASCVD. Often the medical community supporting flyers is hesitant to diagnose or treat this condition, due to nonrecognition, the young age of presentation, or reluctance to potentially ground a flyer. By intervening earlier, rather than waiting, aviators can remain on flying status longer with lower risk to themselves and their aircrew. Gatzke LC.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: High altitudes imply exposure to a decreased ambient air pressure. Such a situation may also alter the performance of acoustic transducers using vibrating diaphragms due to air rarefaction. This study aimed at analyzing the performance at high altitude of hearing aids (HAs) where mechano-electric and electro-mechanic transducers are used. METHODS: A hypobaric chamber was used to perform two separated experimental sessions. In the first one two commercial models of HAs were exposed to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft (7620 m) and to a subsequent rapid decompression profile, with a rapid climb (< 3 s) from 8000 (2438 m) to 25,000 ft. The second session separately analyzed the performance of microphone and receiver at an altitude of 9000 and 15,000 ft (2743 and 4572 m). Before and after the first session, the HAs were tested with an electronic ear while a dedicated recording system was used in the second session. RESULTS: No HA damage or dysfunction was detected during the first session. In the second one, the microphone showed a mild decrease of its output, while the receiver exhibited a much higher reduction of its output. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the safe use of HAs even under extreme environmental pressure changes. For altitudes exceeding 10,000 ft (3048 m), a recalibration of the HAs output via a dedicated program may be suggested. Lucertini M, Sanjust F, Manca R, Cerini L, Lucertini L, Sisto R.

The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to collect baseline data for neck function for F-15E aircrew and determine efficacy and feasibility of two separate exercise protocols in measuring short-term outcomes of subjective and objective neck function in order to inform future study design. METHODS: Randomized to either progressive (PRO) or general (GEN) exercise groups were 41 F-15E aircrew. Data collection occurred at baseline, 3 wk, and 3 mo. RESULTS: At baseline, 39% of the subjects reported current NP, 79.5% reported a history of NP attributed to flying, 12.8% reported being removed from flying duties due to NP, and 10% reported receiving medical care for NP. PRO and GEN group randomization showed similar baseline assessment data. Blinding was successful and exercise logs showed 31.6% compliance with prescribed exercise regimens. There were small but statistically significant increases in neck range of motion in both groups over the course of the study. Aircrew with current NP had significantly higher F-15E flight hours. DISCUSSION: This study supports the high prevalence of NP in aircrew, yet low frequency of seeking care for NP. Future studies to assess NP prevention and treatment in aircrew require an integrated approach that includes operational exercise policy and long-term data collection in flying units with dedicated resources for assessment and analysis.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The speech recognition levels of cochlear implant (CI) users are still incompatible with ICAO hearing requirements for civil aviation pilots testing in the noisy background condition of the helicopter cockpit. In this study, we evaluated noise attenuation effects on speech recognition in the same background condition. METHODS: The study involved the evaluation of 12 Portuguese-speaking CI users with post-lingual deafness and with a pure tone average up to 35 dB HL between 500 and 2000 Hz and up to 50 dB at 3000 Hz on at least one of the ears, and of three normal hearing pilots (controls). We performed speech recognition tests using sentences, numbers, and disyllables for all participants through the VHF radio. The assessment took place inside a helicopter with engine on, using three setups: 1) with headset without the active noise cancellation; 2) activating the noise cancellation system of the headset itself; and 3) connecting the speech processor directly to the helicopter radio system. RESULTS: The headset active noise-cancellation improved only the recognition of sentences. The direct connection system compared to the headset without anti-noise attenuation significantly improved all the recognition tests. The median for numbers was 90%, but the best score for disyllables recognition was 56%. DISCUSSION: The noise attenuation resources proposed in this study improved the CI users’ speech recognition when exposed to the noisy helicopter cockpit. However, speech recognition of CI users still did not meet the standards of ICAO, which requires at least 80% for understanding disyllables in the speech in noise test.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Graves' Disease (GD) is a common cause of hyperthyroidism. Although definitive treatment with radioactive iodine (RAI) is preferred for military aircrew, there are cultural and individual differences in receptivity toward RAI, and clinical guidelines that recommend antithyroid drugs (ATD) as the first line therapy. We examined a case series of Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) aviators with GD treated with ATD and the impact of their condition on aeromedical disposition.CASE SERIES: All RSAF aircrew diagnosed with GD and treated with ATD over a 15-yr period were retrospectively identified and analyzed to determine the impact on their fitness for flying duties. The mean age of the 13 aircrew was 33 ± 7.1 yr (range, 25-47 yr), with 11 (84.6%) being males. There were 10 (76.9%) who had ATD as the only treatment while 3 (23.1%) were initially treated with ATD but subsequently underwent RAI or surgery. Of the 10 treated with only ATD, 3 (30.0%) were returned to restricted flying, 6 (60.0%) were returned to unrestricted flying, and 1 (10.0%) is still undergoing ATD titration. There were 10 (76.9%) aircrew who were returned to some form of flying duties while on low doses of ATD.DISCUSSION: This case series suggests that ATD is a viable treatment modality in the aeromedical management of military aviators with GD and it is possible to return military aircrew on a stable maintenance dose of ATD to flying duties. A framework is proposed to support the aeromedical decision-making process for military aircrew in the treatment of GD.Loh EH-T, Soh FW, See B, Tan BBC.
