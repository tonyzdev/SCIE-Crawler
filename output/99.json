Trichoderma harzianum ( Th -6) is an endophytic fungus that shows salt tolerance and establishes a symbiotic relationship with a host plant. To evaluate the role of Trichoderma harzianum ( Th -6) in mitigating the consequences of salinity stress on crop plants, seeds of maize and rice were coated with Trichoderma before sowing and salt treatment. Later, after germination, twenty-one day old seedlings were subjected to NaCl concentrations (50, 100 and 150 mM). Salinity negatively affected all investigated physiological parameters in both crops. Treatment of seeds with Trichoderma improved plant growth and Th -treated plants exhibited substantial physiological adjustment in a saline environment compared to Th -untreated plants. The Th -treated plants under salt stress showed higher relative water content and stomatal conductance, better photosynthetic performance and higher pigment concentrations, as well as higher catalase and superoxide dismutase activities. Moreover, proline content in salt stress environment was higher in Th -treated plants, while H 2 O 2 content declined. The physiological role of Trichoderma harzianum in mitigating the salt related consequences of both crop plants is discussed.",

The present study was intended to examine the comparative ameliorative effects of diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) and proline (Pro) on As-stress in Glycine max L. Seeds of Glycine max L. were subjected to As (100 µM) singly, and together with DPI (10 µM), EBL (0.5 µM) or Pro (10 mM), for five days, and were then analyzed. Experimental results showed that As treatment caused a substantial fall in growth traits like germination percentage, radicle length and dry mass, which was accompanied by As accumulation. Additionally, As application also revealed reduced viability, total protein content and activities of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase), while it increased the levels of total sugar, proline and oxidative stress markers such as electrolyte leakage, reactive oxygen species, lipid oxidized products, protein carbonyls and hydroperoxides, Amadori and Maillard reaction products, malondialdehyde-/4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-protein adducts, protease and proteasome. Isozymes of antioxidative enzymes were also observed to be altered considerably under As-stress. Impressively, DPI, EBL and Pro played their role as protective agents, hence caused enhanced growth and reduced As accumulation. These protective chemicals also improved the viability, accruals of total protein, total sugar and endogenous proline, and activities of antioxidants, while they reduced the levels of oxidative stress markers. Our findings demonstrated the involvement of DPI, EBL and Pro in As-stress tolerance in Glycine max L. Further, Pro appears to be superior to DPI and EBL, in alleviating As-induced responses in Glycine max L.",

In order to study the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) and spermine on physiological and biochemical traits of licorice under cold stress conditions, a factorial experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications. Plants were exposed to optimum temperature (26 ºC) as control and low temperature (4 ºC) as cold stress conditions and also treated with TiO2 NPs (2 and 5 ppm) and spermine (1 mM), separately. Results from physiological and biochemical analyses of the aerial parts of licorice seedlings showed that the growth parameters and the content of photosynthetic pigments decreased in response to low temperature. TiO2 NPs and spermine treatments increased plant resistance to cold stress and decreased the level of oxidative damage by reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents. In other hand, TiO2 NPs and spermine caused increase of phenolics, total protein and osmolytes contents under cold stress conditions. An increase in glycyrrhizin content was significantly induced by low temperature, TiO2 NPs and spermine.",

Salt, drought and a combination of these stresses were applied to plants by gradual increments. The plants were exposed to stress for two weeks. Relative water content, osmotic potential, stomatal conductance, performance index, dark adapted quantum yield and chlorophyll contents were reduced upon salinity and drought stresses. However, when plants were subjected to a combination of these stresses, a greater reduction in all tested attributes was observed. Proline and carotenoid contents in drought stress were elevated compared to salt stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) showed the highest activity in individual salt and drought stress with less accumulation of H 2 O 2 . Combined stress reduced the activity of antioxidant enzymes which ultimately decreased the physiological performance of sunflower plants. However, among the tested genotypes, S.28111 and SF0049 were found to be more tolerant to drought, salt and combined stress than both Hysun genotypes. The physiological performance of genotypes against salinity and drought individually and in combination is discussed in detail.",

In these conditions, the effect of biostimulant Bio-algeen S-90 and fertilizer Megagreen on the production of the traditional winter lettuce cultivar ‘Four Seasons’ was tested. Both treatments showed a positive effect on the growth and total yield of winter lettuce, and decreased the share of non-marketable yield. Bio-algeen S-90 treatment increased the plant height by 61.5%, and foliar treatment with Megagreen by 60.9%, as compared to the control treatment. Equally, both treatments resulted in higher leaf numbers (47.7% for Bio-algeen S-90 and 37.2% for Megagreen). The head mass of lettuce treated with Bio-algeen S-90 and Megagreen was 30.3% and 25.0% higher than in the control treatment, respectively. Megagreen contributed more to chlorophyll and carotenoid content, while Bio-algeen S-90 elevated the amount of vitamin C and dry matter. The pH value of lettuce juice decreased after Bio-algeen S-90, while the mineral content (N, P and K) did not differ between the tested treatments. Lower nitrate content was detected after both treatments. The obtained results elucidate the effect of Bio-algeen S-90 and Megagreen on “low input” lettuce production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Croatia is among the most ecologically diverse and floristically rich countries in Europe, with a great variety of communities. The vegetation elaboration according to the standard central European method was initiated in Croatia at the beginning of the 20 th century. In previous overviews of Croatian vegetation, the number of classes and alliances was underrepresented in relation to the country’s floristic richness. Furthermore, the level of knowledge and the amount of available data varied greatly among the various types of vegetation. The aims of this paper are mainly to compile a stabile syntaxonomic list of classes, orders and alliances dominated by vascular plants in Croatia and to adjust Croatian vegetation to the new European syntaxonomic system (EuroVegChecklist). It introduces a consistent description of high-rank syntaxa in Croatian. In conclusion, the vegetation of Croatia comprises 66 classes, 121 orders and 201 alliances. The number of syntaxa shows vegetation diversity that is rather high compared to most other European countries; this is related to the high floristic richness and endemism. The list points out the obvious problems and gaps in our knowledge of vegetation in Croatia and can serve as a baseline for the future vegetation studies.",

Carvacrol was the major constituent of the S. montana oil (45.7%). Other important compounds were the monoterpenic hydrocarbons p-cymene, -terpinene and the oxygenated compounds carvacrol methyl ether, borneol and thymol. Conversely, the oil of S. cuneifolia contained a low percentage of carvacrol and thymol.

The screening of the antimicrobial activities of essential oils were individually evalated against nine microorganisms, using a disc diffusion metod. The oil of S. montana exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than the oil of wild savory. Maximum activity of winter savory oil was observed against Escherichia coli, the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and against yeast (Candida albicans). The essential oil of S. cuneifolia was also found to inhibit the growth of pathogens such as S. aureus and E. coli.

Drought stress and artificial prevention of leaf rolling (PLR) were applied at grain filling stage for 30 days. LR in Batem 56-55 occurred later than in Batem 51-52. Leaf water potential (Ψ leaf ) did not change in Batem 56-55 but decreased in Batem 51-52 at LR. Maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F v /F m ), effective quantum yield of photosystem II (Φ PSII ) and electron transport rate (ETR) of the cultivars decreased during LR more significantly in Batem 56-55 in comparison to Batem 51-52. The same was observed for the decrease in net photosynthetic rate (P n ), stomatal conductance (g s ), transpiration (E) and intracellular level of CO 2 (C). Rubis-co activity and content were reduced at LR, but were less affected in Batem 56-55 than in Batem 51-52. Ear and kernel weights also decreased at LR. All parameters at PLR were more reduced than those of LR. These results implied that LR was an important and necessary mechanism protecting photosynthesis and reducing yield loss under drought stress by maintaining the leaf hydration, preventing loss of the photosynthetic pigments, sustaining the activity of PSU, keeping the stornata open, and conserving the activity of Rubisco.",

A size class distribution and a vegetation structure analysis were applied in order to analyze the dynamics of this forest using census data from 51 plots selected across 5 transects covering the hill-slope andwadi-bed habitats. Some of the trees inhabiting the hill-slopes (e.g. Acacia senegal and Commiphora spp.) were found to exhibit an inverse J-shaped distribution with constant regeneration, whilst in the wadi bed these same trees exhibited a J-shaped distribution (i.e. of declining populations). On the other hand, Acacia etbaica inhabiting the hill-slopes exhibited a tendency towards a J-shaped distribution and an inverse J-shaped distribution in the wadi-bed. All the populations (i.e. inhabiting the hill-slopes and the beds) of Anogeissus dhofarica had a J-shaped distribution whereas all the populations of Blepharispermum hirtum had a more or less inverse J-shaped distribution. The Ziziphus spina- -christi and Acacia tortilis populations, meanwhile, exhibited the bi-modal shape of size distribution. The shrubs inhabiting the hill-slopes (e.g. Coroton confertus and Ormocarpum dhofarense) exhibited a tendency towards a J-shaped distribution; such distribution characterizes a declining population with a limited regenerational capacity. Overall, most of the examined populations, except those of Acacia etbaica in wadi-bed and Blepharispermum hirtum, seemed to be under stress from both environmental and human factors, particularly in the wadi bed. This type of study can provide a basis for the development of a management plan to support the conservation and sustainable use of forest vegetation in an arid region.",

This study, using RT-qPCR, determined the expression of P5CS and PCS genes to investigate their roles in the leaves of tomato plants grown under heavy metal conditions. The expression of the PCS1 gene is significantly induced under such conditions. Transcript expression of P5CS1 , a gene responsible for proline synthesis, changed depending on heavy metal doses; treatments of Cu (20 and 50 ppm), Cd and Pb (10 and 20 ppm) remarkably increased P5CS1 expression. However, the P5CS1 gene expression at 10 ppm dose of Cu and 50 ppm doses of Pb and Cd was not significantly different from that in control plants. The metal-chelating potency of the extract of tomato leaves exposed to Pb and Cd was higher than that of untreated plants. The proline content as assessed in the leaves of stressed plants was significantly increased by applications of 10 and 20 ppm of Cd and Pb, and high doses of Cu. In addition, the results showed that the proline content had a positive correlation with the P5CS1 gene expression in tomato leaves under application of these tree heavy metals and that there was a positive relation between the PCS1 gene expression and metal-chelating ability of Cd-stressed plants.",

The seed traits analyzed were: a) the 100-seed weight (P100); b) seed shape degree and seed flattening as determined by J and H coefficients; c) soluble and total protein contents; and d) seed colours. The data indicated that landrace genotypes of common bean collected in Southern Brazil were from both gene pools (Central America and Andes) with both Â»SÂ« (53.42%) and Â»TÂ« (42.46%) phaseolin types. The P100 was the main character that grouped these gene pools. The landrace genotypes of the common bean showed a wide range of seed size associated with seed colour. The grouping used by comparison of means, allowed efficiently identify promising genotypes to compose valuable source of genetic diversity that would be highly useful for future studies of representative genotypes from each group. The accession numbers 11, 25, 26, 46, 48 and 74 are of interest for breeding purpose, for they showed higher productivity associated with high protein content.",

The aim of our study was to select sour cherry genotypes according to their genetic background as well as drought tolerance and investigate possible mechanisms of drought tolerance through the changes in photosynthetic apparatus (i.e. photosynthetic pigment content) and photosynthesis process assessed through the chlorophyll fluorescence transient. All of them together with molecular markers (SSRs and AFLPs), relative water content (RWC) as indicator of plant water status distinguish two genotypes (Kelleris 16 and OS), which are the opposite in regards to drought tolerance. Down-regulation of photosynthesis in drought-treated Kelleris 16 plants was seen as changes in antenna complexes of PSII (decreased total chlorophylls content (a+b) and chlorophylls ratio (a/b)). Despite unchanged maximum quantum yield of PSII in drought-treated leaves of genotype OS, overall photosynthetic performance expressed as PI ABS was down-regulated in both investigated genotypes. However, decrement of PI ABS was much pronounced in genotype Kelleris 16, mainly because of changes in a certain fraction of RCs, which become dissipative centres, seen as increase in ABS/RC and DI 0 /RC, in order to avoid photooxidative damage of photosynthetic apparatus. Also, electron transport, seen as decrease in ET 0 /(TR 0 -ET 0 ) and ET 0 /RC, was impaired which lead to impaired CO 2 fixation and photosynthesis. The described changes in the functioning of photosynthetic apparatus in drought-treated plants of Kelleris 16 constitute the main distinction between the two investigated genotypes regarding drought adaptation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract From a field experiment, the changes in oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities were studied in six Spanish peanut cultivars subjected to 25−30 days of water deficit stress at two different stages: pegging and pod development stages. Imposition of water deficit stress significantly reduced relative water content, membrane stability and total carotenoid content in all the cultivars, whereas total chlorophyll content increased at pegging stage but decreased at pod developmental stage. Chlorophyll a/b ratio increased under water deficit stress in most of the cultivars suggesting a greater damage to chlorophyll b rather than an increase in chlorophyll a content. Oxidative stress measured in terms of H 2 O 2 , superoxide radical content and lipid peroxidation increased under water deficit stress, especially in susceptible cultivars such as DRG 1, AK 159 and ICGV 86031. Relationship among different physiological parameters showed that the level of oxidative stress, in terms of production of reactive oxygen species, was negatively correlated with activities of different antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase. In conclusion, the study shows that water deficit stress at pod development stage proved to be more detrimental than at pegging stage. The higher activities of antioxidant enzymes in the tolerant cultivars like ICGS 44 and TAG 24 were responsible for protection of oxidative damage and thus provide better tolerance to water deficit stress.",

A total of 16 morphospecies of marine-derived fungi (MDF) were isolated from four host macroalgae and two seagrasses and identified as belonging to the genera Aspergillus , Fusarium , Paecilomyces , Penicillium , Sclerotinia , Thamnidium and Trichoderma , including five mycelia sterilia. Among these host organisms, the rhodophyte Laurencia intermedia harboured the highest number of isolated MDF. Selected MDF were then assayed and showed to inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8-19 mm zone of inhibition) and Staphylococcus aureus (6-19 mm zone of inhibition), and were cytotoxic against the brine shrimp Artemia salina nauplii (LD 50 : 201.56-948.37 μg mL −1 ). The screening led to the selection of five of the most bioactive morphospecies, all belonging to the genus Aspergillus . These marine aspergilli were subjected to β-tubulin gene sequence analysis for species identification, and to mass production in different culture media with or without marine salts, and screening of the crude culture extracts for their cytotoxic and trypanocidal activities. Aspergillus tubingensis cultivated in potato dextrose broth with marine salt proved to be the most cytotoxic against P388 (IC 50 : 1028 ng mL −1 ) and HeLa (IC 50 : 1301 ng mL −1 ) cancer cells. On the other hand, A. fumigatus cultivated in malt extract broth without marine salt was shown to be the most potent against Trypanosoma congolense (IC 50 : 298.18 ng mL −1 ). Our study therefore showed that salinity may influence the bioactivities of some species of MDF.",

Antifungal activities of common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oil were tested against endophytic fungi grown from wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain, molecularly identified as Alternaria alternata, Alternaria infectoria, Aspergillus flavus, Epicoccum nigrum and Fusarium poae. Their susceptibility to thyme essential oil was tested in vitro, and ranged from fungicidal to fungistatic. Treatment combinations of prior grain surface sterilization with hypochlorite and direct/indirect treatment with the essential oil were used, which showed strong effects on infection incidence and germination. Direct soaking of the wheat grain in the essential oil was particularly effective, but inhibited both fungal growth and seed germination. In contrast, indirect treatment of the grain with the essential oil (i.e., fumigation) inhibited fungal growth without negative effects on seed germination. In combination with grain surface sterilization with hypochlorite, indirect treatment with thyme essential oil reduced these fungal infections even more. Since thyme essential oil is safe for plants and consumers, in the form of fumigation it could be used as a protectant of storage containers for wheat grain intended for sowing and for food production.",

Lichen thalli were collected before each exposure period from an unpolluted area and transplanted to 16 sites; every 3 months the thalli were retrieved and replaced with new ones. Exposed-to-control ratios of trace elements revealed a marked intracellular accumulation of Cd in summer and autumn, and of Sb in autumn and spring, possibly as a result of vehicular traffic pollution. However, considering the low absolute concentrations of these elements, the intracellular fraction of depositions may hardly have caused an impairment of physiological parameters. As a matter of fact, indicators of photobiont vitality (content of chlorophylls a and b and photosynthetic efficiency) did not show any fluctuation across seasons, while changes in the indicators of mycobiont vitality (cell membrane damage and ergosterol content) overall did reflect some seasonal changes and/or lichen growth.",

All the plants had dual colonization of both AMF and DSE associations. The intermediate-type AMF morphology in the shallot is the first report of this AMF type for the family Aliaceae. The extents of total AMF and DSE colonization ranged from 20.7 to 67.3% and 3.6 to 35.3% respectively and varied significantly among fields. Though no significant relationship existed between total AMF and DSE variables, they were correlated to the soil variables. Significant correlations existed between soil P and microscelerotia and also between soils N and K and AMF spore numbers. A total of six AMF spore morphotype belonging to Glomus and Scutellospora were identified. Scutellospora calospora was the most dominant morphotype in the studied fields.",

Floristic and soil analyses were performed in 2011. The substratum was very diverse in terms of texture (sand: 55-92 %, clay: 6-38 %), nutrient content (total C: 1.3-41.0 %, total N: 0.05-0.49 %, total Ca: 0.5-7.3 %) and pH (3.7-8.7). Moreover, total thallium concentration in the substratum was high, ranging from 6.0 to 14.6 mg kg -1 . Plant cover varied from 50 to 95 %. The number of plant species per 4m 2 varied from 6 to 29 and correlated negatively with total carbon content (r = -0.85, p &lt; 0.01), and positively with sand content in the substratum (r = 66, p &lt; 0.05). The highest number of species per area unit was observed on a humus substratum, where initial soil has developed on the part of carboniferous waste rock spoil under 20-30 year old trees, and the lowest on carbon shale with coal and culm. Among 197 plant species, most belong to Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae and Rosaceae families. Hemicryptophytes (49%) and terophytes (18%) predominated. The investigated area was primarily colonized by native species spread by the wind. However, invasive alien species also had a significant share (8%) in the plant cover.",

Despite differences in mineral content among the leaves, pods and seeds, calcium was found in the highest amount and zinc in the lowest. The amino acid profile indicated aspartic acid as the major amino acid and proline as the minor. Among protein fractions, globulin was present in higher amounts than other fractions. Linoleic acid was the major fatty acid detected in the oil from both pods and seeds, while g-tocopherol was the major component of the tocopherol observed from same oil. Moreover, significant antioxidant potential was observed from the extracts of all three parts investigated. The results obtained in this study clearly indicate that A. leucophloea has a sufficient potential for use as a natural antioxidant agent. Further phytochemical studies will be performed for specification of the biologically active principles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Leaf trait variations in five deciduous species (Quercus robur, Corylus avellana, Populus alba, Acer campestre, Robinia pseudoacacia) growing in an old broadleaf deciduous forest in response to light variation within the tree crown was analyzed. Net photosynthetic rate (PN), leaf respiration rate (R) and the photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency were, on average, more than 100% higher in sun than in shade leaves. A. campestre and C. avellana sun leaves had the highest specific leaf area (SLA, 156.0 ± 17.9 cm2 g-1) and the lowest total leaf thickness (L, 101.9 ± 8.8 μm) underlining their shade-tolerance. Among the shade-intolerant species (Q. robur, P. alba and R. pseudoacacia), Q. robur had the lowest SLA and the highest L in sun leaves (130.6 ± 10.0 cm2 g-1 and 160.8 ± 9.6 μm, respectively) since shade-intolerant species typically have thicker leaves. The higher PN decrease in respect to R decrease from sun to shade leaves attested the higher sensitivity of PN than R to light variations within the crown. This determined a 69% lower R/PN in sun than in shade leaves. This result is further attested by the significant correlation between PN and the relative photosynthetic photon flux density. The shade-tolerant species have a 76% higher R/PN ratio than the shade-intolerant ones. The measured leaf phenotypic plasticity (PI = 0.35) was in the range of broadleaf deciduous species. Plasticity is a key trait useful to quantify plant response to environmental stimuli. It is defined as the ability of a genotype to produce different phenotypes depending on the environment. Among the considered species, Q. robur showed the highest PI (0.39) and P. alba the lowest (0.29). Knowledge on phenotypic plasticity is important in making hypotheses about the dynamics of the studied forest in consideration of environmental stress factors, including invasive species competition and global climate change.",

Diatom assemblages were regularly monitored in lowland lotic systems in Hungary (Central Europe) during the unusually dry year of 2012. Highly pronounced changes in diatom composition were observed from spring to autumn. Halophilic taxa (especially Nitzschia sensu lato species) appeared in the dry autumn. In addition, the total relative abundances of halophilic species also increased up to autumn. Abundance of Nitzschia cf. lorenziana and Nitzschia tryblionella showed a positive correlation with chloride and phosphate concentration, while that of other taxa like Tryblionella apiculata or Tryblionella calida showed a positive correlation with the concentration of nitrate. Our findings clearly demonstrated that these halophilic and mesohalophilic diatom taxa were sensitive indicators of even short-term changes in lowland lotic ecosystems, such as the increasing salt concentration from spring to autumn caused by the lack of rainfall and/or environmental loads.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Springs are unique but understudied habitats. Diatom communities have received some attention but have remained largely unknown in the south-western Alps. We therefore studied the springs of the south-western extreme of the Alpine mountain range. We analysed epilithic and epiphytic assemblages in 48 springs of different ecomorphological types, located on contrasting lithological substrata (carbonate/siliceous). Moreover, phytosociological relevés were carried out for carbonate springs. The diatom flora consisted of 223 taxa. Most (198) of the taxa were included in the Red List, and 12.5% belonged to threatened categories. Characteristic spring taxa (crenophiles) were present. The ecological preferences of crenophilous diatom species described in the eastern Alps were confirmed. Diatom species characteristic of the lake-littoral zone were found in pool springs. We observed no significant differences in species richness and diversity between epilithic and epiphytic assemblages, but some species showed a preference for bryophytes, and five occurred in the epibryon only. As regards moisture conditions, 15% of the taxa occurred on wet or temporarily dry sites, and 4% lived mostly outside water bodies. The main environmental factors influencing diatom assemblages were pH, conductivity, altitude, and shading. The carbonate-substratum crenic vegetation was composed of a mixture of vascular plants and bryophytes, which find their ecological optimum in springs. Bryophyte cover was dominant, with the most abundant taxa belonging to the genus Palustriella. The vegetation corresponded to the Cratoneuretum commutati association.",

High temperature significantly affected total proline, soluble protein content, membrane stability index (MSI), yield, and various yield components, and had a direct effect on growth and other physiological attributes of wheat at anthesis and the milky seed stages. The wheat cultivar AS- 2002 achieved better osmotic adjustment by accumulating more leaf proline. Higher MSI was also observed in AS-2002, as well as Inqalab-91. The anthesis growth stage was found to be more sensitive to heat stress than seed development at the milky stage. Overall heat stress reduced yield 75% at anthesis and 40% at the milky stage. AS-2002 performed better on the basis of yield and yield components. Seed weight per spike was highest in AS- 2002, and lowest in SH-2002. The cumulative response of AS-2002 was better on the basis of physiological and yield attributes. In addition to yield, plant breeders should also include proline and MSI as selection parameter in the breeding program for development of heat tolerant wheat cultivars. Most of the evaluated wheat cultivars/lines were developed for cultivation in the rainfed areas of Pakistan.",

Such biofilm formation, also known as fouling, is a complex multistage process and not yet thoroughly investigated. In this study, the succession of diatoms and bacteria was investigated during a one month exposure on an artificial substrate of plexiglass (polymer of methyl methacrylate) mounted above the seafloor at a depth of 5 m. For biofilm analyses, the fouling was investigated using selective agar plates, epifluorescence, light and electronic microscopy, as well as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analysis. During biofilm development, the abundance of all biofilm components increased and reached maximum values after a one month exposure. In the bacterial community, heterotrophic marine bacteria were dominant and reached 1.96 ± 0.79 × 10 4 colony forming units (CFU) cm -2 . Despite the fact that faecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci were detected in the water column, faecal coliforms were not detected in the biofilm and intestinal enterococci appeared after one month of exposure but in the negligible number of 60 ± 10 CFU cm -2 . The phototrophic component of the biofilm was dominated by diatoms and reached a concentration of 6.10 × 10 5 cells cm -2 , which was supported by pigment analysis with fucoxanthin as dominant pigment in a concentration up to 110 ng cm -2 . The diatom community was dominated by Cylindrotheca closterium and other pennate benthic diatoms. A detailed taxonomic analysis by electronic microscopy revealed 30 different taxa of diatoms. The study confirmed that a plexiglass surface in a marine environment is susceptible to biofouling within 30 days of contact. Furthermore, the co lonization process sequence firstly involved bacteria and cyanobacteria, and secondly diatoms, which together formed a primary biofilm in the sea.",

Furthermore, there was no germination in 1000 µM SA. The analysis of antioxidant enzymes revealed that although superoxide dismutase activity increased, catalase activity decreased in comparison to control. Besides, lipid peroxidation and peroxidase activity increased in 10 µM SA, whereas they decreased in higher concentrations. Similarly total chlorophyll content increased in 10 µM SA, but it decreased in 100 and 500 µM SA treatments. Moreover anthocyanins and carotenoids increased after SA treatment. In conclusion, exogenous SA application causes developmental and biochemical alterations in rye.",

Environmental variables comprised the daily course of the exposition to sun; and plant variables included the area of the tree crown, the height of the tree and geographical position of the tree in relation to sun exposition. Trees on the west bank of the islands at the SW-NE direction have the highest shading effect. The management of tree vegetationmight control incoming solar radiation affecting submerged macrophytes.",

The polyphenolic content and free radical scavenging activity of plants that had passed all stages of cultivation: micropropagation and rooting (in vitro), adaptation in greenhouse (ex vitro) and mountain conditions (in vivo) were evaluated. Four surface flavonoid aglycones [scutellarein 6-methyl ether (hispidulin), scutellarein 6,4’-dimethyl ether (pectolinarigenin), 6-OH luteolin 6-methyl ether and kempferol-6-methyl ether] were detected in the acetone exudates of the studied samples bymeans of thin layer chromatography.No differences in the accumulation of surface flavonoids were found among the tested leaf extracts of in vitro, ex vitro and in vivo samples. However, the extracts from the flowers were richer in surface flavonoids than extracts from the leaves. The methanol extracts of the samples from ex vitro and in vivo grown A. montana plants had significantly higher radical scavenging activity and polyphenolic content than the extracts of in vitro samples. The observed differences in the contents of these biologically active compounds were related to different growth conditions and stages of plant development. The biotechnological method of A. montana established holds promise for the future production of antioxidants.",

A distinction among substrates can be made by analysing the specific abundance and composition of diatoms on different substrates. In this study, 11 different artificial substrates were exposed to a marine environment for a period of 30 days. Abundance and taxonomic composition of periphytic diatoms was determined on each of the substrates and on shoots of the marine seagrass Posidonia oceanica. The aim was to compare diatom community structure on different newly colonized surfaces. On all surfaces examined, periphytic diatoms were the pioneering organisms with differences in quantitative and qualitative composition on the different substrates. Taxonomic analysis of diatom communities on the substrates examined revealed 41 diatom taxa, with the dominant genera Cylindrotheca, Amphora, Nitzschia, Cocconeis and Navicula. Given that all the examined artificial substrates were solid materials, differences in the abundance and species composition of diatoms found between the materials point to the substrates’ physical and chemical characteristics as a major influence on the final settling of diatoms. Knowledge from investigating the settlement of fouling organisms on anthropogenic substrates can have future use in management of waste materials that end up in the marine environment.",

The amplified sequences were cloned, sequenced and characterized. The coconut RGAs had high identity to monocot NBS-LRRs. A complete structural analysis and 3-D modeling of the NBS domain of coconut RGA was also undertaken. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the isolated coconut NBS-LRR class RGAs was expressed more in root (wilt) disease resistant genotypes than in susceptible ones.

Quantitative analysis showed that in April Achnanthidium minutissimum was dominant at each site, except at the fifth site, where Amphora pediculus was dominant. In July and September, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Achnanthidium pyrenaicum , Amphora pediculus , Denticula tenuis , Diatoma vulgaris , Gomphonema elegantissimum , Cocconeis pseudolineata and Cocconeis placentula var. lineata dominated. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to detect the major patterns of variation in species composition. The first DCA axis summarizes the distribution of the diatom community, mainly through temperature, conductivity, oxygen and water hardness gradient. The second DCA axis was weakly correlated with few variables. Based on the average values of the pollution sensitivity index (IPS), commission for economical community metric (CEE) and biological diatom index (IBD), the water of the Mlava River belonged to water class I during all three seasons. Values of the diatom-based eutrophication/pollution index (EPI-D) indicated class II water quality. According to calculated trophic diatom index (TDI) values, water of the Mlava River was characterized by intermediate nutrient concentrations during three seasons. Principal components analysis was used to represent the correlation between diatom indices, and the highest correlation among the selected diatom indices is seen between EPI-D, IPS and IBD.",

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was done for quantification of SMT gene transcript and it was normalized to actin gene. It was found that transcript level of callus tissues grown at 5.2 μM and 26.4 μM Se-enriched media was lower than that of the control callus. In contrast, a high level of Se (132.3 μM) in the medium caused an approximately 4.26 times higher level of SMT transcript in callus than the control. APX, POX, CAT and GR enzymes were all effected by different Se concentrations. While POX and APX activities were higher then control, CAT and GR activities decreased. These results show that an increase of SMT gene expression led to a rise in APX and POX, but a suppression of CAT and GR enzymes activities in Astragalus chrysochlorus. This suggests that Se could be involved in the antioxidant metabolism in Astragalus chrysochlorus.",

The Apulia Region occupies the south-easternmost part of the Italian peninsula; the land-use pattern is based on extensive agricultural systems and only 10% is covered by forests that are mainly composed of oak woods. It is the region in Italy showing the highest number of oak species, among which four putative species of the Quercus pubescens group, have been reported in floras and checklists with uncertain taxonomic value because of the overlapping of diagnostic characters. In this paper, we carried out a molecular analysis on natural populations of Q. pubescens s.l. distributed throughout the Apulian region. Individuals from 24 pubescent oak populations were sampled and each tree was genotyped at 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Overall, the average expected heterozygosity (He) was 0.629, and the allelic richness (Ar) ranged between 2.130 and 7.187. No differentiation was observed among the populations investigated, and the genetic differentiation coefficient (FST) was 0.036. Gene flow among populations was found to be relatively high (Nm = 6.664). From a taxonomic point of view, the possibility of the coexistence of more than one species among the Apulian pubescent oaks reported in the taxonomic and syntaxonomic literature is not supported by the results of this molecular analysis.",

In this context, ex vitro symbiotic seed germination and seedling growth of orchid seeds may be convenient and advantageous. In this study, both the diversity of the root endophytic fungi in Serapias vomeracea (Burm.f.) Briq. and the ex vitro effects of these fungi on seed germination, seedling development and tuber formation were revealed. The fungi were isolated monthly for two years from S. vomeracea roots and the isolates were identified based on morphological characters and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences. All of the Rhizoctonia-like isolates that joined the mycorrhizal association were closely related to Tulasnella calospora (thirty isolates). Non-Rhizoctonia isolates are closely related to Fusarium tricinctum (two isolates), Aspergillus spelaeus (one isolate) and Talaromyces pinophilus (Pezizales) (one isolate). The viability rate of the seeds was 90.32%. The seed packs were placed in soils containing fungus and the germination process was followed. All isolates associated with Tulasnella calospora promoted germination and seedling development. Isolate Svl 21 (Tulasnella sp.) was found to have the highest germination rate (98%) but isolate Svl 4 developed seedlings with advanced leaves (stage 4 (S4): seedlings with advanced leaves and/or rooted, 13.67%). All seedlings at S4 were transferred to the natural environment; the first tubers were observed seven months after.

Water samplings for physicochemical and biological variables were conducted fromMarch 2002 to November 2007 at three stations along the bay. The phytoplankton was dominated by diatoms throughout the year, with the minimum species diversity in summer and the maximum in autumn. A total of 100 diatoms were identified and classified according to their seasonal occurrence in the plankton; some were consistently present throughout the whole year, but a large fraction showed a distinct seasonal cycle. The inner two stations differed significantly in terms of phytoplankton biomass and nutrient content from the outer station, indicating a higher nutrient input in the inner part. The majority of the dominant diatoms recorded in this study prefer nutrient- enriched conditions. Due to the anticipated increase of human impact in the area, this study can serve as a base for future environmental studies in Lim Bay.",

Two levels of asparagine (5 and 10 mM) and glycerol (20 and 40 mM) were sprayed onto the leaves of maize seedlings 10 days after germination. Saline stress caused considerable decline in total dry mass, chlorophyll content and relativewater content in the maize plants. It increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and polyphenol oxidase as well as electrolyte leakage, but did not alter the activity of non-specific peroxidise. Foliar application of asparagine or glycerol was found to be effective in checking shoot growth inhibition under NaCl stress. Exogenously applied asparagine or glycerol reduced superoxide dismutase, non-specific peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities in salt-stressed maize plants compared to those not treated with these organic compounds. Salinity increased Na+ contents but reduced those of K + , Ca 2+ and P in the roots of the used genotype of maize. Foliar application of asparagine or glycerol increased the contents of K + , Ca 2+ and P, but it reduced that of Na+ in salt-stressed maize plants as compared to those of the salt-stressed plants not supplied with glycerol or asparagine. Glycerol was more effective than asparagine in improving salinity tolerance of maize plants in terms of growth and physiological attributes measured in the present study",

Cd treatment reduced shoot fresh mass more strongly in Mg-supplied than in Mg-deficient plants. Negative effect of Cd on photosynthetic activity was more pronounced in T. aestivum than in Z. mays plants. Cd treatment decreased leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid concentration in both Z. mays and T. aestivum, irrespective of the Mg supply. Cd was preferentially accumulated in the roots of both species. Catalase activity in T. aestivum leaves and roots was unaffected by Cd and Mg supply. Cd treatment did not affect Fe accumulation in the leaves of either species, while in the roots a considerable increase occurred, irrespective of the Mg nutrition. Higher tolerance of Z. mays and T. aestivum plants to Cd toxicity exposed to Mg deficiency could partly be ascribed to the preservation of Fe nutrition.",

This approach was selected to test the possibilities of using metabarcoding in studying marine cyanobacteria, exploring their ecology and potential as an indicator group in anthropologically stressed coastal environments. Additionally, physicochemical water column parameters, sediment granulometry and composition were assessed. Water column revealed a seasonal variation of amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) closely related to Cyanobium PCC-6307, Prochlorococcus MIT9313 and Synechococcus CC9902, as well as seasonal grouping of physico-chemical parameters in PCA analysis. Sediment analysis uncovered greater community richness of 13 cyanobacterial genera and two uncultured groups. The most abundant in sandy gravels and gravelly sand type of sediments were ASVs closely related to Pleurocapsa PCC-7319 and Xenococcus PCC-7305. Furthermore, identified cyanobacterial ASVs predominantly displayed similarity to isolates from tropical areas (e.g. Neolyngbya, Chroococcidiopsis, Trichodesmium, etc.), which could indicate the tropicalization process already ongoing in the fish fauna of the Adriatic Sea.",

This necessitates a comparison, by using suitable stress markers, of the newly created lines with some well-established varieties, which are stress tolerant or susceptible. Drought is one of the most frequently encountered stresses with deleterious effects on plant performance and crop yield. Winter wheat seedlings (soil cultures at 3–4th leaf stage) from one mutant line (M181/1338K), one drought-tolerant (Guinness) and one sensitive variety (Farmer) were subjected to severe drought stress by water withholding, followed by recovery. Changes in leaf protein profiles, the amount of Rubisco large subunit (RLS), some specific chloroplast proteins such as Rubisco binding protein (RPB), Rubisco activase (RA), the chaperone subunit clpA/C of clp protease, as well as the activities of exo- and endo-proteases were analyzed. At the protein level, some differences were found in the drought response of genotypes – stability of RLS and RBP in M181/1338K and Guinness, diminution of RLS and increase in RBP in Farmer. RA presented strong up-regulation at recovery in Guinness but decreased in content under drought in M181/1338K and Farmer. Increase in ClpA/C level was found in all compared varieties under stress. Strong increase in total proteolytic activity was detected under drought only in Farmer. Inhibitory analysis revealed a predominance of cysteine and serine protease types. Aminopeptidase activities remained higher at recovery in M181/1338K and Farmer. Results are discussed in terms of genotype-linked different stress coping strategies.",

    "abstract": "Extensive commercialization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) raises the risk of their accumulation in the soil-plant system. Once released into the environment, AgNPs are prone to chemical transformations, which make it hard to determine whether their phytotoxic effects are purely NP-related or a consequence of released Ag+ ions. In this study the effects of 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 μM AgNPs and AgNO3 on seed germination and early growth of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) seedlings were compared. Additionally, the effects on photosynthetic performance and pigment content were investigated. Germination rate and index values indicated delayed and slower germination in some AgNP treatments. Lower AgNP concentrations stimulated root growth, but induced a prominent reduction in fresh weight. By contrast, all AgNO3 concentrations inhibited root growth but only the higher ones decreased fresh weight. Obtained results imply that the observed AgNP toxicity could be ascribed to NP form and can be correlated with high AgNP stability in the solid medium. On the other hand, the majority of AgNP and AgNO3 treatments induced an increase in chlorophyll content that was accompanied by significantly lower values of relative electron transport rate and coefficient of photochemical quenching, implying an inhibition of the electron transport chain. A similar impact of AgNPs and AgNO3 on photosynthesis can be correlated with lower stability of AgNPs in a liquid medium, resulting in AgNP aggregation and dissolution of Ag+ ions.",

In the present paper we address several problems related to standardisation of DNA image cytometry, such as stability of the measuring system, linearity of optical density measure- ments, correction of uneven illumination of the field of view, and uniformity of integrated optical density measurement over the entire field of view. Furthermore, image processing procedures are described for mitigation of the effects of electronic noise (image averag- ing) and for densitometric calibration of the measuring system. We have developed a macro for plant DNA image cytometry, using a general image analysis software package. The described quality control procedures, adopted from international medical standards for diagnostic DNA image cytometry, were used during software development to test per- formance of our measurement system. Until a specific botanical consensus is reached, we recommend that the quality control standards for instrumentation described in the present paper are considered when DNA image cytometry is used for measurement of plant ge- nome size as well as for any other image analysis-related densitometric measurement based on light microscopy.",

The aims of this study were to obtain preliminary data about the species composition of the attached diatoms of these waters, to evaluate the impact of the pollution on epiphytic diatoms and to evaluate the natural protection value of these waters. Epiphyton of the Tisza River was dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum, Amphora pediculus, Cocconeis placentula, Diatoma moniliformis in February and by Achnanthidium minutissimum and several Nitzschia spp. in October. A number of teratological frustules were observed. In the Kiskore reservoir, Amphora pediculus, Cocconeis pediculus, C. placentula, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Gomphonema angustum, Nitzschia dissipata were dominant. In 1996 Staurosira, Staurosirella and Navicula species dominated in the oxbows, whereas in 2000 Aulacoseira distans, Achanthidium minutissimum and Nitzschia spp. became dominant. Based on results from the literature, we are of the opinion that the characteristic Achnanthidium minutissimum – Nitzschia spp. dominance of the Tisza River and the oxbows is partly due to the heavy metal pollution. A number of endangered species, two new elements for the Hungarian diatom flora – Navicula austrocollegarum and Navicula streckerae – and two probably invasive species, Diadesmis confervacea and Didymosphenia geminata were found.",

Diatoms were analyzed from the 'top' and 'bottom' of each core to reconstruct land-use changes in this area. Aulacoseira taxa were identified and evaluated with light and scanning electron microscopy. Results of these observations showed the presence of some variability of the morphological features within North American species populations. Diatom species composition in surface sediments and differences between tops and bottoms corresponded to changes in land use surrounding the lakes, ranging from predominantly forest and rangeland to urban and agriculturally impacted. Diatom-inferred past conditions revealed that the observed morphotypes probably represent taxa with different ecological preferences. The main factors influencing the variability of these morphotypes are changes in the trophic status of the lakes.",

Five habitat types were selected for the study: sand dunes (North Sinai and in Wady El-Natrun), gravel desert, coastal plain, and water runnels of a wadi bed (South Sinai and Eastern Desert). About 47.4% of the studied sites were subjected to high grazing pressure, 26.3% to moderate grazing pressure; the remaining 26.3% were subjected to low grazing pressure. Concentration of the nutrients (K, Na, Ca, P and Ca/P ratio) in the grazeable parts of P. turgidum populations exhibited insignificant variability between habitats and phytogeographical regions. Meanwhile, concentration of potassium showed significant variability between the phytogeographical regions. Ca/P ratio of the grazeable parts of P. turgidum was significantly related to the soil silt and organic matter content. The percentage of crude protein was higher than the minimum required for the maintenance of the grazing animals, i.e. P. turgidum has a good or excellent forage quality. Due to its high nutritive value and ease of cultivation, P. turgidum grains could be considered as a potential crop, which may serve as a supplementary food to the common cereals. It worth noting that the variation in the nutritive values among the cultivated populations was insignificant as all the cultivated populations had a high nutritive value, indicating the effect of edaphic factors on the wild population nutritive value which was proved also from the correlation between the edaphic factors and nutritive variable.",

Most of the soils were deficient in plant-available P, Zn, Mn, Fe, and B, while they were excessively supplied with Cu. Leaf analysis showed that most of the trees were sufficient in K, Mg, Mn and B, but deficient in N, P and Fe, and excessive in Zn and Cu. It was found that almost all the significant elemental interactions occurring in pistachio leaves or soils were synergistic, contributing considerable quantities of available nutrients and, therefore, improving the nutrient status of pistachio trees, and the level of soil fertility. On the other hand, the interactions between K and Mg in leaves, and between soil pH and leaf N or soil Fe, Mn and B, were antagonistic. It is suggested that these results must be taken into account during fertilization of pistachio trees, in order to avoid nutritional disorders and to promote plant growth, productivity and nut quality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The biodiversity of algal communities and environmental conditions were investigated in the springs of Mt. Konjuh. The assemblages of 20 springs emerging from different lithologies (limestones and ophiolites, respectively) comprised 234 algal taxa. Diatoms and cyanobacteria were the most species-rich groups. The most common alkaliphilic, circumneutral, and eutraphentic diatoms were represented by the genera Gomphonema , Nitzschia , Navicula , Cymbella , and Achnanthidium , and by the cyanobacterial genus Phormidium . Hierarchical clustering and SIMPROF analysis based on relative algal abundance clustered springs into six groups, separating them mainly according to spring type and lithology. Indicator species for groups and springs on different lithological substrata were singled out, revealing 33 taxa with preferences for ophiolites, and 20 taxa with preferences for carbonates. The values of the Shannon-Wiener diversity index were moderately high per spring location, and similar for the two groups of springs on different lithologies. A higher similarity in species composition was noted between springs on ophiolites and limestones than between springs on ophiolites and other types of siliceous substrata. The present study suggests that algal assemblages in springs emerging from ophiolites, even those made up by a preponderance of silicates, should be analyzed separately from those related to springs on other siliceous substrata. The results obtained showed that most of the springs studied are affected by anthropogenic impacts and morphological alterations leading to the dominance of highly competitive meso- and eutraphentic algal species, thus emphasizing the importance of further investigation and conservation of these habitats.",

Morpho-physiological changes were documented in all isolates, including lack of sporulation, depigmentation of conidiogenous apparatus and conidia, and presence of aberrant fungal structures. O. vulgare EO exhibited stronger anti-Aspergillus activity than Sanosil S003, as demonstrated by the higher MIC and MFC values and fewer morpho-physiological changes observed in the tested Sanosil S003 concentrations.

Although the modification of the agricultural landscape pattern is observed across Europe, both extensive and intensive agricultural landscapes still co-exist in Poland. The objective of the study was to examine the flora in field margins in intensively and extensively managed agricultural landscapes, located across three regions in SE Poland. The flora was compared with respect to species richness, diversity, and evenness indices. Detrended correspondence analysis was employed to characterise variation in species composition. Agricultural landscape type made a higher contribution than the topography or geology to species richness and composition in field margins. Field margins function as important habitats for general vascular plant species diversity and are useful for the conservation of rare, threatened, endangered or bee plants. A significant decline in species diversity was observed over a distance of 1000 m from the habitat elements. Plants growing on field margins are mainly perennials; however participation of annuals clearly increases in intensive landscapes. The participation of wind-dispersed species decreased in an open-spaced intensive landscape. Animal-dispersed plants predominated in an extensive landscape with forest islands. Irrespective of landscape type, native species predominated. However, these habitats create the biota and corridors for alien-invasive species as well.",

It is located within a national park, and is included in the Ramsar List of international important wetlands, so its preservation and protection from pollution is very important. The aim of this study was to investigate bioaccumulation of the ecotoxic metals Cd, Pb and Cr from sediments of Skadar Lake in the aquatic macrophyte Trapa natans L. Samples of sediment and plants were collected at nine locations covering all major water inputs to the lake as well as locations where contamination could be expected. The obtained results indicate that sediments from the Skadar Lake are only locally contaminated with Cd (0.03–1.18 mg kg −1 ), generally contaminated with Cr (15.8–180 mg kg −1 ), the concentrations of both elements frequently exceeding sediment quality guidelines, while concentrations of Pb were low (2.7–17.4 mg kg −1 ). The highest bioaccumulation of all metals from sediment to Trapa natans L. was observed in the root, with accumulation efficiency decreasing in the order Cd &gt; Cr &gt; Pb. Translocation from root to stem was also higher for Cd than for Cr and Pb, while the translocation from stem to leaf was comparable for all three metals. From the three investigated metals Cd showed the highest mobility. The results indicate that Trapa natans L. may be a very promising bioindicator of trace metal contamination in Skadar Lake.",

About 10 years after the first record of P. stratiotes, the number, abundance and biomass of indigenous and non-indigenous macrophytes as well as different abiotic parameters were measured. In that period, colonized sections (~94% of the oxbow lake) were completely covered with water lettuce, and the only reservoirs of indigenous macrophyte species were the non-colonized areas (6%). Research in 2011 found only a third of the previously recorded indigenous macrophytes, but then only in small section without P. stratiotes. Three of the species that disappeared were on the Red data list. In the colonized section a higher biomass was observed than in the non-colonized section because of high abundance of water lettuce which remained the only macrophyte. Due to the presence of P. stratiotes, the intensity of light penetrating into the depth and water circulation were reduced, as was the oxygen saturation of the water. In addition to the well documented vegetative propagation of P. stratiotes, a well-established and viable seed bank has been detected in the lake sediment and after winter floods also on lake banks. In the future, special attention should be given to the thermal water ecosystems in temperate climates since they can serve as stepping stones and recruitment centres for the establishment and spread of (sub-)tropical invasive species. Facing predicted climate change such local populations of invasive species can act as stepping stones for further dispersal.",

The present investigation highlights the effect of plant growth regulators like gibberelic acid (GA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) on the quality of bast fibres in A. esculentus. The fibre quality was best in GA 100 + NAA 50 gm L –1 treatment. Fibre macerate studies showed an increase in fibre length and the slenderness ratio was also high. The Runkel ratio for the above treated fibre was between 1 and 2 rendering it suitable for the textile industry. Proximate analysis of retted fibres revealed a lower moisture and ash content and an increase in wax content. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis registered a high crystallinity index. The physico-mechanical properties showed considerable improvement of fibre quality. Considering the above criteria, GA100 + NAA 50 gm L –1 treatment brought about advantageous changes for improving the quality of fibres. This study is significant in promoting the exploitation of a non-conventional bast fibre source for use in textile industry.",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution of surface sediment diatoms was analyzed using ArcGIS in the Round Loch of Glenhead, an acid upland lake in south-west Scotland. The assemblages were composed almost entirely of benthic species. Tabellaria quadriseptata was fairly evenly distributed across the loch but some species (Navicula madumensis, Brachysira brebissonii, Aulacoseira perglabra and Eunotia vanheurckii var 1) showed rather patchy distributions. Ordination analysis was performed to assess the influence of environmental and spatial variables on the diatom composition of the samples. Loss of ignition was significantly negatively correlated with redundancy analysis species axis 1 (r = â€“0.77), indicating the influence of substrate on the diatom assemblages. The positive relationship between theoretical bottom shear stress resulting from wind stress and redundancy analysis (r = 0.31) suggests wind stress also influences the spatial distribution of diatoms within the loch. Spatial variables [(principal coordinates of neighbour matrices (PCNM 1 and PCNM3) positively correlated with redundancy analysis axis 2], indicated that spatial variables, ignored in former studies, are a further influence on diatom distribution. Unique environmental and spatial variables explained 27.3% and 8.6% of diatom variability respectively. Environmental and spatial interactive variables combined explained 4.8% of variation. Although the pure contribution of spatial variables was only 8.6%, the study highlighted the importance of differences in the spatial distribution of different benthic diatom species in this upland lake.",

Compiling the host spectra of the various Cuscuta species based on herbaria, literature and our own observations, we can say that dodders infest at least 26% of the vascular flora of the country. In our study, the Hungarian Cuscuta species parasitised all plants that had a coverage of more than 25% in the sampling sites.We prepared a list of the most frequent host species for the parasites and revealed the importance of exclusive hosts. The results suggest that the habitat differences of the Cuscuta species can be responsible for the different host ranges. Furthermore, it was found that the reason why dodders parasitise plants from various life-forms in different proportions is not (only) the active host choice, but the characteristic features of the habitats.",

Pinus nigra was non-invasive, however R. pseudoacacia escaped from cultivation and invaded several vegetation types including pine plantations. It has recently been planned to cut P. nigra plantations and replace them by native tree stands, especially in nature reserves. The scattered presence of R. pseudoacacia specimens in pine stands might place constraints on planned tree replacement because of their vegetative resprouting and recolonization from an established seed bank. The aim of this study was to investigate the soil seed bank under the canopy of solitary R. pseudoacacia specimens found in P. nigra plantations. Altogether 250 soil samples were collected from the 0-6 and 6-12 cm soil layers under solitary Robinia trees of varying ages (with basal areas between 62.4 and 1089.3 cm2). Seeds were separated by sieving then scarified and germinated. Seed bank density ranged between 640 and 2285 seedsm-2 with an average distribution of 82.7% and 17.3% in the upper and lower soil layer, respectively. Total density of the seed bank and also the seed bank ratio of the lower soil layer increased with tree age. The accumulated seed bank of R. pseudoacacia should be considered in the careful planning of tree replacement operations in Pinus nigra stands.",

Differences in the diversity and density of the epiphytic metazoans were analyzed in relation to plant architecture (simple or complex stems), food resources (algae and detritus) and water characteristics (transparency and derived trophic state index). A significant negative correlation was found between detritus on plants as food resource, and diversity and density of epiphytic metazoans, indicating grazing of microphagous species. Rotifers dominated in diversity and density in the epiphyton on all habitats. Total density of metazoans, rotifers and copepods in epiphyton were significantly higher on Mentha in mesotrophic lake than on Iris in a eutrophic lake. We presume that macrophyte belt width and trophic state governed biotic interactions and consequently epiphytic assemblages more strongly than macrophyte architecture. However, a Mentha habitat showed a slightly higher density and diversity of epiphytic metazoans in relation to Iris at the same site, but these differences were not significant.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We have previously demonstrated that salt tolerance in cowpea could be associated with lesser impairments of the photosynthetic capacity. Taking into account that photosynthesis is the main sink for reducing power consumption, our central working hypothesis is that a salt-sensitive cultivar is more prone to suffer from oxidative stress. We analyzed the long-term effects of salt stress on oxidative damage and protection against reactive oxygen species in both leaves and roots of a salt-tolerant (Pitiúba) and a salt-sensitive (TVu) cowpea cultivar. Two salt treatments (0 and 75 mM NaCl) were applied to 10-day-old plants grown in nutrient solution for 24 days. Significant salt-induced oxidative damage as demonstrated via increases in malondialdehyde concentration were noted, particularly in leaves at the end of the experiment, although such damage was found earlier in Pitiúba. In salt-stressed plants, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased only in Pitiúba at 24 days from the start of salt additions (DSSA). In Pitiúba, catalase (CAT) was not significantly affected by the treatments, whereas in TVu its activity was dramatically lower in salt-stressed plants at 10DSSAonwards. In general salt stress led to significant increases, much more pronounced in ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), at the end of the experiment in both cultivars. In roots, salt-induced increases in enzyme activities were particularly noted at 24 DSSA, as found for SOD and APX in Pitiúba, CAT in TVu and GR and GPX in both cultivars. Therefore, in contrast to our expectations, the present results argue, to a great extent, against a functional link between salt stress tolerance and the expression of the antioxidant system. We also demonstrated that leaves and roots should be evaluated for a full assessment of whole plant acclimation to salt stress.",

High water levels are responsible for the linear spreading direction of E. nuttallii, E. nuttallii and E. canadensis show a wide range of morphological variation, which is characteristic of successful invaders. To show morphological variations of two Elodea species, the most important characters indicated in the literature were measured on 24 fresh collected samples from the seven sites in Croatia. In spite of some overlap in leaf length and width between the two Elodea species, the differences of all morphological traits except internode length are statistically significant. In E. nuttallii leaf width, length and internode length show a higher morphological variability as a result of the higher adaptive strategy to environmental parameters. The most reliable morphologi-cal characters distinguishing E. nuttallii and E. canadensis are leaf width 0.5 mm below the tip and the angle at the apex. E. nuttallii can be expected to spread to other areas of Croatia.",

Due this fact, the necessity of natural product discovery could provide important indications against several pharmacological targets and combat many infectious agents. Piper arboreum Aub. (Piperaceae) has been used by Brazilian traditional communities against several illnesses including rheumatism, bronchitis, sexually transmitted diseases and complaints of the urinary tract. Medicinal plants are a source of several remedies used in clinical practice to combat microbial infections. In this study, ethanol extract and fractions of Piper arboreum leaves were used to assay antimicrobial and modulatory activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using microdilution method of ethanol extract and fractions from the leaves of P. arboreum ranging between 8 and 1024 μg mL -1 . The capacity of these natural products to enhance the activity of antibiotic and antifungal drugs was also assayed. In these tests, natural products were combined with drugs. The natural products assayed did not demonstrate any clinically relevant antimicrobial activity (MIC ≥ 1024 μg mL -1 ). However, the modulation of antibiotic activity assay observed a synergistic activity of natural products combined with antifungal (such as nystatin and amphotericin B) and antibiotic drugs (such as amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin). According to these results, these natural products can be an interesting alternative not only to combat infectious diseases caused by bacteria or fungi, but also to combat enhanced resistance of microorganisms to antibiotic and antifungal drugs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cuscuta campestris is a holostemparasitic plant that obtains its resources from its hosts. Sweet basil is an important commercial plant, widely cultivated in many countries. It is a common host for C. campestris . Generally, C. campestris has negative effect on the growth of infected plants and its infestation is difficult to control. Therefore, environmental friendly control of C. campestris seems to be useful. In this work, the relationship between C. campestris and its host, sweet basil, and effects of κ-carrageenan on protection against C. campestris and suppression of its invasion were studied. Basil was sprayed with a solution of carrageenan at a final concentration of 1 g L −1 , once a week, 3 times in total. Infection of basil with C. campestris was performed 2 days after the last carrageenan treatment and the plants were collected two weeks after C. campestris attachment. In this study, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity (PAL), phenolic, flavonoids and antioxidant content increased remarkably in the basil plants parasitized with C. campestris , and therefore it seems that the parasitic plant induced a defense response in the host plants. Treatment with carrageenan significantly increased shoot length and leaf area of basil and decreased C. campestris infestation by about 26%. Carrageenan treatment caused a significant increase in PAL activity, phenols, antioxidant and lignin content in basil. Thus, the present observation suggested the phenylpropanoid pathway was activated and defense responses were stimulated. Our results showed that carrageenan spraying induced beneficial effects in plants, corresponding to growth stimulation and defense compound synthesis. Thus carrageenan treatment is recommended as a natural biostimulator for the protection of plants against C. campestris .",

    "abstract": "Plants, as sessile organisms, have evolved intricate mechanisms to adapt to various environmental changes and challenges. Because various types of stress trigger significant decrease in global translation rates we examined the stress-related expression of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), enzymes that participate in the first step of protein biosynthesis. We have analyzed promoters of genes encoding cytosolic seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), cytosolic aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) and cytosolic cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS) in Arabidopsis thaliana L., and examined SerRS, AspRS and CysRS gene expression in seedlings exposed to different abiotic stressors. Although global translation levels are repressed by stress, our results show that plant aaRSs expression is not decreased by osmotic, salt and heavy metal/cadmium stress. Moreover, during exposure to stress conditions we detected increased AspRS and CysRS transcript levels. SerRS gene expression did not change in stress conditions although participation of SerRS in stress response could be regulated at the protein level. Expression of the examined aaRS genes under stress correlated well with the length of their predicted promoters and the number of available binding sites for the stress related transcription factors. It thus appears that during stress it is important to keep steady state levels of aaRSs for translation of specific stress-related mRNAs and furthermore to rapidly continue with translation when stress conditions cease. Importantly, increased levels of plant aaRSs during stress may serve as a pool of aaRS proteins that can participate directly in stress responses through their noncanonical activities.",

The seeds were dehydrated in a sterile laminar flow cabinet for different exposure times and then they were directly immersed in liquid nitrogen. The critical point was to support the initial germination of cryopreserved seeds and this was achieved by the excision of zygotic embryos after liquid nitrogen treatment that allowed the seed germination. The best moisture content for tolerance to cryopreservation ranged from 15.8% (M. acuminata ssp. zebrina) to 17.1% (M. ornata) and the maximum post-cryopreservation germination rates varied from 86.4% (M. velutina) to 55.0% (M. ornata). All seedlings derived from seeds germinated after cryopreservation were easily rooted and acclimated to greenhouse conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study presents the first in-depth evaluation of the morphological and anatomical characters, as well as their taxonomic importance, of the seeds of 36 taxa in subgenera Muscari, Leopoldia, Pseudomuscari and Botryanthus of the genus Muscari in Turkey, where 24 of the taxa are endemic. The results indicate that the taxa generally differ from each other in terms of seed shape and dimension. Seed dimensions vary between 1.66 mm and 3.21 mm in length, and between 1.12 mm and 2.63 mm in width. The seed surface ornamentation is grouped into nine forms: ruminate, reticulate, reticulate-areolate, reticulate-foveate, alveolate, scalariform, rugose, verrucate and areolate. The most common type is ruminate, while areolate, reticulate-foveate and scalariform ornamentation forms were found to be taxon-specific. Testa structures of the taxa examined consist in general of two different layers: the epidermis and the subepidermis in scleranchymatous or parenchymatous structures. The subepidermis may be absent in some of taxa. The structure and thickness of the epidermis and the subepidermis are very important characteristics that disclose interspecific relations among the examined taxa. We also provide a key for the identification of the studied taxa based on seed features.",

For each of the eleven species, an identification key and a clustering phenogram for the fifteen major pollen features have been created.

In both needle generations all measured pigments were reduced in dust-exposed needles compared to needles harvested from areas not polluted by cement dust. This was due to deceleration of the biosynthetic processes rather than degradation of pigments. Chlorophyll b content appeared to be more sensitive than chlorophyll a in current-year needles while in previous-year needles chlorophyll a was more affected. Total carotenoids needed a longer period of time to reach nearly the same level as in controls. The progression of pigment decline in previous-year needles appeared not to be dramatically accelerated.

Some architectural parameters of leaves have a significant relation with carbon assimilation and water-use characteristics. In all the studied taxa, photosynthesis is positively correlated to stomatal frequency and the amount of mesophyll tissue, while an inverse relation exists with stomatal size. Similarly, transpiration and stomatal conductance directly correlate to the abundance of stomata, but reciprocate to their size. Cuticle thickness is inversely related to transpiration, but hardly any relation was noticed with the rate of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. The amount of mesophyll tissue has a direct relation with carbon assimilation, while its effect upon transpiration and stomatal conductance seems to be insignificant.",

The regeneration of maximum number of shoots, axillary branches and shoot buds from the excised cotyledonary nodes and their corresponding requirements for BAP differed across varieties, which might be due to variation at their genotypic levels.

In total, 287 vascular plant species were recorded. The life-form distribution was found to be similar to that of the regional species pool, with high percentages of therophytes (38%) and phanerophytes (13%). In the chorological spectrum the Mediterranean floristic element prevailed (44%), while alien species were 8% of the flora. The phytosociological spectrum showed a high diversity of characteristic species from the class Stellarietea mediae or its subordinate syntaxa (26%), and in particular from the order Thero-Brometalia (Mediterranean, sub-nitrophilous annual communities). Species from forest syntaxa had a relatively high diversity (9%). These results suggest that the ecological filtering provided by the Mediterranean regional climate controlled species assemblage even in a completely artificial habitat, preventing floristic homogenization: the flora of the studied railway section is only partially »ruderalized«, while it keeps strong links with the regional (semi-) natural plant communities. However, in contrast to what is observed in central and north Europe, the railway sides studied in the present paper do not seem to represent a refugial habitat for rare species from grassland communities, mainly because in Italy semi-natural dry grasslands are still widely represented.",

Young microspores had a spherical and centrally located nucleus with one or two nucleoli, many spherical lipid bodies and starchy plastids. A mature pollen grain contains insoluble polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and calcium. The mature pollen had the following morphological characteristics: 3-zonocolporate, prolate, tectate (imperforate) type of exine and perforate type of structure. The intine formed an important constituent portion of the wall, and consisted two sublayers: an outer intine (exintine) and an inner intine (endintine). The well-defined exine was made up of lipoidal substances and protein, but the intine composed of insoluble polysaccharides and protein. The bicellular state of the pollen grains persisted to anthesis.",

Depending on the type of the experiment, duckweed is cultivated on different nutrient media under various chamber conditions. In our work, duckweed was cultivated on Pirson-Seidel’s nutrient solution supplemented with 5, 7.5 or 10 g L -1 sucrose under cool white (CW) or Gro-Lux (GL) light sources. When different light sources and sucrose supplies are compared, a significant stimulative effect of GL light on duckweed grown on 7.5 and 10 g L -1 sucrose was seen to start on day 9. Considering photosynthetic performance the results showed that there were no significant differences in maximum quantum yield of PSII (F v /F m ) after 7 and 16 days of exposure, regardless of light source and sucrose supply. Effective quantum yield of PSII (Φ PSII ) decreased only after 16 days of exposure to 5 g L -1 sucrose under CW light. The higher growth rate and photosynthetic performance in plants exposed to GL light is a consequence of its spectral distribution resembling the action spectrum of photosynthesis. Furthermore, enhanced growth noticed in plants cultivated on higher sucrose contents (7.5 and 10 g L -1 ) indicated the promotive effect of sucrose in plants grown under low light conditions.",

However, only the roots of young sporophytes growing on soil and bricks harboured arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The AM morphology conformed to the intermediate type with intracellular hyphal coils, arbusculate coils and intercellular hyphae. No AM fungal spores could be retrieved from the soil on which gametophytes and young sporophytes were growing. The observations in this study support the idea that the septate fungal endophytes could confer an ecological advantage on colonized individuals, especially on nutrient deficient substrates.",

The present paper shows for the first time the results of micromorphological, anatomical, and ultrastructural analyses of floral nectaries in Aesculus hippocastanum. We have also described the forage and signal attractants of these flowers, which are important for the ecology of pollination. Using light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy, we demonstrated that the A. hippocastanum nectary forming a lobed disc is histologically differentiated into the epidermis with stomata, nectariferous parenchyma, subglandular parenchyma, and vascular bundles reaching the basal part of the nectariferous parenchyma. The use of histochemical assays revealed the presence of insoluble polysaccharides, lipids, terpenoids, and polyphenols including coumarins in the nectary tissues. Nectar is exuded onto the nectary surface via stomata and the permeable cuticle. As indicated by the observation of the ultrastructure of the nectary cells, transport of pre-nectar into parenchymal cells may proceed via the symplast and apoplast. We have also demonstrated that nectar transfer outside the protoplasts of parenchymal cells has a character of granulocrine secretion. A. hippocastanum flowers produce nectar abundantly; one flower secreted on average 2.64 mg of nectar and the concentration of sugars in the nectar was 33%.",

Medium supplemented with 1.5 mg L −1 BAP was found optimum for shoot induction from the explants and 6.4±0.69 shoots were regenerated from each node with 97% response. Shoots were further proliferated maximally (228±10.3 shoots per culture bottle with 7.5±0.43 cm length) on MS medium augmented with 1.0 mg L −1 each of BAP and Kin within 4–5 weeks. The shoots were rooted in vitro on half strength MS medium containing 2.0 mg L −1 indole-3 butyric acid (IBA). The cloned shoots were pulse-treated with 300 mg L–1 of IBA and cultured on soilrite® in a greenhouse. About 96% of the IBA-pulsed shoots rooted ex vitro in soilrite®, each shoot producing 12.5±0.54 roots with 5.1±0.62 cm length. The ex vitro rooted plantlets showed a better rate of survival (92%) in a field study than in vitro rooted plantlets (86%). A comparative foliar micromorphological study of H. enneaspermus was conducted to understand the micromorphological changes during plant developmental processes from in vitro to in vivo conditions in terms of variations in stomata, vein structures and spacing, and trichomes. This is the first report on ex vitro rooting in H. enneaspermus and the protocol can be exploited for conservation and large-scale propagation of this rare and medicinally important plant.",

The inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis was carried out for five heavy metals, namely Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. The particulate matter deposition was observed to be the highest in Ficus benghalensis (1.14 mg kg −1 ), while it was found to be the lowest in Bauhinia variegata (0.71 mg kg −1 ). The present study revealed that the accumulation of heavy metals in plants inversely varies with the deposition of dust on the surface of leaves. The tolerant species of plants can serve as natural biofilters that can alleviate environmental pollution to certain extent.",

Thirty-eight morphological characters related to the branches, prickles, leaves and corymbs were measured on the collected accessions to study the phenotypic diversity among and within species. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses (PCA and HCA) separated rose accessions into two distinctive groups and eight subgroups. A taxonomic interpretation of the morphological variability has shown that Tunisian rose populations belong to two sections (Synstylae and Caninae) of the genus Rosa. Moreover, they have been identified as seven separated taxa: R. sempervirens L., R. sempervirens var. submoshata Rouy., R. sempervirens var. prostrata Lindl. belonging to Synstylae section and R. canina L., R. agrestis Savi., R. micrantha Smith. and R. dumetorum Thuill. belonging to Caninae section. PCA and HCA proved that morphological characters used in taxonomic identification such as styles form, leaf and leaflets length, number of flowers by corymb, leaflet serration, presence of glands in leaflet, peduncle, receptacle and sepal have a high value of discrimination, and have been very successful in morphological identification.",

The relationship between disturbances of membrane functionality and the production of superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and cell viability after the exposure of roots to Ni 2+ was also studied. Treatments with 0.1-5 mmol L -1 NiCl 2 induced a concentration-dependent transient PM depolarization, which was recovered to the initial resting potential within 50-70 min in the presence of Ni 2+ . Longer (up to 24 h) exposure of roots to 1 mmol L -1 of Ni 2+ hyperpolarized the E M by approximately 17 mV. Application of the highest 5 mmol L -1 concentration of Ni 2+ during longer treatments (up to 48 h) resulted in the increase of membrane permeability; however the E M , cell viability, and superoxide content remained unaffected. The increase in the formation of hydrogen peroxide was time- and concentration- dependent and maximum production was recorded after 180 min of Ni 2+ treatment. We can conclude that oxidative stress resulting from an imbalance in the generation and/ or removal of hydrogen peroxide in the root tissues of grapevine was the major cause of Ni 2+ toxicity.",

In this study, the genetic relationship of seven Turkish olive cultivars was investigated using non-coding trnL-F regions in chloroplastic genome. Cultivars demonstrated a similar sequence length of 330-340 bp with an average 35.26% G+C content. Variable (polymorphic/segregating), parsimony informative and total numbers of the insertion or the deletion of bases in the DNA (indel sites) were 4, 3, and 28, respectively. Nucleotide diversities π and θ were found as 0.00631 and 0.00644 respectively, while Tajima’s D was −0.786. cpDNA trnL-F regions of sequenced Turkish olive cultivars had a low level of genetic variations, and these non-coding regions were strictly conserved in all analyzed cultivars. Geographically distant shared more sequence similarities than relatively close cultivars. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that the biogeographic distribution of cultivars does not demonstrate any association inferring cultivar source. These results indicate the possibility of germplasm exchanges among countries or that some indel mutations contribute to variations of the Turkish olive gene pool. Thus, the authorities should develop the necessary programs to preserve the purity of native germplasms.",

However, boundaries have been examined mainly on fine scales (between communities) and on coarse scales (between biomes), while boundaries of intermediate scales (e.g. between community complexes) are quite neglected. In this study, we analysed boundaries between mesic and xeric community complexes in a sub-Mediterranean karst area of South Hungary. We applied the moving split window (MSW) technique for boundary analysis. First, since the behaviour ofMSWconcerning complex vegetation patterns is not fully understood, we prepared artificial datasets (simulated communities) to test its capacities. Second, we established north-south oriented belt transects across mountain ridges of the Villány Mts, and investigated the transition between the community complexes of differently exposed slopes. UsingMSW, we were able clearly to distinguish between transitional zones and zones that do not represent real transitions: peaks in the Z-score profile of MSW merge only in the case of transitional zones. Moreover, we found that peaks merge depending on the independence (distinctness) of the transitional zone: when it is distinct, peaks merge only at the largest window widths. In the Villány Mts, transitions seem to occur mostly in the grasslands north of the ridges. We demonstrated that these grasslands can be regarded as boundaries between mesic and xeric complexes or as zones in their own right, with their own two boundaries. Interpretation depends upon the scale of observation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Rogoznica Lake marine system is a small, karstic, naturally eutrophic and euxinic marine environment. Abundance and temporal distribution of phytoplankton was investigated in relation to environmental conditions in the period from 1998 to 2013. The 36 determined diatoms contributed 90% of the total phytoplankton abundance. The diatom composition is characterized by low species diversity and high single species abundance (up to 107 cells L -1 ). There were, on average, 2.6 diatom species per sample (maximum 14 diatom species per sample) reflecting extreme environmental conditions. Dominant diatoms Thalassionema nitzschioides, Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana, Dactyliosolen fragilissimus and Chaetoceros curvisetus occurred repeatedly and were alternately dominant in the lake during the whole research period. Some diatoms were dominant only in limited period, like Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana (evident since 2001), and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (evident in the period 2002 to 2009). It appears that the interplay of environmental conditions such as variability in thermohaline and redox conditions, nutrient and reduced sulphur concentration influence the phytoplankton development and abundance in the lake.",

    "abstract": "This paper is aimed at investigating leaf morphological variability and possible hybridization between two species within the Rosaceae family: the one-seed hawthorn ( Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) and the almond-leaved pear ( Pyrus spinosa Forssk.). These two genera are taxonomically related and meet many prerequisites for successful hybridization between them, which prompted us to investigate the possibility of the presence of a long-described yet uninvestigated hybrid called × Pyrocrataegus . The research was conducted along the Eastern Adriatic coast, where both species are widespread and often grow together in open woodlands, forest edges and abandoned agricultural areas. The examination of morphological variability was based on a morphometric analysis of seven populations using ten phenotypic traits of leaves. In general, our results showed great variability of leaf morphological traits within and between the studied populations, as well as a clear differentiation between the two species. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed a few intermediate individuals between the two species, indicating possible hybridization. However, as heteroblasty is present in P . spinosa , with its seedlings reported to have lobed, hawthorn-like leaves, dimorphism could also result from the reappearance of juvenile leaves on adult trees by means of rejuvenation. In order to draw a definitive conclusion about the existence of hybrid individuals in the next study, DNA markers and a much larger sample, especially morphologically intermediate individuals per population should be included.",

    "abstract": "In a rapidly changing environment, habitat loss and fragmentation have primarily led to a decline in the numbers of numerous plant species. We compared the genetic variability of two small, isolated populations of Linnaea borealis L. with three populations from the core distribution area in the boreal region. The results show three main clusters, exemplars from the boreal distribution area being represented in all three clusters. The genetic variability within the two isolated Eastern-Southeastern Alpine populations was found to be very low, while genetic variability between them was very high. In addition, a low proportion of different genotypes was revealed in the Eastern-Southeastern Alpine populations as compared to the northern population. The high genetic variability between the two isolated Eastern-Southeastern Alpine populations indicates that most likely both are glacial relict populations, probably due to consecutive bottlenecks and long-term isolation under specific environmental conditions. Glacial relicts, which tend to be associated with endangered habitats, deserve urgent attention, especially when the recent anthropogenically-driven environmental crisis is considered.",

This paper aims to extend the knowledge of the distribution and ecology of G. reginae-olgae in Croatia and the northwestern Balkans. A field study in 2023 revealed as many as 35 populations in southern Croatia, some of them counting up to 100.000 individuals. Most of the populations exhibit semi-sciophilic behaviour within transitional habitats (ecotones) from insolated grassland to shaded eu- and sub-Mediterranean thickets and forests, and are found in the altitudinal range from sea level to 664 m a.s.l., at an average distance of 5.44 km from the coastline. Analysis of the bioclimatic variables reveals that the populations studied find an optimum in Mediterranean conditions with a mean annual air temperature of 14.61 °C and mild winters. The annual precipitation is high, exceeding 1600 mm, although it is limited to the winter period. The analyses of the temperature data provided insight into the environmental conditions that might serve as triggers for the initiation and duration of anthesis. In view of the the observed leaf length and flowering time, the populations are designated G. reginae-olgae subsp. vernalis Kamari. Since the Croatian populations are sparsely scattered along the northern limit of the species’ distribution on the Balkan Peninsula, future research should investigate the adaptability of this species to habitat and climate changes in the eastern Mediterranean region.",

Today, the vast species diversity of diatoms can only be estimated, but the taxa that have been explored over the years are stored in collections that represent an important resource for modern taxonomy, phylogeny and evolution, ecology, paleoecology, biogeography, phylogeography, applied biology, monitoring and conservation. The Croatian National Diatom Collection (HRNDC) was established in 2018 on the basis of long-term work by Croatian algologists. Today it represents a collection of 2883 permanent specimens that store valuable information on the diatom biodiversity of all waterbodies and store important holotypes, isotypes and paratypes of described new species for science. The future brings the challenge of keeping the collection sustainable, digitalized, and more accessible to the scientific community as well as capable of meeting the challenge of the omics era.

    "abstract": "One of the key factors affecting plant survival and agricultural yield production is temperature. The magnitude of temperature extremes is increasing as a result of global climate change. The present study evaluated the impact of elevated temperature treatments on Brassica rapa seed germination, as well as of prolonged exposure of seedlings to temperatures of 37 °C and short-term exposure to the temperature of 45 °C. Elevated temperatures reduced seed germination rate and affected germination pattern. Both applied heat stresses negatively affected seedling development and root growth, and showed a differential physiological and molecular response. Under prolonged exposure to 37 °C seedling growth and development patterns were impaired but with no sign of oxidative stress, which could be related to increased indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid, enhanced heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and reduced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate levels. The short-term exposure to a temperature of 45 °C, a treatment mimicking a heat wave event, had more negative effects on seedling growth, which correlated with the appearance of oxidative stress. The extreme temperature significantly stimulated the gene expression of heat stress transcription factors HSFs and dehydration-responsive element-binding protein DREB2A , and induced the accumulation of auxin IAA and HSP90 proteins. Our study confirms the great importance of phytohormones and HSP90 in the heat stress response of B. rapa and emphasizes the potential for their manipulation in phytoprotection and breeding programs for adaptation to climate change.",

Diverse filamentous cyanobacteria due to their ability to add nitrogen and organic carbon to soil and to maintain the physical properties of soil are undoubtedly one of the important groups of cyanobacteria. The present study aimed to understand the diversity of filamentous cyanobacteria (both heterocystous and non-heterocystous) obtained from saline/alkaline soils of Uttar Pradesh, India. Fuzzy cluster analyses of 47 filamentous cyanobacteria based on their cellular dimensions showed high inter-generic diversity among heterocystous cyanobacteria while in non-heterocystous cyanobacteria both inter- and intra-generic diversity was observed. The results of the present study indicated that the dimensions of vegetative cells and heterocysts can be useful for the identification and differentiation of cyanobacteria belonging to Hapalosiphon and Lyngbya. Physiological characterization also revealed a great deal of variation (5-15%) in salinity tolerance. Multiplex HIP fingerprinting revealed a higher genetic diversity in heterocystous (12-76% similarity) than in non-heterocystous cyanobacteria (13-90% similarity). Heterocystous cyanobacteria like Aulosira laxa O. Kirchner ex Bornet &amp;amp; Flahault, Hapalosiphon sp. and Nostoc sp. showed high intra-generic variability while among the non-heterocystous ones, Lyngbya was found to be genetically highly heterogeneous. The results of the present study highlight the importance of morpho-physiological and genetic analyses in deciphering the diversity of filamentous cyanobacteria for the understanding of their population structure, ecology and adaptations.",

Although the allelopathic activities of phenolic compounds are well-documented, the allelopathic effects of pyrogallol under heavy metal stress remain poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of PG on oxidative stress indicators, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant responses, and leaf gas exchange parameters in maize ( Zea mays L.) seedlings under arsenic (As) stress. The combined treatment with PG and As led to a significant 5-fold increase in arsenic accumulation compared to treatment with As alone. This application also caused excessive oxidative stress, which exceeded the antioxidant system’s capacity. Although the application of PG or As alone enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes, their combined application suppressed these enzymes, reducing total antioxidant capacity. Similarly, the combination of PG and As caused a significant decline in photosynthetic performance, further disrupting redox balance and physiological stability. These findings reveal the synergistic toxicity of PG and As, which severely impair plant metabolism. In As-contaminated soils, phenolic compounds like PG may intensify oxidative stress, influencing plant physiology, depending on the concentration. This study underscores the importance of careful management of phenolic compounds in agricultural systems exposed to heavy metal pollution.",

J.D.Sauer, native to North America and a major weed of agricultural fields and riparian habitats, was discovered on the banks of the Tagus (Tejo) River in the late summer of 2024, apparently for the first time in Portugal. The species occurs here in exceptionally large numbers, with probably tens of thousands of plants, and in numerous locations on the sandy and gravelly banks of the river in the Ribatejo area, roughly between Azambuja and Azinhaga, over a distance of about 60 kilometers. It may also occur further upstream, where no prospecting has been carried out but where suitable habitats are also available. Considering its current distribution and the number of plants observed, the species has either been present in the region for a long time but has been overlooked (although no older observations could be found on e.g. GBIF or iNaturalist, not even under other amaranth species names), or it is indeed a recent introduction that is spreading very rapidly. However, it can certainly be considered an invasive species. Here, the current naturalized range of the species in Europe and the Mediterranean area is critically reevaluated. Although the species is known from relatively many countries, it is currently only naturalized with certainty in Israel, Italy, Croatia, Serbia and now Portugal. The species is described and illustrated and a local distribution map is presented; notes on its ecology are also given.",

The species was observed in 2024 along the route between the cities of Heraklion and Agios Nikolaos, i.e. over a distance of more than 60 kilometers. Research into the presence of the species in Crete revealed that it was also known to occur on the western side of the island (Chania area) from 2020 onwards. Given the relative extent of the species’ local distribution area, it appears that the species is either a recent, very rapidly expanding weed, or that it has been overlooked for several years. It is especially alarming that the species is currently still being planted in new green areas, both public and private, and is therefore apparently still available for sale in the local horticultural trade, despite EU regulations.

    "abstract": "Ship ballast water discharged by vessels into the receiving port is recognised today as an important vector for the spread of non-indigenous species and facilitates the introduction of potential invasive species. Here, we report on 18 species (of about 30 identified), both vegetative cells and spores, of the diatom genus Chaetoceros Ehrenberg found in ballast water collected from ships arriving at Canadian ports on the West Coast (WC), East Coast (EC) and the Great Lakes (GL). We found live, vegetative Chaetoceros cells (one of the most abundant taxa) in 49% of the 57 ballast water samples. The highest density of viable spores enumerated in our counts was 414 cells L –1 . In 62% of 52 samples examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Chaetoceros spores were found, though fewer live, identifiable spores were found using light microscopy. Three reportedly harmful species, C. convolutus, C. danicus, C. debilis were encountered in WC samples, and additionally, C. cf. hispidus, a species not yet reported from Canada. C. ceratosporus and C. cf. subsecundus, to date reported only from the EC of the USA, now have been transported to the port of Vancouver, British Columbia. Our findings contribute to the assessment of the effectiveness of ballast water treatment via water exchange, and serve to evaluate the diversity of diatom vegetative cells and spores transported in ballast water tanks.",

The main source of betanin is a red beet (Beta vulgaris L.), the yield depending on abiotic and biotic factors in the field. Sugar beet cells, transformed by a wild strain B6S3 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, strongly produce betanin and could be a stable production source. With the aim of enhancing the yield, cell suspensions were initiated from friable calli. Biomass accumulation, betanin content and yield were monitored over 21 days in relation to changes of sucrose concentration, modifications of minerals in nutrient medium, and the usage of elicitors. Results showed that elevating sucrose levels from 3% to 4%, 5%, or 6% (w/v) in the original medium strongly induced biomass accumulation followed by an increase in betanin yield of up to 250%. Modification of minerals in the medium additionally increased betanin yield up to 20% in a few instances: 40 mg L –1 was recorded at day 10 with 5% and 6% of sucrose. The highest yield at 53 mg L –1 was reached at day 21 on 4% Suc, again with the modified medium. High sucrose concentrations positively affected betanin accumulation only during lag phase of the cell suspension, but afterwards the trend reversed. Calcium and yeast extract were used as abiotic and biotic elicitor, respectively, in the early exponential phase of subculture (day 7). Calcium ions (at 10 fold higher concentration than in the control) failed to increase betanin yield as well as yeast extract at 0.25% (w/v). Yeast extract at 1.25% provoked excretion of betanin at day 4, and cell necrosis at day 7 after elicitation. Taken together, in our system, sucrose affected betanin yield more strongly than medium modifications or elicitors. Yeast extract could be used for reverse-sequestration of betanin where the cells can be used over an extended period.",

The relevé selection focused on the Arrhenatheretalia order but its transitions towards other types were also included. The groups of relevés are delimited and described according to differential, dominant and constant species. Ecological conditions of the groups were compared using indicator values. Nine groups were distinguished, four of them belonging strictly to the order Arrhenatheretalia . Each alliance of Arrhenatheretalia presented in the study area ( Cynosurion, Arrhenatherion ) was represented by two groups. Groups from these two alliances are separated along a light gradient, while groups of the same alliance differ in nutrient values. Within Cynosurion , the nutrient-poor group cannot be identified unambiguously as any syntaxa previously known from Hungary. The nutrient-rich Cynosurion meadows are similar to Lolio-Cynosuretum , however, they show a stronger relationship with wet meadows. Within Arrhenatherion, Pastinaco-Arrhenatheretum is recognised as a hay meadow of nutrient-rich soils. The other meadow type is similar to Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum , thus raising syntaxonomical problems. There are transitional groups towards semi-dry andwet meadows, one dynamic phase and one outlier group among the other five clusters.",

We have considered the potential effects of diversity in plant-community attributes as well as variations in the pollen and energy amount on the abundance and frequency of insect visitors to the Lamiaceae species Salvia pratensis L., S. verticillata L., Thymus serpyllum L., Betonica officinalis L. syn.

We found significant inter-species, inter-habitat, and inter-year disparities in the pollen mass and total energy amount per unit area. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the blossom cover, species richness, and diversity noted at the plant community level significantly influenced the distribution of insect visitors to Lamiaceae species. The pollen caloric value and pollen abundance (but not the protein content in the pollen) had a considerable impact on the abundance and frequency of honeybees, bumblebees, and solitary bees in Lamiaceae flowers. Butterflies, beetles and flies did not respond to these factors. The model including all variables explained 66.4% of the observed variance. The studied Lamiaceae species, due to abundant flowering and good pollen nutritional value should be considered in the protocols to improve food resources, especially for social bees; however, disparities in pollen quantity and energy amount should not be ignored.",

For vegetation classification and for describing the relationships between vegetation and environment, traditional Braun-Blanquet methods and multivariate analysis techniques were used. The vegetation mainly consisted of subalpine grasslands and coniferous cushion scrubs. Caricetea curvulae and Astragalo microcephali-Brometea tomentelli were found to be dominant syntaxa in the vegetation of the study area. Land topography, soil physical and chemical factors and species richness have important impacts on the development of subalpine vegetation according to the results of multivariate analysis. Three associations and two subassociations were newly determined and classified. Hemicryptophytes, chamaephytes and geophytes participated in the floristic composition of these syntaxa. EUNIS habitat code and names for described syntaxa were also proposed.",

The results showed that CAB-6P plants are very sensitive to salinity stress because their growth and leaf chlorophyll concentration were both affected negatively from the 3 rd and 5 th day, respectively, after incurring salinity stress. Since root growth was suppressed more severely than shoot growth, the shoot to root ratio was significantly increased under saline conditions. The concentrations of Na in leaves and stem of NaCl-treated plants were much lower than those measured in roots, suggesting Na exclusion mechanism from the shoot. The opposite trend was observed for Cl, indicating Cl inclusion mechanism to leaves. As regards the concentrations of Ca, Mg, P, K, Na, Fe, Zn and Mn, they were not changed in higher salinity conditions, apart from K, concentrations of which in leaves and roots were significantly increased and decreased, respectively (K translocation to leaves). Salinity further reduced K/Na ratio in root and stem as well as leaf water and osmotic potentials, whereas leaves of control and NaCl-treated plants presented similar turgor potential and K/Na ratio. These data add very important information to our knowledge about the physiological events occurring in sour cherry plants after even short-term exposure to salinity.",

O. Schwarz and G. punctata Lapeyr. In order to consider possible environmental influences on the production of specialized metabolites, each species, except G. alypum , was collected from three different natural populations. Great variations in the amounts of specialized metabolites were observed among different plant parts and species. For example, total phenolic content ranged from 10.13 ( G. punctata , flowers) to 44.90 ( G. cordifolia , flower stems) mg gallic acid equivalent g −1 dry weight. Moreover, great differences, attributed to location-specific environmental factors, were observed among different populations of the same species. For example, a strong positive correlation was observed among mean monthly temperatures and total phenolic contents in the leaves of studied Globularia spp. (r = 0.75, p = 0.019). However, despite these differences, all species were rich in bioactive substances when compared to G. alypum , especially in their aerial parts. A very good positive correlation was observed between total phenolic content and DPPH radical scavenging capacity (r = 0.86, p &lt; 0.001)/ABTS radical scavenging capacity (r = 0.83, p &lt; 0.001). The results obtained show that G. cordifolia , G. meridionalis and G. punctata are rich in bioactive substances, providing support for their pharmaceutical utilization.

The floral reward is attractive to a variety of insect visitors (honey bees, wasps, flies and butterflies). The season of blooming as well as the total sugar yield (25.4 – 47.4 kg ha −1 ) and pollen yield (57.8 – 212.7 kg ha −1 ) indicate that H. tuberosus is important in the enhancement of food resources for pollinators. The generative reproduction in H. tuberosus is impaired (the species does not set seeds/fruits). However, due to its attractiveness for a variety of pollinators in both rural and urban areas, the spread of H. tuberosus should be monitored. Moreover, its propagation needs to be attended with restrictions.",

In the present study we compared growth characteristics, photosynthetic pigments content and photosystem II (PSII) performance in Lemna minor L. grown in two different irradiation regimes: low light (LL) – 50 μmolPHOTONS m-2 s-1 and high light (HL) – 500 μmolPHOTONS m-2 s-1. The main goal was to investigate the photosynthetic regulatory mechanisms that ensure adjustment to different light conditions and integrate these observations with the data on plant multiplication and biomass production. For this purpose, we measured chlorophyll (Chls) and carotenoid (Cars) contents and analyzed the energy fluxes through the PSII by saturation pulse method as well as by Chl a transient induction and JIP test. In a comparison of the effect of LL and HL on plant multiplication and fresh biomass, it was shown that the effect on growth was primarily attributed to the biomass reduction in LL while the effect on number of plants was much smaller. Total Chl and Cars contents were decreased in plants exposed to HL which indicated long-term acclimation response to the increased irradiance. Furthermore, the HL plants revealed better capability for the utilization of absorbed light in photosynthesis accompanied by photoprotective adjustment of certain number of PSII reaction centers from active to dissipative mode of functioning. In conclusion, our study showed that duckweed plants had great adjustment potential to different irradiation conditions, which might be of great importance not only under variable light availability but also when simultaneously challenged by some other environmental disturbance (e.g. different pollutants).",

The severity of the disease in positive control plants reached to 92.50% whereas that of acibenzolar-S-methyl and F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis-pretreated seedlings of eggplants was only 32.21% and 21.13%, respectively, 21 days after inoculation. Acibenzolar-S- -methyl and F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis pretreatments resulted in a hypersensitive reaction and triggered the elaboration of histological barriers such as callose and H 2 O 2 synthesis. In situ studies demonstrated that the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) accumulation and the callose deposition as responses to the pathogen attack started 24 h after inoculation. Acibenzolar- S-methyl and F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis-pretreated plants also showed significant increases in the activity of catalase and polyphenol oxidase enzymes along with the increase of proline and H 2 O 2 content when compared to F. oxysporum f. sp. melongenae-infected plants.",

The intention was also to compare the resulting prediction maps with the available field records and see whether there are any differences between the actual and the predicted ranges. The data set included 1979 species records and each record was accompanied by geographic coordinates. The geographi-cal analysis was performed on the chorological data (latitude, longitude, altitude), while the ecological was based on vegetation data relating to the association, alliance, order and class as well as on 19 bioclimatic parameters. The data set was georeferenced using GIS tools. The results demonstrated that the distribution patterns of all the analyzed species are mostly affected by the limiting effects of the variables related to precipitation and temperature of the dry and also the warm period. Their synergic limiting effects are the most important force shaping distribution patterns within a territory. These findings highlight the importance of defining bioclimatic profiles of species using different techniques of distribution modelling.",

The research was focussed on the classification of segetal plant communities occurring in paddy fields, which had been poorly investigated from a geobotanical standpoint. In all, 108 phytosociological relevés were sampled, using the Braun-Blanquet method. The analyses classified the vegetation into 9 communities, including 7 associations and one subassociation. Four new plant associations and one new subassociation were proposed: Elatinetum triandro-ambiguae, Mazo pumili-Lindernietum ciliatae, Mazo pumili-Lindernietum ciliatae caesulietosum axillaris, Rotaletum rotundifoliae and Ammanietum pygmeae. Due to species composition and habitat preferences all phytocoenoses were included into the Oryzetea sativae class and the Ludwigion hyssopifolio- octovalvis alliance. As in other rice field phytocoenoses, the main discrimination factors for the plots are depth of water, soil trophy and species richness. The altitudinal distribution also has a significant influence and separates the Rotaletum rotundifoliae and Elatinetum triandro-ambiguae associations. The study shows that anthropogenic rice fields can harbour relatively rich rush and water vegetation. More than 80 species were noted in the vegetation plots. Several of them are considered to be extremely rare and have been recorded on the world Red List.",

Airborne heavy metal pollution causes various physiological changes in lichens, but sensitivity to metal pollution is species specific. In this research, three lichen species ( Parmelia sulcata , Flavoparmelia caperata and Evernia prunastri ) were exposed to cadmium (50 mg L −1 ) in laboratory conditions. Photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II and content of secondary metabolites were determined after one, three and eight days of exposure. In all investigated species treatment of lichen thalli with cadmium significantly changed F v /F m and R Fd only after eight days of exposure. Quantification of metabolites showed a decreased content of the medullary depsidones salazinic acid (in P. sulcata ) and protocetraric acid (in F. caperata ) but increased content of cortical depside atranorin (in P. sulcata ) and dibenzofurane usnic acid (in F. caperata ) after cadmium exposure. However, no changes in secondary metabolites were found in E. prunastri . Results show that investigated species are relatively resistant to short-term cadmium-exposure and that secondary metabolites could have an important role in the protection of primary metabolism from negative cadmium impacts, at least in some species.",

The current study on in vitro propagation of T. cilicicus focused deeply on environmental applications such as the development of an optimum medium composition for efficient and genetically stable micropropagation and improved preservation procedures for long-time conservation of elite germplasms for further studies. For this purpose, MS and OM media were used individually and in combination with cytokinins, charcoal, AgNO3, Fe-EDDHA, and H3BO3. The raw data were statistically analyzed via the graph kernel method to optimize the nonlinear relationship between all parameters. The optimal proliferation medium for T. cilicicus was OM supplemented with a combination of 10 g L-1 charcoal and 1 mg L-1 KIN and the calculated averages of the best regeneration rate, the best shoot number and the best shoot length were 96.89%, 3 and 1.24 respectively on this medium. The determination of genetic stability of in vitro grown plants on the optimum medium compositions obtained by the graph kernel method was carried out with the use of the ISSR-PCR technique. All the ISSR primers produced a total of 192 reproductive band profiles, none of which were polymorphic. Furthermore, the micropropagated plants were successfully rooted and acclimatized to greenhouse conditions. In this study, we present a graph kernel multiple propagation index which considers all the possible parameters needing to be analyzed. Such an index is used for the first time for the determination of the optimum proliferation medium.",

Mont., inhabitant of temporary shallow ponds around the Mediterranean basin, is considered threatened throughout its distribution range. In addition, little is known of its biology and ecology or of its role in such an important ecosystem where environmental conditions vary yearly in unpredictable ways. In these variable habitats, due to the seasonal fluctuation of water levels, there is no guarantee of yearly spore input into the spore bank. Spore germination rate and the effects of different culture media in an axenic culture establishment, as well as propagation procedures of R. helicophylla, were tested. New insights into the ecology and biology of R. helicophylla are given. Spore dormancy is documented, and the protocols for the in vitro culture establishment, propagation and acclimatization of this liverwort are developed. Dry storage at 20 ± 2 °C for about three months broke the dormancy of spores, which subsequently germinated in a high percentage (over 90%). A two phase (solid and liquid) culture media system was developed for the purpose of achieving fully developed gametophytes. The liquid phase contained electrolytes simulating brackish water.",

They are documented with 47 relevés, which were compared with 177 dry grassland and 107 sand dune vegetation plots. Using hierarchical cluster analysis (flexible Beta method), and ordination (non-metric multidimensional scaling), the dry grasslands from the hinterland of Velika Plaža were grouped into three clusters, representing three new associations: Junco bufonii-Vulpietum ligusticae , Tuberario guttatae-Avellinietum festucoidis , Helinathemo jonii-Artemisietum campestris. The first association develops at the transition from wet grassland on gleyic soil to xerophilous grassland over sands. It is characterized by relatively high biomass production and is thus regularly mowed. The second association develops on somewhat higher and better drained sands, and due to very low biomass production, it is used exclusively as pasture. The Helinathemo jonii-Artemisietum campestris is also a pasture, evolved as a result of progressive natural succession of dune sands on the highest part of the dune system. It is represented by two sub-associations, one of which is characterized by the extremely high coverage of Asphodelus ramosus . Stands with A. ramosus primarily grow in the form of narrow strips along roads and around fences, sheltered from the wind, and on more developed and humus-rich soils. This suggests that Asphodeletosum ramosi present the terminal stage of the dune community Helianthemo jonii-Artemisietum campestris . The latter association is classified within the Crucianellion maritimae (Ammophiletea arundinaceae), whereas the other two belong to the Vulpio-Lotion (Helianthemetea guttati) .",

Carex limosa has to be considered as extinct from Croatia. Search for the species C. arenaria , C. diandra , C. frigida , C. melanostachya , C. pauciflora , C. stenophylla , and C. supina , has revealed only very old herbarium specimens, but there has been no recent confirmation in the field.

These glands are especially conspicuous in reproductive organs, such as the fruits, but their structure, origin, and secretion are still uncertain. The objective of this study is to determine the nature of the croceous glands in Senega from an analysis of the fruits of Senega longicaulis (Kunth) J.F.B. Pastore. Flowers and fruits at different developmental stages were analysed through light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to investigate the origin, structure, and composition of the secretion of the glands. Croceous glands of the pericarp are cavities that originate early, while still in the ovary, through a schizolysigenous process. In addition, new glands are formed de novo during fruit development, and the persistent calyx observed surrounding the fruit, also has such cavities. The secretory tissue is constituted by a single layer of epithelial cells, lining a spheroidal lumen that stores the secretion. The exudate is composed of essential oils, indicating functions related to protection against herbivory and microbial attacks. Our results partially diverge from previous reports, and further comprehensive analyses of Polygalaceae glands are essential to understand the nature of croceous glands and the evolution of defence strategies within the family.",

In transverse section, there is a beak-like cuticular outgrowth overarching the stomatal pore either at the outer side or at both the outer and inner side of the stomatal pore. The guard-cell mother-cell divides once longitudinally to form two guard cells and the development of subsidiary cells is not at all concerned with the former cell. Ontogenetically it is revealed that the development of a stomatal complex in these investigated taxa is aperiginous (X. granatum) and periginous (A. ilicifolius, A. rotungifolia and C. decandra). Glandular hairs (salt gland) are present only at the adaxial surface of leaves in A. ilicifolius and A. rotundifolia. In A. ilicifolius it is pear-shaped and protrudes from the normal epidermal layer while in A. rotundifolia it is present within a cup-shaped crypt in the epidermal layer. In both the cases, the ontogenic pathway is similar, at least up to the three-celled stage, but at maturity, the morphology is quite different. The salt gland consists of 4–8 radiating terminal cells, two stalk cells and one basal cell.",

Recently, Pinus nigra stands cover 70300 hectares, that is 4.2% of the total forested area of Hungary. The extensive monocultures of this tree are causing several problems from a nature conservation point of view, of which occupying the habitat of native communities and impoverishment of the local flora and fauna are the most important. Therefore, stands of this tree should be transformed and occupied by natural vegetation types, at least when found in national parks or other nature conservation areas.

    "abstract": "The flora of the Nebet Tepe Architectural Reserve in the city of Plovdiv (Thracian Plain) was studied in the period 1998–2003. The number of plants growing spontaneously on and around the fragments of the fortification wall and on the pavements is 131. The flora is analyzed with respect to the local distribution of the taxa, their chorology, life form and geoelement characteristics. The flora contains a relatively high proportion of ruderals and weeds. The hemicryptophytes and therophytes constitute the largest group. The following families are distinguished by the greatest number of species: Asteraceae (14), Fabaceae (13), Poaceae (12), Brassicaceae (8), Scrophulariaceae (7), Caryophyllaceae (7). The species Cerastium tauricum Spreng. and Melica transsilvanica Schur are recorded for the first time for the flora of the Thracian Plain floristic region. The results are compared with other European and Mediterranean wall floras.",

Sterile Perspex and polished quartz glass discs with a diameter of 3 cm were placed into a\r\nPerspex rack, which was immersed vertically in an aquarium containing water from a shallow soda lake. The temperature was kept constant and sufficient oxygen supply was provided. The samples were illuminated for 12 hours a day. Periphyton communities were sampled from 2 to 126 hours of exposure. In both experiments, the alteration of the number of algal species and cells as well as the carbon source utilization of microbial communities was logarithmic. In the two years, considerable differences were revealed in the magnitude of algal cell numbers. The proportion of benthic and planktonic algae showed an undulating pattern in the second experiment. One of the dominant benthic species was the diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum Kutz., while that of the planktonic, the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa Kutz. During the experiments an increase in the bacterial\r\nactivities could be observed; the higher the microbial diversity and abundance that was detected, the more BIOLOG carbon sources were utilized. The examined element contents indicated interactions among algae and bacteria in the biofilms from the beginning of the colonization processes.",

    "abstract": "Diatoms are single-celled organisms with rigid parts in relative motion at the micro- and nanometer length scales. Some diatom species form colonies comprising many cells. In this manuscript, the results of a two-dimensional finite element computer model are presented. This model was established to discover if diatom colonies start to exhibit some kind of Â»pumpingÂ« behaviour when subjected to water flow. To analyze this computationally, a model diatom colony with continuously repeated units of ten cells is investigated in a fluid dynamic simulation. In this first simple model, undisturbed fluid flow is allowed for between the single cells. The cells do not move actively, and are solely moved by the water. The initial fluid velocity is assumed between 0.01 m sâ€“1 and 1 m sâ€“1. Acomputational result that does not change anymore with time is called a steady state solution. Such a steady state solution is reached in all calculations performed. The steady state for a chain where initially all diatoms are spaced equally (equidistant spacing) has forces that encourage the formation of cell pairs with less distance between one another. These forces result from the flow of the surrounding fluid. The steady state for a chain with initially paired cells shows the opposite effect: the pairs tend to un-pair and head for the equidistant state again. The mutual change in forces between these two states, i.e., paired and unpaired formations, suggests that these two steady states lead into each other: The computer simulations suggest that a diatom colony subjected to water flow exhibits some kind of oscillatory movement. Such movement might facilitate nutrient uptake of the diatom colony.",

The traditional diatom classification originated as an aid to identification rather than as an arrangement expressing perceived relationships, and characters for identification continue to bias taxonomic descriptions. Reference to types for nomenclatural purposes has resulted in overly narrow taxon descriptions; i.e. types have been considered representative specimens (typical) of taxa, whereas they may not lie at the centre of the range of variation of a taxon. This paper discusses how taxonomic concepts are subject to change in the light of new data and that such changes should be reflected in the systematic arrangement. It presents some thoughts on character choice and the need to make appropriate comparisons before new taxa are erected. The importance of the suprageneric classification is also discussed.",

Greenhouse experiments were conducted to assess the effects of supplemental Ca 2+ in salinised soil on germination and plant growth response of castor plant ( Ricinus communis L. Var.

Further, Ca(NO 3 ) 2 x 4H 2 0 to the quantity of 97.5, 195, 292.5, 390, 487.5, and 585 g was separately mixed with soil of six lots to give 1:0.25, 1:0.50, 1:0.75, 1:1, 1:1.25, and 1:1.50 Na + /Ca 2+ ratios, respectively. The soil of the seventh lot contained only NaCl and its Na + /Ca 2+ ratio was 1:0. Soil without addition of NaCl and Ca (NO 3 ) 2 x 4H 2 0 served as control, with a 0:0 Na + /Ca 2+ ratio. Salinity significantly retarded seed germination and plant growth, but the deleterious effects of NaCl on seed germination were ameliorated and plant growth was restored with Ca 2+ supply at the critical level (1:0.25 Na + /Ca 2+ ratio) to salinised soil. Supply of Ca 2+ above the critical level further retarded seed germination and plant growth due to the increased soil salinity. Salt stress reduced N, P, K + and Ca 2+ content in plant tissues, but these nutrients were restored by addition of Ca 2+ at the critical level to saline soil. In contrast, Na + content in plant tissues significantly increased in response to salinity, but significantly decreased with increasing Ca 2+ supply to saline soil. The results are discussed in terms of the beneficial effects of Ca 2+ supply on the plant growth of Ricinus communis grown under saline conditions.",

The fire risk of such stands was examined using McArthur's empirical forest fire danger model. Our study focused on the effects of temperature and wind speed on fire behaviour. By keeping the input parameters of the model constant while changing temperature andwind speed within a specified interval the resulting fire danger index (FDI) and fire behaviour were examined. The applied fixed parameters were: 30 °C temperature, 30% relative humidity, 30 km h -1 wind speed, 30 degree of slope and drought factor value 10. The annual trends of the Byram-Keetch drought index (BKDI) and the drought factor were also calculated. Our results show that increasing temperature and wind speed raises the FDI, flame height, rate of fire spread (ROS) and spotting distance. The amount of fuel does not influence the FDI, but increasing the amount promotes the ROS and raises the flame height. Wind speed was the most important factor in the ROS. A serious fire risk of these plantations was determined. The reliability of McArthur's model was proved by comparison of our results with experimental laboratory data based on literature.",

(2n = 2x = 16) and A. × cornutum Clementi ex Vis. (2n = 3x = 24). This paper reviews the results of studies of their morpho- -anatomical characteristics and genetic structure. Although all three taxa were determined as varieties of the common onion, only the shallot A. cepa Aggregatum group (syn. A. ascalonicum L.) belongs to that species. The shallot A. × proliferum represents a hybrid between the two closely related species, A. cepa and A. fistulosum L. The third form of shallot, A. × cornutum is a still incompletely understood triploid hybrid between A. cepa and one or two closely related Allium species, whose identity has not been fully elucidated. In contrast to shallot A. cepa Aggregatum group, which has normal meiosis and produces fertile seed, hybrid shallots A. × proliferum and A. × cornutum are sterile, and reproduce exclusively vegetatively by underground bulbs or bulbils from the inflorescence.",

Changes in glycoprotein pattern during differentiation/dedifferentiation events exist in animal cells and DNA methylation status is closely related to the changes. However, in plant cells this relationship is not yet established. In order to verify whether such a relation exists, hypermethylating drugs 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and hydroxyurea, or hypomethylating drug 5-azacytozine were applied to sugar beet ( Beta vulgaris L.) cells during 14 days of in vitro subculture, and the glycoprotein patterns of the cells were compared. The applied drugs were not toxic, as observed from cell phenotype and by measuring growth of the control and treated cells. Hyper and hypomethylating treatments influenced the activity of enzymes related to differentiation state of the cells: peroxidases and esterases, and their isoform patterns. Electrophoretic patterns of soluble and membrane proteins were similar between control and treatments, but the treatments modified N- and O-linked glycoprotein patterns as visible from GNA and PNA lectin blots. This suggested that hypermethylation and hypomethylation of genomic DNA in sugar beet cells affect protein glycosylation patterns and cellular metabolism, possibly in a mechanism similar to that existing in animal cells.",

Crocus species have horticultural, medicinal and pharmacological importance. Saffron is the dried styles of C. sativus and is one of the world’s most expensive spices by weight. Controversy exits about the taxonomy of the genus and the species relationship. Exploring genetic diversity and inter-specific cross-ability are important tasks for conservation of wild taxa and for breeding of cultivated C. sativus . The present study was performed to study genetic variability and population structure in five Crocus L. species including Crocus almehensis Brickell &amp; Mathew, C. caspius Fischer &amp; Meyer, C. speciosus Marschall von Biberstein, C. haussknechtii Boissier, and C. sativus L. by inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular markers. We also used published internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences to study species relationship and compare the results with ISSR data. The results revealed a high degree of genetic variability both within and among the studied species. Neighbor joining (NJ) tree and network analysis revealed that ISSR markers are useful in Crocus species delimitation. Population fragmentation occurred in C. caspius and C. sativus . Both ISSR and sequenced based analyses separated C. sativus from the other studied species. Close genetic affinity of C. sativus and C. pallisii and inter-specific gene flow was supported by both data sets.",

Seed morphological data were analyzed for variability. Seed oil was extracted for phytochemical constituents, physicochemical properties, and fatty acid profiling by gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results showed intra and inter-locational variations in seed characters. Most fruits had 1–2 seeds. Seeds were predominantly brown and very few were dark brown. Phytochemicals and physicochemical parameters of the seed oil varied with place of collection. Alkaloid, saponin, tannin and phytate contents ranged between 0.79–0.84, 1.20–1.26, 1.48–1.56 and 0.15–0.18 mg g −1 respectively. The density of the oil was less than that of water, acid value ranged from 10.58–13.56 mg KOH g −1 and iodine values were between 36.63 to 40.32 g I 2 (100 g)–1. Saponification values lie between 160.39 and 184.14 mg KOH g −1 ; and free fatty acid was within 5.32–6.81 %. Peroxide, ɑ-tocopherol, total phenol and oxalate values as well as viscosity of the oil also varied; however, refractive index was similar. Ethyl oleate and octadecanoic acids were present and most abundance in all the locations, while glycidol stearate was only found in Fufu samples with three other fatty acids. Five fatty acids were present in Kosubosu, while Sare had only two. The results obtained in the present study indicate that shea oil could be used for medicinal, nutritional and industrial purposes. Since seed characters, phytochemical, physicochemical and fatty acid compositions varied with the microclimate, environmental and micro-ecological conditions should be considered when collecting seeds for oil utilization.",

Heterotrophic bacteria increased to peak abundances (69,268 cells cm–2) at the beginning of June when the diatoms abundances start to increase. The lake has high diatom species richness (285 diatom taxa within 72 genera), with the highest species diversity index in August. Among diatoms, adnate were the primary colonizers, particularly Cocconeis dirupta W.Gregory var. flexella (Janisch and Rabenhorst) Grunow and Cocconeis scutellum Ehrenberg var. scutellum, while motile taxa joined the fouling communities from July to September. This study showed close relationship between diatom species composition and changes of physico-chemical parameters, particularly the nutrient concentrations.",

    "abstract": "In the last two decades, the number of research articles focused on urban ecosystems in Europe has increased significantly. However, the cities investigated are very unevenly distributed, and most of the studies are focused on Central Europe. The aim of this analysis was to provide a realistic insight into the results of previous research into the urban flora and vegetation of Southeast Europe. The analysis covers a total of 149 articles, classified according to the topic and concept of research. The rates of exploration of urban flora and vegetation vary considerably across the countries of Southeast Europe. The floristic approach was the most common. Although some countries of Southeast Europe have a significant number of floristic studies (e.g. Serbia and Croatia with more than 20 each), their urban flora is still insufficiently explored compared to other European regions. Also, the use of different methodologies makes it impossible to compare results in an adequate way and draw relevant conclusions. Unlike the studies in most of Europe, with a broader spatial framework and uniform methodology, in Southeast Europe they usually referred to individual cities, specific habitats or certain parts of the cities. Hence, including Southeast Europe in large-scale studies would be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The side effects of certain antibiotics have been a recent dilemma in the medical arena. Due this fact, the necessity of natural product discovery could provide important indications against several pharmacological targets and combat many infectious agents. Piper arboreum Aub. (Piperaceae) has been used by Brazilian traditional communities against several illnesses including rheumatism, bronchitis, sexually transmitted diseases and complaints of the urinary tract. Medicinal plants are a source of several remedies used in clinical practice to combat microbial infections. In this study, ethanol extract and fractions of Piper arboreum leaves were used to assay antimicrobial and modulatory activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using microdilution method of ethanol extract and fractions from the leaves of P. arboreum ranging between 8 and 1024 mgmL–1. The capacity of these natural products to enhance the activity of antibiotic and antifungal drugs was also assayed. In these tests, natural products were combined with drugs. The natural products assayed did not demonstrate any clinically relevant antimicrobial activity (MIC ³ 1024 mg mL–1). However, the modulation of antibiotic activity assay observed a synergistic activity of natural products combined with antifungal (such as nystatin and amphotericin B) and antibiotic drugs (such as amikacin, gentamicin and kanamycin). According to these results, these natural products can be an interesting alternative not only to combat infectious diseases caused by bacteria or fungi, but also to combat enhanced resistance of microorganisms to antibiotic and antifungal drugs.",

The establishment of A. leptophylla on the western part of the island of Mljet may be attributable to certain favourable environmental conditions, but essentially to higher air and soil humidity.

    "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal that poses a significant threat to food safety and agricultural production worldwide. Its solubility enables easy entry into plants, leading to reductions in seed germination, growth and crop yield. Thus, it is crucial to discover methods to alleviate the harmful impact of Cd on plant growth. Magnetopriming (MP) is a non-invasive and cost-effective technique that has been proposed to improve plant growth under abiotic stress conditions. The current study investigated the potential of MP to improve the seed germination, early seedling growth and biochemical responses of soybean under Cd toxicity. Soybean seeds were magnetoprimed with static magnetic field (SMF) strength of 200 mT for 1 hour before germination. The unprimed and magnetoprimed seeds were grown under different concentrations of cadmium chloride (0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200 and 300 μM CdCl2) in Petri plates for five days in the dark at 25 + 1°C. The results revealed that Cd toxicity significantly reduced the germination percentage and inhibited the seedling growth parameters and increased oxidative stress, as determined by malondialdehyde (MDA) content in soybean seedlings from unprimed seeds. The inhibitory effect was increased with increasing concentration of Cd. However, MP remarkably increased the germination percentage, seedling growth parameters, activities of total amylase and protease, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content and decreased MDA and proline content in germinating soybean seedlings at all concentrations of Cd. These findings suggest that MP can alleviate the adverse effects of Cd stress in soybean seedlings and increase the tolerance index towards Cd toxicity by enhancing the activity of amylotic and proteolytic enzymes and reducing oxidative stress.",

The present study was performed to explore the effects of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) on Hg toxicity in maize (Zea mays L., cv. Arifiye-2) seedlings. Plants were grown in a hydroponic system containing 1/2 diluted Hoagland at 16 h day length, 25/20 °C (day/night) and 60% relative humidity. Eight day-old maize seedlings were first treated with NO (as 0.1 µM sodium nitroprusside) and then they were exposed to Hg toxicity (as 100 µM HgCl2) after 24 h. The toxic Hg decreased seedling growth, chlorophyll content, proline content, calcium and manganese contents, non-enzymatic antioxidant contents, cell membrane viscosity, and antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidases, and glutathione reductase) while it increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and super oxide anion (O2.-), and lipid peroxidation (as malondialdehyde, MDA) content and the amount of sodium ion (Na+) in the seedlings. However, NO treatment markedly enhanced the growth parameters (dry and fresh weight, and plant height) and manganese and potassium contents as well as contents of antioxidants and chlorophyll thus alleviating the negative effects caused by the Hg stress. Also, it decreased the generation of ROS and lipid peroxidation level by activating the antioxidant enzymes. These results show that NO in maize seedlings under Hg toxicity may improve stress response and mitigate oxidative stress by stimulating the antioxidant system and modulating ion homeostasis.",

With the aim of defining the differences among the communities and identifying the main environmental gradients, cluster analysis (Ward's method on a Chord distance matrix) and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination were applied. Taxa score-weighted means of the Ellenberg-type indicator values of main environmental variables were used to assess ecological differences among communities, and disturbance-related indicator values were calculated to assess the disturbance regime in shaping plant communities. According to the syntaxonomic framework for the grassland associations, three associations and two subassociations were found.

In this research, the effect of Tre foliar application on the growth rate, the content of photosynthetic pigments, accumulation of metabolites, and activity of antioxidant enzymes of basil seedlings under salt stress has been investigated. Basil seedlings were factorially treated twice a week with levels of 0, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mM NaCl and weekly with concentrations of 0 and 5 mM Tre for 4 weeks. Growth characteristics, the content of photosynthetic pigments including chlorophyll and carotenoid, and starch content decreased in response to salt stress, while the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the accumulation of metabolites including soluble sugars, proteins, amino acids, and proline increased. Tre treatment caused severe inhibition of plant growth, further reduction of photosynthetic pigments, and amount of soluble proteins during salinity stress. Also, starch, total protein, amino acids, and proline were hyperaccumulated in response to Tre. These results indicate that Tre not only does not reduce the detrimental effects of salinity in basil seedlings but also inhibits plant growth possibly by diverting carbon to other metabolic pathways.",

The anthers of C. kilaea are tetrasporangiate; the anther wall development is dicotyledonous; and the tapetum is amoeboid. The meiotic division of the microspore mother cells is regular, and when the pollen grains are thrown from the anthers, they are three-celled. The ovary of C. kilaea is inferior, bicarpellary, syncarpous, and unilocular, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It carries only a single ovule with basal placentation. The ovule is anatropous, unitegmic, and tenuinucellate. The megaspore mother cell undergoes meiotic division, giving rise to a linear tetrad of megaspores. The chalazal megaspore remains functional, and the other three megaspores degenerate rapidly. The functional megaspore undergoes three mitotic divisions in succession. As a result, a Polygonum-type embryo sac, with eight nuclei and seven cells, is formed. The antipodal cells persist until the first divisions of the zygote. In the mature embryo sac stage, the integument consists of the endothelium, peri-endothelial region, parenchymatous cells, and outer epidermis, from the inside out. Endosperm development is initially free nuclear, becoming cellular in the globular embryo stage. Embryo development is of the asterad type. The mature seed does not contain endosperm, but the endothelium persists.",

In addition to controlling stress-related gene expression through a signal transduction cascade, epigenetic regulation plays an important role in orchestrating rapid and precise responses of plants to dynamic changes in environmental conditions. Complex mechanisms such as DNA methylation, especially via the de novo pathway, and histone tail modifications such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation are involved in plant stress responses. In addition, histone variants and chromatin structure contribute to the dynamic regulation of chromatin state and determine whether it remains open or closed. Here, we summarise the complex combination of epigenetic modifications and factors that together regulate plant response to climate stress, focusing on the interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and the phytohormone abscisic acid.",

The hydrography of the bay is influenced by the specific karstic hydrology (underwater springs in the inner part of the bay), and the Neretva River discharging into the outer part of the bay. Due to the estuarine circulation in winter, a stratified water column is formed, the surface layer being mostly formed above, and the subsurface layer below 6 m depth. This vertical structure was detected on the basis of temperature, salinity and phytoplankton and non-living suspended particle distribution. Phytoplankton accumulated most frequently in the surface layer in more stable conditions, and below the halocline during greater input of freshwater. Due to the relatively low phytoplankton cell density, the cell density of species indicating nutrient enrichment, as well as high species diversity and transparency, Mali Ston Bay may be indirectly classified as moderately eutrophic ecosystem, and recommended for the further development of shellfish farming activities.",

The albumin degradation was lesser in the early stage and reached a maximum in the later stages of germination. However, the globulins were degraded steadily from the start of imbibition. The influence of the embryonic axis on albumin and globulin degradation was also evaluated by using axis-attached and axis-detached cotyledons. The overall loss of globulins and albumins in axis-detached cotyledons was only 49 % and 60 % of the basal level, while in axis-attached cotyledons it was 81 % and 94 %. These results were confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and reveal the faster degradation of high molecular weight (HMW) polypeptides of globulins in the early stages of germination with increased utilization of albumins in the later stages. The results obtained showed the role of the embryonic axis in seed storage protein mobilization.",

Two unusual diatoms were associated with the red alga Herposiphonia ceratoclada. They were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. The first, previously described as Â»Cocconeis coelataÂ« Arnott ex Greville, is a thick-ribbed biraphid diatom that appears to have an undular raphe and marginal septum like some Mastogloia species, but it does not have partecta in the valvocopula. Instead it has short marginal ribs that support a pseudoseptum. Its solid lyre and multiseriate striae with cibrate pores could be modifications of similar structures in Aneumastus aksaraiensis Spaulding et al. It typifies the new genus Skeletomastus which appears to be close to both Mastogloia and Aneumastus, hence the name. The second is a proposed new Pleurosigma species, P. inscriptura with naviculoid symmetry and a markedly sigmoid raphe system with deflected ends. It appears bright blue in darkfield illumination which helped us locate it in other samples from theWellington region.We compare it with some other Pleurosigma species and consider their diffraction properties.",

    "abstract": "Phototrophic biofilm and microbial mat communities grow along the rocky coastline of the Maltese islands. This research involved studying phototrophs from the mediolittoral and supralittoral zones over a two-year period and seasonal changes were observed. Attachment of pioneer microorganisms to the porous eroded limestone bedrock was facilitated via a gelatinous matrix composed of exopolymeric substances (EPS). In submerged areas, such as undisturbed rock pools, these progressively formed green or brown compact biofilms, some of which thickened over the spring to form microbial mats via the production of more extensive EPS layers. Microbial mats gradually attained a lighter colouration due to the presence of ultraviolet (UV) screening pigments. In full summer, they were observed to shrink, detach from the exposed substrate, harden and progressively calcify. Biofilm microorganisms survived the harsh summer months in sheltered areas. The major biofilm formers were filamentous non-heterocytous cyanobacteria belonging to the Leptolyngbyaceae, Pseudanabaenaceae and Oscillatoriaceae. Their sheaths were thick, lamellated and often confluent. A higher biodiversity of phototrophs was observed in late autumn and winter, when tufts of heterocytous Calothrix sp. grew on thin compact biofilms of Nodosilinea sp., Toxifilum sp. and Phormidesmis spp., while Lyngbya spp. trichomes were surrounded by thick brown sheaths. Germlings of green and brown macroalgal species belonging to Ulva, Cladophora and Sphacelaria were embedded in biofilms and microbial mats and gradually grew to form extensive macroalgal covers submerged in rock pools. Erythrotrichia sp. filaments colonised the mediolittoral zone and were confined to areas that were exposed to wave action and submerged intermittently. Over the summer, macroalgal coverage diminished and microalgal biofilms and microbial mats prevailed in rock pools.",

Each soil sample was assayed for nine abiotic factors and culturable microfungal populations. Fungal abundance was determined by dilution plate technique, and the identification of fungi was based on morphological characteristics. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship of association between these factors and the presence and abundance of Trichoderma species in each soil type. The abundance of soil fungi ranged between 7.0 × 103 and 13.6 × 10 3 colony forming units (cfus) per gram of dry soil. The population densities of the two Trichoderma species (T. koningii and T. viride) isolated in the present study varied significantly with crop species and their abundance (varied from 0.6 to 3.6 × 10 3 cfus g -1 dry soil). Twenty-two other colony-forming fungal types with an abundance ranging between 7.0 × 103 and 13.6 × 10 3 cfus g -1 dry soil were also isolated in the present study. As soil pH negatively influenced relative abundance of T. koningii, soil P and relative abundance of T. viride were significantly and positively correlated to each other. Further, relative abundance of T. koningii was significantly and positively correlated to relative abundance of Aspergillus fumigatus but negatively correlated to relative abundance of Stachybotrys atra. Likewise, a significant negative correlation existed between relative abundance of T. viride and Absidia glauca.",

Three vegetation types emerged from canonical components analysis (CCA), correlated to a gradient of environmental conditions ranging from the coast to inland areas. The first group with Lomelosia cretica and Dianthus rupicola subsp. rupicola was correlated to thermo-xerophilous conditions (lower thermo-Mediterranean belt), the second group with Silene fruticosa and Colymbada tauromenitana was linked to thermophilous conditions (upper thermo-Mediterranean belt) and the third with Dianthus siculus and Odontites boc-conei was correlated to mesophilous conditions (meso-Mediterranean belt).

Our results showed that spatial variation of both the diatom species composition and the calculated bioindices were similar on both small (distance of centimeter) and medium (distance of decimeters) scales. Spatial variation was also similar on both studied substrates. This implies that it does not matter if a small or a larger area is sampled for biomonitoring as long as no major environmental factors impact certain sites systematically. Diatom assemblages and indices were significantly different between substrates. Spatial variation did not contribute much to this variation, and variation on a slide was unimportant. These results confirm earlier findings that smallscale spatial variation is not a problem when using diatoms to detect anthropogenic impacts to a stream or lake.",

The intercalibration exercise revealed several taxonomic problems. Among others, considerable problems occurred with identifying and differentiating species of the following four groups: (I) Amphora indistincta Levkov and A. pediculus (Kützing) Grunow, (II) Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta Ehrenberg and C. placentula var. lineata (Ehrenberg) Van Heurck, (III) Navicula cryptotenella Lange-Bertalot and N. cryptotenelloides Lange-Bertalot and (IV) N. reichardtiana Lange-Bertalot and N. caterva Hohn &amp; Hellermann. The taxonomic problems that emerged occurred due to both insufficient use of given taxonomic details (by limnologists) and ambiguous species descriptions and documentation (by taxonomists). Thus, we recommend to the applied limnologist to use the mandatory identification literature and to document any ambiguous valves during routine counts. Also, it would be desirable to further investigate certain species by taxonomists and, in general, to provide more basic data with species descriptions or in identification manuals. These measures will improve the use of diatoms as bioindicators and consequently benefit both applied limnologists and taxonomists.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Zonal vegetation is a large-scale expression of macro-climate and, due to the climatic diversity of the country, there are seven traditionally recognized zonal forest plant communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Using data from Bosnia and Herzegovina, this study aimed to reveal whether macro-climate is indeed the most important factor determining the existence of zonal forest plant communities (ZFPC). Detrended correspondence analysis of 398 relevés of seven ZFPCs revealed that the species turnover along the first axis is strongly related to the macro-climatic gradient (annual mean temperature, mean temperature of the coldest quarter and precipitation of the warmest quarter). No correlation was detected between this gradient and topographic factors (slope and aspect) and soil reaction. Floristic analysis revealed clear separation of ZFPCs in terms of diagnostic species. Functional analysis of all layers showed that competitive ecological strategy has the highest proportion, while analysis of the herb layer alone expressed a shift of CSR signatures towards the middle of the C-S axis. Ruderality was overall poorly expressed. Statistically significant differences among communities were discovered along the C-S axis. In terms of life forms, statistically significant differences in the proportions of Phanerophytes, Geophytes and Hemicryptophytes among communities were discovered. Our study confirms that macro-climatic gradient is the most important determinant of the species turnover along ZFPCs. CSR signatures show that zonal forest vegetation is represented by productive communities in a terminal stage of succession. This does not refer to degraded Quercus ilex stands (maquis), which are in the middle stage of secondary succession.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the micromorphology of the vegetative and reproductive structures of the endemic Centaurea glaberrima Tausch subsp. divergens (Vis.) Hayek (Asteraceae), using scanning electron microscope (SEM), is presented for the first time. Uniseriate whip-like non-glandular and biseriate glandular trichomes are found on the surface of all aboveground parts (stem, leaves, peduncles, involucral bract). On the adaxial leaf epidermis ribbed thickenings (striation pattern) of outer periclinal cell walls, slightly curved anticlinal cell walls and anomocytic stomata are noticed. Rugose abaxial surface with thorny protuberances of the involucral bract is documented. Corolla is glabrous with longitudinally parallel epidermal cells with distinct straight outline. Isopolar, radially symmetric and tricolporate microechinate pollen grains are seen. Short stylar hairs, without cuticular striations, are present along the outer sides of the style, while the inner sides (abaxial surface) constitute the papillate stigmatic surface. Microcharacters found in cypsela are as follows: slightly ribbed body; rotund base; lateral and concave insertion; short, unicellular curly acute trichomes; smooth epidermis; fine-sulcate ornamentation; rod shaped epidermal cells with short, obtuse end walls and straight anticlinal walls; poorly developed minutely dentate pericarp rim; and dimorphic pappus with bristles of different length and morphology, with pinnules restricted to the margins of the bristles. The results obtained contribute to knowledge about the micromorphology of the studied endemic species and provide features for its better identification. The taxonomic significance of the analyzed characters is discussed. Some well defined microcharacters of the studied species might have taxonomic value.",

Salinity can have harmful effects on physiological processes and plant growth, including Tropaeolum majus L. (Tropaeolaceae). The application of phytohormones can be a strategy to mitigate these effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, cytokinin and polyamine as attenuators of salt stress in T. majus . Three levels of salt stress were used: 0 mM NaCl (no stress), 50 mM NaCl (moderate stress) and 100 mM NaCl (severe stress). Four phytohormones and a control treatment were used: control (deionized water), jasmonic acid (200 µM), salicylic acid (2 mM), cytokinin (6-benzylaminopurine – 10 µM) and polyamine (spermine – 1 mM). Growth and gas exchange parameters were evaluated. Applied in conditions of moderate salt stress, all the phytohormones were efficient in improving plant height and leaf area (except salicylic acid); cytokinin and polyamine improved the number of flowers as well as gs, A and iCE; jasmonic acid improved the stem dry mass and total dry mass. In relation to severe salt stress, applications of jasmonic acid and polyamine were efficient in improving plant height; cytokinin improved leaf dry mass as well as gs, A, E, WUE, iWUE and iCE. The application of cytokinin, polyamine and jasmonic acid can be used to mitigate moderate salt stress in T. majus.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the orchid species have become endangered due to overuse and habitat destruction. As with most flowering plants, seed production is the primary strategy for reproduction in orchids. Orchids produce tiny seeds consisting of a seed coat and a rudimentary embryo. However, it lacks the endosperm, which is generally required as the primary energy source during germination. The only way to germinate orchid seeds is to get nutrients from an external source. In nature, this is achieved by mycorrhizal symbiosis. This study used Ceratobasidium sp. inoculation of Anacamptis laxiflora (Lam.) seeds combined with media with various organic substrates to determine their effectiveness on germination and seedling development by in vitro culture. The highest germination rate (35.78%) was obtained in the medium with addition of young hazelnut leaves. Then, soilless ex vitro symbiotic germination was performed on young hazelnut leaves, the most effective organic substrate. Seed germination was determined to be 19.01% in this medium while 14.87% seedlings with developed leaves and roots were formed. For the first time, success was achieved by producing A. laxiflora from seed in ex vitro conditions without soil and adapting it to nature.",

The synoptic phytosociological table and the results of hierarchical classification and ordination showed a quite distinct floristic and phytogeographical pattern of differentiation in a northwest-southeast direction. The proportion of Southeast – European-Illyrian (Illyricoid) species decreases towards the northwest while Alpine species decrease in the opposite direction. Stands from the Trnovski gozd plateau form a geographical variant Omphalodo-Fagetum var. geogr. Saxifraga cuneifolia, further divided into two geographical sub-variants, western – subvar. geogr. Anemone trifolia and central-eastern – subvar. geogr. Omphalodes verna. All other stands belong to the geographical variant Omphalodo-Fagetum var. geogr. Calamintha grandiflora, also further divided into two geographical sub-variants, subvar. geogr. Dentaria pentaphyllos and subvar. geogr. Dentaria polyphylla. Although the distribution area of the association is well defined in its northwest part, the question of its south-eastern border is still open. The preliminary results of analyses indicate that the stands southeast of Velebit and Li~ka Plje{ivica should be treated as a different association, distinct from Omphalodo-Fagetum. Further phytosociological and phytogeographical research into the entire Illyrian floral province will therefore be needed to resolve the problem of the southern border of the distribution area of the association Omphalodo-Fagetum and the syntaxonomy of south-eastern Dinaric fir-beech stands.",

Brachidinium and Karenia papilionacea often co-occurred, B. capitatum predominating in the surface waters. The highest abundance of Brachidinium were found in the upper 25min the western Mediterranean with amaximum (24 cells L -1 ) at a depth of 5 m in the Balearic Sea. Asterodinium (up to 4 cells L -1 ) was recorded below of deep chlorophyll maxima. The genus Microceratium , only known from the tropical Indo-Pacific region, is reported for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea. Microceratium was found below 100min the eastern Mediterranean Sea, with the highest abundance of 8 cells L -1 at 125 m depth, in the Levantine Basin. This study also illustrates for the first time specimens under the division of Brachidinium and Microceratium . This first occurrence of Microceratium in the Mediterranean Sea should be considered an indicator of climate warming. However, it should not be considered a non-indigenous taxon. Microceratium is the ‘tropical morphotype’, the adaptation of a local species (a life stage of Karenia - Brachidinium - Asterodinium ) to the tropical environmental conditions that prevail in summer in the open Mediterranean Sea.",

Hydrogen peroxide level, antioxidative responses and photosynthetic pigments Essential signaling processes such as changes in calcium mobilization, protein phosphorylation and gene expression are known to be modulated by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). A lot of silver maple trees in the city of Osijek (Croatia) were noticed to have bleached leaves by early summer as well as during the whole vegetation season. In this study we aimed to investigate the processes that regulate H 2 O 2 levels in healthy (green) and prematurely aged (bleached) leaves. For that purpose, photosynthetic performance and antioxidative response of green and bleached silver maple leaves were studied. Bleached leaves had higher hydrogen peroxide level, a three-fold level of total soluble proteins as well as a lower level of ascorbic acid. Concentrations of chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , total chlorophylls and total carotenoids as well as maximum quantum yield of photosystem II were lower in bleached leaves. This indicated their impaired photosynthetic performance. Further more, bleached leaves were characterized by lower specific activities of the main antioxidative enzymes, which influenced their reactive oxygen species scavenging capability. The higher level of H 2 O 2 content in bleached leaves as the consequence of reduced antioxidative enzyme specific activities as well as ascorbic acid level could be the reason for the down-regulation of photosynthetic performance and premature aging of those leaves.",

Plant leaf extracts provide a platform for nanoparticle synthesis from metal and metal oxides, which is more economical and environmentally friendly than other methods, such as chemical reduction and physical methods. The present study conducted the biosynthesis of iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) using Thymus vulgaris L. (Thyme) leaf aqueous extract. The characterization of FeNPs was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. UV-vis spectroscopy analysis demonstrated a visible peak around 440 nm. FTIR demonstrated the presence of iron metallic ions. Structural analysis of the nanoparticles by TEM showed agglomerations of spherical shapes. The average size of the synthesized FeNPs was around 40 nm. Regarding application, the ability of the FeNPs to degrade methyl orange was recorded as 95%. They were also examined for potential antimicrobial activity against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. FeNPs demonstrated high antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis and Aspergillus flavus, while their antibacterial activity was much weaker compared to commercial antibacterial agent. Thus, FeNPs synthesized using T. vulgaris could play an important role in controlling C. albicans, C. parasilosis and A. flavus and bioremediation of dyes.",

A new population with intermediate individuals that share morphological characteristics of both T. montanum and T. polium has been found in Croatia (Bisko near Trilj), and most likely represents a hybridogenous taxon. The aim of this study is to compare the morpho-anatomical and phytochemical characteristics of the two parental species and their putative hybrid, as well as to determine the most important distinguishing characters between these three groups. In order to describe the variability and significance of morpho-anatomical and phytochemical differentiation of the analysed groups several multivariate statistical analysis were conducted (PCA, CDA, DFA, UPGMA-clustering). All analyses confirm the separation of two species, T. polium and T. montanum, and reveal the intermediate position of the putative hybrid. In this way, data on morphological and anatomical analysis together with data on the composition of the essential oils support the assumption of the hybridogenous origin of the intermediate individuals. Based on descriptions and original indication of parental species of previously described hybrids T. × castrense Verg., T. × bogoutdinovae Melinkov and T. × rohlenae K.Malý, we found that the intermediate specimens collected in Croatia perfectly correspond to T. × rohlenae, a hybridogenous taxon discovered by Rohlena in the vicinity of Kotor in Montenegro, and thus prove the presence of a new natural hybrid in the flora of Croatia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The morphological characteristics of achenes of Lactuca serriola represented by 34 local populations from Slovenia and 12 local populations from Sweden were studied in relation to their eco-geographical conditions. In total, eight quantitative morphological characters were evaluated: length and width of achene body; index length/width of achene body; number of ribs on achene body; length of beak; length of pappus bristles; pappus area and discus diameter. NestedANOVAanalysis indicated significant differences in length and width of achene body, length of pappus bristles, and pappus area between Slovenian and Swedish populations. Achenes from Slovenia were longer, wider and possessed longer pappus bristles than achenes from Sweden. Among geographical factors, latitude had the greatest impact on the morphological characters evaluated. Significant differences in seven parameters were also found between populations within countries and between samples within populations. It is probable that this variation has a genetic basis with sufficient variation within populations to permit continued selection.",

We analysed the influence of selected environmental and spatial variables on the diversity and species composition of epilithic diatom communities in periphyton. Samples were collected along the river course in a torrential river the Kamniška Bistrica. Sampling sites were selected in reaches distributed from the source to the outlet of the river and were under different influences from the catchment area and with different physical and chemical characteristics. The most common and dominant diatom species in the periphyton community were Achnan-thes biasolettiana and A. minutissima. Achnanthes species often inhabit rivers and springs with moderate organic pollution. Another common diatom taxon was Gomphonema pumi-lum - a key species indicating oligosaprobic conditions. The results of the canonical cor-respondence analyses revealed that variance of the periphytic diatom community was explained by water temperature and conductivity as well as altitude. Diatom species richness was positively correlated with saprobic index values and abundance of filamentous algae in the river bed indicating a relatively low organic matter and nutrient input into the river system.",

Given the constraints of the minimum mapping unit chosen, 17 classes were identified in the field and designated to corresponding polygons created by the classification of satellite image. Thirteen classes were plant communities or their combinations, while remaining four denoted various types of land cover (coniferous plantations, mixed rural landscapes, settlements and quarries). In the overall area of the Nature Park (344 km 2 ), the most frequent type of cover was Lamio orvalae – Fagetum forest (38.4 % of total area), while the most frequent non-forest community was Bromo – Plantaginetum mediae (7.9%). According to this research, as much as 77.3 % of Park area is covered with forest, which is a significant increase compared to the old data of 61 % of forests. Analyses of mapped polygons showed that almost a quarter of all polygons has an area equal to, or just little bigger than the minimum mapping unit, while more than three quarters of all polygons have their area smaller or equal to 9 ha (corresponds to 300 x 300 meters square). Such an extreme mosaic landscape structure in conjunction with the constant depopulation of Park area causes further natural forestation of park and hence decreases in biodiversity. The overall accuracy of map was 65%, forest vegetation being mapped with higher accuracy (70%) than non-forest vegetation (61%).",

The pericarp indumentum type is velutinous with different density of trichomes. Glabrous pericarp was observed in A. reticulata Runemark ex Khatamsaz solely. All trichomes are simple. Two basic types of trichomes were distinguished on the surface of peicarp: tubular and flattened. Among those, tubular trichomes are more frequent than other trichome in most species except for A. kotschyi Boiss. & Hohen., A. eburnea Spach, A. spinosissima Bge. subsp. spinosissima and A. lycioides Spach var. lycioides . Density of trichomes was variable among the studied taxa. In the first subgenus (subgen. Amygdalus ) with two sections, there was enough difference between sections. While density of trichomes in sect. Spartioides Spach was very low, most of species in the another section, sect. Amygdalus showed dense pericarp indumentum. Regarding density, the second subgenus, subgen. Dodecandra (Spach) Browicz showed dense indumentum. Two studied hybrids, A. × keredjensis Browicz and A. × kamiaranensis Khatamsaz & Assadi showed different pericarp indumentum, dense and sparse one, respectively. In conclusion, micromorphological investigation of pericarp indumentum in drupe is a useful tool for separating of taxa in some cases especially of the two sections in the first subgenus in Amygdalus .",

The effect of ethanolic leaf extracts of Mangifera indica, Mentha spicata, Citrus limon, Eucalyptus camaldulensis against four isolated fungal species including Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus flavus, Rhizopus stolonifer and Penicillium digitatum was evaluated at various concentrations, by using the poisoned food technique. The impact of the extracts on seed germination and growth of eggplant was assessed by seed treatment and growth in a greenhouse experiment. Total flavonoids of E. camaldulensis were analyzed through spectrophotometer, using quercetin as a standard. Physico-chemical parameters were also determined. Antifungal activity showed that maximum inhibition percentage of P. digitatum (67.78%) and F. oxysporum (64.44%) was observed at the highest concentration (80%) of C. limon and E. camaldulensis extracts, respectively, followed by M. spicata extract against A. fl avus (63.33%) and R. stolonifer (52.22%). Least inhibition percentage of F. oxysporum, P. digitatum, R. stolonifer and A. flavus was 6.67, 7.78, 14.44 and 16.67%, respectively, at the lowest (20%) concentration of M. spicata. The greenhouse experiment showed variations in seedling germination and post-germination growth. E. camaldulensis extract showed an increase in percent germination (78.98%) over untreated control (62.83%), root and shoot length and fresh and dry weight of root and shoot with the consequent reduction in disease symptoms. Phytochemical analysis depicted the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, saponins in all extracts while steroids and glycosides were absent. A fair amount (10.38 mg QE g -1 DF ) of flavonoid was present in leaf extract of E. camaldulensis. Physico-chemical analysis showed pH of 4.6, ash content of 0.41% and weight loss on drying of 8.14%.",

The morphological characterizations of the collected plant materials classified all 121 samples as L. serriola f. serriola ; one sample was heterogeneous, and also present was L. serriola f. integrifolia . Differences in the amount and distribution of the genetic variations between the two regions were analyzed using 257 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and 7 microsatellite (SSRs) markers. Bayesian clustering and Neighbor-Network were used for visualization of the differences among the samples by country. Under the Bayesian approach, the best partitioning (according to the most frequent signals) was resolved into three groups. While the absence of an admixture or low admixture was detected in the Slovenian samples, and the majority of the Swedish samples, a significant admixture was detected in the profiles of five Swedish samples collected near Malmö, which bore unique morphological features of their rosette leaves. The Neighbor-Network analysis divided the samples into 6 groups, each consisting of samples coming from a particular country. Reflection of morphology and eco-geographical conditions in genetic variation are also discussed.",

A real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was carried out and our results showed that Arf1 ( AtArfB1c- like), MtSar1 , AtRabA1e -like, AtRabC1 -like, MsRab11- like and AtRop7 -like genes were highly expressed in the nodules of rhizobium inoculated plants compared to the non-inoculated ones. On the contrary, AtRabA3 like, AtRab5c and MsRac1 -like genes were highly expressed in non-infected nitrogen supplied roots of M. truncatula . Other Rab genes ( AtRabA4a , AtRabA4c and AtRabG3a -like genes) were nearly equally expressed in both treatments. Interestingly, RbohB (a respiratory burst NADPH oxidase homologue) was more highly expressed in rhizobium infected than in non-infected roots and nodules. Our data show a differential expression pattern of small GTP-binding proteins in roots and nodules of the plants. This study demonstrates an important role of small GTP-binding proteins in symbiosome biogenesis and root nodule development in legumes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper reports a cytogenetic study of eight Medicago L. species sampled from the Soummam Valley (northeastern Algeria). Chromosome numbers and meiosis irregularities during microsporogenesis were explored. Pollen viability rate and pollen size were also examined. The studied taxa are diploid and display biva-lent pairing and regular chromosome segregation during meiosis. Although meiosis appears regular, some anomalies were detected in relatively high cumulated rates (14.66%–26.14%). The most common meiotic abnormality examined here is related to cytomixis (from 14.66% in M. littoralis to 25.83% in M. laciniata ). Other anomalies were also detected, including chromatic bridges, asynchronous divisions, micronuclei and multipolar cells. Consequently, the species exhibited varying percentages of pollen viability (from 70.11% in M. laciniata to 99.14% in M. littoralis ). Pollen viability was negatively correlated with meiotic abnormalities (Pearson correlation coefficient R = −0.72, p = 0.043). The pollen grains were also heterogeneous in size. Medicago truncatula Gaertn. and M. laciniata (L.) Miller presented the most variable pollen size (relative standard deviation exceeding 19%). Medicago littoralis is distinguished from other species by possessing homogeneous and large sized pollen (relative standard deviation RSD = 6.73 %). The cytogenetic and pollen data provided by this study are discussed in the context of species systematics and in the perspective of genetic improvement.",

This study was designed to draw attention to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) distribution and community assemblages following heavy metal and salinity concentrations in two wetlands subjected to domestic and industrial effluents. Rhizospheric soil and roots of 18 plant species were collected in two wetlands along a decreasing salinity gradient. The results showed that 72.72% of plant species exhibit an association within arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), and 36.36% a dual association between AM and dark septate endophytes (DSE). A total of 33 AMF morphospecies were distinguished on the basis of morphological criteria dominated by taxa belonging to Glomeraceae and Acaulosporaceae. Soil contamination was investigated by determining metallic trace elements (MTE) (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cr and Zn) using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Values of the pollution index revealed wetlands that were particularly polluted by lead. Two˗way ANOVA showed significant variations in metal content among sampling locations and transects. Principal component analysis showed that species richness, and mycorrhizal frequency were slightly affected by MTE. This opens possibilities for their utilization in polluted soil remediation.",

Both abandonment of grazing and overgrazing gradually reduce plant diversity. This paper correlated abundance patterns of the flora on rocky pastures with the values of the chemical composition of the soil resulting from the degree of sheep grazing intensity. The study was carried out in the period from 2008 to 2010 on the islands of Pag, Krk and Cres. At 30 sites, 310 taxa of vascular plants were found. The highest plant diversity and 220 plant taxa were found on moderately grazed pastures. Abandoned pastures with a total of 93 plant taxa observed show the dominance of phanerophytes (35.5%) and the highest proportion of the Mediterranean floral element when compared to pastures of moderate and heavy grazing intensity. The highest concentration of total nitrogen in the soil (0.71%) was recorded on plots of heavy grazing intensity. The results of the study indicate that moderate grazing intensity, from 1 to 1.5 sheep ha −1 , can be recommended on the northern Adriatic islands. This should contribute not only to the preservation of plant diversity, but also to the improvement of ecological sheep farming.",

Forty two sample sites were designated on the watershed from source to mouth of the two rivers and their tributaries. Samples were taken in July 2012. Altogether, 258 diatom taxa were identified. The microflora was dominated by tychoplanktonic elements. According to the relative abundance of the occurring taxa, four groups could be distinguished. Differentiation of these groups was confirmed by differences in the habitat characteristics, viz. altitude, width of watercourse, macrophyte coverage and river bed material. Diversity of diatom taxa in the phytoplankton was also studied. A positive relationship was found between the macrophyte coverage and the Simpson and the Shannon indices. In contrast, a negative relationship was shown between the macrophyte coverage and Berger-Parker diversity, in which metric the role of the dominant taxa is emphasized. Although the phytoplankton in rhithral rivers is influenced by stochastic events, our results reveal that geographical and hydromorphological characteristics of the rivers and coverage of macrophytes can also play role in shaping the composition and diversity of the phytoplankton.",

Although 21 taxa of the C. pyramidalis complex were described, only four species are accepted: C. pyramidalis, C. versicolor, C. secundiflora and C. austroadriatica. In the present study, we propose compounds of the methanolic leaf extract as possible chemotaxonomic markers for the C. pyramidalis complex. Eleven flavonoids and two phenolic acids were detected in leaf extract using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection analysis. The investigated taxa of the C. pyramidalis complex differ in terms of the composition of the methanolic leaf extract. clustering of investigated taxa is not completely consistent with the previously reported molecular and morphometric data.",

Tissue culture was initiated from seeds and juvenile plants obtained from natural sites on a solid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium, with and without growth regulators. We tested various combinations and concentrations of growth regulators, and the best proliferation of axillary shoots, on average 14, was obtained on MS medium with 5 μM BAP and 3 μM IBA and 3% sucrose. Rooting was achieved after transferral of the shoots to an MS medium with 2 μM IBA and 3% sucrose. The rooted plants were acclimatized on a mixture of limestone sand, potting soil and vermiculite in a ratio of 10:2:2, with pH in the range of 7.5–8.0. In vitro propagation methods provide an important opportunity for the propagation and preservation of H. pastinacifolia by rapidly increasing the number of plants, without disturbing the wild population.",

There are 91 species of vascular plants, four species of bryophytes, three species of lichens, and one species of cyanobacteria. Vegetation is represented by populations of species typical of plant communities from the classes Stellarietea mediae, Artemisietea vulgaris, Koelerio-Corynephoretea, Festuco- Brometea and Molinio-Arrhenatheretea. Two floristic groups recognized from hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis correspond with ruderal and segetal habitats.

Flower visitors have also been observed and analyzed with the aim of clarifying certain pollination aspects of the species including flower attractiveness especially to honeybees, and also in order to ascertain its contribution to the bee pasture. The pollen grains of C. coloratum are isopolar, radially symmetrical and medium sized. Polar axis (P) is 26.83±1.77 μm length, and equatorial diameter (E) is 9.17±0.57 μm length. P/E ratio amounts 2.90±0.10 indicating a perprolate shape. In an equatorial view, the grains are constricted in the equatorial region (bone-shaped), with obtuse polar caps. In polar view, they are triangular with obtuse angles and furrows in the sides of the triangle (interangular). The grains are tricolporate with three straight ectocolpi arranged regularly meridionally, of mean length 14.43±2.17 μm, each of which has one endopore. The characteristic internal thickenings around the protruding, clearly visible endopores (costae) in the constricted equatorial region are obvious in light microscopy. The ornamentation is psilate, irregularly rugulate (“cerebroid”), the exine surface is rather undulating. With regard to the observed flower visitors, the following pollination types occurred: melittophily, myophily, sapromyophily, cantharophily, and phalaenophily, and the most frequent pollinator was the honeybee.",

Phytoplankton accumulated around the halocline in the middle portion of the estuary, where nanoplankton provided the dominant autotrophic constituent. Marine phytoplankton accumulated there due to more favorable light and nutrient conditions along the outflow plume, as well as reduced zooplankton grazing. Orthophosphate was detected as a limiting growth factor in the estuary. The phytoplankton species assemblages at the seaward and riverine ends of the estuary were made up of taxa with corresponding salinity preferences. A subsurface temperature maximum was detected in the middle portion of the estuary, due to the combined effect of radiative heating and reduced heat exchange at the halocline level, as well as the accumulation of suspended matter close to the halocline and selective absorption of solar radiation.",

According to analysis of life forms, the most numerous are Therophyta (13 species, 46.4%), followed by Chamaephyta (seven species, 25%), Phanerophyta (four species, 14.3%), Hemicryptophyta (three species, 10.7%) and Geophyta (one species, 3.6%). After analysis of floral elements, autochthonous taxa are grouped into three categories: Mediterranean floral element (18 species, 66.6%), South European floral element (five species, 18.5%) and widespread plants (four species, 14.8%). Especially important plants in the flora of Brusnik are Frankenia pulverulenta L., a very rare species in the Croatian flora and the Illyrian-Adriatic endemic plants Centaurea ragusina L., Limonium vestitum (Salmon) Salmon subsp. brusnicense Trinajsti} and Senecio leucanthemifolius Poir. var. reichenbachii Fiori.

    "abstract": "Randonia africana Coss. (Resedaceae) is a perennial endangered vascular plant species in Egypt. It inhabits the sandy plains along the Mersa Matruh-Siwa Oasis road crossing the Western Desert of Egypt, where it represents the easternmost limit of distribution in North Africa. The vegetation associates within each of the five known population sites of R. africana were studied, and their edaphic correlates were analysed. Eight soil variables were included: electric conductivity, pH, calcium carbonate, soil moisture, organic matter, sand, silt and clay. Classification and ordination techniques were employed to the importance values (IV) of the recorded 29 species in 25 stands. Application of TWINSPAN classified the floristic data into five vegetation groups: (A) Randonia africana-Capparis spinosa var. aegyptia ,( B)R. africana ,( C)R. africana-Pulicaria undulata ,( D)R. africana-Zilla spinosa subsp. biparmata and (E) R. africana-Zygophyllum coccineum. These groups were separated along Detrended Correpondence Analysis (DCA) axes 1 and 2. Group E was the most diversified (10.0 ± 5.6 species stands-1) among the vegetation groups, while monotypic stands of R. africana (group B) were the least (5.1 ± 2.3). Stands of R. africana group (group B) were characterised by the highest levels of soil salinity and fine sediments, and the lowest levels of moisture content and sand. Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) indicated that the distribution of R. africana and its associates was mainly controlled by soil salinity, percentages of surface sediments of different size classes, calcareous deposits, and organic matter. The resulted gradients were related closely to the first three canonical axes, and accounted for 68.5% of the species-environment relationship among stands.",

This species meets all criteria for a multipurpose plant and is capable of being used in the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems. The paper presents the most suitable methods for the propagation of and testing the possibility and capacity of germination and growth of different populations of Panicum turgidum. Besides investigating the socioeconomic value of this species through the documentation and survey of its traditional uses, the study illustrates the importance of P. turgidum for the local inhabitants as a very important fodder plant, for both domestic and wild animals. The main benefit from propagating this plant is an increase in grazing potentialities and reduction of the use of artificial feed. The results of the present study shows that individuals propagated by direct seed sowing attained the highest values of growth parameters, followed by those propagated by rhizomes, then those propagated by seedlings. The most suitable method for propagating it, in this region, is by grains and the best time is the first week of June. The results also show that the P. turgidum populations collected from the eastern desert attained the highest germination percentage and maximum values of growth parameters upon cultivation. Thus, eastern desert populations are recommended as a good source of grains for rehabilitation programs.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the allelopathic effect of Ficus retusa L. leaf litter on the understory species in urban gardens. A field study showed that the plant cover and species richness of litter-affected plots were lower than those of litter-free areas. The litter-affected soils had substantially lower pH and higher electrical conductivity. In a greenhouse experiment, litter-affected soil significantly inhibited the emergence and growth of understory species selected for the purpose of this study: Melilotus indicus (L.) All., Trifolium resupinatum L. and Amaranthus viridis L. Osmotic potentials equivalent to those of the litter-affected soils did not affect emergence or growth of these species. A spectrophotometric analysis indicated that the litter-affected soils contained larger amounts of phenolics and flavonoids. An HPLC analysis revealed that the litter-affected soils contained higher concentrations of free phenolic and flavonoid allelochemicals. These results demonstrate that F. retusa leaf litter may reduce plant cover and species richness. The significant inhibition in both field and greenhouse experiments could be attributed to phenolic and flavonoid allelochemicals released from the tree litter, as the osmotic potential of the litter had no effect on the understory species. The allelopathic potential of F. retusa leaf litter plays at least a partial role in reducing urban vegetation.",

The fossil flora contains a number of taxa of moderate to poor preservation and low abundance. Analysis of stratigraphic occurrence of diatoms throughout the section has been conducted. Two diatom assemblages of different ages are recognized in different parts of the 900 m-thick Alugivayam Formation. The younger assemblage is characterized by the presence of Cavitatus sp. cf. jouseanus and Odontella sawamurae. Co-occurrence of these taxamay indicate the age of enclosing sediment not older than ~31 Ma (the early Oligocene). The older assemblage from the basal part of the Alugivayam Formation lacks the mentioned taxa but contains Stephanopyxis species such as St. grunowii and St. marginata. Most likely, its age is at the earliest Oligocene. It is shown that in the studied Paleogene stratigraphic section diatoms appear just above the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. Data obtained on diatoms and diatom biomarkers may indicate increased diatom productivity in the sea basin after the Eocene/ Oligocene transition. The first data on diatom flora from stratigraphically well-controlled samples support the Oligocene age of the Alugivayam Formation in the Ilâ€™pinskii Peninsula section and contribute to regional correlations of the Oligocene strata in Kamchatka.",

The results demonstrated that genus Dysphania is represented in Bulgaria by five species: Dysphania ambrosioides, D. multifida, D. botrys, D. schraderiana and D. pumilio. The first two species are tetraploids with chromosome number 2n = 32 for D. ambrosioides and 2n = 36 for D. multifida. The remaining three species are diploids with 2n = 18. The results from statistical analysis demonstrated that the main source of phenotype variation in the species is the interpopulation variation. The specific characters which allowed their recognition are themorphological characteristics of the perianth lobes, the upper leaves and the seeds. The distinction between D. multifida, D. ambrosioides and D. schraderiana is based on differences in the quantitative traits, while in D. botrys and D. pumilio qualitative traits are also important. The basic evolutionary mechanisms are polyploidy and diploidy.Atendency towards reduction in the size of generative organs and the number of perianth lobes was found.",

While the structure (physiognomy) of these stands is very homogenous and dominated by few species, the flora is heterogeneous, since ecotonal areas, where heaths are most frequently developed, represent a contact zone of elements of different syntaxa. Due to an abrupt reduction in pasture activities strong encroachments of shrubs and trees have become common, which additionally contribute to the floristic heterogeneity of the heaths. Although the identification and circumscription together with synecology and synchorology of heaths in general are more or less easily understood and straightforward, their floristic affinities, in relation to structure homogeneity and syndynamics, are complicated, which led to the proposal of several synsystematic schemes depending on interpretation of the relationship between flora and structure of stands. Dinaric heaths are classified into three classes, Erico-Pinetea, Vaccinio-Piceetea and Festuco-Brometea and a classification scheme is proposed together with nomenclatorial revision of the analyzed heaths with dwarf ericaceous shrubs and Alpine juniper (Juniperus alpina) in the Dinaric Alps",

Functional and molecular adjustment of PSII In the present study we aimed to investigate physiological and molecular mechanisms of photosynthetic performance decline in prematurely aged bleached leaves of silver maple ( Acer saccharinum L.) trees. We used in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence measurement to analyze changes in PSII photochemistry, relative abundance of photosynthetic proteins (D1, LHCII, Cyt f and Rubisco LSU), relations between chlorophylls and their precursor protochlorophyllide as well as elemental composition of the leaves. Decreases in Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Zn and an increase in S concentrations were found in bleached leaves in comparison to healthy green ones. The bleached leaves were visually expressing symptoms characteristic of Fe deficiency. Further, they had considerably decreased chlorophyll contents and protochlorophyllide contents, overall photosynthetic activity and relative abundance of major photosynthetic proteins. All the results indicate that modifications in the molecular organization of photosynthetic electron-transport chain components in bleached leaves led to functional adaptation of the PSII achieved by modifications of some reaction centres (RCs), turning them from active to dissipative. This provided efficient adaptation of bleached leaves to high-light induced oxidative damage during summer.",

To clarify whether the genetic variations support the morphological differences among accessions of different geographic origin, analysis of nuclear DNA content and polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) dataset was studied. The variation in nuclear DNA content of G. sericea var. sericea and var. rigida is minimal (2.09 and 2.08 pg/nucleus respectively) and is correlated with equal chromosome numbers in both varieties. Intraspecific variability of the ITS region was studied on 13 accessions of G. sericea , 6 belonging to var. sericea and 7 to var. rigida . These accessions were analyzed in comparison to closely related species already studied. ITS sequences of G. sericea revealed large polymorphism and formed two main clusters. One cluster (6 accessions) comprehends var. sericea of northern Italy, Slovenia and northern Croatia; the other cluster (7 accessions) includes five accessions of var. rigida from southern Croatia and Montenegro and two from the Pollino massif (southern Italy). The later two accessions considerably differed from other accessions of var. rigida . This genetic analysis supports the previous assumptions, which subdivided G. sericea into at least two taxa. On the basis of the results presented, it is here suggested that the subdivision of G. sericea into var. sericea and var. rigida should be maintained.",

The species was studied in terms of detailed morphology. Basal leaves are narrowly spatulate and cauline leaves are linear to oblanceolate; both leaves are covered with flattened stalked five-armed trichomes. Raceme length was found to be up to 6 cm and 9 cm in the flowering and fruiting stages, respectively. Sepals are linear-oblong, rarely elliptic with obtuse to subacute apex. Petals are spatulate with emarginate apex. Some morphological characteristics such as dimensions of cauline leaves and ovary and length of pistil were measured for the first time. In an anatomical study, root, stem, basal leaf and cauline leaf were examined. The anatomical results showed that the plants have secondary growth in roots, primary growth in stems, amphistomatic and equifacial basal and cauline leaves with anisocytic stomata. Pollen grains are radial symmetrical, isopolar and tricolpate. The ratio of polar axis to equatorial diameter is 1.16, and pollen shape is subprolate. Exine sculpturing is reticulate under light microscope and scanning electron microscope. Seeds are obovatesuborbicular, compressed and pale brown. The chromosome number of P. haussknechtii was defined to be 2n=16. The karyotype formula of P. haussknechtii consists of five metacentric chromosome pairs and three submetacentric chromosome pairs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Iron Age site of Kaptol-Gradci belongs to the south-eastern periphery of the Hallstatt cultural complex, dominated primarily by the Kaptol cultural group, and encompasses a hillfort settlement and necropolis. During the investigation campaigns organized to date, 25 tumuli have been identified and 17 of them investigated. This paper presents the first results of the analysis of plant remains from a Hallstatt necropolis in Croatia, from tumuli 6 and 7, identified as an integral part of the complex burial ritual. In both tumuli, the predominant finds were of cereal grains (83% in tumulus 6 and 96.9% in tumulus 7). Besides the cereal grains, a very small quantity of weeds representing accidental associations have also been identified, as well as remains of wild fruits collected in the countryside. On the basis of the first results obtained from the archaeological site of Kaptol-Gradci and the scarce archaeobotanical research into Hallstatt necropolises in Europe, the conclusion can be drawn that a potential pattern can be observed, an element of a complex burial ritual in which cereal grains (overwhelmingly dominant in terms of their relative proportions) played an important role, together with various fruit deposits, whose type and quantity probably depended on the season, their availability in the environment and/or the possibility of their storage/preservation.",

Apical shoot tips obtained from previous subculture were transferred to a Murashige and Skoog nutrient medium for proliferation and were exposed to continuous or gradual salinity stress for 42 days. The salt used to induce salinity was NaCl added in six concentrations: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 mM. Gradual salinization was achieved by transferring the explants sequentially every week to the above mentioned NaCl concentrations. Most salt treatments had a negative effect on the growth parameters of explants. Sodium concentration of explants increased in all NaCl treatments compared to control and it was higher in the treatments with gradual exposure to salinity. Potassium concentration was reduced, mostly in the treatments with continuous exposure. Calcium andMg concentrations increased in all saline treatments. In general, the high salinity level in the substrate enhanced the proline and sugar concentrations of the studied explants. In conclusion, salinity had significant impacts on the growth and chemical status of P. trifoliata.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chaetoceros wighamii Brightwell is a planktonic diatom species originally described from brackish waters. Since its original description, the species has been reported in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from freshwater to marine. Varying descriptions exist in the taxonomic literature and several taxa have been considered as synonyms, including freshwater species Chaetoceros amanita. In this study we provide morphological and ultrastructural information on a cultured strain isolated from freshwater sample collected in the Lake Vrana (Vransko jezero) in Croatia, in April 2011. The cells form short and robust chains with very narrow apertures, often partially occluded by silica membranes. Other distinctive features observable in light microscopy are the shape and orientation of the setae which are very long, straight and robust, diverging in various directions from the chain axis and the single parietal chloroplast extending from valve to valve. Distinct ultrastructural characteristics are the absence of processes either in intercalary or terminal valves and the ornamentation of the valve face with densely distributed ribs spreading from an irregular eccentric hyaline area without a clearly defined annulus. The outer surface of the terminal valve is ornamented with small spines and setae are composed of fl at longitudinal filaments interconnected with short bars and ornamented with small spines tightly arranged around the setae. Our description agrees well with that reported for the freshwater morphotypes of C. wighamii (syn. C. amanita) and contributes for a reliable distinction of this intriguing taxon from similar morphotypes. This finding supports the interpretation of Chaetoceros wighamii as a freshwater/brackish species and represents the first report of a Chaetoceros species in lacustrine environment in Croatia and possibly in any Central European habitats.",

On the basis of the variability of anatomical characters, similar populations formed two clusters, joining the plants previously determined as O. divergens and O. umbellatum. The two taxa significantly differed for most of the quantitative leaf and scapus characters. Since only quantitative differences were recorded in this research, anatomical characters could not be solely used to separate these two taxa. However, the results of anatomical investigations are consistent with the results of previous morphological and genetic analyses; therefore anatomical parameters could be useful as additional taxonomic characters.",

Statistical analyses showed that the species had greater impact on the observed parameters than either the sowing date or the species and sowing date in combination. The species showed a significant influence on all five tested parameters, while sowing date and interaction of both factors significantly influenced plant height, leaf percentage and essential oil content. The best yield per plant was obtained for O . × hybrida and O . basilicum ‘Eco Genovese’. The lowest species O . × hybrida produced the highest amount of essential oil. »Nodes number« parameter most clearly separated the species, but not the cultivars. Even though O. americanum gave the tallest plants, it did not yield either the highest amount of fresh herb or essential oil. This species’ height was most consistent, considering the significant impact of biodynamic rhythm. Sowing date was not crucial for basil fresh yield; however if there is a need for taller plants with a higher percentage of leaf mass and more essential oil, sowing date needs to be controlled.",

In this study, the effects of 1 and 10 mM proline (Pro), prior to exposure of resistant (CM-334) and susceptible (SD-8) pepper seedlings to P. capsici , on some physiological parameters were investigated. A lower Pro concentration (1 mM) was found to be more effective than 10 mM Pro in increasing the stress tolerance of the CM-334 cultivar. Namely, in CM-334 cultivar, the highest chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , carotenoid, glucose and fructose content and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity percentage were detected on the seventh day after application of 1 mM Pro + P. capsici , while the lowest malondialdehyde (MDA) amount was measured on the third day in the same treatment. The highest ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) increase was determined on the seventh day in the 10 mM Pro + P. capsici application. The effects of the same Pro treatments on the SD-8 cultivar somewhat differed; the highest amounts of chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , anthocyanins, fructose, total protein and endogenous Pro were detected on the seventh day in the 1 mM Pro + P. capsici application, while the lowest MDA amount was measured on the third day after the 10 mM Pro + P. capsici application, the highest DPPH % and FRAP values were detected on the seventh day with 10 mM Pro + P. capsici application. Although some differences were detected between the cultivars, Pro application against the P. capsici stress in general resulted in a positive effect on photosynthetic pigments, soluble carbohydrates and antioxidant capacity in pepper. The exogenous application of Pro helped the non-resistant cultivar to overcome the stress.",

However, the alleviation of the harmful effects of B[a]P pollution in perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne L.) by the application of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) has been ignored. Thus, in this paper the effects of exogenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) on the growth, photosynthetic fluorescence characteristics, and antioxidant enzyme activity of ryegrass exposed to B[a]P stress are investigated. B[a]P stress induced the reduction of the aboveground and belowground dry weights, chlorophyll (a, b), the total chlorophyll contents, the carotenoid content, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci), the water use efficiency (WUE), the photosystem II (PSII) potential activity (Fv/F0), the maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), the steady-state fluorescence yield (Fs), and the non-photochemical quenching (qN), while enhancement was recorded in response to the foliar spray of SNP at 200 and 300 μmol·L-1 under B[a]P stress. Gray correlation and principal component analyses show that 200 μmol·L 1 of SNP more drastically alleviated the damage caused by B[a]P stress than 300 μmol·L 1 of SNP.

Observations were made on the phenology, floral morphology and architecture, breeding and pollination system, as well as flower-insect interactions. During 1999–2000, Abrus precatorius was observed to flower twice a year (April to June and September to November) while A. pulchellus flowered only once, from October to December. Flowers of A. precatorius never opened, which indicted obligate cleistogamy in this species. The study has produced evidence showing that the type of breeding strategy in A. pulchellus is of the facultative type. There was no evidence of agamospermy in the two species. Fourteen insects and an arachnid belonging to eleven families in six orders were observed visiting flowers of the two species. Among these visitors, Chrysops longicornis, Riptortus dentipes, Rhinocoris bicolor and Rhinocoris rapax were the most likely to aid cross-pollination and hence are legitimate visitors. Our study suggests that low outcrossing rate occurs in both species despite the predominant cleistogamous characteristics in the genus. Occurrence of low outcrossing is a kind of evolutionary homoeostasis in both species for perpetuating healthy offspring.",

    "abstract": "The first record of the genus Pliocaenicus from middle Miocene deposits is presented in this paper. This record from Changbai (Jilin Province, China) places the origin of the genus further back into themiddleMiocene. The genus has been so far reported from the late Miocene/early Pliocene till Recent. The population from Changbai belongs to the group of Pliocaenicus species possessing complex alveolae, such as P. cathayanus Wang, P. jilinensis Wang and P. omarensis (Kuptsova) Stachura-S. et Khursevich. Both P. cathayanus and P. jilinensis have been described from China (Pliocene deposits), and are only known from the type locality. The third species, P. omarensis is reported from Eurasia and Africa (age range: late Miocene-Pleistocene). In this report we describe P. changbaiense, a new species from China, and focus on those characters having the potential for developing further an evolutionary and taxonomical concept in Pliocaenicus. We anticipate that these will contribute to our understanding of the driving forces of diatom dispersal.",

The site is characterized by a periodic intrusion of seawater. We propose to classify this species as critically endangered (CR) on a national level due to the small population size and the fragile habitat, which requires active protection and conservation.",

Although genetic factors such as meiosis, chromosome number, and ploidy level may be causative for the evolution, endemism, rare distribution or even extinction of the species, no detailed information exists. Keeping this in mind H. astragaloides has been studied cytologically. Male meiotic investigations revealed diploid level (2n=2x=14) for species and normal meiotic course in the accessions from the Manali Hills resulting in nearly 100% pollen fertility. However, the accessions scored from the Manimahesh Hills and Pangi Valley depicted inter-pollen mother cell transfer of chromatin material and structural heterozygosity for reciprocal translocations. Consequent upon these meiotic anomalies, some pollen sterility (21%) resulted. On account of this sweeping genetic outcome, the incidence of anomalies such as this in an endemic and threatened species warrants grave consideration. It is sensible to conclude that conservation measures should include the collection of germplasm from the localities where plants are meiotically stable with high gametic fertility, to ensure good germination and healthy plants for future use. Seeds from meiotically normal individuals should be given priority for inclusion in seed banks.",

P. yezoensis has been used as food in East Asian countries for a long time, and, in addition to that its consumption is increasing worldwide owing to the growing interest in healthy seaweed food. A mutant (Py2K) with a high growth rate was developed using gamma rays to increase the production of P. yezoensis. De novo transcriptome analysis was performed to determine the mechanism underlying the high growth rate of this mutant. The transcriptomes from wild-type (PyWT) and mutant (Py2K) strains were assembled, and 167,165 genes were analyzed. A total of 15,979 genes were differentially expressed. Transcriptome analysis of nitrogen pathway revealed the increase in nitrogen availability through the upregulation of nitrate transporter gene (nrt) expression. Activation of nitrogen assimilation and re-assimilation and upregulation in alternative oxidase (aox) gene contributed to the increase in cellular nitrogen availability, thereby affecting the synthesis of phycobiliprotein. As a consequence, the efficiency of photosynthesis and the subsequent growth rate increased, which contributed to the color differences in thalli between PyWT and Py2K.",

It is one of the most economically important seaweed species and has been cultivated extensively in the cold waters of East Asia. Various reports have been published on the isolation and characterization of improved strains of Pyropia. However, there are few studies focusing on the molecular basis underlying these mutant strains. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of whole transcriptomes of wild-type (PyWT) and high-growth (Py500G) strains of P. yezoensis using next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). After sequencing, a total of 167,110,896 paired-end reads with a length of 151 nucleotides, were obtained. De novo transcriptome assembly and redundancy removal generated 19,441 transcripts. The assembly was annotated in NCBI nr, Swiss-Prot, Pfam, KEGG, GO and KOG databases. To unravel the differences in Py500G and PyWT, we mapped Py500G and PyWT reads to the assembly and calculated the expression levels. In total, there were 454 transcripts that were differentially expressed. Among the differentially expressed transcripts, candidate genes were identified with well-known growth and development functions. This study not only identifies candidate genes responsible for the high-growth phenotype of Py500G, but it also provides more comprehensive genomic data for future research on P. yezoensis.",

Vascular plant species diversity was studied in relation to landscape variables and to threat (Slovenian red-listed species). Our results show that fragment size does not affect plant species diversity. In addition, fragment shape index is not related to Alpha diversity. Higher Alpha diversity was observed for abandoned grassland fragments. The lowest Alpha diversity was perceived on more mesic fragments, where habitat specialists are much scarcer. It was confirmed that the highest diversity of specialists are in the driest fragments, both still mowed and abandoned. With an increase in the number of distinctly different bordering habitat types, the total number of species per fragment generally does not increase, except in the case of those fragments that are already in different succession stages. Abandoned and typical dry grasslands are associated with a higher number of bordering habitats. Typical dry grassland fragments and abandoned ones, which probably derived mostly from drier (less productive) grasslands, are found on lower altitude and have a lower shape index. Habitat specialists Sedum sexangulare, Polygala vulgaris and Spiranthes spiralis have higher frequency in fragments with a lower shape index. This means that these oligotrophic specialists occur in smaller fragments. But Orchis morio has higher frequencies of occurrence on polygons with a higher shape index, which confirms the observation that this species occurs in larger and more irregular fragments, as well as close to houses and fields and along the roads.",

Due to the quite large flower heads and easy maintenance, this plant has a potential use as a substitute ornamental plant for K. arvensis in perennial beds. The current study evaluated the germination process in different treatments in an attempt to suppress dormancy and increase germination rate, and to develop a successful protocol for micropropagation. An over 60% germination rate was achieved through cultivation of seeds on MS basal medium with reduced mineral nutrient composition and the absence of sucrose. On the other hand, a below 10% germination rate was achieved with untreated seeds. Suppression of apical dominance was achieved through application of high concentrations of kinetin, apical shoot decapitation or cultivation of shoots in liquid media. Overall, liquid cultures were more successful as a micropropagation system for this plant. Shoots spontaneously developed roots on multiplication treatments and were successfully acclimatized. Moreover, phenolic compound profile was analysed in the light of the possible medicinal potential of this plant. Variable amounts of total phenolic compounds as well as individual phenolics were recorded, according to treatment and solidification of media. An increase in rosmarinic acid content was reported for kinetin treatments and acclimatized plants comparing to mother plants in natural habitat. The present study shows that choice of cytokinin concentration, explant type as well as culture type influences not only shoot proliferation and apical dominance suppression but also in vitro production of phenolics.",

In total, 123 polymorphic DNA fragments were amplified from five combinations of ISSR primers.

There was a low correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance of accessions. The results of STRUCTURE analysis suggested the presence of three genetic groups of this species in Iran, mostly adapted to different ecological conditions.

The flower is considered an adaptation that has coevolved to achieve effective pollination and successful fertilization. Therefore we have focused on the morphological and anatomical characteristics of the flowers of A. sylvestris L. as a prelude to the study of the species’ pollination biology and plant breeding system. The large size of the flower (50.6 ± 16.4 mm in dimensions) and its bowl shape fulfil both the biotic pollination syndrome and the aerodynamic requirements for pollen dispersal and capture. The opening and closing of the perianth provide a shelter for beetles. The odourless perianth, absence of nectar, scarcity of pollen (approximately 200 000 pollen grains per flower) and its traits - small size (axis P = 18.52 ± 1.0 μm; E = 16.59 ± 0.9 μm), lack of balsam on the exine surface, starch accumulation in more than 95% of pollen grains correspond to the specialization in anemophily. The stigma is papillous, the dense hairs are situated between single carpels indicating adaptation to capturing dry pollen and specialization in the wind pollination syndrome. The flower of A. sylvestris is an example for an intermediate form between entomophily and anemophily, i.e. a secondary and more advanced feature among Ranunculaceae.",

Identification of salt tolerant genotypes and integration of alternative molecular markers have important roles in enhancing breeding processes. In this study, 3308 maize expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from salt stress-related libraries were assembled to mine repetitive sequences for development of applicable markers. In this core EST data, 208 simple and 18 non-simple repetitive regions were detected in 312 contigs and 1121 singletons. The di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant type and accounted for 79.3%, followed by tri (19.7%), and tetra-nucleotide (1%). Among 59 EST-simple sequence repeats (SSRs), a total of 55 were screened for polymorphism between F35 (salt sensitive) and F63 (salt tolerant) parents and 48 out of 55 were detected as monomorphic. Significantly, seven of them (12.7%) were found to be polymorphic and were used for genotyping of 158 F 5 derived recombinant inbred maize lines, and four of them were located on chromosome 1 and 3. Using in silico mapping, 44 out of 59 EST-SSR markers were mapped on 10 maize chromosomes. Analysis of sequence homology revealed different functional groups such as: membrane transport, cell defense, cell division, signaling components, photosynthesis and cell metabolism.

At the bases of some plants abundant callus masses developed. Lower agar and higher MS salt concentrations stimulated callus production. In the culture, morphologically normal and hyperhydric shoots were regenerated. The growth of crown-gall tumour was induced on disc-like explants of in vitro grown plants infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, B6S3 strain. Calli appeared on both infected and control explants. The tumorous tissue grew more intensively than the control. The transformed character of the callus was confirmed by PCR amplification of a gene 6a of T-DNA. Gene expression in cactus shoots (grown in vitro or in pot), callus, hiperhydric and morphologically normal regenerated shoots and crown-gall tumour were analysed at the level of the electrophoretic pattern of soluble proteins. Some tumour-specific polypeptides were detected (76, 32-39, and 23 kDa). That of 42 kDa was highly expressed in callus and hyperhydric shoots. A faint 58 kDa band was found in all extracts except in the pot-grown shoot. Relatively high peroxidase activity was detected in callus and shoot regenerants and it was lower in tumour and the lowest in plant shoots.",

Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, electric conductivity and turbidity were measured in the field. Water and hydrosoil samples were collected and analysed for phosphates, nitrates, sulphates, carbonates, bicarbonates, calcium, magnesium, and silicates. The shoreline was classified into four moisture segments depending on the period of inundation, namely: wet (frequently inundated and recently exposed); moist (periodically inundated); semi-dry (rarely inundated); and dry (never inundated). Plants characterising each segment have been identified. Factors affecting the distribution of aquatic macrophytes in Lake Nubia were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis. Temporal and spatial variations of the shoreline vegetation were revealed.",

In this paper, the planktonic diatom Thalassiosira delicatula Ostenfeld emend. Hasle, originally isolated and cultured (in f/2 medium, a light-darkness cycle of 12:12, and at temperature of 20 Â°C Â± 2 Â°C) from material obtained from the tropical, southern Mexican Pacific, was studied by LM, SEM and TEM. General morphology of the species agrees well with previous descriptions, including the formation of chains and colonies embedded in mucilage, the chitin threads connecting cells in the chain, the shape of the cells (in girdle view rectangular with a concavity in the valve centre), and processes (with a large rimoportula between valve face and mantle, a marginal ring of occluded ones, and two or three marginal rings of fultoportulae) and areolae arrangement. However the shape and distribution of chloroplasts and threads produced by marginal fultoportulae in living cells, and the presence of more than one central fultoportula, close to a larger areola (two and three fultoportulae were detected in this study) had never been described. Urn-shaped marginal fultoportulae were also very common in most specimens studied, whereas in the literature this character was found only once for the species. Additionally, two rimoportulae were detected in at least one valve. This morphological variability is discussed. This species is a new record for the Mexican Pacific and also the first record of the northern Pacific Ocean.",

Optimizing irrigation in agriculture is a challenge. Understanding the response of crop development stages to water deficit stress provides an opportunity for optimizing irrigation. Here we studied the response of two barley varieties (Rihane, Martin), to water deficit stress at three development stages (tillering, stem elongation, and heading) by measuring water status and grain yield components in a field experiment in Tunisia. The three stages were selected due to their importance in crop growth and grain development. Water deficit stress was initiated by withholding water for 21 days at the three stages with subsequent re-watering. Water deficit led to a progressive decrease in leaf water potential. In both varieties, heading was the stage most sensitive to water deficit. Leaf water potential measurements indicated that water deficit stress was more severe during heading, which to some extent may have influenced the comparison between growth stages. During heading, the number of ears per plant and weight of a thousand grains were reduced by more than 70% and 50%, respectively compared with stress at tillering. Comparison of yield components showed differences between the two barley varieties only when the water deficit was produced during the tillering stage.",

    "abstract": "Although Croatia is not often perceived as a citrus growing country, citrus species have been planted in the Croatian southern coastal part for centuries. Citrus had always been important as a source of vitamins and micronutrients for local consumption, but with the introduction of Satsuma mandarins (Citrus unshiu Marc.) citrus production started its commercial development. The Croatian coast is probably the northernmost commercial citrus growing area globally with several agroecological constraints influencing citrus production. However, Satsuma mandarins, the most cold-tolerant citrus of economic interest, are successfully cultivated resulting in an excellent quality of fruits that easily finds a market niche. Unfortunately, with the import of plant material in the last century, the simultaneous introduction of viral and subviral pathogens occurred. The most important are Citrus tristeza virus and Citrus exocortis viroid. As certain rootstock-scion combinations are tolerant to virus or viroid infections and display no obvious symptoms, these pathogens have been continuously spreading by plant propagation. Molecular and biological analyses revealed the existence of pathotypes not believed to be endemically present in the Mediterranean region. Their high intra-isolate genetic variability and frequent coinfections suggest that this geographical region presents a sort of a biological enclave of potentially threatening pathogens. Their transmission from this agroecological niche to areas where sensitive rootstock-scion combinations are common presents a serious risk to citrus production, especially when global warming and the resulting migration of efficient vector species are considered. Comprehensive pathogen monitoring is important for improving citrus production and the prevention of pathogen transmission.",

Secretory ducts formed by 5-12 secretory cells embedded in the cortex and located near the vascular bundle were found at the root, which was in the early stage of secondary development. The stem was circular-pentagonal in cross-section. There was lamellar collenchyma beneath epidermis of pentagon corners, and cortex parenchyma between corners. Secretory ducts located near the phloem, between the cortex and endodermis on the interfascicular region, were also observed. An endodermis layer was evident and its cells have indentations and protrusions where they touch adjacent endodermis cells, which strengthens the connection between them. In addition, casparian strips were conspicuous in many endodermis cells. The leaf midrib area had a triangular cross section. There were secretory ducts, consisting of 4-5 secretory cells observed on both sides of the sclerenchymatous fibers that accompany the xylem. The leaf lamina was amphistomatic and stomata type was anomocytic. Mesophyll layer was equifacial. There was a large secretory duct and its diameter is bigger than the nearest main lamina vascular bundle. Achene shape of A. sivasica was lanceolate-oblong and its surface was ribbed and glabrous.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A pattern of seasonal changes in the morphological and anatomical leaf traits is reported for Potentilla argentea L. var. tenuiloba (Jord.) Sw. of temperate-climate areas in central Poland. Leaf area, perimeter, dry mass and lamina thickness were measured in summer and autumn leaves of the same individuals. Dissection index, density and specific leaf area were calculated. Significant differences were obtained between summer and autumn leaves obtained from the same individuals. The shapes of leaves of the P. argentea plants varied in the extent of incisions between teeth and the number of teeth on the margins. Fully expanded autumn leaves were larger in weight and area than summer leaves. The autumn leaves had lower leaf mass area and density than the summer leaves. Leaves were covered by considerably more trichomes in summer than in autumn. Anatomical leaf structure also changed with the season. The summer leaves were thick, with a lower number of chloroplasts in the cells of the compact mesophyll. Autumn leaves are thinner, with loose mesophyll. Chloroplasts from the two seasonal types of leaves differ on account of starch grain and plastoglobule content. The large variations in leaf density and thickness recorded here confirm great differences in cell size and amounts of structural tissue within species. Seasonal dimorphism of leaves may result from seasonal drought or from seasonality in leaf production, leaf fall or incoming solar radiation. Within this new context of seasonal leaf dimorphism, P. argentea can still be distinguished by the absence of deeply divided leaflets on late-formed leaves. The results confirmed the presence of several morpho- anatomical leaf traits of P. argentea that allow the species to adapt to environmental seasonal conditions.",

Surrogate variables like Pignatti's bioindicator values or dissimilarity indices can provide further insights regarding succession trajectories aggregating the combined effects of changes in the cover/abundance of taxa. The land-use abandonment in an area in the estuary of the River Aliakmon, N. Greece, provides an opportunity to study medium-term rates and patterns during the first twelve years of vegetation succession. Cluster and time-series analyses of turnover rates, Sørensen's dissimilarity index and Pignatti's bioindicator values revealed clear differences in succession patterns and rates among permanent plots. Succession rates and patterns in the study area were found to be dominated by two ecological factors. On the one hand, availability of fresh water, assumed by the proximity to the river, allows the fast growing Populus alba to develop a forest canopy that radically alters the shading environment which, in its turn, controls succession trajectories. Increased soil salinity on the other hand, allows salt-tolerant taxa to be quickly established, and defines the species inventory on these sites as early as the first years of succession.",

These species are clearly distinguished by the lamina, which is in B. matricariifolium 2-pinnatifid, while in B. lunaria it is 1-pinnate with trapezoid to flabellate pinnae. Although chamonile grapefern has a large range of distribution, it is everywhere a rare species that has some kind of protection status in the most European countries.

This work focuses on the study of the polymorphic pollen assemblage of three annual pansies: Viola arvensis, V. kitaibeliana, and V. hymettia, and on the assessment of its variability both within a population and within the same plant. In all the species, with both large and small flowers, 3-, 4- and 5-aperturate pollen grains were observed, with a large prevalence of 4-aperturate types. No pollen grains with 6 apertures were found. No significant variability of the pollen assemblage among flowers of the same plant was observed. In addition, in these three Viola species the frequencies of the various pollen morphs are also fairly constant among plants of the same population.",

To reveal the pollen characteristics of Ae. lepidioides , light microscope and SEM studies were conducted. Additionally, in the present study the anatomical features of Ae. lepidioides were also studied for the first time. The Ae. lepidioides leaves were found to be linear-oblanceolate, with an entire margin and a subacute to obtuse apex. The seeds were found to be dark brown and oval-shaped, with reticulated surface ornamentation. Anatomical studies found roots in the secondary growth stage, with xylem-filled pith. The stem was in the primary growth stage, featuring a multi-layer cortex under its outermost single-layered epidermis, a pronounced endodermis and a central cylinder beneath. The leaves were thick, amphistomatic and covered with a prominent wax layer. Their mesophyll was equifacial, and their stoma type was anisocytic. A stomatal index of 26 was found for the upper epidermis, while a corresponding index of 28.4 was found for the lower epidermis. The pollens were monad, radially symmetrical and isopolar.

We also tested the viability of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Hungarian Lake Phytoplankton Index (HLPI) as proposed metrics in the standard regulatory monitoring procedure. The phytoplankton samples, Chl-a and physical- chemical parameters were taken on a monthly basis from April to September in 2016 and 2019. In 2016, the most dominant species was Pantocsekiella ocellata (Pantocsek) K.T.Kiss &amp;amp; Ács, while in 2019 it was accompanied by Ceratium hirundinella (O.F.Müller) Dujardin. According to Chl-a, Lake Visovac was within the limits of oligo- to mesotrophic status. Based on the HLPI index, the Lake ecological status was assessed as Good. Chl-a showed a statistically significant positive correlation with temperature, while HLPI was positively correlated with oxygen and Secchi depth. We propose the use of Chl-a for rapid bioassessment on a weekly basis, whilst more complex HLPI index should be applied monthly. Further improving the confidence level of the metrics used to assess the ecological status and a comprehensive revision of boundaries for included indicators is of fundamental importance.",

In addition to the complex taxonomic characteristics of the genus, sexual dimorphism leads to sex-specific differences in the morphology of juniper species, which further complicates the delimitation of species. Two of these species, Juniperus oxycedrus L., which occurs in the western part of the Mediterranean, and J. deltoides R.P.Adams, which occurs in the eastern part, have only recently been delimited as separate species. To further support the delimitation of the species, we examined the phenotypic traits of the cones and needles of both species for both sexes. Three populations from the western and three from the eastern part of the Mediterranean region were sampled and a total of 2400 needles, 1200 cones and 1200 seeds were measured and analyzed. Both needles and cones of J. oxycedrus were slightly larger, longer and wider than those of J. deltoides and also less variable. Sexual dimorphism was observed in most of the needle traits measured, with the majority of traits in J. oxycedrus being larger in females than in males. Although sexual dimorphism was confirmed based on needle morphology, no consistent pattern of diversity was observed between the two species. In addition, variability among populations of J. oxycedrus was higher than that of J. deltoides . Our results confirm the previous species delimitation and open the possibility for further exploration of sex-specific differences in adaptability, as well as the potential implications for differential management and conservation of individuals of both sexes.",

Specifically, we aimed to determine the presence of the hybrid taxon P . × saportae and to validate the controversial taxonomic status of P. calcivora at the molecular and morphological levels. Our combined results indicate the presence of two well separated groups of populations. The first group included all individuals of P. terebinthus and the individuals initially assigned to the potential taxon P. calcivora based on leaf morphology, suggesting that there is no support for the described taxon P. calcivora and that it should be considered as a synonym for P. terebinthus . The second group corresponded to P. lentiscus and included the majority of the presumed hybrid individuals of P . × saportae . However, four hybrid individuals were confirmed at the molecular level and were placed between the two parental taxa in the phylogenetic tree, confirming the presence of P. × saportae in Croatia. Although confirmed P. × saportae individuals were genetically closer to P. lentiscus , they were morphologically more similar to P. terebinthus , hindering their correct identification in the field.",

Despite its great botanical, ornamental and pharmaceutical value, a thorough investigation of Ae. hippocastanum habitat diversity in its native distribution range has not been conducted yet. The present study aims at the syntaxonomic classification and ecological features of plant communities dominated by this species across its overall native distribution range. On the basis of 55 phytosociological relevés, five ecologically, floristically, and spatially well differentiated clusters were identified, with the main revealed gradients of differentiation being geographic location (longitude, latitude), altitude, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. The distinct microhabitats with a special refugial character where these plant communities occur meet the species’ requirement for relatively high air and soil humidity. They have allowed the preservation of Ae. hippocastanum through time highlighting their great conservational value. The last one could be useful for the implementation of some appropriate measures for effective conservation of these communities.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of seed imbibition and hormopriming with 0.1 mM gibberellic acid (GA3) on germination performance and biochemical changes in fenugreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) radicles. The results showed that hydropriming and imbibition with GA3 significantly improved germination performance and radicle growth. Concurrently, treatments induced stimulation of the antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbic peroxidase, catalase and guaiacol peroxidase, and decreased lipid peroxidation, stimulated an increase in total non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and reduced glutathione content. Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and cytochemical analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in situ confirmed the role of imbibition in stimulating ROS. Interestingly the effects of imbibition with gibberellic acid were more effective then hormopriming, probably due to the partial degradation of GA3 during dehydration process.",

To gain an understanding of the dormancy status and germination needs of C. persicus, seed characteristics, seed coat permeability and different dormancy-breaking treatments were assessed. The results revealed that C. persicus seed coats are water-impermeable and that both cold and warm stratification were effective in breaking dormancy. Furthermore, GA3 pretreatment with combination of either cold or warm stratification proved successful in releasing dormancy. However, the highest germination percentage and rate as well as seed vigour was achieved by mechanical scarification followed by H2SO4 application and warm stratification. Warm stratification was recognized to be more favourable for overcoming seed dormancy and promoting seedling survival than cold stratification. Notably, the influence of population type on germination capacity was found to be negligible. These findings may facilitate the conservation and collection management of this threatened plant species, which is currently underrepresented in ex situ conservation efforts.",

On the basis of this evidence, we have investigated which ecological and biological traits may have allowed its establishment and spread, and could trigger its further expansion in the Aeolian Islands in the near future. Several factors seem to have favoured its success on a global scale, such as the wide edaphic and climatic range, the tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance, and the production of toxic metabolites that protect it from herbivore browsing and from competition with other plants. The study of the organisms that perform pollination and seed dispersal is probably the key to understanding the local naturalization of this plant, introduced about three centuries ago in Europe and the Mediterranean, here discussed in detail for the first time.",

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in consumer products and possess antimicrobial properties, making them important in assessing nanoparticle effects on plants. In the present study, we examined the impact of AgNPs (0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mg L-1) on wheat root PCD by evaluating parameters such as the mitotic index, chromosomal behaviors, nuclear deformation, cytochrome c release, caspase-1-like activity, and the expression of cysteine protease genes ( TaVPE4 , TaMCA1, and TaMCA4 ). Our findings revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the mitotic index ratio and increased chromosomal abnormalities induced by AgNPs. Additionally, we observed various hallmarks of PCD, including chromatin condensation, slight DNA smear, reduction in mitochondrial inner membrane potential, and cytochrome c release to the cytoplasm as well as increased caspase-1-like activity and TaVPE4 gene expression. Notably, the gene expressions of TaMCA1 and TaMCA4 were found to be antagonistically regulated by AgNPs, further indicating the induction of PCD by AgNP treatment. Overall, our study provides evidence of AgNP-induced PCD in wheat roots, elucidating the involvement of cysteine protease genes in this process.",

    "abstract": "The black pine is a characteristic Mediterranean pine species and extends from Spain eastward to Southern France, Italy, Austria, the Balkans and Türkiye. Black pine is a fire tolerator and has a distinctive natural fire regime differently from the serotinous red pine and Aleppo pine forests in Mediterranean. Black pine forests are one of the ecosystems that are most affected by changing fire regimes. Fires in these forests generally occur as low intensity surface fires. The black pine is a light-demanding species and in pure stands it forms single layer structure with self-pruning. It also has a thick bark. Therefore, heat during surface fires does not have a lethal effect on the trees and crown fires will not be generated due to self-pruning. However, with changing climatic conditions and forest structure based on human use and management, the fires in black pine forests have begun to become crown fires in large areas. Since the black pine does not have any adaptation to crown fires, the trees are killed and no regeneration occurs. This process results in the degradation of black pine forests into other vegetation types such as oak woodlands, rock rose ( Cistus spp.) scrublands or bracken fern ( Pteridium aquilinum L. (Kuhn)) herbaceous vegetation. This holds true for the whole of the distribution of the black pine in the Mediterranean. Therefore, a silvicultural approach ensuring fires occur as surface fires only should be employed in the existing black pine forests and the areas degraded after fires should be restored in an ecological way to re-establish the black pine.",

These xerophytic species inhibit transpiration in different ways, depending on the number, the form and the position of trichomes, whether they are dead hairs or live glandular structures. The Salvia genus is characterized on one hand by multicellular, uniseriate and scaled dead hairs and on the other hand there are several types of glandular structures, generally with voluminous heads. Lavender and rosemary (Lavandula angustifolia Mill, and Rosmarinus officinalis L.) have well-developed ramified forms of dead hairs with different ends and different levels of flexibility. The representatives of the Satureja genus have cone-shaped tri­ chomes, showing predominant glandular structures (with unicellular base, unicellular stalk and twelve-cell head) and a slight structural variation. While glandular trichomes are frequent in this genus, non-glandular trichomes are rare and few. In Salvia, although no glandular trichomes are developed, it has numerous simple, uniseriate, multicellular hairs. This is how the leaf epidermis, by xeromorphic changes, ensures the preservation of the entire plant.",

The most reliable character with which to distinguish E. ciliatum from all native European Epilobium species is the presence of conspicuous longitudinal white stripes on the seed testa. If seeds are not available, E. ciliatum may easily be misidentified as E. roseum. With fieldwork and revision of herbarium material we ascertained that the invasion towards the territory discussed came from the north, which is in agreement with the north west to south east direction of the spread in Europe. At least in Eastern Slovenia E. ciliatum has already become an important member of ruderal plant communities. Rapid spreading and naturalization as in the case of E. ciliatum can give rise to concern that it will replace some indigenous species with a similar ecology or hybridise and so by introgression cause »genetic« pollution of native relatives’ populations. Further spread to the south and east is expected.",

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and GST analyses revealed significant differences among the investigated populations. A significant correlation between genetic distance and geographical distance was revealed by the Mantel test. However, reticulation analysis indicated the occurrence of gene flow among most of the populations studied. Principal component analysis (PCA) plot showed that the number of capitula, length of the cauline leaf and plant height were the most variable morphological characters.

Based on the relative frequencies of these five types, specimens from Lake Baikal were shown to be different from those of the other two lakes. Specimens from Lake Baikal are remarkably smaller both in length and breadth; specimens from the other two lakes are longer than those from Lake Baikal, though specimens from Lake Kurilskoye are wider than those from Lake HA¶vsgA¶l. Thus, clear differences in morphological features are recognized between the specimens from these three lakes.Â",

    "abstract": "Two types of thylakoid degradation are described, both including leaf bleaching (i.e. chlorophyll degradation) and destruction of the photosynthetic membranes. The first type of degradation is characterized by coiling of single thylakoids and by cup-shape stacking of grana thylakoids. This type of thylakoid degradation was observed in leaves of the aurea varieties (conditional mutants) of several trees and shrubs. Leaf bleaching and thylakoid damage required strong sun-illumination and was repairable by shading, although only in young, still growing leaves. A structurally similar type of membrane damage, although not repairable, was detected in wheat and bean leaves treated with cadmium, followed by sun-exposure. The formation of interthylakoidally located membrane coils was not always dependent on strong light; they were also found in plastids of senescing leaves of Sophora japonica. A second type of thylakoid degradation appeared as the result of irreversible damage: leaf bleaching induced by treatment with amitrole, followed by sun-exposure. The damage began with tight stacking of long straight grana thylakoids. Later, on plane and perpendicularly oriented sections of these grana thylakoids, osmiophilic particles with diameters around 8 nm became visible. These were arranged in hexagonal arrays, with an approximate spacing of 12 nm. The possible origin of these regular structures is discussed. Structurally similar substructures in tightly stacked grana thylakoids were also detected in plastids of the subepidermal cells of Cucurbita pepo var. ovifera and pyriformis during fruit ripening, i.e. during the chloroplast-chromoplast transition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Benthic diatoms are widely used in Europe and worldwide to access ecological status of running waters. One of key goals of Water Framework Directive is to classify rivers and streams using biological quality elements and type specific reference conditions. According to system B which incorporates additional abiotic descriptors, there are 24 water types in Croatia. For biological analyses 92 rivers and streams with 140 sampling points were chosen and sampled for benthic diatoms and water chemistry simultaneously. Self organizing map (SOM) analysis was used to define biotypes from species composition and abundance of benthic diatoms. Grouping of samples in SOM resulted in 10 distinctive groups. Based on their geographical position and site characteristics, groups represent sites with similar properties (as waterbed, catchment size, altitude, size of stream) belonging to different ecoregions in Croatia. Analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) among SOM groups concerning ammonia, nitrates and total phosphorus. Indicator species analysis (IndVal) singled out species that were significantly characteristic (p&lt;0.05) for SOM and abiotic types. Compared to abiotic groups, in which 7 out of 24 have no indicator species, all SOM groups have one or several characteristic diatom species, thus indicating diatom assemblages as valuable site descriptors. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates analysis also indicated that SOM grouping of samples is statistically reliable. Grouping of similar sites, although placed into different abiotic types, makes SOM groups with its corresponding representative species an easy tool for water quality assessment and description of reference assemblage.",

This study was conducted to determine the comparative growth and photosynthetic responses of selected heat-resistant (cv. Sadaf) and heat-susceptible (cv.

Fifteen day old plants were shifted to plexiglass-fitted canopies to create GH conditions and data were recorded at each growth stage. The results revealed that the seasons, GH conditions and cultivars had large effects on plant growth and photosynthetic attributes. Simulated GH conditions increased the canopy temperature 4-7 °C in spring and 3-5 °C in autumn, but increased relative humidity by 2-3% in spring and 5-9% in autumn season. Although GH reduced the growth of both cultivars, shoot dry mass was reduced more in spring grown heat-susceptible maize at all growth stages. Although the cultivars showed a decrease in growth and photosynthesis, GH conditions resulted in less damage to cv. Sadaf than cv. Agatti-2002 in both seasons. Major indicators of sensitivity to GH effect were loss of chlorophyll b and carotenoids, reductions in net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and possibly reduced ability of Rubisco to fix CO 2 in sensitive maize.",

Numerical analyses of selected 58 relevés representing dwarf shrub vegetation on rock ledges made it possible to distinguish: Ephedro glaucae- Spiraeion baldschuanicae and Ephedrion regeliano-fedtschenkoi alliances, as well as Spiraeetum baldschuanicae, Rhamnetum coriaceae, Pentaphylloidetum parvifoliae and Pentaphylloidetum dryadanthoidis associations, community of Ephedra glauca and community of Rhamnus minuta. The classification of vegetation of dwarf shrubs on rock walls occurring in the Pamir Alai Mts is proposed. Because of the species composition, physiognomy and microhabitat conditions, the plant communities were included into Artemisio santolinifoliae- Berberidetea sibiricae class Ermakov et al. 2006. The main factors determining the species composition of the classified associations seem to be the elevation above sea level.The newly described syntaxa are largely defined by species restricted to very narrow ranges in Middle Asia.",

In all, 109 plant taxa within 35 families were found. The highest number of taxa belongs to the families Poaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae. Specific habitat conditions, characterized by moderately wet and moderately acidic soil with intermediate fertility and the effects of the continental climate favour the development of different plant life forms. Out of the total recorded plant taxa, hemicryptophytes make up 59.6%, followed by therophytes (22.0%) and geophytes (13.8%). Chorological analysis shows that the most numerous are plants of Eurasian (33.9%), Pontic-Central-Asian (21.1%) and Central European (21.1%) floral elements. According to their status in the Red List, three critically endangered (CR), one vulnerable (VU) and three nearly threatened (NT) plant species were found. Altogether, the steppe-like grassland in Bilje is a unique habitat rich in valuable plants of the Croatian flora, including the critically endangered Doronicum hungaricum , therefore it is of great importance to preserve it. Important management tools include mowing and controlling the spreading of cultivated and invasive plant species.",

Various Amaranthus species are important components of the weed flora in tea plantations on acid soils in north Iran. In this study, four Amaranthus species (A. blitoides, A. retroflexus, A. cruentus, and A. tricolor) were grown under hydroponic conditions with total Al concentrations of 0, 20, 50, 200, and 400 µM corresponding to free Al3+ activity of 0, 3.75, 11.97, 60.34, and 125 µM, respectively. Low Al concentrations (20, 50, or 200 µM) stimulated plant growth, A. tricolor demonstrated the highest improvement in shoot growth (93%), whereas A. retroflexus exhibited the greatest improvement in root biomass (367%), total root length (173%), and aproot length (32%). Although the response of shoot biomass to 400 µM Al varied among species, all species were able to accumulate Al in the leaves above the critical level considered for Al hyperaccumulation (1 mg g–1 DW). Our findings revealed Al accumulation in Amaranthus species for the first time at the genus and family levels, suggesting that these species are suitable for the restoration and revegetation of acid-eroded soils.",

In this research, the effects of four artificial sweeteners on plant stress markers in Triticum aestivum L. were investigated. Wheat seedlings were grown from seeds in soil containing artificial sweeteners (saccharin, sodium cyclamate, sucralose, aspartame) in different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100 mg kg-1). Plants were irrigated at regular intervals to maintain field capacity moisture and harvested after 15 days of growth. Electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll and carotenoid content, and antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase) activities were determined in harvested leaves. Comparisons between control samples and test samples were statistically evaluated at a 95% confidence interval to determine significant differences. Overall, significant increases in chlorophyll and carotenoid content, and some antioxidant enzyme activities were observed in wheat plants exposed to artificial sweeteners in the soil. A significant increase in electrolyte leakage was observed with saccharin and aspartame treatment, indicating that these sweeteners can cause membrane damage in wheat. Chlorophyll a nd POX activity were the most sensitive stress parameters in wheat. This study showed the importance of evaluating the potential impact of anthropogenic pollutants that may be present in treated wastewater and consequently affect plants.",

Cell suspensions were initiated and cells were incubated for 72h in the medium with sucrose as a control, or treated during the same period with glucose or 3-O-methylglucose (3OMG). Cellular and extracellular proteins, separated electrophoretically, showed that sugar-induced protein expression was cell line-specific. More differences were visible in extracellular and in glycoprotein than on cellular protein patterns. The 3OMG downregulated while glucose upregulated cellular glycoproteins. In the case of extracellular proteins, glucose and 3OMG were equally effective in both downregulation and upregulation of protein expression. Sialic acid was indicated as a glycan conjugate in sugar beet. Carbohydrate-induced gene expression was related to the developmental state of cells.",

D. callizonus and D. tenuifolius showed particular sets of SSR alleles. D. glacialis ssp. gelidus , D . henteri and D. nardiformis proved to share almost the same alleles in most of the loci. The highest genetic diversity was observed in D. glacialis ss p . gelidus and D. tenuifolius in locus MS-DINMADSBOX. Allelic patterns across Dianthus species indicate that the mean number of different alleles was highest in D. glacialis ssp. gelidus , while the number of effective alleles was highest in D. tenuifolius . There are no particular differences in individuals belonging to the same species. Genetic diversity is generally low, ranging from 0.18 ( D. callizonus ) to 0.44 ( D . henteri ).

Most of the beneficial properties of quince leaf extracts may be assigned to their high content of phenolic compounds, particularly tannins. In this research, we have evaluated the efficiency of various methods for phenolic extraction from quince leaves and determined detailed phenolic profiles of different extracts. The results indicated that leaf drying is a suitable pretreatment for enhancing the extraction of phenolic compounds. Higher extraction of phenolics was achieved at higher temperatures (i.e. infusion or decoction). Phenolic profiles of quince leaf extracts differed among the extraction solvents and time of extraction. Flavanols prevailed in extracts obtained by decoction and ethanolic maceration, while extracts obtained by maceration in water and infusion were rich in phenolic acids. A highly concentrated quince leaf extract was attained by ethanolic maceration, using a standard ratio of solvent and leaf material.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change is expected to reduce water availability in several wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) growing areas. Drought, during and immediately after sowing can compromise germination, seedling development, and ultimately crop yield. Our study’s objective was to investigate early drought stress resistance and evaluate genetic diversity of four bread wheat cultivars – three modern elite germplasm lines (‘Antequera’, ‘Jordão’ and ‘Roxo’) and an ancient Portuguese cultivar (‘Mestiço’) – at five water potentials, ranging from 0 to –1.5 MPa. Germination was annotated daily during eight days. Dry and fresh weights as well as root and shoot growth were measured. Genetic variability among cultivars was evaluated using start codon targeted (SCoT) markers. Overall, when water potential was lowered, germination rate and seedling growth were delayed. Final germination percentages were only affected by the higher stress intensity. This study reinforces the importance of research into ancient wheat cultivars, such as ‘Mestiço’. This cultivar showed the highest genetic difference when compared with the remaining cultivars. ‘Mestiço’ presented the highest coleoptile size, high vigor index values, and the lowest variation in water content due to stress conditions. Therefore, it may be able to germinate in extremly dry soil and be the least affected by drought stress. Still, due to the comparatively reduced yield of older wheat cultivars, stress tolerance should be researched within elite cultivars. Among these, Jordão revealed particularly good germination and early biomass development characteristics across water potentials, presenting a likely choice for future studies under drought stress conditions.",

The top two-thirds of the plants representing thirty individuals was harvested at full flowering from eleven sites and analyzed for the content of bioactive compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography after being dried at room temperature. Morphological characterization of the wild populations was performed on twenty randomly selected individuals from each plant-growing locality. The content of the tested compounds, except for caffeic acid and avicularin, and some morphological traits, namely, the density of leaf translucent glands and black nodules and leaf area varied significantly with the investigated populations. It was observed that hypericin and pseudohypericin contents were connected positively with leaf black nodule density, but negatively with leaf area and the contents of hyperforin, quercitrin and 13,118-biapigenin were correlated positively with leaf translucent gland density. Data presented here could be useful in determining future targets for further wide-ranging studies on this endemic species as well as in identifying superior germplasm in terms of high chemical content.",

The taxon was afterwards described as a separate species (Kerndorff et al. 2012), the holotype being collected in Kırklareli Province, European Turkey. The species was for the first time mapped in two floristic regions of Bulgaria. The diagnostic characters based on the general morphology and leaf anatomy were defined from the natural populations of the species and compared to the type specimen and relevant data from the literature. The phylogenetic position of the species was clarified by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS: ITS1 + 5.SsrDNA + ITS2) and comparison of the obtained sequence with those annotated in NCBI. A phylogenetic tree was built using Bayesian phylogeny. Results have shown the highest degree of phylogenetic similarity with C. adamioides from Turkey. The closest relative C. ranjeloviciorum Kernd., Pasche, Harpke et Raca remains in the proximity. Our morphological, anatomical and molecular analyses have revealed that the Bulgarian population shows a peculiar combination of characters specific to C. adamioides.",

Seeds were collected from specimens widespread on the alpine and subalpine grasslands and dwarf shrubs of Mount Uludağ (1800–1900 m a.s.l.). Depending on the concentration, GA3 and the combination of hormone and moist chilling treatments promoted seed germination in both dark and light/dark conditions. After 4-month-moist chilling treatment, seeds germinated 27% in a light/dark and 80% in a dark regime. Hormone and moist chilling treatments reduced the mean germination time. Our results showed that J. supina seeds have physiological dormancy, require prolonged times of moist chilling and preferentially complete germination in darkness.",

The turnover of highly repetitive satellite DNAis an important element in genome organization and evolution in plants. Here we study the presence, physical distribution and abundance of the satellite DNAfamily AhTR1 in Anemone. Twenty-two Anemone accessions were analyzed by PCR to assess the presence of AhTR1, while fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern hybridization were used to determine the abundance and genomic distribution of AhTR1. The AhTR1 repeat unit was PCR-amplified only in eight phylogenetically related European Anemone taxa of the Anemone section. FISH signal with AhTR1 probe was visible only in A. hortensis and A. pavonina, showing localization of AhTR1 in the regions of interstitial heterochromatin in both species. The absence of a FISH signal in the six other taxa as well as weak signal after Southern hybridization suggest that in these species AhTR1 family appears as relict sequences. Thus, the data presented here support the »library hypothesis« for AhTR1 satellite evolution in Anemone. Similar species-specific satellite DNAprofiles in A. hortensis and A. pavonina support the treatment of A. hortensis and A. pavonina as one species, i.e. A. hortensis s.l.",

Two associations were determined: Valeriano carinatae-Calepinetum irregularis de Foucault 1988 and Geranio lucidi-Cardaminetum hirsutae de Foucault et Frileux 1983. Valeriano-Calepinetum irregularis is found on sunny sites with deep soil horizons and Geranio-Cardaminetum hirsutae on sunny sites with only a shallow soil horizon mixed with small partitions of bedrock. According to the floristic and syntaxonomic analysis, it was decided to classify the communities into these associations, which have been already described in the western part of Europe, but to distinguish two geographical races Valeriano carinatae-Calepinetum irregularis var. geogr.

The other 73 types did not reach percentages over 3% in any of the 49 samples. The families present in the highest number of samples were: Fabciceae, Asteraceae, Cistaceae and Rosaceae the families that had the highest percentages were: Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Ericaceae and Rosaceae. The pollen types that appeared in the most samples were: Papaver rhoeas (39 samples) and Rubus ulmifolius (38); the pollen types that reached the highest abundance percentages were: Erica arborea, Onobiychis viciifolia and Reseda luteola.

However, the literature shows that the studies in this area have had a monospecific or monogeneric use. As a consequence, intergeneric comparative descriptions have not been possible. In the present work we propose an analytical method to compare the morphological expressivity of individuals included in the genera Dianthus and Lotus from the north of Portugal by means of a contingency matrix. This matrix was elaborated on the basis of amplitude parameters, in order to describe the variability present in the basic matrix of each genus studied. The results pointed out the existence of opposite phenotypic behaviours dependent on the altitudinal variation, thus indicating the importance of the analysis between different groups of taxa as a reference for the comparison of their morphological expressivities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The genus Eucalyptus encompasses several species of industrial importance. Many of these species have been subjected to genetic characterization using different kinds of DNA markers. More than 1000 microsatellites have been identified from the genome of eucalypts and they are highly amenable for cross species transferability. During cross amplification of microsatellites, homoplasy is reported in many species in which although the allele size might be the same, the sequences are not. Thus, it is essential to ascertain the DNA sequence homology with source and target microsatellite repeats. Accordingly, fifty five alleles from six microsatellite loci (ECc1, ECc2, Eg61, Embra100, Embra1468 and Embra2002) were amplified in two inter-specific hybrid populations (Eucalyptus tereticornis × E. grandis and E. tereticornis × E. camaldulensis) and sequenced. The results showed that all the microsatellite loci were amplifying the target repeat types except for the loci Eg61 and Embra2002. The locus Eg61 has target repeat of (CAA)(GAT) but the sampled alleles had either (CAA)(GAT) or (GAT) alone. Similarly, the Embra2002 locus was targeting interrupting repeats of (CCA)..(CCA), but the sequenced alleles had repeats of (CCA) with or without interruption. Nevertheless, the allele size estimated in electrophoresis for hybrids was in conformity with that of the parent alleles. This study suggests the need for validation of the repeat characteristics of microsatellites by sequencing of the alleles particularly in cross species amplification.",

The recording of its populations on the edge of the loess cliff in Bansko Hill a part of which belongs to the Important Plant Area and Natura 2000, confirms the significance of this unique habitat in preserving rare and endangered plants.",

Most available data are more than 50 years old, and include only four localities in Croatia, exclusively in the islands of the Mediterranean region. During a floristic survey of the island of Molat (Northern Dalmatia) we recorded a small population in Zapuntelsko polje, in a damp, shallow depression, seasonally occurring as a temporary pond. Comparison with the existing literature shows that C. litoralis often occurs in Mediterranean temporary ponds and similar globally important and threatened habitats. We strongly believe that careful studies of populations of C. litoralis and other species with similar ecologies are necessary in order to preserve these habitats and therefore propose actions to achieve this goal.",

In this study, based on genome-wide analysis, we identified five putative PAO genes ( LuPAO1 to LuPAO5 ) in flax ( Linum usitatissimum L.) that contain the amino-oxidase domain and FAD-binding-domain. The expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR revealed spatial variations in the expression of LuPAOs in different organs. In addition, the expression level of LuPAOs in the flax cell suspension culture was increased by treatment with methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) or pectin, but not with salicylic acid or chitosan. This indicates that LuPAOs might be involved in the MeJA-mediated biological activities. Taken together, our genome-wide analysis of PAO genes and expression profiling of these genes provide the first step toward the functional dissection of LuPAOs.",

The first Hungarian stand was discovered in 2018, and others in 2020. Based on our studies, we detail its morphological characteristics in comparison with other Lepidium species. We present a new drawing and a table to help identify the species. Lepidium oblongum is easily identifiable by its divided (lobed or lobed-dentated) upper stem leaves. By analyzing selected climatic parameters we show that the new European habitats are found in the drier and cooler summer subtype of the humid continental climate belt. In Hungary, it spreads directly along the railways. The establishment of individual populations can be influenced by the location of cargo unloading and the movement of railway workers. Lepidium oblongum occupies gravelly, sun-exposed habitats along Hungarian railway tracks such as loading platforms, guardhouses and goods stations. Based on its high stress and climatic tolerance and initial spread-rate, it is consider to be a naturalized member of the European adventive flora, that could be potentially invasive along the European railways.",

Earlier phylogenetic research of the genus has focused on several small groups within Thlaspi s.str. and lacks detailed morphological observations. The relationships among Eurasian taxa and the value of fruit morphology in defining them have yet to be studied. The aim of this study was to analyze 22 taxa belonging to the Nomisma, Thlaspi and Pterotropis sections of Thlaspi s.l. from Turkey using maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of Internal Transcript Spacer (ITS) sequences. We also analyzed their fruit morphological features. According to the results, the examined taxa fell into 2 main clades. Moreover, clade II showed 3 sub-clusters. Thlaspi huetii and T. aghricum were the most distant taxa with a distance of 0.49%; however, T. ochroleucum and T. violascens were found to be 99% similar. According to ITS region data based on multiple populations of each taxon, T. arvense, T. huetii, T. perfoliatum, T. violascens, T. cataonicum, T. elegans, T. rosulare and T. aghricum were placed together in one cluster, which indicates that they are monophyletic. Thlaspi elegans was found to be a polyploid complex based on bootstrap (BS) (a resampling technique that uses replacement sampling to estimate statistics in a population) values, which varied widely among the studied T. elegans taxa (98, 65 and 49%). Fruit morphology also supported the inter-specific relationships based on molecular data, and relationships found by ITS region data were compatible with fruit type and geographic distribution. A diagnostic key based on fruit morphology is provided for the identification of the examined Thlaspi taxa.",

Despite higher levels of lipid peroxidation, lower membrane stability index (MSI), decreased pigment content and phenolic compounds, and reduced activity of antioxidant enzymes observed under salinity, seedling growth indices, including plant height and biomass, increased significantly, and some protective and antioxidant molecules such as proline and flavonoids accumulated. Soluble protein level increased at the low salt concentration (200 mM) but decreased at other doses. Exogenous Arg treatment alone had less or no effect on plant biomass and other metabolites, but in combination with salt, further enhanced growth parameters, MSI and accumulation of soluble protein, phenolic compounds and proline. Arg-induced changes under salinity were associated with decreased lipid peroxidation, flavonoids content and antioxidant enzymes activity. These results show that S. europaea seedlings are well tolerant to applied salt doses. The treatment with exogenous Arg alone affects plant growth slightly, but in combination with salt, synergistically increases growth and salt tolerance of these plants by enhancing the accumulation of proline and antioxidant molecules instead of enzymatic antioxidant.",

The first voucher specimens and published data for D. pineti date back to the second half of 19 th century; 20 th century records are only occasional, therefore the species was regarded as rare. However, this investigation shows that it is widely distributed throughout Slovakia, mainly on tree bases, stumps or mossy soil in forests. The sub-oceanic D. lutea is recorded from Slovakia for the first time. Its historical occurrence in the Vihorlat Mounts complements our current observation in the Eastern Carpathians (Bukovske vrchy Mts) in 2002. From an investigation of its ecological requirements, it is evident that the species is confined to humid, well preserved forest biotopes. Within the studied territory the species has not been overlooked, but is extremely rare, which is the reason for including it in the Red List of Lichens of Slovakia as critically endangered. Vernacular names for both the species are introduced.",

    "abstract": "The phenology ofDeginia velebitica seeds, including such topics as maturation, dispersal and germination times, is still largely unknown. For the purpose of the present research, the seeds were collected in the Botanical Garden, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb and in the natural habitat (above Sibinj, Veliki vrh, Velika kapela mountain) at the time of natural dispersal. Freshly matured and collected seeds were placed under natural conditions (16–28 °C), at room temperature (24 °C), 21 °C and in greenhouse conditions (22/31 °C). Some of the seeds were placed at 5 °C for 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks and checked to see if cold stratification was needed. The most interesting part for the study of germination phenology was the exposure of the seeds to temperature conditions similar to those in nature (in the garden) and the definition of maximum and minimum temperatures of germination. Seed dispersal begins soon after maturation and all seeds (100%) are dispersed in one season. After 28 days, low percentages of germination, of 8.77% (at 24 °C), 6.66% (at 21 °C), 14.55% (at 22–31 °C) and 0% (at 16–28 °C) were found, indicating non-deep physiological dormancy (PD) in Degenia seeds. Non-deep PD is broken by cold stratification and by seeds being stored dry at room temperature (afterripening). The highest percentage of germination was at 22–31 °C, and the lowest at 21 °C indicating that Degenia velebitica germinates in late summer or early autumn. Seeds do not require light for germination, but germination in the light is 54% better at 22–31 °C, 35% at room temperature and 7% better at 16–28 °C than in the dark. The seeds collected in the Botanical Garden germinated 18%, 28% and 30% better at 22–31 °C, 16–28 °C than seeds collected near the place called Bile after 63 days of germination.",

Electron micrographs of thin sections, particularly when combined with TCH-Ag-proteinate staining, afforded particularly clear insights into the ultrastructure of the fibrils and their formation next to the plastoglobules, while the crystals were seen only in transverse section. In the negatively stained isolates, on the other hand, the crystals were well visible as elongated platelets, which could be as short as 1 mm and only about 1.5 nm thick. They were occasionally aggregated into clusters with irregular outlines, about 2–3 mm in diameter. The crystals likely contained carotenoids and their structure was comparable to the large carotene crystals found in other plants.",

JA (0.475-47.5 nmol.L-1) promoted floral induction under long-day (LD) and short day (SD) conditions, while it had no effect on turion induction. The inhibitory effect of JA on flowering and turion induction was observed at a JA concentration of 237.5 nmol.L-1 and 475 nmpl.L-1. Under the same conditions, flowering and induction of turions were enhanced by EDDHA (20.5 nmol..L-1(. The combination od EDDHA and JA had an additive effect on promotion of floral induction, which was promoted significantly in experiments with LD preculture. The results obtained by quantitative determination of endogenous JA levels in Spirodela polyrhiza at two growth stages support our previous findings that JA may regulate floral induction. The levels of endogenous JA decreased from 226±12 ng·g–1 fresh weight during the vegetative stage in LD to 38.1±3.5 ng·g–1 in the flowering plants. In SD the levels of endogenous JA decreased from 62±9ng·g–1 fresh weight during vegetative stage to 29.2±3.1 ng·g–1 in the flowering plants.",

Populations were collected from different habitats: Bangia atropurpurea from Lake Balaton and Batrachospermum gelatinosum from the Tapolca stream. Their photosynthesis was studied in a wide range of temperature (5–35 °C) and light intensity (0–1150 μmol m −2 s− 1 ) in a photosynthetron. We found both species’ photosynthesis maxima at 25 °C but B. atropurpurea had significantly higher photosynthetic production. Low and medium values were calculated for the species’ photoadaptation parameters. Compensation light intensities determined in this study were similar to those obtained in previous studies. Both species utilized light efficiently; photoinhibition was detected only at two measuring temperatures for Bangia and at four measuring temperatures for Batrachospermum . P-T characteristics of the species revealed that both have temperature optima at 25 °C under high and medium light intensities but there are no such remarkable optima at low irradiance. The biomass specific respiration of both species increased with increasing temperature. We confirmed the good light utilization of these red algal species but found temperature optima higher than reported previously.",

Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that regulates various physiological processes and is involved in response to biotic/abiotic stresses. This work investigated the effects of exogenous sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide (NO) donor, application on Cd toxicity in black poplar ( Populus nigra ). Black poplars were exposed to individual/combined CdCl 2 and SNP treatments for 21 days by complete randomized design with three replications. Cd concentrations increased in leaves, bark, and roots at Cd treatments, whereas Cd + SNP applications had alleviative effects on Cd exposures, except for leaves. Photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a , b , a + b and carotenoids) reduced with Cd treatments in leaves, while they increased in Cd + SNP applications. Similarly, plant biomass was reduced with Cd treatments, but Cd + SNP application prevented these reductions. SNP also alleviated malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) accumulation in leaves under Cd treatments. Catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) activities were also affected by Cd and Cd + SNP applications. Cd exposure also decreased Zn 2+ , Fe 2+ and Mn 2+ levels in leaves, bark and roots, while it increased Cu 2+ level in leaves and roots. This study concludes that Cd toxicity caused a reduction of plant growth and mineral nutrition parameters. However, SNP indicates great potentials for improving the growth under Cd toxicity in P. nigra .",

To determine resonance frequency of growth inhibition of C. raciborskii, cells were subjected to ELF square amplitude modulated waves (QAMW) with a range of frequencies (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 Hz) at single intensity of 100 V m–1 for 30 minutes. The results revealed that the highest growth inhibition of Cylindrospermopsis occurred upon exposure to 0.7 Hz QAMW for 30 min. ELF-EMF-exposed cultures exhibited a marked decrease in cell number, chlorophyll-a content and activity of antioxidant enzymes compared to control cultures, and this effect increased with the prolongation of exposure time. Moreover, ELF-EMF induced morphological changes in Cylindrospermopsis cells upon exposure to 0.7 Hz QAMW for 120 min, including shrinking and disintegration of cytoplasmic contents, and thickening of the cell wall. Changes in dielectric properties, as a measure of interaction of cellular constituents (e.g., plasma membrane, cell wall and cytoplasm), with electromagnetic fields were also observed for treated cells. Our results provide a new possibility for using ELF-EMFs to eliminate toxic cyanobacteria from drinking and recreational water sources.",

The results showed that cadmium stress reduces seed germination and seedling growth indices. Seed priming led to a significant increase in the germination percentage and rate, seedling dry weight and length, seedling vigor indices, as well as the catalase and peroxidase activity of borage seedlings under both cadmium stress and non-stress conditions. Among the priming treatments, the combination of hydro and hormone priming showed the greatest effects on the improvement of germination and seedling growth under cadmium conditions, significantly greater than those achieved with the individual uses of hydro or hormone priming. At all levels of cadmium stress, utilization of combined hydro and hormone priming led to a 0.9 to 11.53-fold, and 0.95 to 2.63-fold increase in seedling dry weight as compared with the control treatment and individual use of hydro or hormone priming, respectively. The highest activity of catalase and peroxidase enzymes in borage seedlings was obtained from seeds primed with the combination of hydro priming with 150 mg L–1 GA3, which was significantly higher than those of the other treatments. Generally, at all levels of cadmium stress, combined hydro and hormone (specially 150 mg L–1 GA3) priming had the most positive effects on seed germination, growth and biochemical properties of borage seedlings",

The aim of our study was to select sour cherry genotypes according to their genetic background as well as drought tolerance and investigate possible mechanisms of drought tolerance through the changes in photosynthetic apparatus (i.e. photosynthetic pigments content) and photosynthesis process assessed through chlorophyll fluorescence transient. All together with molecular markers (SSRS and AFLPs), relative water content (RWC), as indicator of plant water status, sort out two genotypes (Kelleris 16 and OS) opposite in regards to drought tolerance. Down-regulation of photosynthesis in drought treated Kelleris 16 plants was seen as changes in antenna complexes of PSII (decreased total chlorophylls content ( a+b ) and chlorophylls ratio ( a/b )). Despite unchanged maximum quantum yield of PSII in drought treated leaves of genotype OS, overall photosynthetic performance expressed as PI ABS was down-regulated in both investigated genotypes. However, decrement of PI ABS were much pronounced in genotype Kelleris 16 mainly because of changes in a certain fraction of RCs which become dissipative centres, seen as increase in ABS/RC and DI 0 /RC, in order to avoid photooxidative damage of photosynthetic apparatus. Also, electron transport, seen as decrease in ET 0 /(TR 0 -ET 0 ) and ET 0 /RC, was impaired which lead to poored CO 2 fixation and photosynthesis. Described changes in functioning of photosynthetic apparatus in drought treated plants of Kelleris 16 are main distinction between two investigated genotypes regarding to drought adaptation mechanisms.",

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of osmotic stress on the Croatian perennial species Fibigia triquetra (DC.) Boiss, adapted to a hot and dry habitat. Plants grown in culture conditions were subjected to isoosmotic concentrations of mannitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and certain physiological and oxidative stress parameters were analyzed during a period of 14 days. Dry weight and proline content in Fibigia triquetra shoots increased in response to osmotic stress while the relative water content decreased. After an initial rise, chlorophyll and carotenoid levels in treated plants dropped to untreated plant levels. Oxidative damage to proteins and especially to lipids was evident upon PEG-induced osmotic stress. Superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase appear to play an essential protective role in stressed plants. Regardless of the osmotic agent, accumulation of heat-shock proteins of 70 kDa was noticed under osmotic stress. The tolerance of the plant species to osmotic stress seems to be associated with increased capacity of the antioxidative system and efficient photoprotective system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Hungary Navicula jakovljevicii was firstly recorded in biofilm of Elodea nuttallii in 2005 in an oxbow of the catchment area of the River Danube. Subsequently, in 2006, N. jakovljevicii was also found in the same oxbow on reed stems as well. In the following years it appeared in another oxbow, suggesting an expanding distribution in the tributaries of the Danube in Hungary. The Hungarian population can be characterised as having mixed morphological features in comparison with other known N. jakovljevicii populations of Europe. When the morphological study was expanded, a similar, but 'giant form' was detect ed in fossil material. We found similarities and a possible connection between N. jakovljevicii and Navicula lucida, a diatom taxon described from a Neogene deposit in the Carpathian Basin. Despite the morphological similarities in the shape, apices, striae pattern and raphe structure of these two species, there are significant differences in valve dimensions: the valves of N. lucida are larger and more heavily silicified than N. jakovljevicii.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Papaya ( Carica papaya L., 2n = 18), a polygamous angiosperm, is a major fruit crop in tropical and subtropical regions. It is trioecious with three sex forms: male, female, and hermaphrodite, where sex determination is controlled by the XY chromosome pair with two slightly different Y chromosomes i.e. Y for male and Y’ 1 for hermaphrodite. Sex type determination in papaya, which cannot be determined either by embryo shape or morphology at the juvenile developmental stage, is an essential pre-requisite for crop improvement processes as it helps in identification of fruitful plants. Hence, molecular profiling could be used as an alternative that provides a quick and reliable identification of sex types in plantlets at initial stages only. In the present study we have validated the sex-linked sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker W11 using PCR detection assay among different cultivars of papaya i.e. dioecious with either female or male and gynodioecious with either female or hermaphrodites and also performed a double-blind test for validating the seedlings of 84 F1 plants, which resulted in their sex determination. The assay clearly gives 800 bp band in male plants in dioecious types and hermaphrodite in gynodioecious plants.",

Moist recovery was also applied to in-laboratory, artificially, charred barley, millet and lentil samples. After the treatments, the investigated remains were re-counted and the percentages of still recognizable remains for every plant species and for each method were recorded. Comparisons were made of the sensitivities of the investigated species and of the differences in the degree of macrofossil breakup depending on the method of recovery. Our investigation proved that flotation is a less aggressive method than wet sieving and that barley, horsebean and wheat carbonized macrofossils are resistant to moist treatments, while the breakup percentage of lentil and millet (from archaeological sites) is higher than 30%, which should be taken into account when deciding on the (non)use of water recovery in the investigations.",

The results were evaluated using Spearman rank order correlations. Analyzed soil samples contained very low to intermediate levels of physiologically active phosphorus, but were very rich in potash. Organic matter content of soil was high. Phenolic compound content was higher in leaves than in flowers or stems. The analyses showed that M. petraea possesses considerable quantities of phenolic compounds and has no specific demands for particular soil conditions. A negative correlation was found between soil phosphorus content and total phenols content in leaves and stems, and with the total phenolic acids content in flowers. Organic matter in soil also found to have a negative influence on total tannins content in stems. Among the tested geographical locations, the Mljet population showed a higher degree of separation from the remaining locations.",

The photochemical efficiency of the operculum and the pitcher-tube upper part was lower than that of the pitcher-tube lower part and wing, especially in hybrid B. In all hybrids, the wing had higher amount of chlorophyll a than other pitcher parts. In contrast, a higher amount of phenolic compounds, in particular anthocyanins, was measured in the operculum and the pitcher-tube upper part, parts which are red-coloured and participate in luring and trapping insects. Although there were some differences among the hybrids, the results show that amount of phenolic compounds and photosynthetic pigments as well as photochemical efficiency are related to the function of the pitcher part analysed.",

Morphologically, C. fialae is similar to the Serbian endemic C. serbica with which it shares following characteristics: auricules at the base of lower cauline leaves, stem and rosette leaves bipinnate, margin of leaflets serrate with hairy main stem and sepals, although it differs in having bigger petals and sepals, longer filaments and 1–2 lateral stems. C. fialae grows on lower altitudes in rocky ground within the vegetation of forest fringes of the sub-Mediterranean zone.

The establishment of A. leptophylla on the western part of the island of Mljet may be attributable to certain favourable environmental conditions, but essentially to higher air and soil humidity. Its unusual bryophyte-like life strategy, with short-living annual sporophytes, facilitates its survival under Mediterranean climate, generally unfavourable for pteridophytes.",

The three year variability of fruits and seeds was investigated in Berberis croatica (Vošac, Mt Biokovo, Rakov Potok near Zagreb) and in B. vulgaris (Fran Kušan Pharmaceutical Botanical Garden in Zagreb). Berberis croatica had the following dimensions of fruits (seeds): length 7.28-7.88 (4.57-5.03) mm; width 3.85-3.99 (width 1: 2.06-2.20; width 2: 1.44-1.63) mm; weight 0.065-0.078 (0.0116-0.0134) g. Dimensions of B. vulgaris fruits (seeds) were: length 10.20-11.29 (5.71-6.24) mm; width 5.29-5.83 (width 1: 2.40-2.71; width 2: 1.60-1.98) mm; weight 0.1602-0.2199 (0.0146-0.0235) g. The fruit shape of both species was similar and the length/width ratio was 1.91-2.04 in B. croatica and 1.77-2.07 in B. vulgaris. The number of seeds per fruit was 1.23-1.58 in B. croatica and 1.36-1.54 in B. vulgaris . Generally, fruits and seeds of B. vulgaris were significantly longer, wider and heavier than fruits and seeds of B. croatica . ANOVA showed significant statistical differences between populations for all analyzed fruit and seed traits while the species significantly differed in all traits, except in the fruit shape and number of seeds in fruit.",

The addition of quercetin neither supported the growth ofÂ the shoots nor induced the remission of symptoms in the infected plants. On the contrary, addition of quercetin induced browning of leaves and the appearance of black spots on theÂ leaves of treated infected and non-infected shoots. It also had no curative effect against theÂ pathogen. Phytoplasma presence was confirmed by nested PCR in infected shoots treated with quercetin through three subcultures.",

Three subassociations were distinguished (anthemidetosum incrassatae, hedypnoidetosum creticae and cardarietosum drabae), the distribution of which seems to depend on latitudinal alteration of rainfall. The new association has its optimum growth in habitats with moderate human influence, specifically in abandoned cultivations and wastelands. With respect to its floristic composition, the Rapistro rugosi-Hirschfeldietum incanae is close to anthropogenic vegetation with a high degree of naturalness, particularly to the therophytic, subnitrophilous vegetation of the Thero-Brometalia (Stellarietea mediae) and the perennial, subnitrophilous vegetation of Carthametalia lanati (Artemisietea vulgaris).",

    "abstract": "There are two North American ash species which have been acclimatized in north Croatian forest ecosystems: the white ash (Fraxinus americana L.) and the green ash (F. pennsylvanica Marshall). In the lowlands forests of the Drava River basin and Danube basin a total number of 960 subcompartments with North American ash species were established. According to the collected dendrological material the green ash was determined in twenty subcompartments. In those subcompartments the white ash was not found. Accordingly, the distribution of an important neophyte for wood production in the Drava River basin and Danube basin has been mapped for the first time. North American ash species are present in small, mostly isolated depressions where they were planted at the\r\nbeginning or in the middle of the 20th century. Also, they spontaneously spread to many locations and with other pioneer species colonize swamps and river islets. In these locations\r\nthe green ash has a pioneer and reclamation role in preparing habitats for the arrival and success of the native narrow-leaved ash (F. angustifolia Vahl). The timber value of North American ash species is small because the trees are usually bent by wind, snow and\r\nice. Also, the trees of North American ash species were more often pulled down than the trees of native species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite numerous data dealing with the biogenesis of photosynthetic membranes connected with specific functional alterations in higher plants this is still an insufficiently understood topic and is one of the most promising areas of research in plant biochemistry. The main goal of our study was to detect the impact of different temperatures on chlorophyll biosynthesis and the maximum quantum yield of PSII (F v /F m ). Therefore, we investigated the greening processes in etiolated sunflower cotyledons (Helianthus annuus L.) grown at different temperatures (10, 20 and 30 °C) during 24 h. The dynamics of chlorophyll a and b (Chl a and Chl b) accumulation as well as photosystem II (PSII) effi ciency were observed. We also evaluated combined effects of different temperatures (20 and 30 °C) and short-term application of increased irradiation (800 μmol m -2 s -1 ) on effective quantum yield of PSII (ΔF/F’ m ) and non photochemical quenching (NPQ) in cotyledons with fully developed PSII. Our results showed reduced chlorophyll accumulation and the arrest of PSII assembly at 10 °C in comparison with 20 and 30 °C. Further, the increased irradiance induced equal down regulation of effective quantum yield of PSII at 20 and 30 °C, with significantly higher capability of heat dissipation at 30 °C.",

The cotyledon and hypocotyl explants of 10-day sterile seedlings were treated with 1 μM and 2 μM 24-epiBL solutions (prepared with 70% acetone) for 30 seconds and applied explants were cultured on MS medium supplemented with 2 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) + NaCl (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mM). It was determined that the regeneration percentage as well as the shoot number/explant, the shoot length and the leaf number/shoot derived from both explants suffered NaCl stress after 30 days. 24-epiBL pretreatment against NaCl stress showed ameliorative effects and hypocotyl explants gave better results than cotyledon explants for these growth parameters. Different stages of shoot organogenesis from hypocotyl explants applied with 24-epiBL under salt stress were observed with scanning electron microscopy. As a result, it was shown that 24-epiBL treatment against NaCl stress may play an effective role in salt tolerance in M-28 tomato hybrid cultivar.",

Phylogenetic analysis based on the ITS data showed that all accessions of L. elbursensis formed a monophyletic clade, and L. elbursensis was a sister to the rest of Leutea species. Results of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis performed on the total genome showed that all individuals presented in the study belonged to two different genetic clusters. The individuals belong to L. petiolaris had a different genetic structure and yielded no traceable amount of essential oils. The essential oil obtained from the ripe fruits of L. elbursensis yielded 0.5–0.6% of volatile essential oils. In total, 15-29 volatile natural components were identified on the basis of their mass spectra characteristics and retention indices, in which α-pinene (33.18-43.22%), β-pinene (32.4-40.9%) were the major constituents. Our results indicate that L. elbursensis is a distinct species, segregated from the other species based on morphology, ITS data and AFLP profile. In addition, despite the relatively uniform genetic structure of L. elbursensis , the chemical composition of essential oil could be highly affected by different factors.",

The W lines with a white and translucent tissue phenotype showed the best maturation capacity on 3 % sucrose and 3 % maltose with 20 or 40 uM ABA. Sixty uM ABA inhibited embryo maturation. Media containing 6 % of either sucrose, glucose and maltose produced fewer mature embryos compared to media with 3 % of the same sugars.

    "abstract": "Abstract In the south-east of Italy, rocky coasts are almost entirely concentrated in the Apulia region. Several phytosociological papers have already dealt with the rocky coastal vegetation of the class Crithmo-Staticetea in some parts of the Apulian coast. However, there is still no overall revision carried out by using modern statistical treatments of phytosociological data. This paper aims to revise the syntaxonomy and nomenclature of the class Crithmo - Staticetea in the south-east of Italy. The revision is based on a data set of 225 relevés consisting of new and original phytosociological relevés (66) and others already published. The data matrix was classified with the use of flexible beta clustering. Indicator species analysis was employed to identify the indicator species of the main clusters of relevés. Results were interpreted from a syntaxonomic point of view. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination was performed in order to visualize the floristic relationships among associations. Rocky coastal vegetation of the Crithmo-Staticetea class in the south-east of Italy is represented by two orders, Crithmo maritimi-Staticetalia and Helichrysetalia italici . The first one includes two alliances, Crithmo-Staticion and Limonion anfracti-cancellati , with four associations and one, respectively. However, since they rely on very few character species, the floristic and syntaxonomic relationships between these two alliances need to be deepened by further investigations, involving a larger data set and investigation area. The second order, Helichrysetalia italici , includes two associations, well differentiated by their ecology, structure and floristic composition.

    "abstract": "Abstract The present-day diversity of European flora in temperate mountain ranges was mainly formed by the negative effects of Pleistocene glaciation, which caused extinctions, restricted survival in situ , and subsequent re-colonization. Only rarely can we find species that have retained the molecular information of in situ survival. One such example is the extremely rare H. pastinacifolia Rchb., a monotypic genus and a narrow endemic of a mountain plateau south-east of the Julian Alps (Slovenia). We investigated the germination behavior and dispersal indications, which are often closely related to rarity and persistence and thus valuable for species conservation. Additionally, results about H. pastinacifolia help us to understand better what kind of species survived glaciations in Europe in situ . Our results show that these seeds have an underdeveloped embryo and require an ecologically relevant moist chilling period of about 100 days. The temperature sequence of the colder period that H. pastinacifolia seeds received in nature was 20/15 °C (52 days), 10/5 °C (40 days), 5/0 °C (65 days), 10/0 °C (45 days), 15/5 °C (21 days). The germination rate was high, significantly increased by scarification, and therefore prevented long-term seed bank establishment. We found cryptic seed differences expressed by two types of dormancy, each related to the order of the umbel: simple and complex morphophysiological dormancy for the lateral and the main umbel, respectively. Seed dispersal was very much influenced by precipitation in autumn. The germination and dispersal characteristics could explain the rarity and at the same time the persistence of H. pastinacifolia .",

Total polyphenols (TP), tannins (T) and total flavonoids (TF) were determined in samples of leaves, stems, and roots using UV-Vis spectrophotometric methods. For the subsp. spinosa, the highest content of TF was in leaves (0.09%), as was the highest amount of TP (2.36%) and T (1.12%). In the subsp. jacquiniana, the highest contents of TF (0.10%), TP (1.96%), and T (0.88%) were measured in stems. Coumaric, ferulic and rosmarinic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC analysis in both subspecies. Quercetin and sinapic acid were identified only in subsp. spinosa, while rutin and naringenin were found only in subsp. jacquiniana. Among them, ferulic acid was identified only in flowers of both subspecies. The results of this study represent a useful basis for further research of phytochemical and eventually phytotherapeutic potential of D. spinosa.",

The statistical design adopted was a randomized block design, combined according to the Central Composite Design, referring to electrical conductivities of irrigation water and osmotic potentials, with minimum (- α) and maximum (α) values of 0.5 and 10.0 dS m-1 and 0.0 and -1.0 MPa, respectively, totaling nine combinations. The characteristics of dry biomass, gas exchange and chlorophyll indices were evaluated at 45 days after irrigation with saline water started. The salinity of irrigation water severely affected the dry biomass and the gas exchanges of M. suaveolens. Irrigation water of electrical conductivity above 3.2 dS m-1 caused reductions in chlorophyll a, b and total contents in M. suaveolens plants. Seed osmoconditioning did not attenuate the negative effects of saline stress on M. suaveolens plants.",

    "abstract": "Species of coastal dunes are subjected to several environmental stress factors such as drought, high temperature, light intensity as well as salinity, which led to development of specific morphological, physiological and biochemical adaptation mechanisms. Studying these strategies allows explaining the survival of these species in such hostile and stressful conditions. In this study we compared some parameters (morphological, physiological and biochemical) of two Brassicaceae species Matthiola tricuspidata (L.) W.T.Aiton, Cakile maritima Scop., and two Fabaceae species Lotus creticus L. and Ononis variegata L., harvested from their natural environment in coastal dunes of Zemmouri El Bahri (Algeria), with the aim to understand their mechanisms of adaptation. The results revealed that C. maritime showed the highest relative water content, leaf area, leaf mass area, and succulence index. Based on the highest levels of total phenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins as well as high contents of photosynthetic pigments, M. tricuspidata can be classified as “homoiochlorophyllous” plant. The dry mass content varied considerably among species, with the highest values observed in L. creticus and the lowest in C. maritima. As both Fabaceae species L. creticus and O. variegata showed high chlorophylls, carotenoids, total phenols and flavonoids could also be classified as “homoiochlorophyllous” species. The relatively high levels of total phenols, total flavonoids, anthocyanins and carotenoids implies a biochemical adaptation that allows these plants to maintain necessary photosynthetic activity under a water deficiency condition.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., a major part of MATH-BTB protein family (BPM proteins) participate in the ubiquitin‐proteasome pathway as substrate-specific adaptors of Cullin 3 dependent E3 ligase. Through targeting of specific proteins for degradation, BPMs are involved in various developmental processes, as well as in the plant’s ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The aim of this research was to investigate the oxidative stress response of Arabidopsis with modified BPMs expression to moderate heat stress. Seedlings of wild type, line overexpressing BPM1 gene (oeBPM1), and line with down-regulation of BPM1, 4, 5, and 6 genes (amiR bpm) were exposed to 37 °C for six hours. Seedlings were sampled immediately after stress and after a recovery period of 24 h. Control seedlings were grown at 24 °C and were collected at the same time points as treated ones. The level of lipid peroxidation, H2O2 and proline content, as well as the activity of antioxidant enzymes (G POD, APX, CAT, and SOD) were evaluated. Control amiR bpm and oeBPM1 seedlings generally had lower H2O2 and proline content, respectively, than wild type. After exposure to 37 °C, oeBPM1 and amiR-bpm lines showed reduced proline content, while no change in lipid peroxidation level and H2O2 content was observed. Further, seedlings with modified BPMs expression showed differences in the activity of G POD, APX, and SOD, while no change was observed in the activity of CAT. The results obtained suggest involvement of BPM proteins in the response of Arabidopsis to moderate heat stress.",

The treatments were distributed in a 24 × 2 factorial arrangement, corresponding to gas exchange evaluations performed every hour for 24 hours in the rainy season (June) and in the drought season (December). Analyzed were stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, CO2 uptake, and internal CO2 concentration, besides instantaneous water-use efficiency, intrinsic water-use efficiency, and instantaneous carboxylation efficiency. In both drought and rainy seasons, variety Baiana presented higher gas exchange intensity than the variety Miúda. In the rainy season, gas exchanges are potentialized in both varieties evaluated. In this period, the peak of CO2 uptake occurs from 1:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. for the verity Baiana, and from11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. for the variety Miúda, whereas, in the drought season, it occurs from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. for both varieties, with these constituting the ideal intervals for measuring gas exchanges in the field.",

Eight localities were processed, each containing two 1m2 plots.

Although indigenous taxa dominate, two invasive plants: Echinocystis lobata (Michx.) Torr. et A. Gray and Erigeron annuus (L.) Desf. have been recorded. Based on the functional traits of taxa, the functional diversity of plots was calculated and compared with the number of taxa and the weight of plant biomass collected within the plots. Functional diversity values ranged from 1.121 to 2.060 and dry biomass from 251.4 to 586.8 g m-2 per quadrat. Correlation analyses linked a decrease in the number of taxa and functional diversity with an increase in biomass and specific leaf area. Functional diversity is positively correlated with the number of taxa, plant dry matter content and leaf dry matter content. It is necessary to conduct this type of research in other grassland communities in Croatia to obtain more detailed insights into the relations of these parameters.",

Rech. fil.) in Turkey. Subsp. haradjianii is endemic and very common. In this study, Astrantia specimens were collected from different localities and investigated for morphological and anatomical differences. The morphological features of various organs of the plant are described in detail. According to our morphological results, subsp. maxima is bigger than subsp. haradjianii. Bracteoles are large, coloured, surface shapes and length of bracteoles are significant diagnostic characters to separate the subspecies. Inflorescence is simple umbel and fruit oblong-cylindrical. In anatomical studies, the transverse section of the stem and leaf were examined. The stem is almost round, ribbed and the arrangement of vascular bundles has diagnostic value. The number of bundles and rays are different in the subspecies. Leaf is bifacial.",

    "abstract": "This paper is a part of systematic ecological-vegetational research into the forest vegetation of the Slavonian hill area, an exceptionally valuable site in the vegetation of the Republic of Croatia. Particular attention was paid to the presence of the species of the order Quercetalia pubescentis in the forest vegetation owing to the fact that they are a special and rare feature in continental forest ecosystems. A total of 123 releves encompassing 12 forest communities were analysed. The analysis of the floral composition of forest communities of Po`ega hill area revealed as many as 213 species, of which 31 or 14.5 % belong to the order Quercetalia pubescentis in a sociological sense. The species from the order Quercetalia pubescentis encompass the warmest, southern, south-eastern and south-western positions in the upper parts of the slopes, the flat tops of ridges and crests, as well as the stands with lighter and drier conditions. In terms of physiognomy and sociology, the species of the order Quercetalia pubescentis give the most distinct characteristic to the community Lathyro-Quercetum petraeae. The number of species of the orderQuercetalia pubescentis decreases considerably going from the west to east with the exception of the Po`ega hill area. A comparison of species occurring in certain areas shows that the western part differs from the eastern part, to which the hills of Po`ega belong. The spectrum of biological forms and the spectrum of floral geoelements were determined for each community. The results of the research broaden the perception of the number, distribution and importance of species of Quercetalia pubescentis order in the forest ecosystems of hills in the Pannonian plain.",

This paper describes phytoplankton and environmental conditions in three karstic pools on Dugi Otok island (Dalmatia). The pools are small (ca 20 m2) and shallow (max. depth 2 m), with Charophytes and vascular plants covering the bottoms. Eighty-five taxa of net phytoplankton were recorded. These included 22 Cyanobacteria, 14 Chlorophyceae, 17 Charophyceae (Zygnematales), 15 Euglenophyceae, and 17 Bacillariophyceae. Low species richness is owed to the predominance of Cyanobacteria. Despite their similar physicochemical regimes, the pools had different phytoplankton communities. The data presented here contribute baseline information concerning biological diversity, essential for evaluation of environmental changes in the future. Conservation of karstic pools is one way to preserve the overall biodiversity of karstic islands.",

The species has so far been known only in northeastern Italy and western Slovenia (the Soča valley). In order to obtain more specific information its sites were studied phytosociologically and the communities in which it grows in the Sava and the Soča valleys compared. Two new associations were described on the basis of these comparisons: Triseto argentei-Leontodontetum brumatii ass. nov. and Leontodonti brumatii-Seslerietum calcariae ass. nov. As this endemic taxon and its endemic communities are a characteristic of riparian flora and vegetation of some Slovenian mountain rivers and as its localities in the Sava valley are explicitly disjunct and the southeastern-most in the entire known distribution area, they deserve to be studied and protected.",

It grows in winter in the calcareous gravel soil (pH 7.6-7.8) near the Adriatic Sea (Rovinj, Istria, Croatia) in predominantly pine forests ( Pinus halepensis ). Although similar to other black truffles, it has very irregular and hard fruit bodies, lobate and knotted in form, with deep irregular cavities reaching the middle of the fruit bodies. These cavities are clearly evident in the cross-section of the fruit bodies. Adistinctive characteristic of this truffle is the fact that when it is hermetically closed it can be kept in a refrigerator (2-4 °C) for more than 60 days. Tuber donnagotto has a slight but pleasant odor, reminiscent of boletus ( Boletus reticulates, B. edulis ). Furthermore, T. donnagotto has yellow-brownish and reticulate-alveolate spores, measuring 20-30 × 20-25 mm.",

Hermaphroditic flowers were also detected on one holm oak tree from Weihenstephan, Germany. Since the first oak tree was described as a hybrid between Q. cerris f. austriaca Q. ilex, scanning electron microscope investigations of pollen and hairs on the leaves of three species were made, on: Q. ilex L., Q. cerris L. and the »green oak«. Oak pollen is of elliptical shape and tricolpate. The ornamentation of the pollen grains of Q. cerris and the »green oak« were similar concerning the ornamentation of the exine – warty and rough and with small rounded protrusions – as well as the size of the pollen grain. Q. ilex pollen was much smaller and the surface lacked the small irregularly shaped protrusions typical of the other oaks. Within samples of holm oak pollen, significant difference in the surface structures was observed. Concerning the different types and number of hairs on the leaf surfaces, Q. ilex revealed a much greater number of stellate hairs on the upper leaf side as compared to Q. cerris and the »green oak«. Simple uniseriate hairs and simple unicellular hairs were missing on the leaves of Q. ilex, but were present on both the other oaks. To sum up the results, the »green oak« and Q. cerris reveal some similarities whereas Q. ilex does not.",

    "abstract": "The biochemical characteristics and functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus in two developmental stages of spruce needles (vegetative buds and mature needles) were compared. Biochemical analysis included quantification of the photosynthetic pigments and immunodetection of the NAPDH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Photosynthetic performance was monitored as the oxygen production at different light levels applied. Two POR isoforms were detected in buds while only one isoform was present in mature needles. The POR polypeptides in buds were expressed at different levels: the polypeptide of lower molecular mass had a level that was more enhanced than that of higher molecular mass. The most intensive POR signal was observed in mature needles. Concentrations of chlorophylls and carotenoids that were higher in mature needles than in vegetative buds were in accordance with observed POR expression. This reflected on the photosynthetic activity of the investigated organs. Although the chloroplasts in vegetative buds revealed the capability of photosynthesising, the compensation of respiration was not observed even at the highest light level (1100 molPHOTONS m –2 s –1 ) applied. In contrast, mature needles ompensated for respiration successfully at low light level (30 mol PHOTONS m –2 s –1 ). Our study showed that chloroplasts in vegetative buds are photosynthetically competent, but limited by their molecular and biochemical background.",

The main features of C. luoyulanae are strongly dorsiventral valves with strongly reverse-lateral raphe branches near the proximal ends, a large central area occupying approximately a half of the width with the valve and slit-like areolae comprising striae that may be unseriate or partially biseriate. The new species has morphological characteristics that resemble those of C. heihainensis Y.Li et Gong, C. modicepunctata Krammer and C. asiatica Metzeltin, Lange-Bertalot et Y.Li, but it differs from these three species in details of size, valve shape, striae density, central area, and number of stigmata.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities have added a large amount of heavy metals to the environment. Heavy metal contaminants affect the physiological and biological properties of soil and plant health. Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient and it promotes plant growth and development but a higher concentration of the metal causes reduction in plant growth. The present study was aimed to evaluate the response of Bacillus cereus on maize plants at different concentrations of ZnSO4 (20, 40 and 60 mg kg–1) amended in the soil under pot experiment conditions. The experiment was conducted by using complete randomized design (CRD) with three replications. Higher doses of ZnSO4 inhibited maize growth and nutrient uptake. However, inoculation of maize seeds with Bacillus cereus at 20 mg kg–1 concentration of ZnSO4 increased seed germination about 39% and plant height by 15%. Moreover, 17% increase in leaf length and a 7% increase in leaf number were observed as compared to control at 20 mg kg–1 concentrations of ZnSO4. Reductions in all growth parameters were observed with 60 mg kg–1 concentration of ZnSO4. The Zn uptake was 75% higher in treatment T8 (uninoculated seeds with 60 mg kg–1 concentration of ZnSO4) as compared to treatments which were inoculated and grown under different zinc concentrations. The results suggest that Bacillus cereus has good potential to remediate Zn from soil as well as to reduce the phyto-availibility and phytotoxicity of zinc.",

Based on the available molecular data published in 2011, Habrosia appears to be nested in a Minuartia-clade, which includes taxa currently recognized under the genus Sabulina. Consequently, Habrosia should be treated as a genus to be included in Sabulina. However, the molecular tree published in 2011 considered only 9 Sabulina members whereas, according to the current concept, Sabulina is a genus comprising about 65 species. Unfortunately, the molecular phylogeny including a larger Sabulina sample published in 2014 did not include H. spinuliflora and the taxonomic position of Habrosia remains, therefore, uncertain. With the aim of verifying the correct position of Habrosia in the tribe Sagineae with respect to its relationship to Sabulina, a comprehensive molecular investigation based on ITS sequences, linked to detailed morphological data, is presented. The results obtained revealed that Habrosia is not part of Sabulina. A detailed description of H. spinuliflora, its ecological preference, and a distribution map are provided. Eventually, the name Arenaria spinulifolia (basionym of H. spinuliflora) is lectotypified on a specimen preserved at G (barcode G00212963).",

    "abstract": "The aims of this paper were to describe seasonal changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of diatom taxa and the potential application of benthic diatoms for ecological status evaluation. Diatom indices (IPS and TI) were calculated from data from three different locations along a longitudinal profile of the Bunica, a small karstic river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A total of 147 taxa were recorded in 12 samples. The most common taxa were Meridion circulare (Greville) C.Agardh and Ulnaria ulna (Nitzsch) Compère. Physical and chemical analyses showed low concentrations of nutrients, good oxygenation, typical pH for carbonate bed/origin and generally oligotrophic conditions and high ecological status. All sites had similar physico-chemical conditions and there were only few seasonal differences. Ordination of the diatom data showed that samples showed neither longitudinal nor seasonal patterns. Median value for IPS (16.8) and for TI (7.3) can be possible ‘‘expected’’ values for ecological status assessment for small karstic rivers in the Mediterranean region. We propose the use of the phytobenthos Intercalibration Common Metric (pICM - an index that combines the IPS and TI) as a national metric for countries developing WFD diatom methods at a late stage. One situation is described, and a solution, which is potentially transferable to other locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and also to other countries facing similar challenges.",

The chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll contents of the control plant were significantly higher than those of plants exposed to UV-B for 4 h and 8 h. The chlorophyll b contents were not significantly affected by the UV-B exposure. We report a significant decline in the total phenolics and ascorbic acid composition at 4 hours after exposure to UV-B. However, at 8 h after exposure, the total phenolics and ascorbic acid contents increased significantly compared to 4 h after exposure. The UV-B doses had no significant effect on the concentrations of Mg and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu) in the two variants of T. cucumerina used for this study. The physiological explanations for these results are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Die Flechten Jugoslaviens sind im allgemeinen noch sehr wenig bekannt. Nur die Grenzgebiete und besonders Bosnien, Her- zegovioa und Dalmatien, welche auslandischen Forschern zuganglicher waren, kann man zu den besser erforschten Gebieten zahlen. Unter den nicht erforschten Gebieten erhebt sich besonders Kroatien, da ausser einigen Arbeiten von Schuler, Servit und Hazslinszky keine systematische Erforschungen vorliegen. Deshalb unternahm der Verfasser eine systematische Bearbeitung der Flechten Kroatiens und in vorliegender Arbeit wird das bisher bearbeitete Material1 aus der »Zagrebacka gora« und »Samoborska gora«, als erster Beitrag zur Flechtenflora Kroatiens veroffentlicht. Das erforschte Gebiet zeichnet sich durch die orographisehe und geologische Beschaffenheit (grosse Hohenunterschiede auf kleinem Raum, Verschiedenheiten der geol. Formationen) und Mannigfaltigkeit der vorhandenen floristischen Typen aus. Letztere zeigt sich mehr in der Verteilung als in der Vielheit der Arten.\r\nNach einer chronologischen Aufzahlung der bisherigen liche- nologischen Arbeiten, die einzelnen Lander Jugoslaviens betreffend, werden 203 Formen, davon 163 Arten nach Zahlbruckners systematischer Anordnung notiert und mit Bemerkungen (O b s.) uber ihre morphologischen und anatomischen Besonderheiten einzelner Arten und Formen, und uber die oekologischen Eigentumlichkeiten samtlicher Standorte, versehen. Samtliche Arten sind zum ersten Male fur das erforschte Gebiet verzeichnet. Als neu sind eine Art (Bia- torella biformis, siehe p. 22.) und vier Formen (Gyalecta cupularis, f. platycarpa, p. 12.; Peltigera canina, f. mixta, p. 15.; Cladonia furcata, f. intermedia, p. 20.); Cladonia furcata, f. robusta, p. 20.) beschrieben. In einer topographischen Darstellung samtlicher Lokalitaten wird noch die Verteilung der einzelnen Arten und ihre Abhangigkeit von der Unterlage und anderen oekologischen Faktoren des Standortes besprochen.",

    "abstract": "The response of duckweed (Lemna minor L.) to salinity and osmotic stress was evaluated by monitoring growth and peroxidase activity every second day, for a period of 17 days. The nutrient medium was supplemented with isoosmolar concentrations of NaCl and mannitol (50 mM and 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM and 200 mM mannitol). Growth decreased markedly with increasing concentrations of NaCl and mannitol. The lower concentrations of NaCl (50 mM) and mannitol (100 mM) started to reduce growth significantly in the second week of the experiment, while the higher concentrations (100 and 200 mM) reduced growth from the beginning. Protein concentrations and peroxidase activity fluctuated during the growth period but, most of the time, they were increased in plants treated with NaCl and mannitol. These results suggest that Lemna minor is sensitive to both salinity and osmotic stress. However, the continued growth, and also the increase in peroxidase activity and protein concentration, during the NaCl and mannitol treatments, demonstrate its potential for adaptation to long-term stress. Although salinity and osmotic stress have similar overall effects on Lemna minor, consistent minor differences in growth, protein concentration and peroxidase activity between plants grown on NaCl and those grown on mannitol suggest overlapping, rather than identical, mechanisms of adaptation to salinity and osmotic stress.",

The aim of our study was to examine the microspecies diversity of the genus Taraxacum in Polish salt and brackish coastal meadows and to analyse soil property preferences of the dandelion microspecies identified. In addition, we analysed the relations between soil properties and vegetation patterns in dandelion-supporting coastal meadows (by canonical correspondence analysis). The salt and brackish meadows along the Polish Baltic coast we visited were found to support a total of 27 dandelion microspecies representing 5 sections. Analysis of vegetation patterns showed all the soil parameters (C:N ratio, organic matter content, pH, concentration of Mg, P, K, electrolytic conductivity of the saturated soil extract EC e ) to explain 32.07% of the total variance in the species data. The maximum abundance of most dandelion microspecies was associated with the highest soil fertility, moderate pH values and organic matter content, and with the lowest magnesium content and soil salinity. The exceptions were T. latissimum , T. stenoglossum , T. pulchrifolium and T. lucidum the occur-rence of which was related to the lowest soil fertility and the highest salinity. In addition, several microspecies ( T. leptodon , T. gentile , T. haematicum , T. fusciflorum and T. balticum ) were observed at moderate C:N ratios and EC e . Four other microspecies ( T. infestum , T. cordatum , T. hamatum , T. sertatum ) occurred at the lowest pH and organic matter content. The information obtained increases the still insufficient body of knowledge on ecological spectra of individual dandelion microspecies, hence their potential indicator properties.",

In addition to its therapeutic uses in its vinegar form, AA attenuates inhibitory effects of stress in plants. However, in some plant species toxic effects of AA have been found. Therefore, in this study, 0, 2.5 and 5 mM concentrations of AA were applied to 2-day-old barley ( Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Bornova-92) seedlings for 2 days in order to investigate the possible toxic effects of AA. After treatments, seedlings were grown in AA-free conditions for 2 days to recover. AA inhibited root and shoot growth; decreased water content, fresh weight, chlorophyll, pheophytin, and carotenoid contents. However, anthocyanin and flavonoid contents, as well as the levels of UV-absorbing compounds and UV-B marker increased in the leaves of AA-treated plants. AA increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content in shoots and induced cell death in roots. Soluble carbohydrate content decreased in roots of AA-treated plants while insoluble carbohydrate content increased. Our results demonstrate that AA in young barley seedlings can exhibit its toxic effects through oxidative stress, which induced antioxidative response in the form of molecules with antioxidative activities. These effects persisted for 2 days after the removal of AA.",

    "abstract": "The thylakoid rhodanese-like protein (TROL) is located at the end of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, at the vicinity of photosystem I, where it dynamically interacts with the ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR) and is postulated to facilitate the transfer of electrons from reduced ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP+. TROL is one of the few so far known dually localized chloroplast proteins. Besides being localized in the thylakoid membranes as the 66 kDa mature form, it has also been found in the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts as the 70 kDa precursor. In thylakoids, the interaction between TROL and FNR acts like a switch, prioritizing the photosynthetic electron destination sinks according to the organellar needs. The role of TROL in the chloroplast inner envelope membrane is, however, presently unknown. By engineering the presequence protease processing site, a single amino acid exchange of Ala67 to Ile67 has been introduced to TROL, leading to inhibited cleavage of the presequence and resulting in protein incorporation at the inner envelope membrane. In this work, we engineered the Arabidopsis mutant plants that contain TROL almost exclusively in the inner envelope membrane (TROL-IE). To facilitate studying the role of this protein in this chloroplast compartment, we also produced the antiserum specific for the IE form of the TROL.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the anatomical and micromorphological characteristics of the vegetative organs and the essential oil constituents of the aerial and underground parts of the local and endangered endemic species A. orduensis Pawł. were evaluated. For anatomical study, sections of root, rhizome, stem, leaves and petiole were excised and stained with safranin/fast green mixture. Leaf and petiole structures were examined micromorphologically. Essential oil contents were determined by headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) analysis. The results showed that rectangular meristematic cells were present in the root. The leaf is of the bifacial and amphistomatic type. Stomata cells are of the anomocytic type. The stomatal index for the upper surface of the leaves is 0.04, while the stomatal index for the lower surface is 0.17. Druse crystals were found in the rhizome, stem and leaves. Among the various compounds identified, the most abundant groups in the aboveground parts are alcohols (39.81%) and ketones (14.99%) with 1-Octen-3-ol, 1-octan-3-one and borane- methyl sulfide complex as the main compounds. Terpenes (23.44%) and alcohols (11.82%), in which myrtenolis was the main compound, were most abundant in the underground parts.",

This study provides for the first time a comprehensive description of the seed morphology of native, endemic, and near-endemic species in Egypt and addresses the significance of seed traits for infrageneric classification. Twenty-two Allium taxa belonging to four subgenera and six sections were investigated using fresh or dry materials from their mature seeds. Thirty-eight quantitative and qualitative traits of the seeds' dorsal and ventral sides were investigated using stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Statistical and multivariate analyses were performed. This work provides the first description of the seeds of 13 Allium taxa, including A. artemisietorum Eig &amp;amp; Feinbrun, A. barthianum Asch. &amp;amp; Schweinf., A. blomfieldianum Asch. &amp;amp; Schweinf., A. crameri Asch. &amp;amp; Boiss., A. desertorum Forssk., A. erdelii Zucc., A. mareoticum Bornm. &amp;amp; Gauba, A. papillare Boiss., A. roseum subsp. tourneuxii Boiss., A. sativum L., A. sinaiticum Boiss., A. spathaceum Steud. ex A.Rich., and A. trifoliatum Cirillo. This study reports for the first time a comparative investigation of dorsal seed surface traits against ventral traits, revealing conspicuous differences for most species and highlighting the most informative diagnostic seed traits for distinguishing taxa.

    "abstract": "The Dinaric Alps have been recognised on numerous occasions as a biodiversity hotspot. They host a variety of species with great importance in sustainable forestry operations and nature conservation. One such species is the European ash ( Fraxinus excelsior L., Oleaceae), a broad-leaved, wind-pollinated and wind-dispersed forest tree. In this paper, we aimed to determine the morphological variability of the European ash populations of the northern Dinaric Alps. For this purpose, leaf samples from 10 individuals in seven populations were collected. Morphometric analysis of intra- and interpopulation variability was conducted using 19 morphological leaf traits. We determined great variability of trees within, and small variability among, populations. The variables that best discriminated studied populations were those relating to leaflet shape. Based on these variables, populations were grouped into two clusters. The first cluster encompassed individuals with acute leaflets, found in drier and rockier habitats, whereas the second cluster, defined by more rounded leaflets, was found in mesophilous and nutrient-rich habitats. However, this research revealed no influence of geographical or bioclimatic distances on morphological variability, which indicates that the rockiness and soil are most likely two predominant factors in shaping the phenotypic plasticity of European ash populations. These results are of great significance in the planning of future forest breeding programs, as populations from drier habitats are likely to persist and spread due to their adaptation to water scarcity, which will become more pronounced in the future.",

This alien species has been found at 12 new localities in Hungary in recent years. Some of these stands are located along main roads, while others are found in urban weed vegetation. The species was most likely introduced by increasing road traffic and tourism. Our preliminary findings suggest that the spread of the species is not concentrated along main roads due to its salt sensitivity. Instead, it is more likely to be found in xerothermic weed vegetation in urban areas where salting and winter de-icing are not applied.",

    "abstract": "Heliotropium thermophilum , a thermotolerant plant, was subjected to low sulfate treatments to examine the effects of sulfur deficiency on the plant's thermotolerance. For this aim, two different concentrations (0.15 mM and 0.30 mM) of low-sulfate media as well as full nutrition (FN) medium were prepared and the plants were cultured at 25 °C for 60 days, then divided into 2 groups for temperature applications and kept at either 25 or 40 °C for 7 days. H. thermophilum could survive in low-sulfate media at 40 °C, but high temperature damages such as chlorosis, and green color retention were observed. In addition, heat treatment reduced plant fresh weight, relative water content, and total sugar contents in both low-sulfate media. Moreover, proline and hydrogen peroxide levels were the highest in plants grown in 0.15 mM sulfate at 40 °C. Peroxidase activities were increased in plants grown in low-sulfate media at high temperature, compared to values at 25 °C. In plants grown in 0.30 mM sulfate medium, catalase activity was elevated, whereas it was reduced in 0.15 mM sulfate-grown plants at 40 °C compared to the values at 25 °C. Glutathione reductase (GR) activity at 40 °C was downregulated in 0.30 mM sulfate-grown plants while in those grown in FN and 0.15 mM-sulfate media it did not change. Heat Shock Factor 4 ( HSF4 ) and HSFA4A genes were also upregulated by low sulfate and high temperature although HSFA4A gene activation was lower under sulfur deficiency. Moreover, HSFA3 gene expression at 40 °C decreased upon the application of 0.30 mM sulfate. We hypothesize that sulfur deficiency makes H. thermophilum susceptible to high temperatures by decreasing chlorophyll and sugar contents, and reducing the activities of the antioxidant enzymes and thus plant growth. Moreover, the down-regulation of the HSFA3 and HSFA4A gene, caused by sulfur deficiency, confirms the negative effects of sulfur deficiency on plant response to high temperatures.",

Although it is known that Si has a role in improving plant defense against a variety of stresses, the role of Rut application in stress response remains unclear. Therefore, the current study was designed to evaluate the function of the synergistic effect of combined Rut and Si applications on the photosynthetic capacity of maize seedlings under osmotic stress. Twenty-one-day-old seedlings were treated with Rut (60 mg L-1) and Si (1 mM), and exposed to osmotic stress (induced by 10% and 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol) for 48 h. The individual application of Rut and Si and especially the simultaneous treatment of Rut+Si improved the gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll content, photosystem II (PSII) activity, Rubisco enzyme activity, and the expression levels of magnesium chelatase and Rubisco genes, but decreased the expression of chlorophyllase gene under osmotic stress in comparison to osmotic stress alone. These findings suggest that exogenous Rut and Si can improve photosynthetic capacity in maize seedlings exposed to osmotic stress by increasing PSII activity and the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and chlorophyll metabolism, as well as reducing chlorophyll degradation. The simultaneous treatment of Rut+Si may be useful in developing osmotic stress tolerance of plants.",

    "abstract": "Clathrus archeri (Berk.) Dring, an alien saprotrophic fungus originating from Australia and New Zealand has been present in Europe for over 100 years. From its first observation in 1920 in France, it has spread all over Europe, and is among the better surveyed alien saprotrophic fungi with respect to its spread and distribution. Despite this, data about C. archeri in Croatia in the scientific literature are very scarce. To fill the current gap on the presence and distribution of C. archeri in Croatia, we collected reliable available data on its presence, analysed several environmental factors (climate, soil acidity, topography) on those localities, and developed habitat suitability models using Maxent software. We found out that the fungus has been present in Croatia for over 20 years, so we synthesized information on 25 observations, which were all but one placed in the Continental NATURA 2000 biogeographical region of the country. Localities were situated between 104 and 532 m. a.s.l., with mean annual temperatures ranging from 8.1 to 10.9 °C, and annual precipitation ranging between 815 and 1620 mm. On all localities acid soil reactions were present with pH values below 6.8. Although the current number of observations is moderate, in terms of its spatial distribution we can consider C. archeri a widespread alien fungus in Croatia. Based on the habitat suitability models developed here, and data about its ecology from the literature, we can expect more and spatially broader observations of C. archeri in the future.",

    "abstract": "Large parts of Turkey are still really unexplored with regards to their lichen flora. In recent years, however, there has been a substantial increase in the number of lichenogical papers referring to Turkey (ASLAN 2000, 2002a, b, GONULOL et al. 1995, JOHN et al. 2000, OZDEMIRTURK 2003, OZTURK and KAYNAK 1999, YAZICI 1995a, b, c, YAZICI 1996, YAZICI 1999a, YAZICI and ASLAN 2002a, b, YAZICI and ASLAN 2003). So far, no special work has been performed on lichens in MustafaKemalpaoa, while the other parts of Bursa have been studied (COBANOÐLU2005, GUVENC and ASLAN1994, GUVENC and OZTURK2004, OZDEMIR and OZTURK 1992, OZTURK 1990 and 1992, OZTURK and GUVENC 1998, KALB and PLOBST 1978, 1979, PISUT 1970, SCHINDLER 1998, STAINER 1916, SZATALA 1960, VERSEGHY 1982, YAZICI 1999b).

    "abstract": "Als isolierte Population zeichnet sich die Samobor-Sippe der Gattung Alyssum durch eine Reihe von Merkmalen aus (in erster Linie durch Ausbildung von Sternhaaren mit verlangerten, abstehenden und gabeligen Strahlen), die sie von den verwandten Sippen der breiter aufgefassten Art A. montanum L. trennt. Am nachsten verwandt ist sie mit der Sippe A. gmelini Jord., die in mancher Beziehung schon einen Ubergang zur osteuropaischen (dazischen) Sippe A. transsilvanicum Schur bildet (innerhalb der pontischen Art A. repens Baumg.), obwohl ihr Verbreitungsraum sich im Westen weit nach Kroatien erstreckt (hauptsachlich im Gebiet um das einstige Pannonische Meer). Alle diese Ubergangssippen mit ihren ziemlich entfernten und auf kleinere Oasen lokalisierten Populationen befinden sich meist am Rande des Areals der gemeinsamen Art A. montanum, besonders in dem Teil der Peripherie, wo sich das Areal der gemeinsamen Art A. montanum mit dem Areal der Art A. repens trifft. Die A. repens erreicht als Angehorige der Gruppe der pontischen Pflanzen ihre Westgrenze auf den Hugeln der Ostalpen, in Koruska (Karnten), im Hrvatsko Zagorje und anderswo am Rande des pannonischen Beckens.\r\nDie besondere Lage der Population von Samobor wie auch der verwandten Populationen der Art A. montanum zeigt sich auch in den Lebensbedingungen an ihren Standorten, wie auch in der Zusammenstellung der Pflanzenwelt, in der sie sich, isoliert von der ubrigen Vegetation, erhalten haben. Auf trockene und offene Rasenflachen innerhalb von degradierten Stadien thermophiler Walder und Gebusche begrenzt (mit der Hopfenbuche oder der Schwarzfohre), treten sie regelmassig mit Reliktpflanzen thermophilen und heliophilen Charakters auf. Diese Reliktpflanzen sind submediterraner bzw. pontischer Herkunft, und sie konnten sich an Steilabhangen mit flachem, trockenem, juvenilem und oligotrophem Boden (am haufigsten auf Dolomitunterlage) erhalten. Die Samobor-Population hat mit diesen Pflanzen auch eine gemeinsame Herkunft und eine gemeinsame geschichtliche Entwicklung, die noch aus der Zeit des Bestehens und Schwindens der Pannonischen Meeres datiert.",

Several research groups working in tree species are presently employing next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms for marker discovery, since it is a cost effective and time saving strategy. However, most trees lack a chromosome level genome map and validation of variants for downstream application becomes obligatory. The cost associated with identifying potential variants from the enormous amount of sequence data is a major limitation. In the present study, high resolution melting (HRM) analysis was optimized for rapid validation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions or deletions (InDels) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) predicted from exome sequencing of parents and hybrids of Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. ? Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden generated from controlled hybridization. The cost per data point was less than 0.5 USD, providing great flexibility in terms of cost and sensitivity, when compared to other validation methods. The sensitivity of this technology in variant detection can be extended to other applications including Bar-HRM for species authentication and TILLING for detection of mutants.",

It inhabits rocky places and clearings, open habitats, parks and marginal parts of wetlands. Based on the known distribution, habitat preferences and literature records for the Balkan Peninsula, it was hypothesised that this species might be distributed in Croatia as well. To confirm this, herbarium material was revised, and field investigations were organized. The first report confirmed that O. sibthorpii is widespread along the eastern Adriatic coast, reaching the inland Dinaric region too. To present the currently known localities in Croatia, a distribution map is provided. Detailed morphological and leaf anatomy descriptions are given. Morphological affinities with similar species, O. excapum and O. refractum, are also briefly discussed, and an identification key is given. All Croatian populations of O. sibthorpii proved to be diploids with chromosome number 2n = 18.",

The results revealed the presence of a significant genetic variation among the cultivars although s alt stress significantly reduced all germination parameters tested. The cultivar Ozveren was the most salt tolerant with 20.1% reduction in final germination percentage compared to control seeds while cultivars Alınoglu, Ayaz and Bakir did not germinate. The maximum delays in germination rate (G50 = 3.78 days) and synchrony (G10-90 = 3.45 days) were obtained from the cultivars Urkmez and Ozveren, respectively. The GTFMs provided a total of 53.1% polymorphism. The primers of MtSOS2 gene gave the highest numbers of alleles per primer pair while the highest polymorphism rate (77.8%) was obtained from the MtP5CS gene. The first three components of principal component analysis explained 57.63% of total variation. This study concluded that the cultivars determined to be salt tolerant and sensitive at germination stage distributed into three main clades determined by UPGMA analysis while the GTFMs associated with salt tolerance successfully determined the genetic relationships of common vetch cultivars.",

In four Hp accessions some individual plants were found with a DNA content corresponding to 6Cx (2.34 - 2.39 pg). All plants of accession Hp8 showed a DNA content of 6Cx (2.41 pg). In root tips of Hp plants with an average DNA amount of 1.58 pg, 32 chromosomes were detected, corresponding to 2n = 4x. This is the first ploidy and/or DNA content report for H. umbellatum, H. maculatum and H. hircinum. H. umbellatum and H. maculatum, each contained 0.76 pg DNA and 16 chromosomes were counted. The 2C DNA content of H. hircinum was 1.00 pg with the best metaphase plate revealing 32 chromosomes. Additionally, a combined marker analysis, based on inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and sequence related amplified polymorphism (SRAP), was conducted to gain a better understanding of diversity especially within the accessions of H. perforatum . A total of 27 (11 ISSR and 16 SRAP) primer combinations were screened, showing 699 bands, of which 661 were polymorphic. UPGMA clustering revealed that accessions from the same geographic area tended to be more closely related, while H. maculatum was grouped separately from all H. perforatum accessions. Both methods have shown similar sensitivities in detecting the genetic diversity of the analyzed genotypes. Our results may be useful for Hypericum breeding programs and the development of effective conservation strategies.",

In this study, morphological variation and the anatomical features of the cladodes have been evaluated in respect to each taxonomic unit and ecogeographical distribution and suggest distinct adaptive strategies. Analysis have been performed on twenty-nine natural populations sampled along the east-west bioclimatic gradient of the Northern Algeria. Multivariate analysis based on the main diagnostic descriptors, underlines the interspecific differentiation particularly with respect to the stigma type bifid versus trifid, shape of flowers, color of berry, and the number of cladodes in a fascicle. For each species the anatomy of the cladodes is unique, unlike that of stems and roots. Interspecific differentiation was observed in the form of cross-sections of the cladode, thickness of the cuticle, shape of epidermal cells, number of vascular bundles and presence of raphides. Morphological and anatomical traits of the cladode constitute important interspecific criteria within the genus Asparagus.",

Seedlings were exposed to four levels of EB using boric acid. The results manifested that EB inhibited tomato growth, total water content, and photosynthetic pigments. EB harmed the membrane stability, as seen by increased potassium (K) leakage, UV absorbance metabolites, and electrolyte conductivity (EC) in leaf disc solution. EB raised concentrations of free, semi-bound, and bound forms of B in seedlings. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data revealed that EB induced uneven wax deposition, altered the shape of cell walls, and lowered cellulose synthesis in seedlings. EB affected the amide I and amide II indicating damage to the protein pools.

The survey included 507 plant taxa, belonging to 95 plant families. The results show that most plant species depend on insect pollination (73.6%), followed by self-pollination (30%), wind (25%) and water pollination (0.6%). For some plant species there are one, two or more modes of pollination; the largest group consists of pure insect pollination (43%), followed by both insect and self-pollination (27%), pure wind pollination (22%), insect and wind pollination (2.6%), and so on. Overall, 54% of plant species useful to European honey bees were found, of which 51% provide pollen and 47% nectar. These results suggest that A. mellifera could be a potential pollinator for about half of the flora. Analysis shows significant differences in pollination patterns among habitat types and that most entomophilous plant taxa are found in grassland, forest and ruderal sites, indicating that these habitats are most important for pollinators. Other characteristics of plant species, such as flowering time, plant family, life form and origin, were also analysed to determine a possible relationship with pollination.",

    "abstract": "Drought stress is a major environmental factor limiting plant growth. Selection of drought-tolerant plants is of critical importance in vegetation restoration and forestation programs. Alnus subcordata and Acer velutinum are two valuable, dominant, and endemic species in the Hyrcanian forests. There are fast-growing species and significant diffuse-porous hardwood in afforestation and reforestation. One-year old seedlings of both species were exposed to four water shortage treatments (100, 75, 50 and 25% of field capacity (FC) chosen as control, mild, moderate, and severe) for 12 weeks. Thereafter, their morphological characteristics such as height and basal area, total and organs biomass (root, stem, and leaf), leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), as well as physiological and biochemical characteristics such as relative water content (RWC), content of chlorophyll, free proline and malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activity were measured. The results showed that when exposed to reduced water availability, plants’ height, basal diameter, total and organs biomass, LA, LAR, RWC and chlorophyll content decreased, but their proline concentration, MDA content, SOD, and POD activity increased in both species. The root to shoot ratio (R/S) and root mass ratio (RMR) increased at 50 and 25% FC treatments in A. subcordata, whereas no significant difference was found in A. velutinum under drought treatments. SLA increased significantly at 50% FC in A. velutinum and decreased in A. subcordata under drought treatments compared to control treatment. A. velutinum showed more proline content, RWC, POD, and lower increase in MDA content than A. subcordata under moderate treatment. Therefore, A. velutinum appears to possess a better mechanism to cope drought stress. The drought tolerance of A. velutinum may enhance its potential for climatic adaptations under drier conditions with the ongoing climatic change.",

For this reason, seven different species currently classified in the Multicaulia section were collected from various localities. The pollen grains were nonacetolyzed, prepared and directly measured according to the Wodehouse method. Pollen grains were found to be subprolate in H. nitidum but prolate in others and the exine sculpturing pattern was determined to be microreticulate-perforate in six taxa while only H. varium subsp. syriacum had reticulate-perforate sculpture. The minimum exine thickness was measured at 0.96 μm in H. varium subsp. varium , while among the investigated species, H. nitidum had an exine measurement of 1.38 μm. In this study, multivariate analysis was used to investigate nine qualitative and quantitative features. Data cluster analysis revealed that the pollen characteristics were important in helping to distinguish the different species from one another. The results demonstrated that the genus Hedysarum of the section Multicaulia was divided into two major groups based on variations in pollen dimensions. The usefulness of certain pollen morphological traits was assessed, and the congruency of the palynomorphological investigations was examined. The findings demonstrated the significance of pollen micromorphology in precisely identifying and categorizing the Multicaulia section.",

The distribution and a checklist of marine benthic diatom taxa in the Mediterranean sub-basin of the Adriatic Sea are presented based on literature data. The nomenclature is brought up to date and synonyms are included. Eight hundred and twenty-two species belonging to 70 families and 163 genera have been reported. The number of pennate species represented was 719. Families with the highest number of genera were: Naviculaceae (8), Bacillariaceae (7), Surirellaceae (6), Fragilariaceae (6). The highest number of taxa belonged to the Naviculaceae (95) and Bacillariaceae (88). The most numerous genera were Mastogloia (65 taxa), Navicula (62), Nitzschia (53), Amphora (52), Diploneis (43), Cocconeis (37), Halamphora (24), Achnanthes (22), Licmophora (22), Tryblionella (19), Fallacia (15), Surirella (14), Grammatophora (13), and Lyrella (12). This study focused on the areas of investigation according to the literature reviewed and showed that many areas have to be investigated. Nevertheless, this first comprehensive checklist of marine benthic diatoms in the Adriatic Sea, updated with recent literature, is a valuable tool. However, it is important that this update has been progressive over time. Incorporating data on diatom taxa will improve the overall diversity of microalgae and our knowledge of the ecology of coastal ecosystems.",

Brizovac und Pejakusa auf der kustenlandischen Seite des mittleren Welebit—Gebirges (oberhalb des Ortes Karlobag). Dort wachst diese Pflanze innerhalb der mediterran — montanen Zone der Hopfenbuche (Ostryo — Carpinion).\r\nIm Jahre 1970 stellte der Autor einen neuen, oberflachlich grosseren und an Exemplaren reicheren Fundort dieser Sippe im nordlichen Velebit—Gebirge fest, und zwar iim weiteren Gebiet von Zavižan (oberhalb des Ortes G. Klada). Auch hier gehort dieser Strauch der mediterran — montanen Vegetation zu und kommt zwischen dem Gestrupp der Hopfenbuche, den Schwarzkieferwaldern und teilweise auch im kustenlandischen Buchenwald vor, vorwiegend in der Hohe zwischen 900 und 1500 m u. d. M. An solchen Stellen wachst diese Pflanze hauptsachlich auf seuchtem, kargem und skelettreichem Boden, sowie auf kahlen Felsen. Obwohl relikten Charakters gehort Sibiraea croatica mit mehreren anderen xero- termophilen und heliophilen Arten, einer sehr charakteristischen und in der Bewachsung des kroatischen Karstes sehr dynamischen Gruppe auto- chthoner Pflanzen terziarer Herkunft zu.",

This study was conducted to determine the comparative growth and photosynthetic responses of selected heat-resistant (cv. Sadaf) and heat-susceptible (cv. Agatti-2002) cultivars of maize to simulated GH conditions during spring and autumn seasons at seedling, silking and grain filling stages in 2007. Fifteen day old plants were shifted to plexiglass-fitted canopies to create GH conditions and data were recorded at each growth stage. The results revealed that the seasons, GH conditions and cultivars had large effects on plant growth and photosynthetic attributes. Simulated GH conditions increased the canopy temperature 4–7 °C in spring and 3–5 °C in autumn, but increased relative humidity by 2–3% in spring and 5–9% in autumn season. Although GH reduced the growth of both cultivars, shoot dry mass was reduced more in spring grown heat-susceptible maize at all growth stages. Although the cultivars showed a decrease in growth and photosynthesis, GH conditions resulted in less damage to cv. Sadaf than cv. Agatti-2002 in both seasons. Major indicators of sensitivity to GH effect were loss of chlorophyll b and carotenoids, reductions in net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, and possibly reduced ability of Rubisco to fix CO 2  in sensitive maize.",

    "abstract": "Every surface that is immersed in seawater becomes rapidly covered with an unavoidable biofilm. Such biofilm formation, also known as fouling, is a complex multistage process and not yet thoroughly investigated. In this study, the succession of diatoms and bacteria was investigated during a one month exposure on an artificial substrate of  plexiglass (polymer of methyl methacrylate) mounted above the seafloor at a depth of 5 m. For biofilm analyses, the fouling was investigated using selective agar plates, epifluorescence, light and electronic microscopy, as well as high performance liquid chromatography  (HPLC) pigment analysis. During biofilm development, the abundance of all biofilm components increased and reached maximum values after a one month exposure. In the bacterial community, heterotrophic marine bacteria were dominant and reached 1.96 ± 0.79 × 104 colony forming units (CFU) cm–2. Despite the fact that faecal coliforms and intestinal  enterococci were detected in the water column, faecal coliforms were not detected in the biofilm and intestinal enterococci appeared after one month of exposure but in the negligible number of 60 ± 10 CFU cm–2. The phototrophic component of the biofilm was dominated by diatoms and reached a concentration of 6.10 × 105 cells cm–2, which was supported by pigment analysis with fucoxanthin as dominant pigment in a concentration up to 110 ng cm–2. The diatom community was dominated by Cylindrotheca closterium and other pennate benthic diatoms. A detailed taxonomic analysis by electronic microscopy revealed  30 different taxa of diatoms. The study confirmed that a plexiglass surface in a marine environment is susceptible to biofouling within 30 days of contact. Furthermore, the colonization process sequence firstly involved bacteria and cyanobacteria, and secondly diatoms, which together formed a primary biofilm in the sea.",

In all lines and in the hybrid DH10 exposed to 200 mM NaCl evident root growth inhibition and increased proline content were noticed. However, in some cases lines differed in the activity of antioxidative enzymes, which could account for differences in their salinity tolerance. Increased activity of catalase and peroxidase in roots of line 239K could contribute to the more pronounced salinity tolerance previously reported for shoots of this line.",

To gain a deeper understanding of the conservation status (sensu EEC Directive 92/43) of abandoned cropland in the northern Apennines, we used the concept of the social behavior type (SBT) of plant communities. SBTs refer to the behaviour and ecological attributes of species at a given observation level and allow the understanding of the plant community conservation status. We found that topographic and soil conditions drive species assemblage in pastures after crop abandonment, but that long-term abandonment does not lead per se to the recovery of the semi-natural grassland communities deemed worthy of conservation in the EEC Directive. It was mainly the lack of appropriate disturbance regimes that allowed the spread of dominant tall herbs, which, in turn, reduced site suitability for subordinate plants. Moreover, their spread fostered the presence of elements such as ruderals and fringe species. We concluded that these abandoned croplands had a good potential to develop into a Habitat as defined in the EU Directive but without appropriate management plans they would remain of low representativeness.",

Apical shoot tips and axillary buds from juvenile trees (5-year old) and from root suckers of mature trees (55-year old) were used as initial explants for establishment of multiple shoot cultures. Factorial tests for growth regulator interactions with the two genotypes showed significant differences in shoot multiplication rate with numerous auxin- and cytokinin-amended basal media. For genotype P5, the most effective growth regulator combination was 5.0 mg/L KIN and 1.0 mg/L IAA. Genotype 5/11 responded best to 1.0 mg/L BA and 5.0 mg/L IBA.

    "abstract": "This paper reports the occurrence of a North American salt-tolerant taxon, Diplachne fusca subsp. fascicularis (Lam.) P.M.Peterson et N.Snow in Hungary (Central-Europe). Two earlier Hungarian observations of D. fusca were known from 1915, near Győr (West Transdanubia), later the taxon was collected by Pénzes in 1958, in downtown Budatétény (central Hungary. Both observations seem to be occasional. Recently, the taxon has started spreading in Europe, mainly on rice paddy fields, with a serious invasion potential. In North America its appearance on ruderal habitats, as well as along roads and other linear infrastructures is a well known phenomenon. The Hungarian population was found near Cegléd (Central Hungary) on the roadside of the E40 primary main road in September 2018. In July 2019 more than one thousand (mostly vegetative) individuals were detected. The salt content of the habitat shows remarkable temporal and spatial variability. At one meter distance from the edge of the paved road soil salt content was higher in spring (after the winter de-icing regime), than in autumn. Salt concentration was highest in the vicinity of the road, and decreased with increasing distance from it. Germination tests revealed a significant negative effect of NaCl concentration on germination rates, but germination occurred even on extremely saline substrates with 1.5% NaCl concentration. Considering its biology and reproduction strategy, the further spread of Diplachne fusca is highly presumable.",

Grapevine yellows-like symptoms were observed on vines in the vineyards in Lumbarda (southern Croatia) and in propagated grapevines near Zadar and Zagreb. The majority of the detected phytoplasma isolates belonged to the 16SrI group. However, RFLP pattern and R16F2n/R2 fragment sequence assigned one isolate to the 16SrIII group. Thus far, on cv. Grk, phytoplasmas belonging to three different groups have been detected: 16SrI, 16SrIII, and 16SrXII, which was confirmed previously. Aside from the 16SrI, 16SrV and 16SrXII phytoplasma groups previously found on grapevines in Croatia, the finding of 16SrIII group, which is not common on grapevines in Europe, adds to the diversity of phytoplasmas in a very small geographic region.",

    "abstract": "Studies on Bolivian diatoms are scarce and they do not represent the great geographic variability of the country. One of the regions with the highest biological diversity in Bolivia is the Yungas (cloud forest), a 90.500 km2 strip located between the Andean Puna and the Amazonian lowlands. The Carrasco National Park is the park with the largest extension of Yungas within its boundaries. This park is located east from Cochabamba, the third largest city in Bolivia, and has an area of ca 6.226 km2, serving as a refuge to 5.000 recorded species of plants and more than 300 species of vertebrates. Very little is known about the aquatic biota in the zone and there are no studies on diatoms. One of the preferred tourist spots within the park is Sehuencas, located 17Â°31'42;;; S and 65Â°16'17;;; W and characterized by numerous lotic waterbodies. The present work was carried on 5 epilithic samples from which 118 species, varieties and forms were identified using light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Forty-two (36%) of these taxa were not found in the literature for South America or other regions of the world. This high percentage of unknown taxa suggests a high potential for the contribution of new organisms to science, many of which are possibly endemic to the region, thus justifying an additional effort to preserve the aquatic habitats in the park. Two new species are described herein (Fragilaria cochabambina Morales sp. nov. and Achnanthidium sehuencoensis Morales.sp. nov.) and comparisons with published morphologically similar taxa are presented. Unknowns remain undescribed until larger populations that allow detailed LM and SEM studies are found.",

The pollen grains are 3-zonocolporate of subprolate and prolata types (P/E=1.2378-1.4491) medium to large in size, eliptical or rectangular-obtuse-convex (equatorial view) and circular to slightly triangular-obtuse-convex (polar view).

The latter feature appears to be new for taxa assigned to the genus Placoneis. Data on the associated diatom flora and its ecology are also given.

To understand how these stress factors affect metabolism at the cellular level, we analyzed cation concentrations and expression of cellular and extracellular proteins, as well as their functions and types. Cells of the industrially important halophyte sugar beet were exposed to 300 mM NaCl and 600 mM mannitol as stressors in modified Gamborg B5 liquid medium (PG0). Severe stress altered the intracellular concentrations of the most measured cations. The cellular proteome revealed that both stressors provoked significant differential regulation of 110 cellular proteins. About 80% of the identified proteins were classified in metabolism, energy, or cell rescue, defense and virulence categories. We identified several novel proteins that respond to stress, including a member of the bZIP family of transcription factors, a member of the glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins, and the K+ channel beta subunit. Among extracellular proteins we found previously unreported stress-responsive proteins, a beta-xylosidase and an isoform of chitinase. The obtained results indicate that salt and drought stress disturbed the concentrations of cellular cations and the affected expression of cellular and extracellular proteins in sugar beet cells.",

However, some of the points raised by Brullo et al. (2022) are in contrast to previously published scientific evidence, leading them to reach different taxonomic conclusions. This contrast is the result of (i) misinterpreted some key findings published in other works, and (ii) stitching to preconceptions on the distribution and specific characteristics of these species.

P.Beauv. successional grassland → Cornus sanguinea L. scrubs → late-successional Populus tremula L. forest → late-successional oak-hornbeam (Quercus-Carpinus) forest. The last forest stage was represented by the association Epimedio-Carpinetum betuli (Horvat 1938) Borhidi 1963. Occurrence of plant species throughout secondary succession was mostly stage-specific; only Fragaria vesca L., Ajuga reptans L., Cornus sanguinea, Prunus spinosa L., and Viola hirta L. showed survival ability throughout almost all stages.",

    "abstract": "To improve the biological control of white mistletoe (European mistletoe) additional detailed information on Botryosphaeria visci infection, its basic nutritional requirements, growth, and in vitro growth characteristics is needed. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify the fungus B. visci associated with Viscum аlbum from Sorbus aucuparia, to provide information on its in vitro introduction and growth characteristics on different media, and to test the pathogenicity of the isolated fungus. To achieve these goals, the morphology of conidiophores from infected parts of mistletoe was evaluated by microscopy. The isolate from fresh collections of V. album was identified as Sphaeropsis visci anamorph of ascomycete Botryosphaeria visci. The morphology of the vegetative mycelium and growth of B. visci varied depending on the media used. The best medium supporting growth and sporulation was oatmeal. Re-infection of European mistletoe in laboratory conditions showed positive result on liquid media, and in field conditions but only after mechanical damage to the mistletoe leaves. Our results expand the knowledge regarding the optimal cultivation of this fungus. This may facilitate further mycological and pathological studies involving B. visci isolates, and the results have a theoretical basis for the implementation of measures for the prevention and control of mistletoe.",

Wild-type leaves did not show changes (in nucleoid number, size and distribution) induced by different light intensities. Mutant leaves responded to changes in light conditions by changes in colour. During yellowing of regreened aurea leaves and bleaching of yelow aurea leaves the number of plastid nucleoids decreased with concomitant increase of their volume in such a fasion that the total volume of nucleoids and the DNA content per plastid remained constant. No degradation of chloroplast DNA before and during yellowing and bleaching of aurea leaves was observed",

    "abstract": "The species Allium neapolitanum Cyr. of the Section Mollium G. Don ex Koch is a common plant found in the Croatian Adriatic region as well as in a wider area along the coast and on the Adriatic islands /Table 1). In these localities, fifty plants from nine populations were collected and karyologically examined. The number, size and shape of mitotic chromosomes and their behaviour in meiosis were determined. Out of the polyploid series 2n=14, 21, 28 and 35 we found only the 5x level with 2n=35 and aneuploids with 2n=27, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 39 and 40 (Tables 1 and 2). The size of metaphase chromosomes ranged from 8.40 to 14.00 pm, from the shortest to the longest one (Table 3). The chromosomes were of meta- and submetacentric shape (only rarely of subacrocentric shape). Their number varied from karyotype to karyotype. Two chromosomes from group 31-34 (Table 3) showed secondary constriction next to the centromere, and they are known as nucleolar chromosomes. They have been named, according to this species, chromosomes of the »neapolitanum« type (Fig. 1, arrows) (Ved Brat 1965, cited from Kol- lmann 1973). Their number varies, and in alternative series it is smaller or greater than two. The variability of the karyotype was confirmed in meiosis. Irregular pairing of chromosomes was noted, as well as the appearance of uni-, bi-, tri- and multivalents, with a greater proportion of tri- and multivalents (Fig. 2). They separate into 17 and 18 chromosomes as well as in other ratios. Apart from uneven distribution of chromosomes, micronucleoli in the pollen grains also varied in number, indicating that some chromosomes or their fragments were not incorporated into new pollen nuclei. Despite such a course of meiosis, there was reproduction of the seed found in plants from cultivated and natural populations. The results concerning seed germination and germination of young bulbs are shown in Table 2. It follows that the species A. neapolitanum has a variable karyotype, which is manifested by a decreased or increased number of chromosomes, as compared to the most common karyotype, 2n=35 chromosomes.",

Previously it was known only from two coastal sand dune sites in Northern Dalmatia. The habitat at the locality of Crnika near Lopar on the northern Adriatic island of Rab is destroyed and A. arenaria subsp. arundinacea does not grow there anymore. At the second locality, on the sand dunes of Kraljičina plaža in the vicinity of the town of Nin, A. arenaria subsp. arundinacea was rediscovered and confirmed after 174 years. This is the only population of this taxon in Croatia, counting 48 mature individuals where the psammophylous habitat of Kraljičina plaža is under strong anthropogenic influence. This taxon is now classified as critically endangered (CR) and merits adequate active protection and conservation of its psammophylous habitat.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climatic gradients can be used to predict the extent to which climate drives biodiversity and to which biodiversity may be affected by global climate changes. Climate and evolutionary history are linked by the ecological adaptations of species and the history of Earth’s climate. If so, phylogenetic diversity may be a good metric to estimate biodiversity. We aimed to test whether the phylogenetic diversity of Macedonian dry grasslands was related to climatic variables. We sampled 575 plots, identifying the species and building a phylogenetic tree for them. We calculated two metrics of phylogenetic diversity and regressed them against climatic variables. We also tested whether there were nodes in the tree responsible for the main observed spatial patterns of phylogenetic diversity. We found a strong signature of evolutionary history in species sorting across a gradient driven by climate in Macedonian dry grasslands. First, the amount of evolutionary history decreased towards drier and more seasonal climates, suggesting a phylogenetic niche conservatism. Second, there was an air temperature filter and a temperature seasonality filter, acting in opposite directions and leading to phylogenetic clustering. Third, there were few nodes in the phylogenetic tree with high degrees of allopatry, associated with clades that differed not only in their geographic distribution, but also in their climatic preferences. Macedonian dry grassland communities developed over centuries of traditional land use but are threatened nowadays by human activities. The use of phylogenetic approaches may lead to more effective conservation policies and help us preserve this highly diverse vegetation.",

The systematic, biomorphological, ecological and geographical structures of syntaxa were studied using cluster, discriminant and factor analysis. The principal conformity of the floristic similarity dendrogram and the previously developed classification scheme were analysed. It was revealed that the leading factor of coenosis development is the soil moisture, while most parameters of these ecotopes are constant. The critical differentiation of Nano-Cyperion and Eleocharition ovatae alliances and the legitimacy of the recognition of the Radiolion linoidis alliance and Polygono recti-Juncetum juzepczukii association as separate syntaxa of the main ranks are emphasized.",

In addition, some differences were found, such as the metaxylem number in the root, number of vascular bundles in the scape, presence of raphide crystals, and number of protruding epidermis cells at the tip of the leaf. These differences have been found to be taxonomically useful for distinguishing these species. Moreover, similarities and differences between Puschkinia Adams and the taxonomically closely related Scilla L. section Chionodoxa Boiss. and Scilla bifolia L. taxa were also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Although Croatia is not often perceived as a citrus growing country, citrus species have been planted in the Croatian southern coastal part for centuries. Citrus had always been important as a source of vitamins and micronutrients for local consumption, but with the introduction of Satsuma mandarins (Citrus unshiu Marc.) citrus production started its commercial development. The Croatian coast is probably the northernmost commercial citrus growing area globally with several agroecological constraints influencing citrus production. However, Satsuma mandarins, the most cold-tolerant citrus of economic interest, are successfully cultivated resulting in an excellent quality of fruits that easily finds a market niche. Unfortunately, with the import of plant material in the last century, the simultaneous introduction of viral and subviral pathogens occurred. The most important are Citrus tristeza virus and Citrus exocortis viroid. As certain rootstock-scion combinations are tolerant to virus or viroid infections and display no obvious symptoms, these pathogens have been continuously spreading by plant propagation. Molecular and biological analyses revealed the existence of pathotypes not believed to be endemically present in the Mediterranean region. Their high intra-isolate genetic variability and frequent coinfections suggest that this geographical region presents a sort of a biological enclave of potentially threatening pathogens. Their transmission from this agroecological niche to areas where sensitive rootstock-scion combinations are common presents a serious risk to citrus production, especially when global warming and the resulting migration of efficient vector species are considered. Comprehensive pathogen monitoring is important for improving citrus production and the prevention of pathogen transmission.",

To investigate the ef­ fect of these chemicals on chloroplast morphology and their sedimentation profile in a sucrose gradient, duckweed, Lemna minor L., was chosen as a test organism. By light microscopy, round to oval chloroplasts in control plants and in plants grown on media supplemented with 0.025 and 0.050 mol dm 3 of tested salts were observed. However, in plants grown on media containing higher concentrations of the salts ested (0.075 and 0.1 mol dim3) most of the chloroplasts were of irregular shape, and bigger. The sedimentation profile of the control and the treated chloro­ plasts (based on chlorophyll determination in 200-pi fractions) also differed. Con­ trol samples showed three peaks, while treated samples showed an additional peak (fractions 5-8). One of the peaks obtained in the treated samples was sharper and more intensive than the peak present at the same position in the control extracts. The results obtained showed changes in chloroplast morphology and sedimenta­ tion profile after treatment with the higher concentrations (0.075 and 0.1 mol dm“3) of the salts tested that could be the consequence of starch accumulation in chloroplasts.",

    "abstract": "Bisher waren in Kroatien zwei Berberis-Arten bekannt: Berberis vulgaris L. und B. aetnensis var. brachyacantha Guss. Die erste gehort auch in Kroatien zu den weit verbreiteten und allgemein bekannten Pflanzenarten, die vorwiegend an der Ausbildung der Laubwaldvegetation im Tieflande des Landinneren teilnehmen. Als hoher sommergruner Strauch bevorzugt die Berberitze durch die Einwirkung des Menschen entstandene Standorte im Bereiche der xerothermophilen, aber auch me- sophilen Laubwalder. Berberis aetnensis Presl. ist dagegen von sehr geringer Verbreitung. Als mediterrane Gebirgspflanze bewohnt sie in Form eines niedrigen Strauches Gebirge von Sizilien, Sardinien, Korsika und Kalabrien im aussersten Suden der Apenninenhalbinsel. Sie gehort zum Formenkreise der sudeuropaisch-mediterranen Sauerdorne, die auf die Hochgebirge um das Mittelmeer, von der Pyrenaenhalbinsel und Nordafrika (Berberis hispanica Boiss. et Reut.) bis Griechenland und Anatolien (B. cretica L.) begrenzt sind. Die meisten Autoren halten sie fur mediterrane Modifikationen der mitteleuropaischen Berberitze, B. vulgaris L., zu welcher Art sie als geographische Rassen oder Kleinarten angeschlossen werden. Nach dieser Ansicht ging die Berberitze an der sudlichen Grenze ihres Areals, im Mittelmeergebiet, in diese endemischen Kleinarten uber.\r\nDem apenninischen Sauerdorn sind auch einige Sauerdorne von uns, die im Gorski Kotar, auf der Ucka, auf dem Velebit und dem Biokovo Vorkommen, angeschlossen und zwar wegen einiger Unterschiede als besondere Varietat. I. Horvat jedoch stellte schon im Jahre 1925 fest, dass auf der Licka Pljesevica zwischen voralpinen Strauchern eine neue Art des Sauerdorns wachst, die er mit dem Namen B. croatica bezeich- nete. Spater (1962) erweiterte er das Areal dieses neuen Sauerdorns auch auf die Gebirge des Gorski Kotars, die Ucka und den Velebit: damit schliest er in die neue Art auch die Sauerdorne, die fruher als B. aetnensis var. brachyacantha Guss, betrachtet wurden.\r\nNach grundlicher Bearbeitung reichen Herbarmaterials aus verschiedenen Teilen des Dinarischen Gebirges Kroatiens und der Nachbarlander konnte der Verfasser feststellen, dass die Gebirgssauerdorne in Kroatien tatsachlich als eine selbstandige Art u. zw. B. croatica Horv. angesehen werden mussen. Denn obwohl sie zu den mediterranen Gebirgssauerdor- nen gehoren, unterscheiden sie sich doch in vielem von ihnen, was man auch aus der angefuhrten Diagnose der neuen Art ersieht (pag 431). Diese Unterschiede sind an erster Stelle durch ihr bedeutend nordlicher gelegenes Areal, weiter im Inneren des Landes und im Bereiche der mesophilen Vegetation, verursacht. Nur die Populationen, die sich auf den Gebirgen in der Nahe des Meeres befinden (besonders auf dem Velebit, dem Bio- kovo, dem Orjen, dem Lovcen usw.), zeigen mehr Aehnlichkeiten mit der apenninischen wie auch mit der griechischen Gebirgssippe. Diese betrachtet der Verfasser als eine mehr oder weniger selbstandige und in geographischer Hinsicht ziemlich begrenzte Rasse (unter dem Namen dinarica) zum Unterschied von denen, die mehr im kontinentalen Teile Kroatiens gelegen sind und als typische Form angesehen werden sollen (ssp. horvatii). Aus all dem geht hervor, dass auch die kroatischen Gebirgssauer- dorne in ihrem Entstehen mit den ubrigen mediterranen Gebirgssauer- dornen in Verbindung standen und dass sie alle von einer und derselben Elternsippe abstammen, die einst einen weit grosseren Raum und ein zusammenhangendes Areal einnahm, ein Areal, das mit den Arealen der ubrigen Gebirgssauerdorne in Asien verbunden war. Unter dem Einfluss der klimatischen und geologischen Veranderungen Ende des Tertiars spaltete sich dies Areal in mehrere kleinere und vollig isolierte Areale mit besonderen endemischen Sippen auf. In interglazialen wie auch nachglazialen Perioden konnten an mehreren Stellen diese Gebirgssippen in eine neue und sehr dynamische Tieflandsippe, in die gewohnliche Berberitze, die heutige B. vulgaris, ubergehen. Durch die menschliche Bewirtschaftung begunstigt, breitete sich nun die Berberitze sehr weit aus und nahm bald den grosten Teil ihres heutigen Areals ein. Deshalb mussen alle mediterranen Gebirgssauerdorne als sehr alte und relikte Gebirgspflanzen angesehen, die Berberitze dagegen als viel jungere und deswegen durch erhohte Vitalitat und grossere Besiedlungsfahigkeit ausgezeichnete Tieflandsippe betrachtet werden.",

The main aims of this study were to contribute to knowledge of the composition of dry grasslands dominated by Asphodelus ramosus in Montenegro and to compare instances of Asphodelus ramosus dominated vegetation along the Adriatic. Our vegetation dataset included 82 phytosociological relevés: 17 from our recent field work and 72 relevés of South European Asphodelus ramosus communities. Ordination analysis (NMDS) was used for comparison of Asphodelus ramosus dominated communities in the Adriatic region. The Asphodelus ramosus community from Montenegro was classified into Bromo erecti-Chrysopogonetum grylli . The analysis revealed two distinct vegetation groups: grassland communities of the vegetation class Festuco-Brometea from Montenegro, Croatia and Albania, and edge vegetation of the new class Charybdido pancratii-Asphodeletea ramosi from Italy. Comparison with similar vegetation types shows high similarity with associations on the eastern Adriatic coast, where they are treated as grassland communities belonging to the alliance Chrysopogono grylli-Koelerion splendentis , order Scorzoneretalia villosae , class Festuco - Brometea .",

Detailed leaf anatomical descriptions of the studied taxa and an identification key generated using the anatomical features are given. Clustering and principal coordinate analysis (PCA) methods were applied based on a total of 14 leaf anatomical characters. Anatomical differences between species were detected and anatomical characters of taxonomic interest were identified in this genus. With clustering analyses, a UPGMA tree was obtained to show the relationship between the species studied. Based on the results of PCA, the arrangement of adaxial sclerenchyma cells, the number of adaxial ribs, the number of abaxial sclerenchyma strands, the size of epidermal cells and the number of vascular bundles are designated as the most reliable characters to separate the species.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the epiphytic bryophyte succession of the Buxus sempervirens L. forests in Fırtına Valley (Çamlıhemşin-Rize, North Türkiye), one of the nine biodiversity hotspots in Türkiye, were investigated. For this purpose, a total of 60 sampling plots were taken from the live trunks of the B. sempervirens trees of different ages. Twenty-nine epiphytic bryophyte species were determined (24 mosses and 5 liverworts) within the sample plots. Also, six different life form types and four different habitat affinity categories were determined. The mat type life form is in the first place with 34.4% whereas the and cortico-saxicolous species are the most common with 51.7%. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) classified the epiphytic bryophyte communities on the trunks of the B. sempervirens at the second level into two main clusters (A and B) and three sub-clusters (A1, B1 and, B2). Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) axis 1 was interpreted as gradient along the height of the epiphytic habitat (from the lower base to the upper zone) on trunks and the DCA axis 2 was interpreted as gradient of moisture (from mesic to xeric). Exsertotheca crispa (Hedw.) S.Olsson, Enroth &amp;amp; D.Quandt was the species with the highest Index of Ecological Significance (IES) value on the lower bases of the aged trees. Species diversity and epiphytic cover in the upper zones were lower than in the basal and middle zones in the study area. While Metzgeria furcata, (L.) Corda, Oxyrrhynchium hians (Hedw.) Loeske, Plagiothecium nemorale (Mitt.) A.Jaeger, and Radula lindenbergiana Gottsche ex C.Hartm were only found on old trees, Ctenidium molluscum (Hedw.) Mitt. and Pseudoleskeella nervosa (Brid.) Nyholm were only found on middle-aged trees.",

    "abstract": "Auf Grund anatomischer Untersuchungen der Blatter von 13 in Europa verbreiteten Helleborus-Arten, wovon 9 Arten der Flora Jugoslawiens angehoren, haben wir 5 verschiedene Typen einzeliger Trichome festgestellt: blasenformige (bulliformes), keulenformige (clavae- formes), schlauchformige (utriculiformes), stabchenformige (bacilliformes) und borstenformige (setuliformes) Trichome.\r\nZwischen den Formen, der Verteilung und der Zahl der Trichome besteht ein standiges korelatives Verhaltniss, welches genetisch fixiert ist und sich sogar bei veranderten okologischen Verhaltnissen nicht andert; deshalb ist es taxonomisch spezifisch fur einzelne Arten, beziehnugweise fur einzelne Artengruppen.\r\nDe angefuhrten Typen der Trichome stellen einen geraden phylogenetischen Entwicklungsweg dar. In der Ontogenese der schlauchformigen, stabchenformigen und borstenformigen Trichome melden sich als einzelne Entwicklungphasen fast alle einfachere Trichom-formen, z. B. die blasenformigen und keulenformigen, was man als eine kurze ontogenetische Rekapitulation ihrer Phylogenese auffassen kann.\r\nAuf Grund der Untersuchungsergebnisse, die in dieser Arbeit angefuhrt sind, und der Literaturangaben (Schiffner 1890, Goffart 1901, Lacza 1959, u. a.) uber die Form, Verteilung und Anzahl der Trichome, kann man die europaischen Helleborus-Arten in funf trichomorphe Gruppen einteilen:\r\nA. Artengruppe mit einzelligen, blaseformigen Trichomen (bullitricher Typ), die sich am Rande der Blattchen und in den Furchen oberhalf grosserer Nerven befinden: Helleborus corsicus, H. dumetorum, H. occidentalis, H. siculus (Abb. 6 a) und H. asperus (= H. purpurascens j. asperus) (Abb. 6 a’).\r\nB. Artengruppe mit wenigen keulenformigen Trichomen (clavaetricher Typ), die mehr oder weniger an der oberen oder unteren Blattchenepidermis zerstreut sind: Helleborus foetidus, H. atrorubens (Abb. 6 b) und H. niger, H. viridis (Abb. 6 b’).\r\nC. Artengruppe mit einer grosseren Anzahl schlauchformiger Trichome (utriculotricher Typ), die im Bereiche der Blattchennervatur lokalisiert sind: Helleborus bocconi, H. multifidus (Abb. 6 c), oder mehr oder weniger zerstreut an der unteren Flache des Blattchens: Helleborus purpurascens (Abb. 6 c’).\r\nD. Artengruppe mit grosser Anzahl stabchenformiger Trichome (bacillitricher Typ), die an der unteren Flache des Blattchens zerstreut sind und in den Furchen oberhalb grosserer Nerven sich befinden: Helleborus croaticus, H. hercegovinus und H. serbicus (Abb. 6 d).\r\nE. Artengruppe mit sehr grosser Zahl borstenformiger Trichome (setulitricher Typ), die an der unteren Blattchenflache und in den Furchen oberhalb grosserer Nerven zerstreut sind: Helleborus odorus und H. cyclophyllus (Abb. 6 e).\r\nInteressant ist auch die geographische Verteilung der angefuhrten Trichometypen beziehungsweise der betreffenden HelZeborus-Artengruppen. In Mittel-, West- und Sudwesteuropa dominieren die bullitrichen und clavaetrichen Topen, in Ost- und Sudosteuropa die setulitrichen Typen, und in Sudeuropa die utriculotrichen und bacillitrichen Typen, und in Sudeuropa die utriculotrichen und bacillitrichen Typen. Besondere charakteristisch ist dass sich in Jugoslawien alle funf trichomorphe Artengruppen Zusammentreffen und mit ihrem Areal teilweise uberdecken, was hinweist, dass hier der Mittelpunkt morphologischer Differenzierung und taxonomischer Divergenz der Gattung Helleborus ist. Dies bestatigt auch der grosse Polymorphismus der Helleborus- Arten die in Jugoslawien verbretet sind.\r\nEigenartige und sehr interessante trichomoide Papillen wurden auf der Blattchennervatur von Helleborus purpurascens f. asperus konstatiert. Infolge dieser ausserordentlichen trichomoiden Papillen und der Tatsache, dass sich H. purpurascens f. asperus nach der Form der Trichome von H. purpurascens unterscheidet, trennt der Verfasser Form »asperus« als besondere Art unter dem Namen Helleborus asperus von H. purpurascens.\r\nBei den blasen-, keulen-, schlauch- und stabchenformigen Trichomen Typen haben wir festgestellt, dass sie eine mehr oder weniger ausgedruckte Fahigkeit haben, das Wasser oder basischen Farben einzusaugen beziehungsweise zu akumulieren. Wenn man weiss dass diese Trichome an jungen Blattern, beziehungsweise auf Pflanzen arider Standorte wachsen, konnte man annehmen Grudfunktion die Absorption der atmospharischen Feuchtigkeit und des Taues ist. Diese Trichom- formen bezeichnet der Verfasser als Trichopoten. Die borstenformigen Trichomen unterscheiden sich nach der funktionellen Struktur von anderen Trichomen und stellen einen mechanischen Trichomtyp dar.",

Electron microscopy revealed a highly condensed, chromatin-like, beaded structure. Naked DNA supercoils or loops were not observed. Integral nucleoid proteins were isolated and analysed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A distinct pattern of the nucleoid proteins, covering the entire range of molecular masses from 5 kDa to > 100 kDa revealed that the nucleoid fraction was highly depleted of major thylakoid and stroma constituents.",

Heynh. with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (LBA4404)was performed in two ways: in vitro - by the transformation of root and stem explants - and in planta - by the transformation of whole plants in the greenhouse. Agrobaacterium contained the binary plasmid pBI121 or its constructs with the fragments of carrot DC-8 promoter. The results show that transformation efficiency in vitro is influenced by the age and type of explant. It was not possible to induce transgenic calli on eexplants of 5 week old Arabidopsis roots, although it was possible on explants of 3 week old roots. Although green calli grew on Arabidopsis stem explants, transgenic shoots did not develop. When using traansformation in vitro, from seed to mature primary transformant it took 15 to 16 weeks and for in planta transformation it took 19 to 20 weeks.",

It is the first institutional collection of permanent microscopic specimens of diatoms in Croatia, currently containing 1000 microscopic specimens and 200 wet samples and 16 type specimens. Most importantly, the collection contains 16 type specimens of newly discovered species in Croatia, which are no longer sent to other European collections, but kept in Croatia as a national biodiversity treasure.",

    "abstract": "Allium subhirsutum L. species of the section Molium G. Dor ex Koch is very common in the Mediterranean region of Croatia on the Adriatic Littoral. Forty plants from eleven populations coming from this area were studied. All these plants are diploids whose karyotype contains 2n=14 chromosomes. A karyotypic analysis of the number, size and shape of chromosomes has revealed the following:\r\nThe chromosome number 2n=14 of this diploid is stable. The expected triploid 2n = 21 and tetraploid 2n = 28 were not found.\r\nThe range of the size of chromosomes, from the shortest to the longest, was 8.05—12.53 pm, and standard deviation, both for the longer and the shorter arm, did not exceed 1 pm. The values, apart from the ones given, can be slightly higher or lower (i.e. the karyotype longer or shorter), however, the difference between the shortest and longest chromosome is ±4.5 pm.\r\nThe shape of the chromosomes is metacentric and submetacentric. The former predominate over the latter and in 40% of mitoses the karyotype formula is 12m+2sm, while in 60% of them 10m+4sm chromosomes. In each karyotype there are two submetacentric nucleolar chromosomes, known as the »neapolitanum« type, which are not the shortest in size in the regressing series of chromosomes. The haryotype is generally very stable, which is also reflected in the normal course of meiosis.\r\nThe meiotic chromosomes are bivalent, n=7, ring-shaped and rod- shaped in metaphase I., and during the entire course of meiosis they behave regularly forming nuclei (of pollen) without chromosome fragments.\r\nIn short, all the studied karyotypes of Allium subhirsutum from eleven populations of the Mediterranean region of Croatia are mainly homomorphic (uniform), stable and of a high degree of symmetry, which are preconditions for a regular, bivalent formation in meiosis.\r\nThe karyotype studied is similar to the karyotype of foreign populations, and this study provides a supplement to the data for the Mediterranean region of Croatia.",
