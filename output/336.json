    "abstract": "Abstract Africa (excluding the Seychelles) has a diverse caecilian fauna, including the endemic family Scolecomorphidae and six endemic genera of the more cosmopolitan Caeciliidae. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies have not included any caecilians from the African mainland. Partial 12S and 16S mitochondrial gene sequences were obtained for two species of the endemic African Scolecomorphidae and five species and four genera of African caeciliids, aligned against previously reported sequences for 16 caecilian species, and analysed using parsimony, maximum likelihood, Bayesian and distance methods. Results are in agreement with traditional taxonomy in providing support for the monophyly of the African caeciliid genera Boulengerula and Schistometopum, and for the Scolecomorphidae. They disagree in indicating that the Caeciliidae is paraphyletic with respect to the Scolecomorphidae. Although more data from morphology and/or molecules will be required to resolve details of the interrelationships of the African caecilian genera, the data provide strong support for at least two origins of caecilians in which the eye is reduced and covered with bone, and do not support the hypotheses that the caecilian assemblages of Africa, and of East and of West Africa are monophyletic.",

We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial (cytb, 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA) and nuclear (RAG‐1) gene sequences for these geckos. Pachydactylus tetensis + P. tuberculosus form the sister group to the remaining taxa, and we resurrect the genus Elasmodactylus to accommodate these two basal species. The P. bibronii group is sister to Chondrodactylus angulifer, and is here transferred to the latter genus. Pachydactylus kochii is the sister species of Colopus wahlbergii and is transferred to that genus. All remaining taxa ‐ including the P. namaquensis group, the 'small‐bodied' Pachydactylus, and Palmatogecko ‐ form a well‐supported monophyletic assemblage recognised herein as Pachydactylus sensu stricto. The major clades within Pachydactylus s.s. include the capensis, serval/weberi, rangei, rugosus, and geitje groups, as well as a diverse \"northwestern group\" that occurs chiefly in northern Namibia and southern Angola. The fine‐scale regional endemism apparent among members of the southern African Pachydactylus Group probably reflects an interplay between substrate specialisation and vicariant events (both geologically and climatically associated) since at least the Miocene. Explicit phylogenies for Pachydactylus, cordylid lizards, scorpions, and other taxa provide a basis for the first fine‐scaled analytical biogeographic analysis of southern Africa.

    "abstract": "The global environmental crisis has reinforced the importance of improving the documentation of the geographical distributions of extant species. With this aim, species inventories of specific locations or regions are a high priority, especially so in poorly explored areas. Cabinda Province, an Angolan enclave located between the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), represents one of the most enigmatic and poorly explored areas in Africa. No detailed species inventories within its protected areas (namely, Mayombe National Park) exist. Furthermore, this region presents some of the better preserved remanent of primary moist rainforest in West Africa. Although these forests are severely threatened by logging and by the rapid social growth in the area. Therefore, we provide here the first herpetological checklist of Mayombe National Park and Cabinda Province, Angola, to shed light on this underexplored corner of Africa. To obtain the most accurate species identification, we performed detailed morphological examinations and DNA barcoding identifications. As a result, we recorded a total of 76 species of amphibians and reptiles in the area, including four new genera, 19 new distribution records for Angola, and 13 candidate species. This work also provides novel topotypic genetic material from three reptile species (i.e., Agama congica, Panaspis cabindae and Atractaspis congica), that may contribute to revise and solve taxonomic inconsistencies in these different groups. Finally, we identified areas of high species richness, as well as areas with a high number of habitat specialists, thus indicating species more vulnerable to extinction. Therefore, our study allowed us to identify areas that are of special interest for conservation of reptiles and amphibians, primarily focus on species vulnerable to extinction, but also to identify some knowledge gaps that still need further investigation. To conclude, this work not only contributes to an improved understanding of Angolan herpetofauna, but also highlights the importance of the western slope of Central Africa as an important biodiversity hotspot, centre of endemism and potential source of diversification for this group of land vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Investigations of aggregation behaviour in five lizard species (three diurnal rock-dwelling species, one nocturnal rock-dwelling species, and one diurnal terrestrial species) occurring in the arid western regions of South Africa revealed that there is no single set of causal factors explaining this behaviour. Aggregating behaviour in Cordylus macropholis is simply the result of environmental constraints, namely a shortage of preferred shelter sites. Individuals of Ouroborus cataphractus aggregate to benefit from the early predator detection effect. In Platysaurus broadleyi and Chondrodactylus bibronii aggregation behaviour appears to be the result of environmental constraints as well as possible benefits from the dilution effect. At present there is no conclusive information on the reasons for aggregation in Namazonurus peersi. In the rock-dwelling species investigated, the extent of adaptation to counter the effects of intra-group competition appears to be correlated with the proportion of activity time spent at the communal shelter. The proportion of time spent at the shelter, in turn, appears to be determined by the morphology of the species and whether it is diurnal or nocturnal.

We sequenced two mitochondrial (cyt b and ND4) and two nuclear (c-mos and RAG1) genes from several populations of B. olivaceus in Central Africa and recovered two highly divergent lineages (Congo Basin and Albertine Rift) attributable to this species. Dating analyses with BEAST suggest the two lineages last shared a common ancestor during the mid-Miocene approximately 12 million years ago, and data from RAG1 showed consistent differences in two amino acids for topotypic Congo Basin B. olivaceus compared to the Albertine Rift lineage and all other examined species of Boaedon. Based on these striking molecular differences and significant differences in ventral scale counts and the number of supralabials contacting the eye, we describe the Albertine Rift lineage as a new species. The recognition of this new species bolsters the importance of the Albertine Rift as an important region for endemism and conservation in continental Africa. Based on the results of our phylogenetic analyses, the poorly known taxon Lycodonomorphus subtaeniatus upembae is elevated to full species status and transferred to the genus Boaedon. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D0C0E5B5-DBE9-4D21-B5FE-86221DDF60BA",

With reference to the dominant role of climate fluctuations resulting from Milankovitch forcing since the Pliocene, Poynton hypothesised: \"These climatic fluctuations must have altered the faunal patterning very considerably, and they have probably left an impression on present distribution\". In this study we use modern methods of species distribution and palaeoclimatic models not available in the 1960s to further investigate Poynton's predictions on the importance of glacial–interglacial climatic changes on the distributions of southern Africa's amphibian assemblages. We constructed current distribution models based on presence data for 20 representative endemic anuran taxa from the two centres. We then used two paleoclimatic models (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate: MIROC and Community Climate System Model: CCSM) to project the species' current niches back to 6 and 21 Kya (Last Glacial Maximum: LGM) to reconstruct hypothetical historical distributions. Our results predict that 65% or 75% of species experienced a range reduction since the LGM, using MIROC and CCSM respectively, but this shrinking was significantly greater in the Cape (mean reduction since LGM = 18 099.6 ±5 894.27 km2 MIROC) than Tropical areas, most of which expanded (mean = − 5 990.3±8 801.80 km2 MIROC; F1,18=5.074; P = 0.037.

Despite its greater surface area and habitat diversity Angola has significantly lower lacertid lizard diversity than adjacent Namibia. This is particularly notable in African sand lizards (Pedioplanis), where 10 species (two endemic) are known from Namibia but only two are recorded from adjacent Angola. Pedioplanis benguellensis was described from Angola, but its taxonomic status is problematic and it was previously synonymised with P. namaquensis. All other Angolan Pedioplanis were referred to Namibian P. undata, although this taxon is now known to comprise a complex of at least five different species and the relationship of Angolan material to this complex has not been assessed. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic placement of Angolan Pedioplanis using two mitochondrial (ND2 and 16S) and one nuclear (RAG-1) markers. A Bayesian analysis was conducted on 21 samples from Angola, combined with existing data for 45 individuals from GenBank and three additional samples from central Namibia. The phylogeny demonstrates that P. benguellensis is a valid species and that it is not the sister taxon to P. namaquensis with which it has been morphologically confused. In addition, Angolan lacertids previously referred to P. undata are not conspecific with any of the Namibian or South African species in that complex. Rather, there is strong support for the presence in Angola of additional species of Pedioplanis, which form a well-supported sister clade to the P. undata complex (sensu stricto) of Namibia and two of which are described herein. These discoveries highlight the need for further biodiversity surveys in Angola, as similar increases in species diversity in other Angolan taxa might be found given sufficient investment in biodiversity surveys.",

A previous report of osteoderms in the Afro-Malagasy gekkonid genus Geckolepis has been questioned due to the extreme skin fragility and regional integumentary loss within the group. We re-evaluated the integument anatomy of Geckolepis maculata using µCT scanning, histology, and clearing and staining to verify the presence or absence of osteoderms and, if present, to characterise and compare their morphology to the osteoderms of Gekko gecko and Tarentola, as well as osteoderm diversity within squamates. Osteoderms were confirmed present in Geckolepis maculata; however, these osteoderms are compound, imbricating, squamous elements that are morphologically similar to the dermal ossifications observed in scincids and gerrhosaurids, while G. gecko and Tarentola possess plate-like and granular osteoderms. Our results suggest that osteoderms have independently evolved at least three times within the Gekkota and that epidermal anatomy may be a better predictor of osteoderm morphology than ancestral history. Further research is required to investigate the regenerative capability of Geckolepis osteoderms following skin autotomy.",

Reduced major axis regressions of limb skeletal element length against occiput-vent length (OVL) indicate that there are significant differences in the scaling relationships among the five Namibian species of the genus Rhoptropus. R. afer differs from all other taxa in y-intercept and size of ordinate variable at smallest common OVL for almost all regressions. The proportional differences in limb morphology for this species are most notable for the metapodial elements and proximal phalanges. Distal phalanges do not show this pattern, perhaps reflecting functional constraint imposed by the hyperextensive scansorial system of the toes. Rhoptropus afer also typically has one fewer presacral vertebra than its congeners. There is no evidence that these features of R. afer are shared by its sister taxon, R. bradfieldi. It therefore seems likely that R. afer has evolved these locomotor characteristics, along with many other autapomorphies. since the divergence of the two taxa.

Ecophysiological and behavioral character evolution in the Cordyliformes is discussed. Arguments are based on Lang's generic-level phylogenetic tree for the Cordyliformes, but with Platysaurus taken as the most basal genus in the Cordylidae. Ancestral values for reproductive mode, foraging mode, prey chemical discrimination ability and preferred substrate are evaluated using parsimony criteria and the Scincidae and Lacertoidea as outgroups. The available data suggest that, within Cordyliformes, sit-and-wait foraging, lack of prey chemical discrimination, and a rupicolous lifestyle co-evolved in the immediate ancestor of the Cordylidae, while viviparity evolved in the immediate ancestor of the Cordylus-Chamaesaura-Pseudocordylus clade. The highland distribution and viviparous reproductive mode of the latter clade suggest that the ancestor became adapted to cool regimes, in other words that the clade had a cold origin. The adaptive significance of the transitions to a sit-and-wait foraging mode, lack of prey chemical discrimination ability, and a rupicolous lifestyle in the ancestor of the Cordylidae remains unknown, but these transitions could have served as preadaptations which facilitated the invasion of highland areas by the Cordylus-Chamacsaura-Pseudocordylus clade. The distribution of extant species suggests that the Cordylidae/Gerrhosauridae divergence occurred in southern Africa, the former diversifying in the extreme southern regions of the subcontinent and the latter in the south-central regions. The rupicolous lifestyle and resultant low vagility of early cordylids probably prevented the family from reaching Madagascar before its separation from Africa.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Clicking Stream Frog (Strongylopus grayii) occurs throughout southern and eastern South Africa across summer, aseasonal and winter rainfall areas. Because of its contiguous distribution and extended breeding season this species might be expected to show a phylogeographic pattern of isolation by distance rather than divergent geographical lineages. To investigate population structure and make inferences about physical processes that have influenced gene flow in this species, two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and 16S) were sequenced for 64 frogs from across the distribution of the species. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony and Bayesian) revealed two well-supported clades partitioning the range of this taxon, with one clade restricted to the northeast (summer rainfall) and the other restricted to the south (winter and aseasonal rainfall). The magnitude of sequence divergence between these clades is higher than expected, and is typical of levels of sequence divergence found among closely related species of pyxicephalid frogs. Phylogeographic analyses of sequence networks and spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) revealed additional geographical structure within each of these lineages. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of climatic transitions as barriers to gene flow and as potential agents for vicariant speciation.",

Here we present the first molecular phylogeny that includes as many as nine of the ten pyxicephalid genera, omitting only Nothophryne, based on four nuclear gene fragments and one mitochondrial gene fragment. This study corroborates the basal placement of Pyxicephalus and Aubria, and the sister group placement of Natalobatrachus and Arthroleptella, which were first signalled using smaller datasets. The evolution of endotrophic development has evolved twice within the Pyxicephalidae, once in the ancestor of Anhydrophryne, and independently in the ancestor of Arthroleptella. The implications for the evolution of body size, from the large species in Pyxicephalus and Aubria to the smallest pyxicephalid species in Arthroleptella and Microbatrachella are discussed.

    "abstract": "The 5.1 million year old fossil site of Langebaanweg (LBW) has provided a wealth of information on the evolution of west coast ecosystems along the southern west coast of South Africa and numerous taxa, including small and large mammals, and birds, make a first appearance in the fossil record at the site. Langebaanweg also contains a rich and diverse anuran fauna which derives from the two main fossil-bearing members at the site. This study identified six families, including Hyperoliidae, Brevicipitidae, Pxyicephalidae, Pipidae, Heleophrynidae and Bufonidae, and some 19 taxa have been differentiated. The majority of frog families identified from the LBW fossil material currently contain a high number of species endemic to the southwestern Cape or South Africa. LBW provides an insight into how current patterns of endemism and distribution may have evolved, and illustrates that the frog community in a region may change substantially over time. The progressive aridification of the west coast subsequent to 5.1 Ma has left very little trace of the rich and diverse frog community which existed during the early Pliocene, and diversity and endemnicity are low today. This challenges the generally held assumption that centres of origin may have a bearing on current-day frog distributions.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that underpin ecological speciation, morphological convergence and the evolution of ecological morphotypes (ecomorphs) in squamates have allowed for a better appreciation of the speciation process in chameleons. In particular, attention has been drawn to several populations of chameleons (Sauria, Chamaeleonidae, Bradypodion) from the Cape Fold Mountains, South Africa. Previous work suggested that these populations are genetically divergent, but with strong similarities in phenotype. Using an integrative taxonomic approach that accounts for genetic diversity, habitat and morphology, three of these populations are described as species. One population is from an isolated forest patch and is genetically different at the species level, but morphologically similar to Bradypodion damaranum (Boulenger, 1887) from forested areas in the Knysna region. Although not sister species, the two are in the same clade and probably diverged through vicariance of the forest. Two other populations are from fynbos habitat in adjacent mountain ranges (Tsitsikamma/Langkloof/Kouga mountains and Baviaanskloof Mountains) and are also morphologically similar, but genetically divergent at the species level. These two species are not sister taxa and are not in the same clade yet have a virtually identical phenotype presumably as the result of convergent evolution for the fynbos habitat. Within the context of morphological taxonomy, these populations have been difficult to evaluate. However, when viewed in the context of ecological speciation, convergence and morphological conservatism, the species boundaries are apparent, allowing for them to be described as new taxa.",

Adults of both sexes were collected during the autumn of 2002 in South Africa, and stereological analytical techniques were used to quantify the distribution of testicular cell types. In addition, total laryngeal mass was used as a gauge of secondary sex differences in animals from MGA and NMGA study sites. Evaluation of the total laryngeal mass revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between X. laevis of the same sex from the NMGA and MGA sites. Mean percent fractional‐volume values for seminiferous tubule distribution of testicular cell types of mature X. laevis, ranged from 3–4% for spermatogonia, 26–28% for spermatocytes, 54–57% for spermatozoa, and 14–15% for other cells types. The mean percent volume for blood vessels ranged from 0.3–0.4%. These values did not differ significantly between frogs from NMGA and MGA areas. Collectively, these data demonstrated no differences in gonadal and laryngeal development in X. laevis collected in South Africa from MGA and NMGA areas and that there is little evidence for an effect of agricultural chemicals used in maize production functioning as endocrine disrupters in this species. Screening of X. laevis testes revealed a small incidence of Stage 1 testicular oocytes in adult male frogs collected from the NMGA (3%) and MGA (2%).",

These areas overlap with populations of the African Clawed Frog (Xenopus laevis) that has a wide distribution in southern Africa and is found in most water‐bodies including those where atrazine residues are detected. The aim of this study was to compare various attributes of individual‐ and population‐level responses of X laevis from maize‐growing and non‐maize‐growing areas. Xenopus laevis were studied in three reference and five maize‐growing sites. Sex ratio, snout‐vent length, body‐mass and age profiles were found to be similar for populations in maize‐growing and non‐maize‐growing areas. Our mark‐recapture data indicated that all sites had robust populations. There were no significant relationships between exposure to atrazine and any of the parameters investigated in populations of X. laevis.

However, amphisbaenians are often found under rocks where they thermoregulate, and probably engage in social interactions. We describe aggregations under rocks in a North African population of the little studied amphisbaenian Trogonophis wiegmanni. These observations could be used to make initial inferences about the social behaviour of this amphisbaenian. Results showed that amphisbaenians were sometimes found in pairs under the same rock. However, these aggregations were not random. Adult males were only found together with adult females, but we did not find pairs of adult males or adult females. This might suggest that there is intra-sexual intolerance, and that adult individuals of the same sex do not occupy the same rock space. Pairs of adults were more frequently found in spring than in autumn, coinciding with the mating season. Also, juvenile individuals were often found together with an adult, but juveniles tended to be more often with an adult female than with an adult male. This might indicate that juveniles are allowed to remain with their parents until they are older, which might enhance offspring fitness by providing access to high-quality habitats.",

Previous investigations have indicated human induced habitat modification, predators, pesticides and disease as possible causes of a rapid population decline and the species extirpation. Here, we systematically investigate the role of disease in the extinction event of the wild toad population. The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, was detected in spray toads that died during the extinction event and subsequently in other amphibian species in Kihansi Gorge and the adjacent Udagaji Gorge, but not in any toads collected prior to this. Following the population decline, the remaining spray toad population gradually disappeared over a nine-month period. We demonstrate how demographic (rare, low fecundity, high elevation species) and behavioural (congregate in high densities) attributes predisposed the spray toads to chytridiomycosis, as a result of B. dendrobatidis infections, and how epidemic disease could have been exacerbated by altered environmental conditions in the spray wetlands. Our results show that chytridiomycosis was the proximate cause of extinction in the wild of N. asperginis. This represents the first known case of extinction by disease of an amphibian species in Africa. Captive breeding programs, in both the US and Tanzania, have been introduced in order to ensure the survival of the species and a reintroduction program is underway. However, we caution that chytridiomycosis remains an existing threat, which requires a comprehensive mitigation strategy before the desired conservation outcome of an established population of repatriated toads can be achieved.",

We sequenced 3 779 bp from two mitochondrial (12S, 16S) and four nuclear (MYH, Kif24, PrLR and MC1R) genes from multiple samples of C. tropidosternum and several sympatric species; these data were analysed with maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference optimality criteria. One morphologically and genetically distinct clade of Cordylus from the Marungu Plateau of Katanga Province, DRC is described as a new species. The new species was found under rocks in montane grassland, but further study is needed to assess Cordylus populations in the lowlands of Katanga. We also provide the first detailed morphometric data for the poorly known species C. angolensis, which was described from a single specimen that has since been destroyed.

Here, we review the diet of cape cobras (Naja nivea) based on examination of museum specimens, an extensive literature review, and social media reported natural history observations. We quantify dietary niche breadth and test the hypothesis that cape cobras are generalist predators. Additionally, we test the hypotheses that diet varies significantly (1) across biomes, and (2) across winter, summer and year-round rainfall regions. We gathered 101 feeding records for cape cobras and based on family-level prey frequencies calculated Levins’ measure of niche breadth as B = 6.57, which we standardised to BA = 0.29. We found no association between prey classes and biomes or rainfall region. Our data indicate that cape cobras consume a wide range of vertebrate prey from all four tetrapod classes, including a large number and diversity of snakes. Our findings suggest that cape cobras may be involved in several important ecological processes. Moreover, our study demonstrates the utility and value of collating natural history observations reported on social media platforms.",

A new species of Platysaurus is described from the Gordonia-Kenhardt district of Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Numerous features of scalation and colouration distinguish it from all other southern African Platysaurus. The new species is morphologically most similar to, and was previously confused with, P. capensis from northern Namaqualand, the Richtersveld and southern Namibia. There is no evidence for genetic exchange between the new species and P. capensis, which are separated by 100 km. Therefore, based on allopatry, the presence of two autapomorphies (dorsal forelimb scales subequal to those on hindlimb and unique male colouration), and significant differences in eight other scalation features, the Augrabies population meets the criteria for designation as a new species within an evolutionary species concept. These lizards occur in very high densities in the Augrabies Falls National Park where black flies (Simulium spp.) form a major food resource.",

Currently the basal gerrhosaurid is unknown, although Angolosaurus skoogi previously was proposed as the sister taxon to mainland African gerrhosaurids. Many details of the cranial osteology of A. skoogi are also unknown because of the rarity in museum collections and elusive lifestyle of this dune‐dwelling lizard, endemic to the Namib Desert. In this study, High‐Resolution X‐ray Computed Tomography (HRXCT) was used to study in detail the cranial osteology of A. skoogi. Results of this study enabled completion of the first anatomical description of the skull and mandible of A. skoogi. Throughout the description, reference is made to a fully labeled cross‐sectional HRXCT data set, available online as supplementary material. Detailed information on cranial osteology obtained from these data can help resolve the contentious placement of A. skoogi within Gerrhosauridae. Unlike other Cordyliformes (Gerrhosauridae + Cordylidae), the post‐frontal in A. skoogi is not extensive and does not extend posteriorly beyond the orbital margin. The squamosal is not bifurcated anteriorly in A. skoogi, unlike other gerrhosaurids. In the braincase of A. skoogi, there is no separate foramen for passage of the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). This morphological study emphasizes the utility of both HRXCT scans and disarticulated skeletal material as valuable sources of phylogenetically‐informative data.",

We report on an enigmatic mortality event in the only known population of the Critically Endangered frog species Xenopus longipes. This aquatic and biologically distinctive species is restricted to Lake Oku, a high-elevation crater lake on Mt. Oku in Cameroon. Neither a quantitative PCR-based screen nor histopathological analysis revealed the presence of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which is believed to be responsible for many declines and mortality events in amphibian populations around the world. Histopathology revealed widespread epidermal hyperplasia and multifocal saprolegniasis suggesting that the animals have been exposed to a source of skin irritation. These sources might include acidified surface waters, perhaps derived from inorganic fertilisers or other human-related pollutants, or to local geological processes distinctive of the Cameroonian Volcanic Line. Currently, the causes underlying this mortality event remain obscure.",

A niche‐based modelling technique was used to predict current suitable climatic habitat for most Bradypodion species and for their phylogenetic clades. Additionally, the models were projected into the future (2080) using the IPCC climate change scenarios. All models for Bradypodion species and clades showed responses to predicted climate change, however, the degree and extent of these responses were individualistic. Most species responded with a contraction in predicated climatic suitability, but some registered an expansion or a shift. These results have important implications in understanding the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change, and for the importance of considering the effects of predicted climatic shifts on the protection of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Populations of the giant bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus) have been poorly monitored due to the unpredictable appearance of this species aboveground. To better understand the activity of P. adspersus we quantified spawning by a population during five summers, and the activity of twenty adult frogs radio-tracked at the same site ca. twice weekly during the first three summers. In addition we examined animal activity, and population spawning in relation to meteorological variables, day of season, and moonlight. During the six-month summer period, males and females, respectively, spent 10±7 and 3±2 days at water, and 22±5 and 13±5 nights active. Greater proportions of radio-tracked animals moved overland, and/or foraged at night, around full moon, after heavy rainfall, when cooler, and less windy conditions prevailed. More animals were found at water, or on land during the day, and population spawning was more likely, earlier in summer, following heavier rainfall. Spawning occurred most frequently, in descending order, during December, January, and November, and was triggered by 40±16 mm rain in 24h. Spawning events lasted 2±1 days, but were prolonged around full moon. Numbers of males at spawning events varied between 30 and 500 males, and were positively correlated with the previous day's rainfall. Annually 6±1 spawning events occurred, and numbers of annual spawning events were positively correlated with total summer rainfall. Results of this study show that single counts of spawning adults will often result in gross underestimates of population size, and therefore, long-term adult counts are necessary to detect real population trends. Due to the unpredictable activity of adults, however, it may be more practical to monitor, within certain areas, the number of aquatic sites where breeding occurs, for improved conservation management of P. adspersus.

We describe the new species and restrict the range of H. greeffi to the island of São Tomé. The original unnumbered holotype of H. greeffii held in the Museu Bocage was destroyed in Lisbon and we have been unable to determine the collection provenance of unnumbered material treated by subsequent authors. We therefore designate a neotype for H. greeffi from California Academy of Science collections and provide morphological information on that species additional to that of earlier workers, based upon 14 specimens collected in various localities on São Tomé during the past decade.",

In the Indian Ocean, surprisingly, little is known regarding the genetic structure of many taxa across the Seychelles Islands, despite their importance as old Gondwanic islands, part of the western Indian Ocean biodiversity hotspot. In recent molecular studies, a northeastern–southwestern subdivision pattern across the granitic islands has been uncovered within some species. Pamelaescincus gardineri, a Seychelles endemic skink and possibly one of the deepest lineages of Afro-Malagasy ‘scincines’, is another species widespread across these islands, within which undescribed variation may occur. Both nuclear (c-mos and MC1R) and mitochondrial (Cyt-b) DNA data were used to address this issue. Mitochondrial DNA shows a marked northeastern–southwestern structure of two highly divergent clades, similar to the pattern previously described in other reptile species. Nuclear DNA seems to corroborate this pattern, although these markers were much less informative. Migration between the two island groups was identified, and gene flow between the two mtDNA lineages is likely, the extent of which remains to be fully explored. This will require more variable nuclear markers and more detailed sampling across the island of Mahé. A suitable assessment of morphological variation is also needed prior to any taxonomic revision of this species. From a conservation point of view, however, these lineages should already be treated as two distinct evolutionary units.",

    "abstract": "DNA barcoding has been proposed as a means of quick species identification using a short standardised segment of DNA. The established barcode gene for animals—the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase one (CO1)—has been plagued by primer failure and low species identification success in amphibians. We investigate the accuracy of CO1 barcoding with a new dataset of West African frogs using the universal CO1 primers and new amphibian-specific CO1 primers in comparison to a proposed alternative DNA barcode for amphibians—the mitochondrial ribosomal 16s gene (16s). Research was performed using 134 specimens, comprising 21 species collected in Ghana, a global biodiversity hotspot with a deficiency of amphibian barcoding resources. These species represent 55% of amphibian species (58% of amphibian families) that are known in the area from surveys from 1988 to 2009. We found nearly a 50% increase in PCR amplification success using the amphibian-specific CO1 primers compared to the universal CO1 primers. However, the overall amplification and sequencing success of the amphibian-specific CO1 primers was low (78%) compared to the 16s gene (100%). Neither marker has a clear advantage in terms of barcoding gap; comparisons of intraspecific and interspecific variation for these markers were similar for the species we examined. Considering the qualities a barcoding gene should possess, 16s outperformed CO1 in terms of ease of obtaining sequences, and given that 16s sequences are better represented for African frogs on GenBank, this marker had higher success in BLAST searches. With amphibian species in fast decline, more consideration should be given to the appropriateness of collecting CO1 barcodes for amphibians, especially as an extensive genetic database for 16s already exists that can accurately identify amphibians.",

The taxonomy of several terrestrial tortoise genera remains highly disputed, due in part to a limited knowledge of the limits of variation in many populations. For taxa where substantial captive populations are maintained and play an important role in conservation, there is a need to ensure correct identification. The use of the carapace in identification has sometimes been criticised due to potential problems of distortion caused by captive diets. I studied the effects of diet on two species; Testudo ibera and Dipsochelys dussumieri. I confirmed previous findings that low calcium ‐ phosphorus ratios cause scute pyramiding and that extreme calcium deprivation results in metabolic bone disease. However, even though poor diets result in bone resorption, deposition at points of stress and abnormal fusion patterns, they do not compromise the taxonomically useful characters of scute proportions, coloration and depressions and they have no impact on the plastron. Such carapace characters and those of the plastron in particular, remain of value in systematics. My study highlights the need for careful examination of the value of taxonomic characters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract There is little quantitative information regarding the two subspecies of the world's smallest tortoise, Homopus signatus. To help characterise the northern subspecies H. s. signatus and evaluate the development of shell size and colour patterns, we measured shell characteristics of wild juvenile, male and female H. s. signatus. When scaling shell dimensions on carapace length, male shell size represented an extension of juvenile shell size for shell height, width and volume, but not plastron length. The slope of plastron length scaled on carapace length was smaller for males than for juveniles or females, suggesting differential growth of the plastron. The smaller male plastron translates to large shell openings, perhaps to improve locomotion and to facilitate tail movement during copulation. Conversely, the slope of female shell height, width and volume (scaled) was larger than for juveniles or males, presumably providing more space to accommodate follicles and the large egg. Serration of the marginal scutes and shell colour changed with body size, and shell colour pattern differed between sexes. The carapace was darker at intermediate body sizes (large juveniles and small adults); the increase in dark appearance resulted primarily from widening of the dark pigment band around scute margins as growth laminae were added. Both the lighter shell colour and reduced serration of large adults may be due to shell wear; large adults may produce less dark pigment, and older laminae disappear due to flaking or peeling. Females had a darker overall colour, more rays and fewer speckles than did males. This dimorphism may relate to thermoregulation, gamete protection or intraspecific communication. Both male and female patterns may confer crypsis if the sexes use microhabitats differently. Key words: Tortoise Homopus morphologycoloursexual dimorphism",

The ovaries each contained a single germinal epithelium (bed) with numerous oogonia and primordial follicles. Similar to other squamates, the ovarian stroma was characterized by follicles in different stages of development, and may contain corpora lutea, and corpora atretica. The seasonal study revealed that vitellogenic ovarian hypertrophy commenced in spring (September) and ovulation of the first clutch (two eggs) occurred in summer (November). A second vitellogenic cycle followed, the second clutch being ovulated in late‐summer (January). Ovarian quiescence, marked by predominance of pre‐vitellogenic (hydration stage) follicles, was evident in females collected from February to July. Although oocyte growth was accompanied by changes in the granulosa layer, zona radiata and thecal layers, the zona pellucida remained unchanged throughout. The small cells of the granulosa layer differentiated into three distinct cell types ‐ small, intermediate and the conspicuous large pyriform cells. Similar to most other squamates, the intermediate and pyriform cells at the onset of vitellogenesis regressed to a single cuboidal epithelium. Following ovulation, the granulosa layer hypertrophied forming luteal tissue. The theca layer differentiated into two layers and septal invasion of the corpus luteum took place. At the time of oviposition, corpora lutea regressed to form ovarian scars (corpora albicantia). Follicular artresia occurred in previtellogenic follicles (hydration stage) and seldom in vitellogenic follicles. The highest incidence of atresia occurred in the post‐breeding period (February). The gross morphology, oogenesis and folliculogenesis of the ovaries of H. mabouia correspond to the general squamate pattern described for oviparous reptiles.",

Males and females of this species differ from all other species of the Calumma nasutum group by an almost absent rostral appendage, by a characteristic stress colouration in the female consisting of a dark reddish ground colouration with many irregular light blue spots, and by significant sequence divergence in the mitochondrial ND2 gene (10.5–19.4% pairwise distance) and no haplotype sharing in the nuclear C-mos gene compared with other members of the C. nasutum group. A molecular survey of C. nasutum populations occurring near the type locality of the new species reveals an extraordinarily high genetic diversity within this morphologically conservative chameleon group. We suspect that C. vohibola might be restricted to a rather small and fragmented distribution range within the last littoral forest fragments along the coast. Owing to the unsolved taxonomic situation of the C. nasutum group, no reliable distribution data of any member of this group are available at present, and hence we cannot ascertain whether the extent of occurrence of C. vohibola is indeed as restricted as suspected. Intensive surveys and field studies are necessary to clarify the distribution limits of this new species and to assess its conservation status reliably.",

AAE was dependent on food type, being 89.8% when snakes were fed frogs and 82.8% when fed mice. Differences in AAE for different meal types could be ascribed to the indigestible hair in mouse meals because differences were lost once this component of the mouse meals was removed from the calculation. AAE did not depend on snake body mass and there was no significant difference between AAE measures made at 20°C and 27°C for mouse meals. Gut passage time was 25% faster at 27°C than at 20°C, but was not affected by food type or snake body mass. Larger meals took longer to digest. Thus, H. haemachatus appears to offset reduced digestive performance at lower temperatures by retaining food in the gut for longer when at lower body temperatures (Tbs). These results fit an emerging pattern in snakes whereby digestive efficiency is generally high and insensitive to Tb over the selected thermal range, but may become dependent at lower Tbs when digestion is eventually arrested. The rate of digestion is highly temperature-sensitive and is fastest in the selected Tb range. Diet appears to affect digestive efficiency owing, mainly, to the presence of indigestible components such as hair. Using a comparative framework, venom does not appear to improve digestion for this species, at least over the temperature range tested, relative to other snake species in the literature.

Three well-supported lineages were identified, each representing separate species. The taxonomic status of the two currently recognised species is validated, and we describe a new species of Limnophis from north-eastern Angola.

The dietary habits of those species during the period of seasonal aridity are poorly known. Little is known of the seasonal variation in the diet of the amphibians and reptiles of Kenya. This project examines the diets of several species of frogs and lizards collected during the dry season in an arid part of central Kenya. Some of the species were thought to be dormant during that season and others were thought to be actively feeding. The incidence of feeding may be used to determine if an animal is dormant. The dormancy may be brief and interrupted or protracted and continuous. Stomach contents were removed by dissection and analyzed in the laboratory. We identified 6,238 prey items to the lowest taxonomic unit possible, usually order, family, or genus. Definite prey items were all Arthropoda except for a single frog in one stomach and skink scales in a few stomachs. Within Arthropoda, Isoptera and Hymenoptera (ants) were the most abundant (5,662 items), followed by Coleoptera and Orthoptera (205 items). Eruciform and scarabaeiform larvae were recorded separately from adults. At least ten other orders of arthropods were recovered. Spiders were present in 12.4% of the stomachs. Specialization was exhibited by some species that utilized termites or ants extensively. A few nematodes were found. Inanimate objects were also found, including miscellaneous plant material, rocks, and charcoal. Termites were more important in reptile diets than in amphibian diets and were used almost exclusively by ground dwelling lizards. Termite specialists contained 87% or more termites and ant specialists contained 72% or more ants. Ptychadena anchitae and P. mascareniensis were the only generalists, based on a Shannon Diversity Index of >0.75. Active and reproductive species had a significantly higher number of food events than active and non‐reproductive species. All of the species examined were secondary, or partially tertiary, consumers and the prey taxa were mostly primary consumers, but included several secondary consumers. Reproductive species and non‐reproductive species in the same genus had different diets and preferences.",

This region includes the range of the smallest tortoise, Homopus signatus signatus. Although the effects of rainfall on the physiology and ecology of H. s. signatus received attention in recent years, the results of these studies have not been integrated to facilitate conservation planning. Here we evaluate the importance of body size and the responses of H. s. signatus to rainfall variation to make recommendations for the taxon's conservation. The small body of H. s. signatus offers one solution to its habitat of low primary productivity and rocky slopes. Nevertheless, female fecundity and egg size increase with female size, and large eggs result in large hatchlings capable of surviving their harsh environment. Females accumulate nutrients in the rainfall season, winter, but also in the dry season, to enable the production of large eggs. Egg production decreases during drought, although some females continue to channel resources to reproduction, apparently at the cost of their own growth. Reduced fecundity and growth, a result of aridification, would likely lower the production of large eggs and hatchlings. Therefore, conservation measures that reduce the mortality of large females may aid population sus-tainability. Because egg and hatchling size might drop below a minimum viable size in an aridified environment, H. s. signatus conservation would benefit from the development of suitable habitat corridors to enable tortoise movements to regions that will receive sufficient rainfall in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mantella aurantiaca is a small, bright orange, terrestrial amphibian that is endemic to the island of Madagascar. The species has attracted significant attention from herpetologists and captive breeders but relatively little effort has been given to its conservation in the wild. We surveyed 33 reported breeding localities of the species to determine sites of conservation importance and aspects of habitat use and seasonality. We found a total of 471 M. aurantiaca in 26 different localities, all of which were characterised by intact or degraded humid forest on sloping ground alongside temporary lentic ponds in narrow valleys. Additional monitoring at a single site revealed that adult M. aurantiaca predominantly used the ponds and surrounding humid forest habitat during the austral summer and moved upslope at the beginning of the austral winter. Effective conservation for this species should therefore include measures to safeguard both forest and aquatic habitat features. Although 62% of localities occurred in sites with a positive conservation status (provisional protected areas or Ramsar sites), there is currently heavy pressure from artisanal mining, logging and agriculture in these areas. Because a further 15% of sites occur on land due to be impacted by mining and an additional 23% were at sites without any biodiversity management, the future of M. aurantiaca in the wild is precarious. A species conservation strategy is therefore needed to produce a cohesive plan for the future which aims to secure as many sites as possible for conservation.

Herein we provide a rediagnosis of the genus and comparative diagnoses of four new species based on new material.ZooBank— urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:19C53BF3-BA52-4CAE-933F-5BBEE0AF0457",

We reconstruct the distribution of this species from museum specimens to the north and quantitative surveys in the south. In addition, a small (0.6 ha) study site near McDougall's Bay was searched on eight visits, each between two and seven nights long, between October 2002 and September 2007. The unique dorsal patterns of frogs were used as 'marks'. Recaptured animals moved between 0 and 380 m (mean±SD = 29±73 m, n=26). The highest counts in September 2006 of 66 adults and 39 juveniles show the population at a density of 110 adults ha−1. Voucher specimens held in museum collections were examined, and demonstrate the northernmost locality in Lüderitz, Namibia, with all 11 localities in white sandy habitat where coastal fog exceeds 100 days per year. The most southerly record from active searches was just south of Kleinzee in South Africa. A new threat to this species is housing development in prime coastal sand dunes.",

    "abstract": "The arrangement of scutes on the carapaces of extant chelonians is very similar among species, but intraspecific deviations from typical scute patterns are common. Because intraspecific variation may relate to inbreeding depression, unfavourable egg incubation conditions and the presence of environmental pollutants, investigations of carapacial scute patterns in natural populations can enhance insight into the ecologies and survival challenges of chelonians. A population of the tortoise Homopus signatus, inhabiting an arid range with substantial annual rainfall variation, was sampled to record carapacial scute patterns. The typical pattern of H. signatus consisted of five vertebral scutes, four pairs of costal scutes, a cervical and a supracaudal scute, and 12 pairs of marginal scutes. Although it was expected that size classes (i.e. representing tortoises born in different years) and sexes would have different percentages deviations from the typical scute pattern as a result of different egg incubation conditions, percentages were similar among size classes and sexes. A high percentage of 44% (25% if counts of the relatively variable marginal scutes were excluded) of all tortoises had deviant carapacial scute patterns. Since the study population was situated in a relatively pristine area and supernumerary carapacial scutes appear related to egg incubation conditions in other chelonians, the wide variation in carapacial scute patterns in wild H. signatus may be the result of frequently challenging incubation conditions in the species' harsh environment.",

    "abstract": "Ethnoherpetology improves our understanding of the conservation implications of nature-based cultural practices through investigations of the influence of traditional culture on frog and reptile species (herptiles). Improved understanding of the implications of human activities on these taxa is especially important as herptiles are experiencing global population declines. Furthermore, improved understanding of nature-based cultural practices can better inform conservation planning that includes cultural practices as defined by South African legislation. The herptile-based cultural practices recorded from a sample of 275 online questionnaire respondents and 68 publications show some cultural practices to compel or inspire protection of herptiles. Conversely, other practices were found to pose a conservation risk as they either involve killing herptile species or they perpetuate negative perceptions towards them. Leveraging protective cultural practices as a conservation tool and mitigating culture-motivated threats requires integrating cultural aspects into modern law. Such an integrative approach is possible under South African legislation's provisions for socially inclusive conservation planning and recognition of customary law. Integrative conservation approaches are also in line with international policy such as the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework. In addition to an inventory of herptile-based cultural practices, the study also assesses their feasibility as conservation tools. Furthermore, this study highlights a need for quantification of their conservation implications (both positive and negative) and aligning protective traditional cultural practices with modern means of law enforcement.",

Important food items appeared to be Oxalis spp., Leysera tenella, Grielum humifusum and Crassula thunbergiana minutiflora. Crassula t. minutiflora may be a potential source of water as it is a succulent. Flowers were present in 96% of the faecal samples and may be an effect of the study period. Almost all faecal samples contained nematodes and their eggs, sometimes in huge quantities, but the effect on the tortoise population is not known. Since only 50 ‐ 60% of the faecal volume could be identified, care must be taken in deriving conclusions from this study. I recommend that future dietary studies of H. s. signatus emphasise focal observations, include pollen analysis, and determine food availability in different seasons to identify preferences and temporal shifts.",

Females attain sexual maturity at approximately 300 mm snout‐vent length (SVL) and males at approximately 240 mm SVL. Females grow larger than males (maximum SVLs of 830 vs 700 mm SVL), and also have longer and wider heads and wider bodies than do males of the same body length. Males have relatively longer tails than females, but eye size relative to head length shows no sexual dimorphism. Both sexes breed each year. Females commence vitellogenesis in late winter (September) and oviposit from October to January. Clutch size ranged from four to 12 eggs with a mean of 7.58 and was highly correlated with female SVL. The testes of adult males are turgid throughout the year, suggesting a prolonged mating season. Of 73 prey items recorded, 97% were anurans. Six anuran families were represented among the prey items, but bufonids (39%), ranids (29%) and microhylids (25%) comprised most of the 51 anuran food items identified to genus. Larger snakes ate larger prey items, in terms of SVL as well as mass. However, the snake's sex and age (adult vs juvenile) did not affect prey type. Bufonids, microhylids and ranids were consumed by snakes of all ages and both sexes, and were eaten all year except during mid‐winter (July and August).",

Subsequent morphological studies have argued either for synonymy of the genera, or retention of the original 19th century taxonomy. Moreover, the validity and boundaries of putative species within each genus, as well as the relationships of each genus to other gekkonid genera, remains unresolved and contentious. We sequenced 3433 aligned bp of mitochondrial (ND2 and ND4) and nuclear (RAG‐1 and PDC) DNA sequence data from 14 samples of Homopholis and Blaesodactylus representing all six recognized species in these two genera, and based on a larger, unpublished study of all gekkotan relationships, eight samples of Geckolepis and two species of Afroedura for outgroups. Results indicated a strongly supported, mono‐phyletic clade including Geckolepis as the sister group to Blaesodactylus + Homopholis, with the latter two genera reciprocally monophyletic. Given the clear morphological and biogeographic distinctness of Homopholis sensu stricto from Blaesodactylus, as well as deep genetic divergence between the two groups, we favor the retention of Blaesodactylus as the valid generic name for the Madagascan species. Homopholis mulleri is confirmed as a valid species, and evidence of cryptic speciation is suggested among divergent samples of H. walbergii (often misspelled in the literature), and among samples of Blaesodactylus and Geckolepis. The pattern observed among South African samples of H. walbergii suggests an important role for the Soutpansberg as a barrier to gene flow.

Under-representation of the Tankwa Karoo in the dataset required an additional field survey of this region. Prior to the survey, available records from the Tankwa Karoo Basin represented only 13 reptile species. A total of 36 species (24 lizards, nine snakes, three chelonians) was recorded during our survey of this area. Turnover across the Basin is high, species richness is lower than in surrounding mountainous areas and there are no species endemic to the area. The Tankwa Karoo Basin acts as a dispersal barrier for many reptile species occurring in the surrounding more mesic areas. At the same time, the ranges of a number of typical northern, arid-adapted species extend southward along the Tankwa plains. A number of species range extensions in the region are reported.

    "abstract": "The sub-Saharan African file snake genus Gonionotophis is currently comprised of 15 species. However, the concept of this genus has been confounded by morphological and genetic differences between the constituent taxa. Due to the dearth of DNA samples, a taxonomic assessment has been impractical to date. We therefore sequenced two mitochondrial and one nuclear marker (16S, cyt b, and c-mos) from 45 samples representing ten species of Gonionotophis to construct a molecular phylogeny using Bayesian and likelihood approaches. Four divergent and well-supported clades were recovered, including: (1) grantii + brussauxi; (2) poensis + stenophthalmus; (3) nyassae; and (4) capensis, chanleri, crossi, guirali and savorgnani. Based on these results and morphological data, the genus Gonionotophis is restricted to the first clade, Mehelya is resurrected for the species in the second clade, and new genera are described for the remaining two clades.ZooBank—urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:A82CFAD6-E2E0-439E-90BB-9224E225426B",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract Stiletto Snakes (genus Atractaspis) are the most poorly studied of the three clades of snakes with front-fanged venom-delivery systems. Fossorial and endemic to Africa and the Middle East, Atractaspis possess uniquely derived mobile fangs that allow them to perform a 'side-stabbing' method of envenomation, rather than the frontal strike of most other venomous snakes. While many studies have examined the functional anatomy of these unique fangs, the evolutionary history of Atractaspis has been comparatively neglected by researchers. While several evolutionary hypotheses exist for relationships within the Atractaspididae, no study has focused on the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Atractaspis itself. This study presents the first attempt to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of 14 species within this genus, using external morphological data. Using Macrelaps and Homoroselaps as alternate outgroups, We compare the results of two phylogenies and provide a starting point for an investigation of the evolutionary history of this remarkable yet relatively little-known genus.

As a result not all prey types are of equal value, and the relative frequency with which different prey types are consumed can strongly influence an organism's fitness. In order to understand foraging behaviour of an organism adequately, one needs to know not only what constitutes suitable prey, but also the relative frequency with which different prey types are encountered by a foraging individual. In this article we investigate the foraging ecology of the Namaqua Dwarf Adder, Bitis schneideri. We use field observations of feeding snakes and records of stomach contents to describe the diet of the species at our study site and compare these measures to measures of prey abundance, collected using passive trapping, to assess whether the species is a selective or generalist feeder. We recorded four species of lizard and one species of frog in the diet of our study population. Our data show that Namaqua Dwarf Adders are generalist predators, feeding year-round, and feeding on prey in proportion to the frequency at which they are encountered. Moreover, we show that large Namaqua Dwarf Adders do not exclude small prey items from their diet. The capacity for Namaqua Dwarf Adders to feed on a wide variety of prey species in proportion to the rate at which they are encountered suggests that future changes in prey species composition are unlikely to influence rates of energy uptake by foraging snakes.",

The phylogenetic relationships of this species with other lacertid lizards are still not clear and have never been assessed in any phylogeny of Lacertidae using DNA sequence data. In this study we employed 3 044 base pairs from mitochondrial cytochrome b, 12S and 16S rRNA genes to investigate the phylogenetic position and the evolutionary history of A. australis. We performed phylogenetic analyses under the assumptions of Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference and estimated the timing of the cladogenic events related to A. australis by using a relaxed molecular clock method. Our phylogenetic reconstruction clearly placed A. australis within the southern African branch of the tribe Eremiadini including genera Tropidosaura, Meroles, and Pedioplanis. The former genus constitutes with A. australis a clade endemic to southernmost mountains of Africa. The radiation of this southern African clade is estimated to have occurred during the Mid Miocene (14.7–11.5 Mya), and it was likely due to the climate changes that occurred in the South African region at that time.

    "abstract": "Abstract The term ‘Afrotemperate’ is taken to cover the area and fauna of the southern Cape, eastern highlands of South Africa, and intertropical highlands. A feature of Afrotemperate distribution is that it conforms to climatic zones rather than to latitudinal zonation. Two main patterns of Afrotemperate distribution are perceived. One is shown by species or genera concentrated in temperate South Africa, or present both in the non-tropical south and disjunctly in the cartographic tropics in highland areas of non-tropical climate to the north. Another pattern is a concentration of species or genera on highlands of East Africa. A concentration of cool-preferring species in the south has led to the concept of this being a centre of endemism, with a radiation undergoing progressive attenuation northwards on highlands within the cartographic tropics; this concept is questioned in the case of several species, and a reverse direction of attenuation from East African highlands southwards is evident in others. Special attention is given to the widespread and problematic genus Strongylopus, whose biogeography is largely unresolved at present. The conventional application of the term ‘Afrotropical Region’ to the whole of Subsaharan Africa is criticised since a large proportion of the Subsaharan amphibian fauna avoids areas of tropical climate, including areas within the cartographic tropics. Undiscerning blanket application of the term ‘Afrotropical’ tends to divert attention away from the rich cool-preferring Afrotemperate faunas and floras. If a faunal and floral unity in Subsaharan Africa needs to be recognised by a corporate name, the name Subsaharan Region seems preferable to ‘Afrotropical Region’.",

    "abstract": "AbstractStudies of diet suggest that skinks are opportunistic predators. However, there is little information on actual diet preferences because most studies do not evaluate the availability of prey in the environment. We analysed the diet selection of a population of the little-known skink Chalcides parallelus from the Chafarinas Islands in North Africa. This species is considered highly threatened, and diet selection is an important basic point on which to support the design of conservation plans. We specifically examined diet estimated from faecal material collected from live skinks, and compared diet with availability of invertebrates in the microhabitats used by skinks (under rocks and in the leaf litter). Results indicated that the diet of C. parallelus skinks consisted of the same types of invertebrates that are more commonly found in the habitat such as beetles (54.8% of prey), cockroaches, spiders and snails. This diet could be considered generalist, and probably opportunistic. However, the comparison of proportions of prey types in the diet and those available in the habitat revealed that C. parallelus did not eat prey at random, but selected some particular prey types (beetles, cockroaches, and pseudoscorpiones) while others (ants and isopods) were consumed less than expected by their abundance. Invertebrates available and consumed did not differ in size, but skinks consumed beetles that were smaller than the average size of those available. We discuss how diet preferences could be due to selection of the more profitable or easily captured prey.Key words: SkinksChalcidesdietfaecal pelletsNorth Africa AcknowledgementsWe thank three anonymous reviewers for helpful comments, and the personnel and facilities of the field station of the Refugio Nacional de Caza de las Islas Chafarinas which provided logistical support.

Our analysis revealed high intraspecific variability in both species, especially in the dorso-ventral axis, but without a geographical structure.

In this study we analyse the genetic variability of these two species across their distribution range using two mitochondrial fragments, 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA. The results confirm the paraphyly of the group, with E. algeriensis more related to Scincopus than to E. schneideri. Eumeces algeriensis shows relatively low levels of genetic diversity, which is distributed in two main lineages, one across Morocco, and the other restricted to the southern region (Anti-Atlas). These results are discordant with the high diversity found in other species from the same area and suggest a relatively recent expansion of E. algeriensis across most of its current range. Regarding E. schneideri, we find high levels of genetic variability and a complex pattern of genetic diversity, concordant with the phylogeographic patterns found recently in other species from the Middle East region, but not with the current intra-specific taxonomy of this group.

Ethnozoological data on the use of pythons for the treatment of human ailments were gathered from 45 traditional medicine practitioners using semi-structured interviews. The use value index and informant agreement ratio were calculated to ascertain the most sought after python body part and the level of agreement of a python body part for the treatment of human ailments. The python head, bones, and skin were the body parts found to be used for traditional medicine purposes together with the fat and eggs. Python fat had the highest use value and informant agreement ratio. Rheumatism, headache, bedwetting, diabetes, and spiritual protection were among the human ailments that were treated with python. Overall, python medicinal use was mainly for spiritual ailments rather than medical ailments. Although the python is currently of less international conservation importance, there is a need to reconcile the high use values of species by traditional medicine practitioners with their conservation status to evaluate their current threats.",

Here we aim to investigate, for the first time, the phenotypic variability of this species, using univariate and multivariate analyses on linear measurements, pholidotic and coloration characters in six populations of A. andreanskyi previously analysed genetically and covering most of its distribution range. The results show that despite the high genetic divergence previously detected, morphological variation among populations was low. Thus, although some genetic lineages could be partially discriminated morphologically at a multivariate level, single diagnostic traits could not be identified, and thus, they can be considered as cryptic lineages. Although the extreme genetic diversity observed supports the existence of six independent entities, more prospecting and analysis of additional populations will be needed to confirm the evolutionary independence of the lineages before their formal description.",

The laryngotracheal region has long been noted to display unusual characteristics, with a widely expanded and membrane-roofed anterior portion of the trachea being prominent among these. It has been proposed that this tracheal expansion serves as a reservoir for pressurised air that is explosively released and provides the energy for the loud distress calls released by these lizards. To determine whether this hypothesis is supported by associated anatomical features, we examined the laryngotracheal region in more detail, for 6 of 14 of the species within the genus, and compared the results to what is known of the laryngotracheal anatomy of Afro-Malagasy geckos. The muscles of the gular region, and the form and dimensions of the trachea, larynx and their adnexa, are described. Modifications of the gular muscles and their attachments render the larynx of Uroplatus more mobile in the oropharyngeal region, and in large-bodied taxa (U. lineatus, U. sikorae) the trachea exhibits the degree of expansion previously observed for U. fimbriatus. In these taxa the paired gular muscles fail to meet in the ventral midline and are, instead, bridged by fascial sheets. These modifications are consistent with ventral displacement of the anterior terminus of the trachea when charged with pressurised air, prior to the opening of the glottal valve and the release of a loud, harmonically-unstructured and explosive distress call. Such calls are likely directed at avian and mammalian predators to induce a startle response. The range of anatomical form of the laryngotracheal region exhibited within Uroplatus provides insights into the variation of laryngotracheal structure, such as incomplete tracheal rings and a conical trachea, which are exhibited by other Afro-Malagasy geckos.",

Understanding the drivers of colour pattern variation within species can therefore provide valuable insights about adaptation. However, the ecogeographic correlates, and thus the ecological drivers, associated with the segregation of different colour morphs for most reptile species, including snakes, are not well known. Here, we examined differences in environmental niches associated with occurrence records of preserved museum specimens and georeferenced photographic images of common egg-eaters (Dasypeltis scabra) to characterise ecogeographic divergence between typically patterned, patternless, and faintly marked individuals. We gathered 1707 records that we assigned as either patterned, plain, or intermediate morphs. Most records were of patterned individuals, which were widely distributed in southern Africa. Climate niches differed between morphs as plain and intermediate snakes were restricted to high-elevation areas in the Highveld grasslands of South Africa, and woodland-dominated areas in the central and eastern parts of both Zambia and Zimbabwe, but there were no areas where only plain or intermediate snakes occurred in isolation from patterned snakes. Environmental niche modelling predicted minimal areas suitable for co-habitation of colour morphs. We speculate that plain or weakly-marked colour patterns likely developed as an adaptation to increase camouflage ability in open areas in grassland and certain woodland habitats.",

Females produced one to two clutches per season and reproduced invariably from spring to late summer, irrespective of climatic conditions. Overall mean CS was 14 eggs per clutch (range: six to 23). CS was positively correlated with snout‐vent‐length (SVL), but not with relative laying date (RLD). There was no among year variation in CS within each age class with three‐year‐old females producing larger clutches over the studied period. Both SVL‐unadjusted and adjusted mean CSs varied significantly from year to year; the largest adjusted CS occurred in 1995 (14.6 + 0.6 eggs). A stepwise regression analysis using seasonal total precipitations and mean temperatures as independent variables indicated that clutch size is significantly related to spring precipitation, whereas it is not related to any other climatic variables tested, including all seasonal mean temperatures. Both EV and EM were not correlated with SVL, CS or RDL in any year, but they exhibit a significant annual variation with the smallest and lightest eggs produced in 1996 (1870.3 ± 372.4 mm3 and 1.05 ± 0.19 g, respectively) and the largest and heaviest ones in 1993 (2550.3 ± 647.7 mm3 and 1.16 ±0.27 g, respectively). Neither EV nor EM was related to precipitation or temperature. The results suggest that reproductive female A. impalearis are adapted to unpredictable proximate environmental factors, in particular spring precipitation which probably ensures sufficient resource levels for the long breeding season.",

In a laboratory setup, individuals were provided with an excess of shelters to determine whether limited availability of optimal shelters may be the cause of this species' aggregation behaviour in the wild. Chondrodactylus bibronii grouped significantly more than predicted by the urn model of random occupation, hinting at mutual conspecific attraction as a possible mechanism for the observed aggregating behaviour. A slight temperature gradient in our laboratory setup, however, precludes a firmer conclusion. In addition to the laboratory study, a field‐survey was conducted to investigate the incidence, size and composition of groups. The proportion of solitary C. bibronii individuals (39%) in our sample was more than double that found in the group‐living lizard, Cordylus cataphractus where the mechanism for aggregation behaviour is known to be mutual conspecific attraction. Similar to small groups of C. cataphractus, the C. bibronii groups in our sample never contained more than one adult male. Like in C. cataphractus, solitary males were also found to be significantly smaller in body size than group‐living ones. Unlike in C. cataphractus, there was no statistical difference in the proportions of solitary males and solitary females in our sample. It thus remains unclear whether aggregation in C. bibronii is induced by limited availability of optimal shelters or whether it is the result of mutual conspecific attraction. Our data provide support for both mechanisms.",

Eighty percent of all herpetofaunal species detected during the survey were detected in riparian areas. We hypothesise that reduced species richness and abundance in non-riparian habitats has resulted from the use of biocides and harvesting regimes and / or the lack of structural complexity in agricultural monocultures. Our results highlight the value of riparian buffer zones in agricultural landscapes as riparian areas have the capacity to act as corridors connecting areas of suitable habitat as well as refugia that could allow for herpetofaunal colonisation of sub-optimal habitats or the recolonisation of restored habitats should future rehabilitation of the site be undertaken.",

These two forms were elevated to species status based on slight differences in morphology, ecological differentiation and seemingly allopatric distributions. The molecular relationships of these two species, referred to as the T. variegata complex, have not been investigated. Here, we use both mitochondrial (ND2) and nuclear (RAG-1) data to test whether T. variegata and T. punctulata form reciprocally monophyletic assemblages, supporting species recognition. While we do not find direct evidence that these two species have a sister taxon relationship, our results are likely driven by an undescribed lineage within T. punctulata or by a sampling artefact. Based on all available evidence, we conservatively support recognition of T. variegata and T. punctulata as distinct species, but recommend further investigation of relationships within T. punctulata to resolve whether additional lineages are present in this group.",

Movement patterns varied between demographic classes as juveniles exhibited movements of higher average durations than adults overall, and spent a greater percentage of time moving than adult females. Juveniles turned their heads more often than adults; all individuals scan their surroundings more frequently in the open sand and near vegetation. An analysis of foraging behaviour indicates that M. cuneirostris exhibits relatively few movements per minute (MPM) and a wide range of percentage of time spent moving (PTM), making it difficult to categorise this species as either an ambush or active forager. Furthermore, intraspecific variation in foraging behaviour within this species exists, as adult males and juveniles exhibited higher PTM values than adult females.",

We also examined the topographical and substrate features, plant cover and climatic conditions at the occurrence sites. Our surveys indicated that P. poireti is widely-distributed on the Edough Peninsula. Pleurodeles poireti predominantly breeds in moderate to large water bodies densely covered with emergent vegetation. The water parameters are less influential in its selection of breeding sites, except dissolved oxygen and turbidity, which are usually high at the occupied sites. At the broad spatial scale, P. poireti is positively associated with lowlands in cultivated landscapes. However, the species has a relatively broad niche in the region, and also occurs in cork oak forests. The species tolerates some level of human alteration of the landscape, but some populations close to villages could disappear in response to the combined effects of habitat destruction and the presence of alien fish.",

These methods can be particularly appropriate for forest-dwelling crocodiles which are difficult to survey visually. However, basic vocal-repertoire data is lacking for many of the poorly known species. Here, we used passive acoustic recorders to capture 97 spontaneous vocal signals from a pair of captive adult African dwarf crocodiles (Osteolaemus tetraspis). We catalogued their acoustic repertoire and compared the calls recorded in captivity with 201 suspected wild O. tetraspis calls recorded in Gabon to determine whether the wild calls belonged to the same species. Captive and wild crocodiles produced the same four types of calls, not previously identified in other crocodylids. Short, low-frequency \"drums\" (31±12 Hz), longer, low-frequency \"rumbles\" (40 ± 14 Hz), as well as higher frequency \"moos\" (299 ± 133 Hz) and \"gusts\" (219 ± 108 Hz). Our results provide reference for species identification and support implementation of acoustic-based methods for African dwarf crocodile monitoring and conservation assessment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Latitudinal and altitudinal changes in composition of the African amphibian fauna is analysed to test the standard zoogeographical division of the continent into Palaearctic and Afrotropical Regions. A comparably high faunal change north and south of the. tropical savannas suggests that it is inappropriate to classify the south-temperate fauna as \"Afrotropical\". High geographical turnover between lowland and montane faunas north of the Cape likewise suggests the inappropriateness of classifying the fauna of the Afromontane archipelago as \"Afrotropical\". Although extending into the cartographic tropics, the area occupied by the temperate amphibian fauna lies outside the climatic tropics and covers the same general area as the Afrotemperate flora. This supports a division into three regions: Palaearctic, Afrotropical (in a restricted sense) and Afrotemperate. Account has to be taken of extensive transition zones between areas occupied by tropical and temperate amphibian faunas, and the Nile Delta is considered to show the typical features of a transition zone rather than be included in the Palaearctic Region as is usually done. Taxonomic differences are evident between faunas of East and West Africa, most marked in forest habitats, yet it seems acceptable to include non-Afromontane east and west faunas in a single Afrotropical Region. Reptiles, birds and mammals do not show a tripartite Palaearctic-Afrotropical-Afrotemperate pattern as strongly as amphibians. This is not unexpected considering global distribution patterns. The amphibian pattern agrees with that of several invertebrate groups, and supports the proposal of dividing the world into three main regions, Austral, Holotropical and Holarctic.",

Translocations of threatened species from urban development sites is a mitigation method that is used in various parts of the world. The translocation of B. melanocephalum largely by volunteers from a proposed light industrial business park to two neighbouring areas with partially restored habitats was eventually successful in one recipient area and unsuccessful in the other. The results suggest that translocations of B. melanocephalum from development construction sites to recipient areas will only be successful if adequate time and resources are available for: a) finding and securing suitable areas for habitat restoration; b) sufficient restoration of the indigenous vegetation in the recipient areas before the capture and translocation of B. melanocephalum from the proposed development sites; c) searching for, and capture of, all B. melanocephalum on the development sites, and; d) long‐term management of the restored habitat in a manner that does not result in significantly elevated mortality or dispersal of B. melanocephalum. Monitoring of B. melanocephalum numbers in the recipient sites, by at least two people per transect, is important to gauge the success or otherwise of the translocation. Monitoring can give insights into the controllable factors that have an impact on the numbers of chameleons, and provide suggestions as how to improve the management of the habitat.",

Quantitative analyses of the factors that may influence the occurrence of fossorial herpetofaunal species are rare, with minimal work conducted in southern Africa. We mapped the absolute and relative fossorial herpetofaunal species richness across South Africa in order to highlight underlying trends in diversity. We also quantitatively surveyed fossorial herpetofauna at a site in Zululand, KwaZulu‐Natal, South Africa, using two methods. The first method has previously been used for surveying fossorial herpetofauna and involved two investigators excavating 28 clusters of five 1 m × 1 m × 0.3 m pits (total of 71 tons), placing all excavated soil on a plastic sheet and searching through the excavated soil by hand. The second method involved the use of heavy‐duty, earthmoving machinery to systematically excavate 193 m × 3 m × 1 m pits (total of 234 tons), passing all soil through a custom‐built table‐sieve to expose herpetofauna. At each site, soil compaction, particle size distribution, and land use were recorded. A Generalized Linear/Nonlinear Model (GLZ) was used to test for factors that predicted fossorial herpetofaunal density. Only seven specimens were captured from three species, yielding density estimates of between 0 and 0.4 individuals.m‐2. None of the measured factors predicted fossorial herpetofaunal density, possibly because of the low capture rates. Our data indicate that fossorial herpetofauna occurrence was patchy and individuals occurred at low densities at the site. We explore several possible explanations for these patterns.

    "abstract": "Abstract We reinvestigated the anuran amphibian fauna of the Lamto region in Central, Côte d'Ivoire, 40 years after this fauna was assessed for the first time. During this period, the region lost about 90% of the forest cover, resulting in an overall change from a forest to a savanna-dominated landscape. Surprisingly, the overall species richness and composition of the amphibian fauna changed only little. We did not observe six species previously recorded from the area but added two more. A total of 40 amphibian species are now known from the savanna/forest mosaic of Lamto. Unfortunately, due to methodological differences, a quantitative comparison of the present and previous amphibian fauna was not possible. It is hence possible that the small qualitative changes in the amphibian fauna obscure more important quantitative ones; in particular the observation of decreasing numbers of Phrynobatrachus spp. and increasing numbers of Arthroleptis spp. hint on microclimate changes affecting the reproductive opportunities for these ecologically different frog groups.

    "abstract": "Abstract Abstract Habitat transfonnation is the primary anthropogenic threat to global biodiversity. Fragmentation of reptile populations following habitat transfonnation within a landscape can lead to the extirpation of species. We investigated the effects of land-use on the species richness and abundance of reptile assemblages in three habitat types (two natural and one modified) in the grasslands of Gauteng, South Africa. Using trap arrays, we surveyed reptiles in primary grassland with little or no rock cover, primary grassland with large quartzite outcrops and scattered rocks, and secondary grasslands that were historically ploughed and cropped. We measured vegetation height and vegetation cover at these same localities. We caught significantly fewer reptile species in the historically cultivated sites than in either of the two natural habitat types. Differences in the reptile assemblage of each habitat type were not explained by either the spatial location or the vegetation structure of our trap sites but were well explained by the sites' habitat type. Estimates of total species richness indicated that we were able to adequately sample the reptile assemblages in the three habitat types, further supporting our observation of reduced species richness in the secondary grasslands. We infer that habitat transfonnation associated with cultivation e.g., rock removal, has had a detectable, negative impact on the species richness and composition of the local reptile assemblages. We recommend that land-use planning in Gauteng emphasise the need for areas of inter-connected, untransfonned habitat in order to mitigate the negative impacts of habitat transfonnation on the local reptile diversity.

Skeletochronological analysis was conducted on clipped phalanges of 20 males and 20 females. The results of these analyses indicated that the age range was 3–7 years in females and 3–6 years in males, and that sexual maturity was attained between 2 and 4 years, comparatively earlier in males than in females. There was a significant correlation between age and size in females. This species appears larger in size but less long-lived than the sister-species D. antongilii.",

It contained 21 adult males and females. Each was marked with a transponder so that the behaviour of individuals could be tracked. The animals inhabited the bottom of the pond. They were active from dusk to midnight. Series of nights in which several males called alternated with series without calling. Simultaneous calls were not synchronised. On nights when males called, several of them established territories on the bottom of the pond that they defended against other males. They delineated the territory by calling along its borders. When meeting a male intruder they emitted an encounter call, followed by a fighting call if they fought. At the end of a fight the loser emitted a release call. Territories could remain constant over several weeks. They were abandoned on nights without calling, but re-established by the same individuals at the same locations on nights with calling. When a female entered a territory, the male approached, started the courtship call and attempted amplexus. The female usually rejected the male while emitting a release call. Females spawned synchronously on one or two nights, with weeks without oviposition in-between. Eggs were laid individually or in small groups on hard structures all over the pond. The adults preyed upon the tadpoles and only a few single tadpoles remained after two weeks. Raising the water level stimulated calling activity.",

This applies especially to the East African clade, which includes the genera Nucras, Latastia, Philochortus, Pseuderemias and Heliobolus. We present a detailed description of the skull osteology of the genus Heliobolus using X-ray microcomputed tomography and compare its morphology to the above lacertid taxa. Because the genus Heliobolus includes species of doubtful validity and affinities (Heliobolus neumanni and Heliobolus nitidus), we also present a detailed intrageneric comparison and construct a morphological character matrix that we analyse against a phylogenetic backbone derived from previous molecular studies. Heliobolus lugubris and Heliobolus spekii can be well characterised as a monophyletic group on the basis of a short postorbital and a continuously broad posterior margin of the parietal, differing from H. nitidus and other members of the East African clade in an overall low degree of ossification and reduced ventral extension of the frontal bone. Our preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests that the genus Heliobolus is currently polyphyletic. We propose that the name H. neumanni be officially retracted, because specimens assigned to this species show very different morphologies relative to each other and are placed in different parts of the tree in our analysis. Also, the type specimen is lost and no specimens were collected from the type locality. H. nitidus shows a signal towards the genus Latastia. A definitive, new generic assignment of H. nitidus must await further investigations based on molecular data.",

[Google Scholar] is a poorly known lacertid endemic to north-eastern Angola and is only known from the type series collected more than half a century ago. The original description provided a comprehensive morphological description, but there was a lack of information regarding its evolutionary relationships and habitat associations. A recent discovery of N. scalaris from Cusseque, Bié Province, on the central Angolan plateau provided the opportunity to address some knowledge gaps of this species. A phylogenetic analysis confirmed its distinctiveness at the species level. Despite a limited dataset, the analysis suggests that N. scalaris is sister to N. broadleyi rather than N. lalandii, the latter having been assumed to be the sister species, because of morphological similarity between them. The new record of N. scalaris represents a range extension of more than 350 km to the southwest and extends the elevation range to 1 570 m above sea level, compared to previous known localities at about 1 300 m above sea level (Alto Cuílo and Alto Chicapa, in Lunda Sul Province). The specimen also provides new information on live coloration, as well as the habitat association of grassy shrubland that is dominated by geoxylic suffrutices (the so-called ‘underground forests’) characteristic of the Angolan Miombo Woodlands. This new information raises the question whether poor survey data have led to an under-estimation of faunal diversity in this peculiar and overlooked vegetation type, and reinforces the need for further surveys which could highlight the importance of this habitat.",

Until recently, no molecular data were available for either species, impeding their phylogenetic placement. However, due to several synapomorphic characters, it was suggested that the Tinhosa Grande population would be related to the congeners of the neighbouring islands of Príncipe and São Tomé. In a recent survey of Tinhosa Grande islet we collected fresh material of both species, allowing us to examine their phylogenetic relationships to the other members of their respective genera occurring on the neighbouring islands using multigene Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. In contrast with the morphological results and previous taxonomic allocations, our molecular results suggest that both T. adamastor and the unidentified Hemidactylus sp. are conspecific with their Príncipe counterparts, Trachylepis principensis and Hemidactylus principensis. While today Tinhosa and Príncipe differ strongly in their environmental conditions, we show that the islands have been repeatedly merged into a single landmass as a result of Quaternary sea level fluctuations. We suggest that the repeated fusion of the islands during low sea levels could have impeded the phylogenetic divergence of both populations, while contrasting habitats might have simultaneously promoted some morphological differences.",

As with other chelonians, however, the species’ slow growth rate, coupled with low survivorship of juveniles, make it susceptible to declines under regimes of environmental perturbation. Here we studied the impact of electrified fences, a key source of mortality for many South African terrestrial vertebrate taxa, on leopard tortoise mortality in the Free State Province (Jacobsdal district) and Northern Cape Province (Strydenburg district), and its implications for survivorship of this population. Our results show a strong selection bias towards larger (breeding age) individuals that, given the life history of the species, should have strong (negative) consequences for populations. Using data for tortoise populations from other regions as a baseline for survivorship rates in populations unaffected by fencing, we derived a size-structure matrix model to evaluate the impact on population growth rates. Population projections, taking into account variation in survivorship and reproductive rates across and within size classes, indicated substantially higher risk of negative population growth (and eventual extinction) in populations affected by electrified fences.

Historically, these island populations have been referred to as part of either the Boaedon fuliginosus species complex or Boaedon capensis species complex, two of the most taxonomically challenging groups of African snakes, or considered a distinct taxonomic entity, B. bedriagae. Here we review the São Tomé and Príncipe populations through a combination of morphological and molecular data. Our results suggest that each island population represents a unique species. After a thorough review of the taxonomic and nomenclatural history of the group, we revalidate B. bedriagae, restricting the application of this name to the São Tomé population by the designation of a lectotype. We also describe the Príncipe population as a new species, Boaedon mendesi sp. nov. This description has implications to our understanding of the diversity and phylogeographic patterns of the Gulf of Guinea Oceanic Islands.",

    "abstract": "Although multiple paternity and sperm storage are common in squamates, neither has been conclusively demonstrated in the chameleons (Chamaeleonidae). To examine whether these traits are present in chameleons, the Cape Dwarf Chameleon (Bradypodion pumilum) was investigated. This viviparous species inhabits a temperate climate in southern Africa, has aseasonal breeding, and can produce multiple clutches annually. Given this reproductive schedule, we hypothesised that females may mate opportunistically and store sperm, and that single clutches may have multiple sires. To examine this, six females and their clutches were genotyped using microsatellite markers, and assessed for multiple paternity. In addition, 46 females were assessed for sperm storage structures and presence of sperm in the oviduct. Multiple paternity was found in all six clutches, based on the presence of multiple alleles at all loci that could not be assigned to the mother. No evidence of specialised sperm storage structures was found, but sperm was present in the lumen of the posterior oviduct in 74% of females. While sperm storage cannot be concluded with finality, it seems likely to occur, rather assuming that three out of four of the females in the sample had mated just prior to capture. Furthermore, two post-partum females retained sperm in the oviducts after the delivery of a clutch, but in the absence of additional copulation. Given that this species has aseasonal reproduction, if sperm is indeed stored long-term, this combination of traits would be advantageous given the lack of defined breeding season and presumably low rates of mate encounter.",

The mean clutch size, based on the first clutches, is 3.44±1.33 eggs per clutch (range: 1–5 eggs); the eggs are elongated in shape. The mean relative egg mass and relative clutch mass are 1.70±0.28% and 4.06±1.32%, respectively.

The body mass at hatching is 12.8±0.6 g. The carapace is sub-circular and more domed than that of adults. The obtained data are compared to those reported for other populations and subspecies of T. graeca across its distribution range. The present study would, hopefully, help to assess the potential for tortoise captive breeding in the eco-climatic conditions of Marrakech, west-central Morocco, for the reinforcement of local declining populations.",

The absence of such pigment in B. fischeri and similar small Afromontane chameleons is consistent with published morphological and molecular evidence and suggests that these lizards may have been incorrectly assigned to genus by Klaver & Böhme (1986). The occurrence of peritoneal pigment in the R. marshalli group highlights the heterogeneity of the genus as presently construed and may lend credence to the interpretation of Rhampholeon as a metataxon (Crumly & Rieppel 1993). Although both ultraviolet protection and infrared absorption may be accomplished by the peritoneal pigmentation, the latter function appears to be paramount as chameleons lacking internal pigment are generally protected from ultraviolet radiation by a deep dermal layer of melanocytes.",

Fifty-nine species of Bufo are considered to occur in Africa. Preliminary analysis using grid partitioning shows greatest species diversity around the Bight of Biafra, Ethiopia and East Africa. Some 46% of all species are associated with mesic areas, 32% with arid areas. Twenty five dwarf non-Bufo species can be included in a Nectophryne and a Mertensophryne—Stephopaedes group; these are associated with forest or open highland situations, which augments the diversity shown by Bufo species in these situations. Disjunct species ranges associated with these situations, and the occurrence of isolated species and genera indicate that extinction is a normal part of the African scene. The small amount of evidence available shows that vulnerability of localized mesic species is a matter of great complexity, and that forest-associated species have proved to be able to tolerate replacement of natural vegetation with exotics provided cover is maintained. This is not to be taken as licence to disturb mesic habitats in Africa; time needs to be allowed to assess the effects of human-induced habitat disturbance.",

We examined agonistic behaviour in males of two lizard species: Platysaurus minor and P. monotropis. In each of nine outdoor field enclosures, we maintained a male and a female of both species (i.e., four total) and observed the dominance relationship between the males. Interspecific aggression was intense and P. monotropis was dominant in eight of nine enclosures. Furthermore, P. minor males received significantly more bite marks than P. monotropis males during the course of the experiment. To distinguish among the two hypotheses for interspecific aggression (mistaken identity and competitive exclusion), we presented P. minor males from sympatry and allopatry with model lizards of both taxa and measured aggressive responses. All trials with models were conducted in field enclosures where males were kept alone for the duration of the experiment. The model experiment revealed that compared to P. minor from sympatry, allopatric P. minor males were no less aggressive towards the heterospecific model than the conspecific model, a finding that supports the mistaken identity hypothesis. Finally, in the same experiment, we included a supernormal stimulus (pink Platysaurus model) to test if males were simply responding to a brightly coloured male lizard. Males showed some aggression towards the supernormal model, but significantly less than towards the two models (P. minor and P. monotropis) combined.",

The other prey orders occurred with far lower frequencies. Vegetation and seeds occurred in over half of the stomachs of the diurnal, S. scincus and C. ocellatus. The high occurrence of plant materials in the stomachs of S. scincus and C. ocellatus suggest that these items were intentionally consumed. Vegetation and seeds occurred at a far lower frequency in the nocturnal S. sepsoides, which fits the general pattern of low vegetation consumption by nocturnal and subterranean lizards. An interesting find of this study was an Acanthodactylus longipes in a S. scincus stomach ‐ to our knowledge, this is the first such record. The occurrence of the lizard A. longipes, and high rate of vegetation and insect consumption by S. scincus could suggest that diurnal, sand dune lizards are opportunistic feeders and dietary generalists. Future studies should examine in more detail the degree of dietary generalization or specialization in sand dune lizards.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The survival strategies of frogs exposed to harsh conditions include various forms of dormancy. Giant bullfrogs Pyxicephalus adspersus subjected to slow desiccation without access to moist substrata over winter in cocoons during dormancy. We found that Pyxicephalus can survive long periods of dormancy in soil without forming cocoons. With virtually no information available on the associated respiratory adaptations, we measured oxygen consumption rates of resting and exercising bullfrogs together with haematological and gas-binding properties of blood and haemoglobin (Hb) solutions from non-dormant frogs and cocoon-less dormant frogs. Treadmill (0.054 ms−1) exercising frogs consumed nearly seven times more oxygen than resting individuals (8.45 and 1.25 mmol O2 kg−1h−1, respectively). During a six-month dormancy period Pyxicephalus lost an average of 13.7% of its body mass, while plasma osmotic pressure increased from 231 to 320 mOsm l −1 coupled with concomitant increases in plasma sodium level, haematocrit, as well as in total Hb and metHb concentrations. Whole blood oxygen affinity was markedly higher in dormant frogs than in non-dormant resting frogs [half-saturation oxygen tensions, P50=33.0 mm Hg (pH: 7.63) and 44.9 mm Hg (pH 7.76), respectively, at 25 °C], which predictably favours pulmonary oxygen loading during dormancy in hypoxic substrata. Although hibernation resulted in sharp decreases in blood ATP concentration and the ATP: tetrameric Hb molar ratio that would increase blood oxygen affinity, the affinity of 'stripped' (cofactor-free) Pyxicephalus Hb shows low sensitivity to this effector. Hb-oxygen affinity is moreover insensitive to Cl− ions (that depress O2 affinity of most vertebrate haemoglobins) but oxygen affinity is strongly increased by urea and metHb formation that increase during dormancy. Isoelectric focusing reveals a single major isoHb (<95% of the total) and two trace components. The adaptive significance of the data is discussed in relation to the physiology of dormancy in Pyxicephalus adspersus, particularly the factors that secure oxygen uptake.",

Here, we present a phylogenetic reconstruction of the small-sized Uroplatus which are included in the Uroplatus ebenaui group, focusing on the most widespread species of these geckos, Uroplatus phantasticus, which occupies a large mid-altitude distribution range in the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. Our phylogeny is based on DNA sequences of four mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, COI and ND4), with a total of 2 312 base pairs. Partitioned Bayesian analysis confirmed U. malama from south-eastern Madagascar as the most basal representative of the group, followed by U. ebenaui from northern lowlands, and clades containing various undescribed candidate species as well as U. finiavana from Montagne d'Ambre in the north. Within our main targeted species U. phantasticus, the northernmost population from Zahamena (here considered as unconfirmed candidate species) forms the most basal lineage, while the southernmost populations studied from Marolambo, Ranomafana and Kianjavato form a nested clade, suggesting the species has expanded its range southwards undergoing repeated events of isolation and differentiation of lineages. Within the Ranomafana–Kianjavato area, we identified three different lineages, of which the two from Ranomafana are differentiated by 28 mutational steps in a fragment of the ND4 gene and occur on opposing banks of the Namorona River. This result suggests that this relatively small river currently limits dispersal and gene flow in these geckos. However, further downstream the Kianjavato population is more closely related to the population on the opposite side of the Namorona in Ranomafana, indicating that this genetic isolation is not absolute, and the river probably represents only a secondary barrier to gene flow in U. phantasticus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Data on population dynamics and distribution are of primary interest to biologists because they reveal information about the species' ecology and evolution and are thus essential for conservation efforts. Patchily distributed species are especially interesting for conservation studies, because of their sometimes very specific environmental requirements. An example of a highly specialised species is the leaf litter frog Phrynobatrachus guineensis. This small species (<20 mm) is short lived, presumably weakly mobile and highly specialised because it uses tree-holes and other small water-filled cavities with very particular abiotic and biotic characteristics for breeding. Previous field studies revealed that P. guineensis exhibited a clumped distribution in Taï National Park (TNP), Ivory Coast, suggesting that the park's population might be subdivided into several (sub)populations. We therefore investigated the population genetic structure of the park using four microsatellite loci, which are the first described microsatellite markers for any African anuran in general and for a species of the family Phrynobatrachidae in particular. In contrast to our expectations, we detected only a slightly significant genetic differentiation based on allele frequencies. We found no correlation between the geographic and genetic distances (isolation by distance) and Bayesian clustering revealed no genetic substructure. We did, however, detect small but significant genetic differentiation between subsequent seasons. The most probable explanation for the lack of population structure is that P. guineensis is more mobile than expected. Adults, most likely females but possibly also juveniles, are able to traverse matrix habitats in which no breeding activities were detected. The temporal genetic differentiation may be the consequence of genetic drift due to high mortality rates and/or non-random mating. Both explanations would be consistent with our field data.",

    "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation and transformation arising from urbanisation are leading causes of frog population declines. Artificial wetlands are sometimes used in remediation to minimise biodiversity loss in urban landscapes, but little is known about the specific habitat requirements of frog species for breeding. The aim of our study was to identify pan characteristics that promote Giant Bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus) breeding success, in order to improve artificial wetland design. African Bullfrogs breed in ephemeral pans and are currently listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) regionally as 'Near Threatened'. Most suitable bullfrog habitat has been transformed in the highly urbanised province of Gauteng, South Africa. We conducted this study in the Total Petroport N14 Biodiversity Reserve (Gauteng Province), which is an artificial wetland complex created in 2006 specifically for the conservation of bullfrog populations. Tadpole numbers and froglet recruitment were compared to the physical characteristics and water quality of 12 pans over two breeding seasons. Total dissolved solids (TDS) in pan water were weakly correlated with tadpole number. Survival to metamorphosis was significantly higher in pans which had been lined and as a result had longer hydroperiod. Frog recruitment, however, was not related to any of the measured physical characteristics of the pans. Thus, bullfrogs appear to be non-selective in their choice of breeding sites, and breeding success appears to largely depend on stochastic events, such as drying of pans. Confounding factors such as proximity to human activity may also impact breeding success. We conclude that a wide variety of artificial pans can adequately ameliorate negative impacts of land transformation on bullfrog recruitment.",

We found strong differences between seasons, and effects of weather, individuals and sex. The high activity was consistent with mild weather during autumn and spring. However, daily temperatures limited female movements on cool autumn days and male movements on warm spring days, a pattern consistent with sexual size dimorphism (large females and small males). The long movements in autumn probably helped tortoises find food plants that grow quickly after autumn rains; both sexes recover body condition from autumn lows, and females begin egg production in late-autumn and winter. These movements may also help males mate with females before they ovulate. The high activity of females in spring should help them forage and sustain their vitellogenesis, egg production and nesting in spring. Male paths tended to be more linear than female paths in both seasons, so this sexual difference is likely not linked to food consumption. Males may move long, linear paths to engage females and avoid other males. Males may have been thermally-challenged in spring. Their movements decreased with increased ground temperatures (in the sun), they used denser refugia in spring than in autumn, and in spring used denser refugia than females used. Geometric tortoises typically used different refugia on consecutive nights, a type of predator avoidance mechanism.",

The phylogenetic placement of B. heraldica within the four subgenera of the genus Bitis (Bitis, Macrocerastes, Calechidna, Keniabitis) has been problematic. The few recent taxonomic and phylogenetic revisions dealing with African viperids and the genus Bitis have not included this species, resulting in the default acceptance of B. heraldica as member of the subgenus Calechidna, based on similar morphology and size. During a survey in Huambo Province, central Angola, we collected the first specimen of this species in the past 65 years, allowing us to examine its phylogenetic relationships to other Bitis using multigene Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses of all species of Bitis, except B. harenna. Contrary to expectations that B. heraldica is a member of the subgenus Calechidna, our results unambiguously place B. heraldica among members of the subgenus Macrocerastes, which contains the largest-bodied species of the genus. The placement of B. heraldica within Macrocerastes raises interesting questions about body-size evolution in viperids and contributes to a better understanding of biogeographic patterns in south-western Africa, and particularly Angola.",

Five monitor lizards (SVL range 302 ‐ 360 mm) were equipped with SI‐2T temperature sensitive transmitters. Two individuals (male # 1 and female # 2) were residents of Fluseyyat Island in Zaranik, and three individuals (two males # 3 & # 4 and a female # 5) were translocated from sand dunes of similar habitat to Fluseyyat Island. I investigated differences between resident and translocated monitors in terms of their home range, movement and habitat selection. Four of the five lizards had home range sizes between 0.075 and 0.228 km2. A translocated male (# 4) exhibited homing behaviour, covering a total area of 2.11 km2. Lizards emerged from hibernacula in March and April and returned in October and November. Frequency of movement for lizards tracked year round ranged from 18 % ‐ 73.3 % of days. The mean distances travelled per day were 278.3 m and 182.7 m for males and females respectively, while the mean distances travelled per move were 173.9 m and 117.9 m. Translocated V. griseus travelled greater distances per day and per move than residents, for both males and females. Activity peaked in May and June. Daily patterns of activity occurred anytime between 07h00 to 20h00. Emergence normally began 2‐ 4h after sunrise, but earlier during the summer. Lizards retreated to burrows from 0.5 ‐ 1.5 h before sunset. Highest levels of activity were generally between 09h00 and 10h00, with basking being observed in the morning between 08h00 to 11h00 and again between 15h00 to 16h00. Bimodal activity patterns were most evident during the hottest months. The burrows most frequently used by monitors were located in areas with 20 ‐ 30 % vegetation cover.",

The potential distributions of the species were modelled at a scale of four hectares using distribution data of spatial resolution of ≤ 250 m. Six of the 14 endemic amphibian and reptilian species and subspecies meet the two conservation goals of: (1) at least 10 % of their present distributions under formal conservation management, and; (2) three such protected areas with viable populations. A benefit of modelling the potential distributions of endemics is that searching for populations of these amphibians and reptiles can be directed to areas where they are expected to occur. The data collected can then be used to improve the distribution models for these endemics, some of which are poorly known. The species distributions and their associated conservation targets form a vital component of the long‐term, iterative, systematic conservation planning project currently underway in the province.",

An additional 12 species have been found in the area but were not detected during our research at Mt. Cameroon. The total of 86 species represents more than one third of the reptilian fauna known in Cameroon, making this site among the richest in the country. Lowland forest had the greatest number of species (58) followed by submontane forest (45) montane forest (21) and marine (4) species. A number of rare or little known reptiles were encountered in the region including: the skink Lacertaspis gemmiventris and the blind snake Typhlops decorosus. Mt. Cameroon appears not to have any strictly endemic reptile species. The high number of reptiles recorded at this site highlights its significance in terms of biological diversity. Sound conservation measures through the erection of the proposed areas to forest reserves could maintain this high diversity while integrating the needs of agricultural companies and local people farming around the area.

    "abstract": "Abstract The lizard family Cordylidae has been classified as a clade of classical ambush foragers. Two species, Platysaurus broadleyi and Pseudocordylus capensis, however, display much greater movement rates during activity than other cordylids. Whereas the foraging behaviour ofP. broadleyi is now well-studied, little information is available on foraging in P. capensis, one of several melanistic cordylid species found in South Africa. This species is typically associated with large boulders or cliff faces. We expected that low food availability on large, barren rock surfaces, will necessitate a less sedentary foraging mode compared to that of other cordylids not frequenting large rock surfaces. In this study, we aimed to verify the high movement rates previously recorded for P. capensis. We also collected baseline data on home range size and spacing patterns. We investigated foraging behaviour of P. capensis at three localities and across two seasons. Our results confirmed previous findings that P. capensis, like P. broadleyi, displays a less sedentary foraging strategy in comparison to other cordylids. No consistent seasonal pattern in movement rates was observed. We concluded that a less sedentary foraging strategy is a prerequisite for life on large, barren rock surfaces where food availability may be low or not uniformly distributed. Like in the case of P. broadleyi, fruit may be an important dietary item of P. capensis, but further study is needed for confirmation. Both males and females of P. capensis have large home ranges, a unique phenomenon for cordylids. Among males, use of space only overlaps marginally, but extensive overlap occurs among males and females and among females, respectively.",

We recorded more than forty plant species at the study area, with monocot species (n = 7) having a greater percent cover than that of dicot species (n = 31 species) or Gymnospermae (n = 2). Tortoise diet was studied by categorising 4422 plant and animal fragments in faecal pellets of 20 males, 16 females and eight juveniles. Tortoises ate a wide variety of plant species, including 13 dicots and three monocots, and occasionally invertebrates. The number of fragments for a plant species was correlated with plant species cover, and plant vegetative tissues exceeded plant reproductive tissues in the faeces. Dicots (Fabaceae, Composeae, Primulaceae, and Caryophyllaceae) accounted for over 70% of the diet (faecal fragments). The high dietary (niche) overlap, and null model analysis (RA3 algorithm with 30,000 Monte Carlo simulations), indicate that males, females and juveniles did not partition food resources; all three groups ate the same plant species.",

This diet is quite unusual for a reptile, and invites investigation. We had an opportunity to examine the diet and to measure seed digestibility for M. anchietae living on dunes near Gobabeb, Namibia. Stomach contents taken harmlessly via esophageal cannulation in the field revealed that the average diet included 37% (dry mass basis) immature seeds, 61% arthropods and 2% green plant leaves and flowers. Captive lizards fed measured amounts of whole mature (dehisced) grass seeds, both with and without hulls, were unable to digest and assimilate any significant dry matter from them. Microscopic examination of seeds recovered from stomachs along with seed remains found in fresh fecal pellets from free‐living M. anchietae indicated that most of the “seeds” apparently were soft, moist, somewhat green and immature when eaten, and may be better termed “ovules”. This food, perhaps eaten directly from the flowers of the plant, would be much more digestible and nutritious than mature, dry, shed (dehisced) seeds. We suggest that the seed‐eating behavior of M. anchietae might be better described as herbivory than as granivory. Key words: dietdigestibilitynutritiongranivoryseed‐eating",

In addition, the skull of this species is characterised by the absence of the squamosal, fused nasals, reduced postorbitofrontal bone and extremely rounded parietal bones.

In the Ampijoroa forest of Ankarafantsika National Park in Madagascar, Madagascan spiny-tailed iguanas (Oplurus cuvieri cuvieri) inhabit a species rich vertebrate community and are exposed to multiple potential predators, such as raptors and snakes. We examined the response of wild iguanas to visual stimuli of avian and serpent predators by presenting iguanas with either a hawk or snake model. In most cases, the iguanas fled following contact with the hawk model. Exposure to the snake model also mostly resulted in the iguanas fleeing, but this response was preceded by other behaviours (e.g. push-up and dewlapping) that were not exhibited in response to the hawk model. Our results suggest that the spiny-tailed iguana adaptively alters anti-predator responses depending on the hunting methods and risk level of the immediate predators.",

We investigated patterns of sexual size dimorphism in a Tunisian population of Bosk's fringe-toed lizards Acanthodactylus boskianus asper, in relation to a Middle-eastern population of the same subspecies. Our results showed an overall male-biased size dimorphism, consistent with general sexual size dimorphism trends in lacertids, and provide support for both the fecundity advantage hypothesis and the intra-sexual selection hypothesis. Indeed, for similarly-sized heads, females had longer trunks than males, and for similarly-sized trunks, males showed larger heads than females. Using the discriminant function approach, we investigated whether the power of discrimination between sexes varied when morphometric measures were expressed relative to head length vs. trunk length. We found that the two methods agreed in the classification of individuals as males or females, although the discrimination power was slightly higher when data were expressed relative to head length. Our results also showed that when using trunk length-adjusted data the power of discriminating the sexes was higher when the analysis was restricted to the largest individuals, which gives support to the idea that for morphological investigations small subsamples of the largest individuals should be used. Overall, the results of our work support the conclusions of a recent study on sexual size dimorphism in a Middle-eastern population of the same subspecies, suggesting that patterns of sexual size dimorphism are geographically stable in this widely distributed subspecies.",

Some geographical structure of genetic diversity and reasonably large within-group average divergence were revealed, especially in the countries around the Gulf of Guinea. Results support a single origin for this introduction, as a single 16S haplotype is found among the three Cape Verde Islands, and suggest Liberia as the country with the smallest genetic distance to the individuals found in the Cape Verde archipelago.

The new species are found in the rainforests of western-central Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo near the Gabonese border, respectively. We demonstrate that these species are morphologically and genetically distinct from each other and all other species of Cardioglossa. Both new species lack the dorsal hour-glass pattern present in many species of the genus, but they can be distinguished from each other and related species by distinctive colour patterns on their lateral surfaces and extremities. Both new species most closely resemble C. gratiosa, which occurs in the Atlantic coastal forests extending from Cameroon through Gabon. The new species can be differentiated from C. gratiosa by the absence of black transverse bars on all limbs or by distinctive lateral colouration. Analysis of mitochondrial ribosomal 16S DNA sequences reveals low to moderate levels (1.9–7.5%) of divergence between these new species and closely related species of Cardioglossa. The floodplains of the Congo and Ubangi Rivers may be important geographic barriers for many of these species. The occurrence of these two new lowland species in the Congo Basin reveals that the distribution and diversity of Cardioglossa in this region was underestimated. In addition, we elevate C. nigromaculata inornata to species-level status, based in part on newly available colour photographs from 1950 of specimens from the only known locality.",

The purpose of this work was to complete the knowledge about the reproductive modes of this species, using anatomical and histological studies of the ovaries. Quantitative variations of follicle categories showed a continuous folliculogenesis. Yet, young corpora lutea were only detected between November and February during the short rain season and the short dry season, indicating ovulation occurred during these four months during the thermal maximum. Oestrogen and progesterone detection allowed determination of three reproductive periods during the year: preparation in September and October, ovulation from November until February and quiescence from March until August. So, the female reproductive cycle of B. taitanus appears to be annual and synchronised with testicular evolution. Because the ovulation was observed following the second peak of follicle production (beginning of June), temperature is supposed to be the main regulating factor of reproductive pattern in this caecilian.",

This study examines sexual size dimorphism (SSD) within and between population variation in morphological traits, and scaling relationships in G. sthelini from a southwestern locality (Tasartico) and from another (Gáldar) in the northwest of Gran Canaria. Both sites differ in climate and vegetation traits, and we hypothesised that SSD should be manifested by males having relatively larger body traits than females and that hind limb lengths should be relatively larger in individuals from the more open habitat. Results showed that one-third of the largest lizards from both populations did not differ significantly either in snout-to-vent length (SVL) nor in trunk length (TRL), but overall males had significantly larger SVL and TRL than females. Multivariate analysis showed that head width (HW) and hind limb length (HLL) were significantly larger in individuals from Tasartico than in those of Gáldar. Hind limb length was the trait that contributed most to differentiate between populations and head parameters between males and females. In both populations head and body traits scaled to TRL, head width (HW) and head depth (HD) of males having a positive allometry, and fore limb length (FLL) and hind limb length (HLL) a negative one. In relation to head length (HL), females had significantly larger TRL and smaller head depths than males; lizards from Gáldar had significantly larger trunk length (TRL), but smaller HW and HLL than those of Tasartico.

Behaviour, such as mate searching, may enable males to maximise the number of mating opportunities with different partners and mate guarding may increase the likelihood that a male will sire offspring with a particular female. In this study, we investigated behavioural differences in movement (distance travelled) and perch choice between sexes of the Cape Dwarf Chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, to offer data for a better understanding of mate searching and mate guarding behaviours. Wild chameleons were radio-tracked in 2010 (n = 8) and 2014 (n = 5) for approximately two weeks. The geographic location and perch height above ground were recorded multiple times per day to capture both the scale of movement and their perch use. Linear mixed effect models were used to assess differences between sexes. Our results indicated that females perched lower than males and moved shorter distances, offering support of a mate searching strategy in males. Ad hoc field observations revealed behaviours consistent with mate guarding by some males, and mate avoidance by some unreceptive females. Our results could indicate that males increase their reproductive fitness by using higher perches in both a mate guarding and mate searching context and moving further distances in search of receptive females.",

Lung loss is typically associated with living in fast-flowing streams, and so we examined larval lung development in the stream specialist family Heleophrynidae. We find that one genus, Hadromophryne Van Dijk, 2008, has large lungs as a tadpole, while the other genus, Heleophryne Sclater, 1898, has much smaller, stunted lung buds.

The thermal melanism hypothesis predicts that for ectotherms, selection for darker phenotypes should be highest in cooler areas because darker pigmentation should provide thermoregulatory advantages. We tested whether intraspecific variation in colour distribution of Cape Cobras (Naja nivea) conforms to this hypothesis using a dataset of ∼800 georeferenced photographs of cobras available from community science platforms. We scored the dorsal colouration of snakes in each photograph and tested for associations between snake colours and climate variables at those locations. Our results provide strong evidence to suggest that temperature and solar radiation are important predictors of N. nivea colour occurrence, whereas elevation and precipitation are not. Overall, darker snakes have a significantly higher probability of occurrence in colder areas with low solar radiation than lighter snakes, which are more likely to occur in hotter areas with more solar radiation.

Through a combination of field observations and mito‐chondrial DNA sequencing (ND2 and 16S), it has become apparent that morphological and genetic evidence are often in conflict. In some instances, species that are morphologically quite different, show close genetic relationships, eg., Bradypodion taeniabronchum and B. ventrale. In other cases there are substantial genetic differences between lineages, with little morphological differentiation. For example, dwarf chameleons from the Kouga and the Baviaanskloof mountains were thought to represent a single undescribed species. However, chameleons from these two mountain ranges show large sequence divergence (6.8% for ND2) that is more than twice the value between B. taeniabronchum and B. ventrale. The evolutionary relationships within this group are reticulate in nature, making taxonomy difficult to resolve. Application of only mitochondrial data to resolve the taxonomy of this group is therefore insufficient, because mitochondrial DNA may only indicate historical isolation of lineages, and if used independently, may not be a good indicator of species definitions. Therefore our next step toward resolving the taxonomy of this group is the inclusion of nuclear DNA markers, in conjunction with a full morphological analysis.",

In both sexes, generation glands start to differentiate before sexual maturity is reached, but males develop significantly more glands than females. Males have larger heads than females, but the sexes do not differ significantly in overall body size. High scar frequencies were recorded for both sexes and the sex ratio for the total sample was close to 1:1. The functional significance of the additional generation glands is discussed in context of the social structure of the species as inferred from the degree and direction of sexual size dimorphism and scar frequency data.

    "abstract": "Abstract The coastal population of the black-headed dwarf chameleon Bradypodion melanocephalum in KwaZulu-Natal appears to be centred on the eThekwini Municipal Area, which is experiencing rapid urban development. This population occurs in few statutory protected areas, all of which are small. In order to conserve successfully the coastal population in KwaZulu-Natal, knowledge of its geographic range and location of potentially suitable habitat is required. Bradypodion melanocephalum was until recently known mainly from Durban, with isolated records from areas to the north and south. A cartographic model was used to estimate the distribution of the coastal population in KwaZulu-Natal. The model predictions were ground-truthed, and the model was found to have a positive predictive power of 0.57 and a negative predictive power of 0.84. The relatively low positive predictive power of the model appeared related to habitat management that is not appropriate for the conservation of B. melanocephalum. The geographic range was then estimated using a Maxent model to predict climate suitability while at the same time taking cognizance of a dispersal barrier, the output of which was further refined in a geographic information system to exclude areas of unsuitable landcover. The variables included in the final model were mean daily minimum temperature of the coldest month and mean daily maximum relative humidity of the coldest month. Both these variables relate to dew formation in the dry winter period, and dew appears to be a critical water source for B. melanocephalum during winter. The Maxent model estimates greater probabilities of occurrence towards the coast, where rapid urbanisation is occurring. This urbanisation is one of the threats to the survival of the coastal population of Bradypodion melanocephalum. The utility of translocation of B. melanocephalum to areas that will not be developed within a development site in comparison to translocation ofT-site as mitigation to ensure the conservation of the coastal population in rapidly urbanizing areas needs to be investigated further.",

Species in this region often vary in morphology and genetics; however, the specific drivers of these differences have not been clearly identified.

Genetic data were collected from 102 specimens using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) and the final data matrix included 5 976 loci and 20 624 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Morphological data were collected from 42 specimens and included 6 meristic and 4 mensural characters. Ecological data were obtained from the WorldClim database to a resolution of 30 arcseconds. Population structure analyses supported up to five distinct populations of A. picticauda in Ghana. Discriminant function analyses were used to classify samples using the morphological data and ecological data. Ecology showed the strongest correlation with population genetic structure, whereas morphological data were only able to weakly differentiate three populations. We discuss the factors that might be responsible for correlations between phenotypes and genotypes in the context of A. picticauda natural history.",

In the current study, we investigated a small and isolated population of M. l. saharica at Sidi El Mehdaoui oasis in the Lower Draa River, southern Morocco, in order to assess its osmo- and iono-regulatory abilities and tolerance to salinity and dehydration. Upon capture, turtles were weighed and measured for shell dimensions and blood and voided urine were taken. Tests of exposure to different levels of water salinity (0%, 35%, and 50% seawater) and maintenance out of water (estivation simulation) were carried out. Osmolalities and Na+, Cl−, K+, and urea concentrations were determined in plasma and voided urine, and glycaemia was measured in blood, before and after tests. Turtles were able to survive in brackish waters with a salinity as high as 24% seawater (8.4 ppt). Their voided urine was hypotonic to plasma, which indicated that they could use their bladder water reserves for osmo- and iono-regulation until the iso-osmocity level beyond which osmotic and ionic anhomeostasy can occur. Experimental tests showed that the osmo- and iono-regulatory capacities of these turtles are relatively limited, and not enough effective to allow them to survive for long-term periods in brackish/saline waters or out of water, because of dehydration indicated by progressive weight loss to a critical threshold. The increased drought, water salinisation and habitat fragmentation related to anthropogenic activities and climate change, represent great threats that can create habitats exceeding the species’ threshold for a long-term persistence of the vulnerable small marginal populations of the Saharan pond turtle. So, conservation measures of these populations and their habitats are urgently needed.",

Species with restricted distributions are often poorly known even though they may be most vulnerable to extinction. We investigated the influences of climate and ecology on the distribution of five understudied, endemic, rupicolous reptiles from the Soutpansberg Mountains in South Africa. Using Maxent, we developed ecological niche models that were used to provide baseline insights into the factors delimiting these species distributions. Results indicated that most species were limited by climatic factors, with the average temperature of the coolest quarter having the most influence on the majority of the species, where they were limited to areas with cooler temperatures. This suggests that they may be negatively affected by climate change in the future. Distribution maps revealed that there were no strong interspecific interactions influencing the distributions between the species investigated and identified potential new localities for two species. There was high endemic richness located in the western Soutpansberg and this is likely to have been driven by past climatic and erosion events. Overall this study highlighted that performing environmental niche models on understudied species can provide essential, baseline information on which to drive future research.",

The two existing hypotheses for this behaviour are: a) to locate individuals for reproductive purposes; and b) to form aggregations during the winter/dry season. Pheromone trailing for reproductive purposes has been observed in over 20 snake species representing four different families. The ability of adult male African brown house snakes (Boaedon fuliginosus) to track a sexually attractive female (assumed to be producing pheromones), as well as a conspecific male, was tested using a standard Y-maze. The length of time a female's pheromone remained distinguishable to a male was also tested using the same methodology. Male B. fuliginosus showed a strong ability to trail females both immediately after the trail was left by a female (100%; n=14) and seven days after a female left a trail (100%; n=14). After 14 days, however, only 71.4% (n=14) of males chose the same arm as the female, demonstrating that the pheromone trail degraded over time. Males also trailed other males in 77.8% (n=18) of trials, which suggests that males may use other male trails to locate females, or navigate through unfamiliar territories.

Tadpoles were collected from near the type locality of each species and identified using DNA sequence data. The tadpoles of both species are stream-dwelling and cryptic, often found in clumps of debris collected in the course of the stream, and orient roughly vertically in the water column with their mouths at or near the surface. As in L. ventrimarmoratus, the only other species in the genus described in detail, the tadpoles of these two species have a prominent umbelliform and up-turned oral disc, robust keratinous jaw sheaths, large lateral sacs along the elongate and dorsoventrally depressed body, and a robust elongate tail with short fins. Tadpoles of the two species are broadly similar morphologically. However, differences in the jaw sheaths may enable discrimination, including more pronounced laterally placed caniniform projections and more small needle-like serrations in the central region of the lower jaw sheath in L. perreti.",

Because of its declining state, there is an urgent need to understand the genetic diversity, population structure and patterns of movement of this species. To do this, 15 microsatellite primer pairs were designed, optimised and tested. Successful loci were screened for null alleles and genotyping errors and then analysed, specifically noting the number of alleles, allelic size range, observed and expected heterozygosities, deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibria. Bottleneck tests and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) were also conducted to gain insight into each population's structure. Eleven primer pairs produced unambiguous polymerase chain reactions (PCR) products and scoreable bands, which were found to be polymorphic across both breeding populations. Deviations from HWE were detected owing to the presence of null alleles and inbreeding. Significant bottleneck signatures were detected for both populations and the AMOVA revealed significant differentiation between the two populations, indicating genetic structure at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract African bufonid toads (especially members of the genus Bufo) are a relatively uniform group morphologically, but beneath this apparent uniformity lies a higher level of diversity in habits and lifestyle than is initially evident. Members of the group exhibit considerable variation in size (from the very small Bufo beiranus to the very large Bufo mauritanicus), habitat preference and reproductive mode. The latter ranges from 'normal' oviparity with a large egg clutch and free living tadpole stage, through ovoviviparity to true viviparity with progressive reduction in egg clutch size. It might be expected that this diversity of form, ecological preference and reproductive capability would have been a stimulus to systematists to make bufonid toads one of the most intensively studied groups of African anurans. In fact, both our current state of knowledge of their phylogenetic relationships and our ability to discriminate species and genera remain poor. These deficiencies hamper progress in the study of all aspects of their biology, especially morphology, distribution, behaviour, ecology and biogeography. The present paper reviews the progress that has been made towards the goal of a natural or phylogenetic classification for the African Bufonidae, and includes suggestions on how this elusive aim may be attained within a reasonable period of time.

Since independence in the early 1960s, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda developed different degrees of capability to conduct research on amphibians. While globally there has been a recent upsurge in research and concern over declining amphibian populations and a general increase in awareness of the importance of amphibian biodiversity, in the East African region this interest has not always been so apparent. Limitations to amphibian study in East Africa include a lack of basic taxonomic studies, field guides and keys to the amphibian fauna, few natural history museums, and a dearth of basic information about the distribution and biology of amphibians. There is a need to determine the conservation status of East African amphibians, encourage studies on basic biology and populations, and to include amphibians in development and conservation policies and agendas.",

It is suggested that there is a ‘northern volcanic’ group of species within Strongylopus. The phylogenetic grade of the ‘volcanic’ Strongylopus species is uncertain. If they are relatively plesiomorphic then the phylogeography of the genus is more complex than has hitherto been assumed. Should there turn out to be two widely separated plesiomorphic groups within the genus, then its evolutionary‐biogeographical relationships would be of considerable interest and merit further investigation.

The revival of the genus Chersobius for the five-toed species (signatus, boulengeri and solus) now limits Homopus to the four-toed species (areolatus and femoralis). Molecular data indicate that Homopus is paraphyletic with two well-supported clades: the four-toed Homopus in one clade and the five-toed Chersobius together with Chersina angulata in a second clade. There are numerous distinct morphological and ecological differences between the genera. All Chersobius species have a single, large inguinal scute, whereas the number is variable in Homopus. The midline pectoral scute of Chersobius is consistently longer, and the nuchal scute shorter, than in Homopus. The fourth to fifth vertebral suture is narrow in Homopus and broad in Chersobius. Forelimb scales also differ with 3–4 large rows and 5–6 smaller rows, respectively, in Homopus and Chersobius. Chersobius males have a plastral concavity and Homopus males not. Two Chersobius species (C. signatus and C. boulengeri) are distinguishable from Homopus by having 12 or more marginal scutes, whereas Homopus species have 11 or fewer. The glans penes are respectively V-shaped and heart-shaped in Homopus and Chersobius. Ecological differences include that Chersobius species are rupicolous and inhabit arid regions, whereas Homopus species inhabit more mesic habitats. Homopus females produce multi-egg clutches and tend to be bigger compared to single-egg clutching Chersobius females. Females of all species are larger than conspecific males, and all males have larger shell openings than females have.ZooBank—urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub: 18229454-6662-46F3-8B15-836BF2AC38EB",

In most cases, directional selection for certain phenotypic traits under specific (and differing) environmental conditions is implicated. Differing ecomorphological forms for closely related species (or for populations within a species) have been documented for several lineages of South African dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion), although this pattern is not ubiquitous across the genus. Within one species, Bradypodion pumilum, two ecomorphs have been observed, these differ in terms of morphology, performance, ecology and habitat, yet genetic differences (mtDNA) were not apparent, with shared haplotypes across the ecomorphs. We investigated whether more sensitive genetic markers (eight microsatellite loci) would show population level structure between ecomorphs, which could indicate lack of gene flow across the ecological (habitat) boundary. Our results suggest that the two ecomorphs are distinct at a population level, implying that gene flow is absent or reduced and that the two ecomorphs are on separate evolutionary trajectories. Given that mtDNA could not detect population structure, we infer that the ecological boundary between ecomorphs is relatively recent in evolutionary history. The two ecomorphs are distinctive in terms of their morphology, ecology, habitat and functional traits, these differences are likely driven and maintained by reproductive isolation across the habitat boundary.",

While observing courtship behaviour in a captive colony of the African brown house snake, Lamprophis fuliginosus, some males excreted a large amount of sperm very rapidly before the inflation and insertion of the males’ hemipenis into the females’ vent. This observation of premature ejaculation suggests that male snakes may be capable of rapid ejaculation and, therefore, likely copulate for an extended period of time to prevent rival males from mating with the same female, thus increasing the chance of paternity for the male.",

Many species are known from single specimens associated with poor collection data, which has not facilitated re-collection. Consequently, nearly two thirds of species are currently considered Data Deficient by the IUCN. Boulengerula fischeri was described from a single specimen deposited onto a car by an unknown collector in 1987, and has defied attempts at relocation for nearly 20 years. Herein we describe a collection of 20 individuals from agricultural land immediately outside Cyamudongo Forest in southwestern Rwanda, around 3 km from the type locality. Adults were found to attain a remarkable maximum length of nearly 400 mm despite being only 4.5 mm wide (maximum elongation index of 102). The range of morphometric and meristic measurements taken include those given for the type specimen, featuring mean annular and vertebral counts of 199.4 and 191.8, respectively. The estimated density of B. fischeri was found to be 50 animals h−1km−1 and is comparable with other species of Boulengerula. Despite our new collection records, we recommend that this species remains Data Deficient until its range can be better described.",

    "abstract": "Increasing linear infrastructure development often impacts habitats and wildlife negatively. Roads, in particular, have numerous threats to wildlife with the most noticeable direct impact being roadkill, and this requires urgent conservation interventions. To assess amphibian roadkill, driven surveys were conducted on three regional roads around the western Soutpansberg in the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve, an important area for biodiversity conservation in South Africa. Six habitat types were identified along the monitored road stretches and their influence on the occurrence of amphibian roadkill was determined. The results comprised an inventory of 248 roadkill specimens, belonging to eight species and six families, and one unidentified specimen. Roadkill was strongly influenced by season, with the greatest roadkill rate recorded in the early wet season (0.051 roadkill km–1 day–1) compared to the late wet season (0.019 roadkill km–1 day–1). Amphibian roadkill patterns were related to roadside habitat. Of the roadside habitat types identified, road sections adjacent to waterbodies had the highest number of roadkill, followed by road sections closer to open savanna bushland. Roadkill frequency was low in areas that were partly located in human modified habitats (residential and agricultural areas) but highest in natural landscapes (near waterbodies and savanna bushland). The study provides baseline data that confirms the potential threat of roads and their users on the persistence of amphibians in the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve and presents the first systematic inventory of amphibian roadkill in the western Soutpansberg, South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating factors that drive microhabitat selection in a species is important for informing the conservation management of the species. For species that use microhabitats as long-term refuge sites, selection pressures are likely to be strong because the microhabitat must fulfil their eco-physiological and life history requirements. Smaug giganteus (Sungazer) is a threatened (Vulnerable) cordylid lizard species in the highveld grasslands of South Africa – a key agricultural area in the country. Individuals dig burrows as refuges, which increases their sensitivity to habitat transformation. In addition, previous attempts to translocate populations have failed due to a lack of knowledge about their specific microhabitat requirements. We assessed microhabitat characteristics that may influence burrow site selection by measuring vegetation characteristics surrounding Sungazer burrows and comparing these to vegetation at randomly selected sites. We also recorded orientation, aspect, soil composition, and the presence of other animal dung. Sungazers selected sites with sparse vegetation cover, and where grass height was short, but had no preference for soil composition. There was no relationship between the presence of ungulate dung and the placement of Sungazer burrows. Most Sungazer burrows were orientated in a northerly direction on north-facing slopes, suggesting that burrow placement has thermoregulatory advantages. We recommend that to identify suitable sites for Sungazer translocations, landscapes are thoroughly surveyed with cognisance to the findings in this study, and that a soft-release translocation protocol follows to maximise translocation success.",

Based on the results from species distribution models, eight sites were visited over a four-month period from February 2020 to March 2021. In total, 46 transects of 1 km were investigated in 23 different forest fragments to understand the distribution of C. tarzan. Another 28 transects of 200 m in length were surveyed to estimate population density. Among the 23 investigated forest fragments, C. tarzan was confirmed from 14 fragments belonging to five sites. All 14 records are completely new and represent a significant range extension for the species. Calumma tarzan is distributed within an elevation range of 604–1048 m above sea level. An analysis of the population of the species across sites show that density varies broadly and ranges from 25 to 78 individuals per hectare. This study fills important knowledge gap on a Critically Endangered and endemic chameleon species and is vital to the development of urgently needed conservation strategy for the Tarzan Chameleon.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial infection poses a significant threat to the health and survival of turtles, both in their natural habitats and in captivity. Notably, the presence and interactions of bacteria, such as those belonging to the Aeromonas genus, have been identified for their adverse impact on turtle health and ecosystem dynamics. This study investigated the prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance genes of Aeromonas hydrophila in Trachemys scripta elegans (Red-eared Slider) and Chelonia mydas (Green Turtle). The study also examined the innate immunity of T. scripta elegans and C. mydas. Buccal and cloacal swabs from 39 turtles were collected and examined alongside 45 water samples to try to isolate and amplify A. hydrophila. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were then sequenced to identify the presence of specific genes associated with virulence, and antimicrobial resistance. The findings revealed that A. hydrophila had a prevalence rate of 35.9% in all examined turtle species, with 14 water samples accounting for 31% of the total samples. Buccal samples from Green and Red-eared turtles showed a higher rate of A. hydrophila isolates than cloacal samples. Sensitivity to norfloxacin (85.71%), gentamycin (71.42%), and ceftriaxone (64.28%) was observed, whereas resistance to amoxicillin (64.28%), ampicillin (57.14%), and rifamycin (57.14%) was apparent. Antibiotic resistance genes, including blaTEM and blaSHV, in A. hydrophila isolates, were present in 42.86% and 28.5% of the samples, respectively. PCR analysis confirmed the genetic identity of A. hydrophila, and five virulence genes were detected: AHCYTOEN (100%), followed by aerolysin (92.8%), alt and act (85.7%), and lipase (78.5%). Genetic sequences of the isolates had a 99% identity with the reference strains in GenBank. Furthermore, the study found the innate immunity of turtles to be robust due to serum lysozyme activity, bactericidal killing assay (BKA), total leukocyte count, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, and packed cell volume (PCV%), all of which help to protect them from infections. Overall, this research highlights the need for continued monitoring and management of antibiotic resistance in aquatic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The structural and environmental heterogeneity within southern Africa has given rise to many morphological forms of Psammophylax rhombeatus distributed throughout the country, with previous studies neglecting the associated molecular significance of these forms. The species' widespread, generalist ecology coupled with the substantial phylogenetic structuring previously acknowledged within the species, makes P. rhombeatus the ideal candidate for phylogeographic analyses. Using 103 samples, representing the full distribution of the species, phylogenetic analyses retrieved four well-supported clades: south-eastern South Africa, south-western South Africa, north-eastern South Africa and western South Africa. Although not variable enough to warrant taxonomic re-evaluation, the clades are phylogenetically distinguishable, with relatively high intraspecific genetic divergence values separating them, irrespective of the small geographic distances separating populations. This is likely a product of the taxon's habitat-generalist lifestyle, enabling them to bypass vicariant barriers that might otherwise cause speciation in less versatile species. The clades are also geographically distinct, with little overlap, indicating previous vicariance, a finding that is supported by the split of P. rhombeatus from P. ocellatus in the mid-Pliocene, followed by the diversification of P. rhombeatus into four clades throughout the Pleistocene. The genetic structuring observed in P. rhombeatus may be a product of population expansion following ancient refugial isolation (potentially Last Glacial Maximum). The morphological groupings highlighted in previous studies are loosely attributable to the molecular clades identified in the phylogenetic reconstruction, highlighting the complex interplay of genetic and morphological characteristics in the process of speciation, and their representation in systematic accounts.",

    "abstract": "The family Ptychadenidae contains three ecologically and morphologically distinct genera: the widespread, species-rich and above-ground dwelling Ptychadena, the less widespread and diverse, burrowing Hildebrandtia, and the little-known, burrowing, monotypic Lanzarana, endemic to Somalia. Previous morphological studies placed Lanzarana in a sister position to Hildebrandtia and these two genera as sister to Ptychadena. However, our analyses of mitochondrial and multilocus nuclear DNA data revealed Lanzarana as a sister lineage to Ptychadena (divergence ∼28 Mya), and Hildebrandtia sister to them (∼42 Mya). This suggests that the common ancestor of ptychadenids may have exhibited a burrowing lifestyle similar to Hildebrandtia and Lanzarana, rather than the more active, above-ground lifestyle of Ptychadena. In addition, based upon analysis of available mitochondrial DNA data, we have identified major clades within the genus Ptychadena and propose them as four species groups, with the P. mascareniensis group being the first diverging lineage (∼20 Mya). We also report four new localities of Lanzarana largeni from central Somaliland, south-western Puntland, southern Somalia and south-eastern Ethiopia, extending the presently known range of the species westward. This represents the first official record of L. largeni from Ethiopia. An ecological niche model of L. largeni for present climatic conditions identifies extensive climatically highly suitable areas in central Somalia and south-eastern Ethiopia. A model for future climatic conditions estimates a substantial extension of climatically suitable areas to northern Somalia and north-eastern Kenya, likely due to predicted more humid conditions accompanying the increase of temperatures in the western Indian Ocean.",

Examination and dissection of museum specimens provided original data on morphology, sexual dimorphism, feeding habits and reproductive biology of the rare western keeled snake (Pythonodipsas carinata) from Namibia and Angola. This small, slender snake is nocturnal. Females mature at a larger size (47–51 cm snout-vent length. SVL) than males (29–31 cm SVL), and attain considerably larger maximum sizes (to 77 cm SVL). At the same body length, males have significantly longer tails than females. Relative to SVL, analysis of covariance detected no significant differences between the sexes in head length, head width, body width, or head shape (i.e., width relative to length, or relative eye size). All prey items were vertebrates, with lizards comprising 67 % of the diet, rodents 25 %, birds 4 %, and unidentified vertebrate bones 4 %. Among lizard prey, geckos (39 % of all prey) and skinks (18 %) predominated. Nocturnal geckos (Afroedura, Chondrodactylus, Palmatogecko and Pachydactylus) as well as diurnal ones (Rhoptropus and Narudasia) were eaten. All skink prey were Mabuya sp. Mammalian prey were eaten primarily by larger snakes. The unusual fragmented head shields and enlarged palatine teeth of Pythonodipsas carinata may be adaptations that permit sleeping diurnal prey to be extracted from retreats.",

We report our observations on the breeding behaviour of M. taitana from Mount Mbololo in the Taita Hills, Kenya. Empirical data from pit‐fall trapping suggest that they are not abundant in the area (< 1.5 % of captures), although we managed to batch mark 230 individuals from breeding assemblages in road puddles during 20 days in November 2007. Results reveal that most individuals depart from a breeding site within 24 hours, although some (around 10%) remain while others travel up to 100 m to nearby puddles. Despite their lack of columellae, these dwarf toads appear to react to conspecific distress calls. Eggs develop rapidly into tadpoles and toadlets within 15 days of being laid, but tadpoles were not observed to use their “crown” at the water surface as previously reported. Instead they were observed submerged in liquid mud at the periphery of puddles. Our brief observations on this species suggest that conservation assessments on threatened members of the genus may be problematic, and we highlight the paucity of natural‐history information on dwarf toads in general.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific genetic diversity provides the basis for evolutionary change and is therefore considered the most fundamental level of biodiversity. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite loci are the markers most typically used in population-level studies; however, their patterns of genetic variation are not always congruent. This can result in different interpretations of the data, which can impact on management decisions, especially for threatened species. Consequently, in this study, we developed and analysed novel microsatellite markers for the Endangered Western Leopard Toad (WLT), Sclerophrys pantherina, and compared the results to previously published mtDNA data to compare the level of genetic diversity between the two molecular markers. The microsatellite evidence showed signs of a past bottleneck, yet relatively high levels of genetic diversity and low genetic differentiation between two sampling sites. In contrast, the mtDNA revealed moderate to low levels of diversity between sampling sites, and strong genetic differentiation. An explanation for the conﬂicting patterns may be that the current genetic signature, as depicted by the microsatellite data, is not yet reflected in the mitochondrial dataset; and, as such the data are depicting a timeline for genetic variation within the WLT. Both markers revealed important information about the two sampling sites, which can help inform conservation management of the species.",

In this region, 33 sites were surveyed over the late winter and spring for a period of three years. Salamandra algira was present at 16 of these sites and absent from 17. These sites were characterized based on parameters related to their macroecology (climate, topography) and habitat structure (density, height, canopy closure and diversity of woody plants). Our analyses showed that mean temperature, topography, woody plant density and height and canopy cover contributed most to the explaining differences between sites where S. algira was present and where it was absent. Most of the sites occupied by S. algira were supra- and meso-Mediterranean forest thermotypes and were dominated by deciduous/evergreen oak trees (Quercus canariensis Willd. and Quercus suber L.). In contrast, the presence of S. algira in thermo-Mediterranean forest was only confirmed in one location. This suggests that the transition between the thermophilic facies of the cork oak forest and the thermo-Mediterranean formations possibly determines the lower limits of S. algira in the region of Edough.",

Virtually nothing is known about its ecology. For the first time, we report the occurrence of an apparently large and well-preserved population of C. mauritanicus on the Chafarinas Islands (NW Africa). In addition, we study some aspects of the morphology and ecology (microhabitat, soil and diet selection) of this skink. Adult females were larger than males but had heads of similar size. In this population, we found an equilibrated sex ratio. Adults showed a very high frequency of regenerated tails, suggesting a high predation pressure. Skinks were restricted to a small area of Congreso Island where, far from the sea shore, they selected sandy microhabitats. These microhabitats were characterised by higher cover at the substrate level of bare soil and medium rocks, lower cover of leaf litter and grass, and more sparse subarboreal vegetation than available microhabitats. Soils occupied by skinks had a higher proportion of sand, and a lower proportion of gravel, silt and clay, resulting in a much lower soil compaction than most soils of the island. The bulk of the diet of C. mauritanicus consisted of small beetle larvae, which were consumed in higher proportions than expected by their availability.",

We then sequenced 3 102 base pairs from both mitochondrial (12S, 16S) and nuclear (Kif24, MC1r, MYH, PRLR) gene regions for these individuals—the first ever genomic material for this taxon—and compared these data with those previously published for other Cordylus species. We analyzed these data using both phylogenetically relevant optimality criteria (i.e. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference) as well as distance-based methods. Cordylus rivae forms a unique clade and groups closely with the other members of the East African Cordylus, particularly C. beraducci—the closest geographic neighbour. We discuss the biogeographic and conservation implications of C. rivae's current distribution and make some suggestions concerning future research into this poorly known species.",

Standard MR was measured for the lizard Pseudocordylus melanotus over a range of temperatures (20, 22, 25, 30 and 32°C). I measured oxygen consumption using a closed respirometry system and tested for the effects of body mass and temperature. Body mass and total MR were significantly related at 20, 22, 25 and 32°C. Body mass and mass-specific MR were significantly related at 20°C. MR increases significantly with increasing temperature for both total and mass-specific MR. Both mass exponents and temperature quotients (Q10) were similar to those reported for other lizards and snakes. Field measures of body temperature were used to estimate energy expenditure for a standard 40 g lizard. Daily energy expenditures during summer and winter were 3074.32 J/day and 1537.46 J/day, respectively. A 40 g lizard, therefore, requires the equivalent of two to three mealworms per day to cover the costs of maintenance metabolism. Any additional energy assimilated can be allocated to growth, reproduction and storage.Key words: Metabolic rateambush foragerenergy budgetDrakensberg Crag Lizard AcknowledgementsGauteng Nature Conservation and Gavin Masterson granted permission to collect lizards at Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve (permit numbers: CPB1 0099, CPB5 002472).

Radiographs of 10 adult specimens reveal variation in the degree of ossification of the interclavicle and scapula and in the forelimb epiphyses; lengths of the humerus, forelimb and femur; and number of metacarpals, metatarsals and phalanges. The variation is unrelated to specimen size for most of these parameters. In all specimens the sternum is absent, the clavicle is ossified, ossification is greater in the humerus than in the more distal forelimb elements, ossification is greater in the tibia than the fibula, and the third toe has two phalanges. The results of this study suggest caution in the use of details of the morphology of vestigial limbs to diagnose lizard species, because of the variability present in such limbs.",

Laurent's concept of Schoutedenella overrode de Witte's diagnostic character, and gave rise to a practice of placing all small‐sized species in Schoutedenella. Cases in point are Arthroleptis troglodytes and A. xenodactyloides, which have been included in Schoutedenella despite not conforming to de Witte's definition of his genus. Justification is given for reverting to de Witte's characterisation of Schoutedenella, and retaining his globosa within it (contra Poynton & Broadley 1985). Small‐sized species such as xenodactyloides are better assigned to Arthtroleptis or to another genus altogether.

Most species are habitat specialists adapted to hyper-arid conditions of the Namibian and north-western South African xeric regions.

In the ten years since the taxonomic revision of the weberi group, some of the species have not been recorded and our knowledge on their distribution, phylogenetic affinities, or intraspecific variability is limited or non-existent. Pachydactylus goodi is one such species. In this study, we report a newly discovered population of P. goodi in the Richtersveld National Park, South Africa, which considerably extends the known range of the species. In addition, the results of our phylogenetic analyses indicate that P. goodi is paraphyletic with respect to P. atorquatus. Although there is a striking colour polymorphism observed between these two species, the level of genetic differentiation within the goodi-atorquatus clade is comparable with intraspecific variability observed in other Pachydactylus species. As a result of these findings, which are further supported by morphological similarity of the two species, we conclude that they represent a single species and synonymise P. goodi with P. atorquatus.",

Wormian bones are well-known in mammals, notably in humans and chimpanzees, but not in lizards. Here we examine the genus Zygaspis, a southern African amphisbaenian with complex cranial sutures, for the presence of Wormian bones. Skulls from seven of the eight species of Zygaspis were examined for the presence of Wormian bones. Because of their small size, complex sutures and delicate nature, high-resolution X-ray computed tomography was used to produce 3D models of the skulls. We discovered three Wormian bones in the interdigitated frontoparietal suture of Z. kafuensis. This discovery is the first known record of Wormian bones in a lizard and it is one of the few reports of them in the Squamata. The presence of Wormian bones in a head-first, burrowing squamate allows for a possible functional role to be hypothesised. Additional studies on a variety of squamate taxa are now needed, particularly in burrowing groups with interdigitated sutures, to improve our understanding of these rare cranial elements.",

These changes have resulted in the steady reduction of suitable, quality habitat and severe fragmentation. In the current study we employed mitochondrial DNA and species-specific microsatellites markers (developed in the current study) to investigate the genetic structure and diversity of H. pickersgilli. Genetic markers revealed moderate to high levels of genetic diversity throughout the remnant groups and absence of specific phylogeographic structure among individuals sampled across twelve localities throughout the range of the species. Results from the current study indicate that gene flow between H. pickersgilli individuals is not restricted, whereby neighbouring groups may interact with each other through continued migration, thereby facilitating possible range expansion should habitat be available. However, the need for continued conservation of the H. pickersgilli population through the protection and management of its natural habitats should remain a top priority in order to conserve representative levels of genetic diversity.",

Capture rates were highest in spring and lowest in winter when environmental conditions were respectively most and least favourable for tortoise activity. Body condition did not change from autumn to spring, but reached lower values during the summer drought. Capture effort averaged 5 hours/tortoise, which corresponds closely to that of species with low population densities in arid regions. Population size structure was skewed towards adults, indicative of low recruitment and/or low juvenile survivorship. Females were larger and heavier than males, confirming sexual dimorphism in this species. Body size of cohorts scaled to annuli counts, indicating a close correspondence between body size and age. Telemetered adults deposited one or no growth ring in the year of study; consequently, annuli counts could underestimate adult age. Regression analyses showed that male and female growth rates did not differ, but males matured at a smaller size and younger age than females. The smallest male showing reproductive behaviour had 12 annuli and a shell volume of 157 cm3, while similar measures for females were 14 annuli and 185 cm3. The sex ratio of the population did not differ from 1:1 but the bias towards males in spring, and towards females in autumn, indicates that studies limited to particular seasons can misrepresent life history traits of populations. We concluded that the life history of P. oculifer conforms to chelonian patterns in arid regions.",

As a result, the species exists as a collection of populations inhabiting an increasingly fragmented landscape within a critically endangered ecosystem. In this study we monitored microsatellite genetic variation in one of these populations of B. pumilum across a three-year period. From the results of a temporary site-vacancy of adult chameleons during the study, we anticipated a significant shift in microsatellite allele frequencies. Using data from eight highly polymorphic loci we detected differences in the allelic composition of chameleons inhabiting the study site between pre- and post-site-vacancy periods (AMOVA RST = 0.017; P = 0.019). Results suggest that recolonisation by immigrant chameleons, from an adjacent vegetation fragment connected to the study site by corridors, caused the recorded shifts in allelic frequencies. Pairwise tests of year by year comparisons revealed significant shifts in allelic frequencies between years one and two and between one and three, but not between years two and three. Our findings highlight the susceptibility of small vertebrates to stochastic changes in the allelic composition of populations in a fragmented landscape, and can be useful for the development of biodiversity management in an increasingly fragmented habitat mosaic.",

Laryngotracheal morphology of the Uroplatus fimbriatus complex (Reptilia Gekkonidae): Yet another autapomorphic organ system in a group of highly aberrant geckos. Afr. J. Herpetol. 46(1): 36–48. The genus Uroplatus has been regarded as being unusual or aberrant among geckos since its discovery over 200 years ago. Its characteristics have been the focus of much taxonomic and systematic debate and only relatively recently has its place within the Gekkonidae been universally accepted. The discovery of new species and the publication of an extensive review of this genus in the last decade have renewed interest in its characters, and a greater understanding of the basic biology of this taxon is now emerging. As part of a survey of the structure of the vocal apparatus of the Afro-Madagascan geckos, the larynx and associated structures of Uroplatus fimbriatus and U. sikorae were examined in detail and are reported in here. When compared to other geckos, the larynx and trachea of the Uroplatus fimbriatus complex is highly unusual on a number of counts, in keeping with the large number of autapomorphies displayed by this assemblage. A combination of dissection and gross morphological observations, histological investigations, computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstructions, and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the cricoid cartilages are unusually robust and that large blood sinuses lie adjacent to them (in U. fimbriatus) and may play a role in adjusting the position of the vocal cords; a unique cartilage lies dorsal to the cricoid and may be associated with a change in the insertion pattern of the laryngeal constrictor muscle; the anterior end of the trachea is unusually widely expanded and uniquely built. Such findings should prompt a more extensive functional morphological investigation of vocalization in Uroplatus.",

Although many of the specimens they sent to Berlin went unstudied, six species of reptiles described by Lichtenstein (1823), Wiegmann (1828, 1834) and Fitzinger (1843) were based on type material collected by them. In all cases (Sepedon rhombeata [= Causus rhombeatus], Coluber rufulus [= Lycodonomorphus rufulus], Gerrhosaurus flavigularis. Scincus homolocephalus [= Mabuya homalocephala], Cricochalcis aenea [= Chamaesaura aenea] and Pachydactylus bergii [= P geitje]) it is possible to restrict the type localities on the basis of the activities of the collectors. In the case of Sepedon rhombeata it is demonstrated that a recent claim (de Massary & Ineich 1994) that no type material was present in the ZMB collection at the time of Lichtenstein's description is false. The type of Coluber rufulus is shown to have been collected by Bergius, rather than Krebs, as previously assumed. The consistent mis-spelling of the specific epithet of Mabuya homalocephala is identified and discussed. The type of the latter species was collected in the Eastern Cape province, suggesting its identity with the form until recently recognized as M. h. smithii.",

Preanal pores, the character originally used to diagnose the taxon, are variably present, but R. b. diporus is reliably differentiated from R. b. bradfieldi by smaller, more rounded scalation of the thigh and precloacal regions. The two forms are also distinguished by relatively high levels of sequence divergence (9.7–11.6%) observed for the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. On the basis of these distinct morphological and molecular characteristics, we regard R. diporus as a valid species restricted to the Brandberg and areas north of the Ugab River. The significance of consistent colour differences between R. diporus and R. bradfieldi remains unclear, but the melanism prevalent in the latter species may be an adaptation to the cool coastal Namib fog belt. Morphological variation in R. bradfieldi is also evident in the southern portion of its range, where inland and coastal populations are notably distinct. The precise geographic patterns of this variation (and its possible evolutionary significance) warrant further investigation.",

Twelve behavioral acts were discerned, of which tail‐lashing, push‐ups, shuddering, face‐off circling and biting were identified as aggressive acts. Adult males showed aggression toward each other and toward juvenile males, but not toward juvenile females. Juvenile males also displayed aggression toward adult males, but were dominated by the adult males in all aggressive encounters. The results suggest that male aggression, territoriality, and shortage of plant shelters may be instrumental in the highly female‐biased sex ratio recorded for this species in the Lambert's Bay area along the west coast of South Africa.",

Langaha madagascariensis employs a sit‐and‐wait foraging strategy and stalking prey is initiated once a snake is conscious of potential prey. Stalking is preceded by hooding, swaying anterior portion of its body laterally, tongue flicking, and advancing toward prey. Strikes are typically made at an extremely close distance, sometimes while a snake places its nasal extension directly onto the back of the prey's head. Prey was always grasped anterior to the pectoral girdle behind the head or neck region. Once prey is seized, it may be coiled around and is usually pulled off its perch and left to dangle in mid‐air, while being worked into the back of the mouth toward the snake's rear fangs. Langaha madagascariensis also exhibits hooding while stalking prey. These hooding and swaying behaviours along with its cryptic colour patterns, might allow L. madagascariensis to mimic a vine swaying in the wind. Because of the many behavioural and ecological similarities between L. madagascariensis and other arboreal snake species, I hypothesize that the nasal extensions in L. madagascariensis serve as an extension of its narrow head and is used as a point of reference during prey stalking.",

All island populations of these two species were studied in 2000–2003 and the morphology of the populations compared to museum specimens. The two species are distinctive in morphology, although convergence occurs on some small islands occupied by large colonies of breeding sea birds. The taxon ’Mabuya wrightii ilotensis’ represents one example of this and was re‐identified as a form of T. sechellensis. The morphology of this population has changed over the last 67 years, probably as a result of the decline of the sea bird colony on the island. More extreme changes have occurred on other islands where the loss of sea bird colonies has been followed by the replacement of the sea bird specialist T. wrightii by the more generalist T. sechellensis. A reverse process of convergence towards the T. wrightii morphology was observed in recently established T. sechellensis populations on islands with large or increasing sea bird colonies. This highlights the adaptability of some island populations and the need to consider distinct islands as part of a metapopulation.",

We dissected 62 preserved A. capensis specimens and identified stomach contents. Fifteen specimens contained a total of 16 prey items, all of which were identifiable as centipedes. Taking a simulation approach, we calculate the probability of all known wild prey items (n = 21) being centipedes under a range of different simulated diets. We show that if cape centipede eaters do eat non-centipede prey, they do so very infrequently. Although all reported prey items for A. capensis are from the order Scolopendromorpha, a survey of 453 citizen science records of South African centipedes suggests that members of this order account for two thirds of all observations. These data do not allow us to reject the hypothesis that cape centipede eaters consume different centipede prey proportionally to what the encounter.",

The daily activity patterns of T. pater were similar during the summer periods (early and late summer), and no variation in activity was detected. Adult males were slightly larger and heavier than adult females and their heads were longer, larger and thicker than females’ heads. T. pater primarily consumed Coleopterans, but diet composition was noticeably different between the two summer periods. There were no sexual differences in dietary preferences.",

Field biologists often use erythrocyte metrics to assess wildlife health but need baseline values to distinguish normal variations from disease or chronic stress. Here we characterise erythrocyte types and features of P. geometricus and assess if age, sex and environmental fluctuations influence their frequencies and metrics. We collected blood from males, females and juveniles over four seasons to prepare smears for cytological evaluation. We treated the smears with May–Grünwald–Giemsa stains and used imaging software to measure size, shape and colour intensity of erythrocyte types. The blood of all groups contained immature, mature and senescent erythrocytes, and the appearance of each cell type corresponded to descriptions for other chelonians. Season had a strong effect on the occurrence of erythrocyte types and features with few group differences. The frequency of immature erythrocytes was high in winter and spring, the wet season, reflecting increased erythropoiesis. Mature erythrocytes dominated in summer and autumn, but frequencies of senescent cells, poikilocytosis, cytoplasmic inclusions and cytoplasmic vacuoles increased in autumn, indicating that water and food shortages caused physiological stress. The small size and elongated shape of summer and autumn erythrocytes would facilitate oxygen exchange when high temperatures increase metabolic needs of ectotherms. Lower temperatures and energy demands in the wet season counter the lower oxygen capacity of round, immature cells. Our results provide baseline information on erythrocyte physiology and metrics for health assessments of geometric tortoises.",

For each year, the surface of testis sections and the number of spermatozoa in bundles fluctuate in the same way throughout the year, with a strong increase during the dry season (maximum in August) and a slow decrease until January. The surface of interstitial tissue remained stable, with the exception of a strong peak in August. Additionally, the surface of Leydig cells showed a substantial peak in May before the dry period. Finally, testosterone was observed every month of the year.",

The Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania are known for their species richness and endemism, but not all mountain blocks have received the same attention. The Ukaguru Mountains, for example, have only infrequently been surveyed by herpetologists, with the first known herpetological survey in 1990. Here we compile and quantify all amphibian survey efforts in the Ukaguru Mountains in the past 30 years, publish an updated species list and comment on the health of amphibian populations and their habitat. We report on fourteen described species of amphibians, with potentially three additional species awaiting formal description. Of these seventeen lineages, seven are endemic to the Ukaguru Mountains. Although total species numbers remain low, compared with other Eastern Arc Mountains, surveys frequently recorded new species for the Ukaguru Mountains and for science. Worryingly, however, endemics, such as the monotypic bufonid Churamiti maridadi, have not been recorded in the past fifteen years. Our analyses show the region is becoming warmer and drier and is experiencing an alarming rate of deforestation. We find that over the past 30 years, dense forest cover inside the boundaries of the forest reserves has reduced by 8.4%.",

First, we explore levels of diversity at several mitochondrial and nuclear genes, and their potential as systematic tools in frogs. Second, we compare divergences among twenty-eight species of African bufonids, at the mitochondrial ribosomal genes 12S and 16S. Nineteen lineages are identified, each separated by a minimum of 3.4 % sequence divergence at these genes. Maximum divergence within lineages is uniformly low (<2.3 %), irrespective of whether these include multiple described species or a single-species. This jump in divergence implies that species within the same mitochondrial lineage are not equivalent entities to single-species lineages. We suggest that low among species divergences within the B. maculatus, B. garmani, B. pardalis, and B. angusticeps groups reflect different causes, including taxonomic artefacts, and that these have the effect of distorting assessments of conservation value and biogeographic history. Comprehensive analyses of geographic variation within these groups are required, and are likely to reduce the number of recognised species.",

Group fidelity was greater in groups with long nearest neigbour distances than in groups with short nearest neighbour distances. More adult males than adult females entered and departed groups during the mating season. Neonates displayed higher group fidelity than juveniles, pointing to delayed neonate dispersal in C. cataphractus. Juveniles displayed the lowest group fidelity of all size classes. The low group fidelity of juveniles could be related to their small size and potentially high growth rates, relative to those of adults, so juveniles may need to forage more frequently than adults forage.",

Both orange‐coloured and melanistic in situ embryos were present in pregnant females, showing that colour polymorphism is not the result of ontogenetic changes induced by environmental conditions, but rather has a genetic basis. The presence of orange‐coloured embryos in melanistic females and vice‐versa shows that breeding in these two colour morphs is not isolated. The functional significance of colour polymorphism in M. litoralis remains unclear, but intraspecific communication or background colour matching as possible selective advantages of melanism are ruled out. Microacontias litoralis is endemic to the west coast of South Africa where there is in general a high incidence of melanistic lizard species and populations associated with zones of upwelling of cold water in the Atlantic Ocean. That the melanistic morph may represent past or present selection for thermal melanism can not be ruled out and further investigation is required.",

Determining the distribution and habitat requirements of species is a necessary first step in monitoring population persistence or declines and implementing conservation strategies to counteract global amphibian declines. Although amphibian population declines and extinctions are recorded globally, taxonomic and geographical sampling has been uneven, especially in tropical regions. With the exception of southern Africa, data on abundance and populations trends of African amphibians are severely lacking. To address this gap, we investigated community structure and microhabitat distribution of breeding and post‐breeding anuran species at Mtele Swamp, a high‐elevation wetland on the Udzungwa Plateau, Tanzania. Over a two‐week period of intensive sampling during the rainy season of 2001, we recorded species presence, microhabitat use, and distribution using visual and aural surveys and random plot sampling yielding a total of 86 individuals of 11 species of frogs. Microhabitat distribution results reveal a clear ecological stratification between species. To place our community findings in a broader context, we compared species composition at this site with similar sites in wet, montane grasslands and forest wetland sites at similar elevations in the Udzungwa Mountains. Communities show little species overlap between these sites, even between geographically close and elevationally equivalent sites. The most similar community to the study site was miombo woodland of low elevation in central Kenya, not the much closer and more elevationally equivalent Udzungwa Mountain sites. Differences probably reflect a closer affinity between habitats (miombo woodland vs. forest) than elevation. This study provides baseline information for monitoring the anuran community at Mtele over time for changes in numbers, species composition and diversity that may be indicative of population declines.

    "abstract": "The Central African treefrog Leptopelis brevirostris has a characteristically short and vertically truncated snout, a tooth-like process at the centre of the mandible, and unlike most species of Leptopelis, eats terrestrial gastropods. Two morphologically similar species (L. crystallinoron and L. brevipes) have been described in sympatry with L. brevirostris, each on the basis of a single female specimen and then provisionally synonymised with L. brevirostris by subsequent authors. Here we re-examine the holotypes of the three species and collect both genetic (mtDNA and 25 nuDNA loci) and morphological data across the range of L. brevirostris and its sister species L. notatus to test the hypothesis that L. brevirostris is comprised of more than one species. We found that the diagnostic characters for L. crystallinoron (lacking a visible tympanum and having larger vomerine teeth in contact) and L. brevipes (distinctive dorsal colouration) are also present in L. brevirostris and L. notatus. Furthermore, these characters vary among individuals that share the same mitochondrial haplotype and that occur within a single locality, including the type locality of L. crystallinoron. Although all samples from the type locality of L. crystallinoron form a distinct mitochondrial lineage relative to L. brevipes and L. brevirostris, our analysis of 25 nuclear loci does not support this relationship and instead suggests that this mitochondrial divergence reflects phylogeographic structure across the range of L. brevirostris, including samples from the type localities of L. crystallinoron and L. brevipes. By contrast, the mitochondrial divergence between L. notatus and L. brevirostris is strongly supported in the nuDNA dataset. Consequently, we recognise both L. brevipes and L. crystallinoron as synonyms of L. brevirostris. Given the extensive variation in the colour pattern, the tympanic membrane, and the size and shape of the vomerine teeth among L. brevirostris collected from one locality, variation in these traits should be interpreted with caution in taxonomic research on Leptopelis.",

The recent description of a new closely related congener from Mozambique, Hyperolius stictus (Conradie et al., 2018 Conradie W, Verburgt L, Portik DM, Ohler AM, Bwong BA, Lawson LP. 2018.

In this study, we reassess the relationships of these closely related species with new field sampling, molecular, morphological and bioacoustics analyses with the aim to assign the correct taxonomic identity to H. cf. mitchelli from northern Tanzania. Our results demonstrate that there are four distinct lineages within this group: H. stictus from Mozambique; H. rubrovermiculatus from southern Kenya; H. mitchelli sensu stricto from central and southern Tanzania and Malawi and H. cf. mitchelli from north-eastern Tanzania. Based on our combined analyses we assign H. cf. mitchelli as a new population of H. rubrovermiculatus with distinct colouration, extending the range of this species from Kenya into northern Tanzania. We also clarify the genetic, morphological and acoustic variation within and between all lineages to further knowledge of this group and provide direction for future study into this fragmented and variable lineage.",

Based on the intraspecific variation found in our specimens, we concluded that the characters considered are of limited usefulness for identification of this species. We found total annuli number to have potential for use as a taxonomic character while there is little diagnostic value in body and tail length, number of anal plates, number of pre-anal pores, and number of dorsal and ventral segments. We conclude that currently utilised morphological characters are insufficient to identify Monopeltis guentheri.RésuméDans un bosquet de forêt résiduelle de la ville de Brazzaville en République du Congo, nous avons collecté 64 spécimens de Monopeltis guentheri dont nous avons mesuré les caractères morphologiques traditionnellement utilisés pour la classification des cinq espèces d'amphisbènes Monopeltis d'Afrique centrale et occidentale. Compte tenu de la variation intraspécifique observée chez nos spécimens, nous concluons que ces caractères sont d'une utilité limitée pour l'identification de cette espèce. Nous avons trouvé que le nombre total d'anneaux est plus pertinent comme caractère taxonomique alors que l'intérêt pour la diagnose de la longueur du corps et de la queue, du nombre de pores pré-anales et du nombre de segments dorsaux et ventraux est limité.Key words: AmphisbaeniaMonopeltisCongotaxonomyidentificationmorphology AcknowledgementsWe thank S.V.

    "abstract": "Population genetic methods can be useful for understanding spatial genetic patterns, gene flow and diversity. While genetic markers such as gene sequences are useful for understanding broad scale phylogeographic patterns, microsatellite markers allow for inferences within species and on smaller spatial scales. Such data can then be used to glean information on biological processes at the landscape level. Because portions of southern Africa are predicted to be heavily impacted by climatic changes forecast for the next century, a better understanding of the biota at the species level would be beneficial for advancing knowledge on the southern African system. Therefore, we characterised 11 microsatellite markers for an arid adapted lacertid lizard, Pedioplanis lineoocellata, in order to obtain a microsatellite library for future studies. Five of 11 loci were out of Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium, showing a homozygote excess. Frequency-based analysis suggested this is due to the presence of null alleles. We further investigated this using a model-based Bayesian approach to simultaneously estimate inbreeding, null alleles and random amplification failures. In contrast to the frequency-based approach, this method indicated that both inbreeding and random amplification failures, not null alleles, are the most significant components of the model for nine of 11 loci. Overall, the inbreeding coefficient was low, but not zero, suggesting that low levels of inbreeding contribute to H-W deviations. Finally, we examined whether population bottlenecks could be a factor in deviations from H-W using multiple methods, but found no evidence to suggest that bottlenecks have played a role.",

We investigated the distribution and the differential calling behaviour of two diurnal terrestrial frogs, Gephyromantis decaryi (Near Threatened) and Gephyromantis enki (Data Deficient) (Mantellidae), across a disturbed forest and farmbush area at the border of Ranomafana National Park (Madagascar), in a selectively logged forest. We used five transects of 300 m that encompass habitats of equal length. We found that G. enki is rather a forest species while G. decaryi occurs more abundantly in farmbush. While detection was relatively constant inside forest, it depended on time of sampling in secondary vegetation: more G. enki calls were recorded in the morning while more G. decaryi calls were recorded in the afternoon outside forest. These findings bring new information to the habitat requirement and the calling behaviour of the two species. Results suggest the need for different study design recognising that the two species may have different calling behaviour. It also implies the importance of secondary vegetation around protected areas for threatened species.Key words: Call surveyGephyromantis enkiGephyromantis decaryisecondary vegetationRanomafanaMadagascar AcknowledgementsThis study was possible thanks to SUNY Stony Brook Study Abroad programme 2008.

Grandison (1972) and Tandy (1972) treated the Malawian Bufo taitanus nyikae Loveridge and the Kenyan B. lonnbergi nairobiensis Loveridge and B. mocquardi Angel as synonyms of B. lonnbergi Andersson. New material of the Nyikan Toad leads to a reassessment of the characters that suggested the synonymy; this in turn leads to a reconsideration of other material relegated to the synonymy of lonnbergi. It is concluded that nyikac is sufficiently distinct from all Kenyan material to merit specific status; separability of nairobiensis from mocquardi remains in doubt, but all this material is separable from lonnbergi. A single specimen of an apparently undescribed species from south-western Tanzania indicates the presence of this complex in Tanzanian highlands. Granting specific status to nyikae requires corrections to the zoogeographical treatment of the Zambesiaca region (poynton & Broadley 1991). B. nyikae is now regarded as a northern Malawi palaeoendemic.",

During previous years in Zimbabwe, total DDT residues from general agricultural contamination were at 3.90 ppm wet weight in Bufo gutturalis and 1.50 ppm in Ptychadena anchietae. Dieldrin residues in the Tomopterna cryptotis downstream of heavy pesticide spillage in Somaliland were up to 0.135 ppm (geometric mean 0.035 ppm), with ß‐HCH up to 0.43 ppm and total DDT up to 0.08 ppm. Dieldrin was within the 0.02–0.20 ppm range. At these levels, it should present no hazard to vertebrate predators ingesting amphibian prey. After the fifth and final application of the non‐persistent insecticide, endosulfan (14.0–23.8 g ha‐1 at 11–14‐day intervals), against tsetse flies (vectors of trypanosomiasis in cattle) in Zimbabwe, residues were at 0.14–0.57 ppm in P. anchietae. Over the 51‐day period of treatment, exponential accumulation to 2.05 ppm in the liver of anuran species was significantly correlated with time. Organochlorine residues accumulated to a geometric mean of 30.88 ppm in corpses of frogs that had been placed experimentally in contact with heavily contaminated soil (3728 ppm), and exceeded the baseline control mean (0.18 ppm) 168‐fold. Amphibian residue loads are biomarkers of the levels of pesticides entering faunal food chains, and thus the environment of sub‐Saharan Africa generally.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new species of Kassina is described from Unguja Island, Zanzibar, East Africa. It is distinguished from other species in its genus by an advertisement call that is pulsed, frequency modulated, and with a longer duration than that of K. senegalensis or K. maculata, and its grey and white reticulated colour pattern. The gular strap, like that in K. senegalensis, is continuous with the thick, pleated skin of the vocal pouch, but unlike K. senegalensis, it is rounded and truncated posteriorly. In contrast, the gular gland of K. maculata is rounded and free at its posterior end. The finger and toe tips are not distinct disks, but are only very slightly rounded and truncated when viewed from above. In lateral view, the tips are noticeably flattened.",

Male lizards in particular, may chemically sample potential refuges to avoid rivals. We tested whether male common barking geckos (Ptenopus g. garrulus) that normally take refuge in burrows, avoid refuges scented with a rival male. Geckos were equally likely to use an artificial refuge scented by another male compared to a control. We conclude that scent is an unimportant cue for rival male recognition in P. g. garrulus based on 1) the result of this experiment; 2) during 510 man hours of field work we did not observe a single gecko tongue‐flick; and 3) males respond aggressively to recordings of rival males and this appears to be the primary mechanism maintaining male spatial patterns.",

The reproductive cycle of this little-known species, originating from the Taita Hills in southeast Kenya, is annual. During the reproductive period (November–February), both lamina propria and the epithelium of the oviduct exhibit a maximum degree of development. The epithelial mucosa is more secretory and the cilia cells are abundant. Histological analysis shows the distribution of the different type of cells according to a specific pattern in the pars recta, pars convoluta and pars utera. Evaluation of proliferative (Ki-67 positive cells) and apoptotic cells (TUNEL and Apostain assays) into the different tissues brings out cyclic modifications of the lamina propria and epithelial cells throughout a seasonal cycle. The results demonstrate that the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis reflects the functionality of the oviduct during the sexual cycle.",

Data on the oviposition sites of Tetradactylus africanus africanus were gathered on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal. South Africa. These lizards oviposit exclusively in the nest mounds of the ant Anochetus faurei in the study area. The abundance of nests of A. faurei and other mound constructing ant and termite species was determined. The mounds of A. faurei were found to be relatively common, thus offering numerous suitable oviposition sites. Microclimate variables, including temperature and soil moisture within these mounds do not differ significantly from variables of other possible oviposition sites (grass tussocks, mounds of other ant species and termite mounds). Possible reasons as to why this lizard oviposits in the mounds of A. faurei are discussed in relation to ease of access to the substrate and protection of the eggs. Cuticular compounds of T. a. africanus eggs and hatchlings show some similarities with those of the worker caste of A. faurei, and its significance is discussed.",

We investigated habitat utilisation, seasonal distribution, and sexual dimorphism of C. dilepis on Telperion Nature Reserve (a privately protected natural area) in South Africa. Seven broad plant habitat units were surveyed for one year, which included a wet and a dry season. Plant species richness and species diversity, woody plant densities and canopy cover were recorded and analysed in each of the habitat units. Location, sex, age class and morphological measurements were recorded for located chameleons. Gravid adult females were found to be significantly heavier and larger than adult males, but no differences were found in size or mass for subadults. The occurrence of hatchlings was significantly influenced by rainfall, whereas minimum temperature had a significant influence on the occurrence of adults and subadults. Hatchlings occurred from mid-December to March in habitats associated with high shrub and grass canopy cover and low plant species diversity. Subadults were located from mid-March to the end of May in woody habitats and adults were located from the end of October until the end of May. Subadult and adult chameleons preferred dense woodland with high tree canopy cover and rockiness with high plant species diversity. The results of this study suggest that C. dilepis on Telperion have seasonal habits influenced by rainfall, minimum temperature and habitat structure.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly recognised that natural history datasets contain locality errors that can compromise the utility of those datasets. However, another source of error in these datasets is taxonomic misidentifications, and this type of error is potentially common, particularly with regards to morphologically conservative species. For example, in the African skinks, the Trachylepis striata and T. varia species complexes each contain morphologically similar species that are commonly confused, despite being genetically distinct. Some species also are partly sympatric, and misidentifications are likely to be especially problematic in those areas. Using DNA barcoding, we assessed misidentification rates between species and applied the updated identifications to known distribution maps to examine whether those maps are accurate representations. Existing banked samples and newly collected samples were DNA barcoded using the mitochondrial 16S gene and supplemented with GenBank data. Identifications were made by matching sequences using haplotype networks that included material from near type localities. The barcode-based identifications were compared with the original identifications recorded for those samples. Taxonomic error was common, particularly in areas of presumed sympatry (error for T. striata species complex: 28%; T. varia species complex: 31%) and this resulted in inaccurately represented species distributions and areas of sympatry. Areas of sympatry were, however, confirmed for T. spilogaster/T. punctatissima, T. striata/T. punctatissima and T. damarana/T. laevigata/T. varia. Our findings corroborate other studies that demonstrate taxonomic error in existing datasets is a significant, but typically unrecognised problem, particularly for morphologically conservative species. This has implications for the utility of historical collections, citizen science records and public databases used in the formulation of species distribution maps, but also for other downstream analyses that rely on these datasets.",

The annual number of frogs varied between 22 and 109 by migration. The sex ratio remained balanced. Most subadults stayed for just one season, whereas half of the adults remained longer. Some individuals reappeared after one or more years of absence. Within a season, male activity was concentrated in series of nights between quiet periods. Higher population density did not result in more territorial, stationary, or roaming males, or more fighting, but mainly in a higher number of inactive males. Fighting was intense, however, at extreme low water in 1995. Territorial males might maintain their territory in subsequent years. The size of individuals did not differ between behavioural types and males of any behaviour could mate successfully. The rare matings aggregated in adjacent nights at peak calling. Female approach to males was not seen, but playback in silent nights caused some females to linger near the loudspeaker. Females that experienced no amplexus during our observations were found significantly more in the shallow areas of the dam where sound did not enter. For mating, females accepted only males larger than 65 mm SVL and repelled all smaller ones. Mating was not size assortative. In both sexes, maturation took years of gradual development before successful mating.",

I examined faecal pellets from P. i. wilhelmi collected during October 2013 in order to survey the spring diet of this subspecies. I found that P. i. wilhelmi preyed mostly on ants, bees and wasps, and included only a minimal amount of vegetation in its diet, some of which was likely to have been incidentally ingested while feeding on arthropods. This study provides only the second examination of the feeding ecology of P. i. wilhelmi, and shows that during spring, flat lizards from one population in South Africa feed largely on insects from the order Hymenoptera.",

    "abstract": "A range-wide assessment of genetic variation in one mitochondrial (16S rRNA) and one nuclear-encoded (Rag-1) gene fragment of the widespread Madagascar frog Blommersia blommersae revealed the presence of up to 12 deep genetic lineages. Many of these differed by genetic distances >3% in the 16S gene. In the Ranomafana area in the southern central east of Madagascar, two mitochondrial lineages differing by 1.2–1.8% in 16S occurred in close syntopy across multiple sites. A phylogeny of representative samples based on multiple mitochondrial genes supported three main mitochondrial clades within B. blommersae, with lineages from the (i) north, (ii) north and northern central east, and (iii) southern central east, respectively. In addition, one lineage from Sainte Luce in the south-east was sister to all other species of Blommersia, and thus clearly not belonging to B. blommersae, to which it has been tentatively assigned previously. Except for the Sainte Luce population, most of the mitochondrial lineages did not show a concordant and consistent differentiation in Rag-1 and no obvious morphological differences were detected among the lineages. We therefore refrain from taxonomic conclusions for them at this time, although indications exist that the populations from the northern central east and southern central east may show certain differences in relative note duration of advertisement calls, which require further study. However, the Sainte Luce individuals were highly divergent in 16S (>10%) and Rag-1, phylogenetically isolated, and characterised by differences in colour pattern. This lineage represents the most evolutionarily divergent species of Blommersia known to date and is herein formally named and described as Blommersia dupreezi sp. nov.",

    "abstract": "Recent molecular phylogenies of African Green Snakes suggested the geographically widespread species Philothamnus carinatus includes at least two distinct lineages. We utilised an integrative taxonomic approach with morphological and genetic data to reconcile the taxonomic status of these cryptic lineages, including the recently described taxon P. brunneus from West Africa. We sequenced three mitochondrial (16S, cyt b and ND4) and two nuclear (c-mos and RAG1) genes from several Central African populations of P. carinatus and combined our data with other closely related species to infer a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with IQ-TREE. Our results are consistent with previous studies that showed P. cf. carinatus populations from Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) represent a cryptic lineage that is distinct from P. carinatus sensu stricto in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea (including Bioko Island), Gabon, eastern Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, and extreme western DRC. In our preferred tree, P. brunneus (limited to 16S molecular data) was recovered as a relatively long branch in a moderately supported clade with P. carinatus sensu stricto, whereas P. cf. carinatus populations from northern Angola, most of DRC, and East Africa (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda) were described as a new species. A possible hybrid population between south-eastern Cameroon and north-western DRC is consistent with an increasing body of evidence suggesting the Ubangi River might represent a hybrid zone area.",

We were able to develop a logistic regression model to predict the sex of adult tortoises in one of the five populations using principal component analysis; the model correctly predicted the sex of 25 of 26 adult tortoises. Growth of 40 tortoises was monitored and as in other chelonians, the annual relative growth rate decreased with age. The relative growth rate in adults was approximately 5% per year as compared to approximately 16% in juveniles. Juvenile tortoises accrued one scute growth layer per year.",

Interest in African herpetology is growing and the quality and quantity of articles in African Journal of Herpetology are seen to continue to increase.

All known locality records for the two species, including several new records, are documented and mapped. Typhlosaurus caecus is restricted to the coastal regions of the Western Cape province, while T. vermis occurs in the coastal regions of Namaqualand district, Northern Cape province. Although we confirm the identification of a T. vermis collected about 400 km to the east of the nearest other record for the species, further collecting is needed to confirm this locality.",

Like congeners with extensively fused head shields, C. bifrontalis displays variability in cephalic scutellation. Pre‐cloacal pores in females are represented by small scale depressions, but these lack secretion cores. The species reaches a snout‐vent length of only 131 mm and is thus one of the smallest known fossorial reptiles.

The species is regarded as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List and is a priority species on the Zoological Society of London’s EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct, Globally Endangered) project, given its Red List status and phylogenetic distinctiveness. We analyse temporal patterns of abundance (1934–2014) of A. dutoiti and the remainder of the Mount Elgon amphibian assemblage to infer the probability of re-encountering A. dutoiti and assess whether declines are species specific to A. dutoiti, or whether they are assemblage-wide phenomena. Our results show that for localities where surveys have been repeatedly conducted, A. dutoiti is likely to be locally extinct. Declines are observed in other Mount Elgon amphibians, encompassing both specialists and generalists. Causal factors for declines are unknown, but habitat change might be important, given the high degree of forest loss in the area, especially since the turn of the 20th century. Urgent sampling of preferred microhabitats of A. dutoiti at the type locality and surrounding areas beyond those included in our study are required to determine whether or not the species is extinct. Impacts on other taxonomic groups would also be useful to understand so that it can be determined how broad the changes are for the Mount Elgon biota.",

To evaluate its current-day (mostly 2012–2021) distribution in central South Africa and Lesotho, we examined various media sources, including Facebook, for photographic and videographic records. Records were posted or shared to a Facebook group Free State Reptiles and Amphibians (including adjacent areas and Lesotho) and saved electronically for future reference. In total we accumulated 208 Facebook records for 152 unique localities. Several localities were vague or broad, and therefore most of the original submitters of records were contacted in an attempt to confirm or refine them. Of the 139 individuals contacted, 68 (49%) responded regarding 96 records and they either confirmed the given locality names, could not add to the information, or refined them. In total, 131 (63%) of the 208 Facebook records were confirmed/verified and were thus usable for plotting on maps. The 131 records represent 86% of all verified media records, whereas only 14% (21 records) are from platforms such as iNaturalist, iSpot and ReptileMAP. All verified media records, together with literature and unpublished museum records, were plotted on a map. Our evaluation, based on verified records, showed that the rinkhals still occurs widely in the northern, central and eastern Free State Province, and several new records extend its known range westwards in central South Africa. New records indicate that it still occurs in western Lesotho, as well as the Maluti Mountains in the north of this country. Our study is the first to make extensive use of Facebook records for evaluating the distribution of a southern African reptile. We contend that a large body of photographic and videographic records for reptiles and amphibians exists on social networking sites, such as Facebook, and proper evaluation and documentation of these records can contribute significantly to knowledge of present-day species distributions.",

Although fairly intensive surveys of amphibian and reptile distribution have been conducted in the Free State province of South Africa, very little collecting has been concentrated in protected areas. Checklists are presented for the amphibians and reptiles recorded from, and expected to occur in, each of the 16 major national parks, provincial nature reserves and other protected areas in the province. Species/subspecies richness for amphibians and reptiles in these areas was evaluated, indicating that only one protected area has been thoroughly surveyed. At Willem Pretorius Game Reserve, 50 % of the expected 14 amphibian and 79 % of the expected 39 reptile taxa (species and subspecies) have been collected. The only other area that has been fairly well surveyed is Golden Gate Highlands National Park, where 56% of the expected 25 amphibian and 44% of the expected 50 reptile taxa have been recorded. Despite this, 21 (81%) of the 26 amphibian taxa, and 67 (69%) of the 97 reptile taxa known to occur in the Free State have been recorded from at least one protected area. Two areas of particular importance to conservation were identified: the Golden Gate—Qwa-Qwa—Sterkfontein Dam conservation area in the mountainous north-eastern Free State, where as many as 27 amphibian and 51 reptile taxa, including four Red Data Book species, are expected; and the extensive Gariep Dam—Tussen-die-Riviere conservation area in the Karoo biome of the southern Free State, where 10 amphibian and 56 reptile taxa are expected to occur, including two Red Data Book species. The study showed that in order to prepare satisfactory inventories of the herpetofauna of the region's protected areas, more collecting is necessary in most reserves. It is suggested that conservation authorities encourage their staff to actively conduct surveys and collect small samples of each species present.",

Morning, midday and late afternoon behavioural activities of cryptically coloured Agama aculeata aculeata and non-cryptically coloured A. planiceps planiceps males were compared to determine whether the former display significantly lower frequencies of movement than the latter. The types of activities studied, were regarded as either behaviour of low movement intensity (basking, shading, sit-and-wait foraging) or behaviour of high movement intensity (running, walking, detect-and-chase foraging). Apart from the fact that A. p. planiceps shaded itself significantly more frequently than A. a aculeata during morning observation sessions, and that the latter species engaged in sit-and-wait foraging significantly more frequently than the former during midday observation sessions, no significant differences were found between the two species with respect to the rest of the behavioural activities. The findings therefore did not support the generalization that the diurnal behavioural activities of cryptically coloured animals such as A. a. aculeata males, is characterized by significantly lower frequencies of movement, compared to that of non-cryptically coloured animals such as males of A. p. planiceps. The absence of significant differences in behavioural activities recorded during consecutive observation sessions for each species was surprising, especially in cases where mean ambient temperature between sessions differed significantly.",

A new species of small, rupicolous Phyllodactylus is described from the upper plateau of the Karoo National Park, Western Cape Province, South Africa. Features of scalation, colour and body form, as well as three fixed allozyme differences distinguish the new species from all other southern African Phyllodactylus. The new species is morphologically most similar to P. hewitti from the southern Cape Fold Mountains, and is genetically most similar to this species and to P. hexaporus from the Cedarberg. The new form is allopatric with respect to all other members of the P. lineatus complex, although P. lineatus reaches its easternmost and inland limit on the lower plateau, only a few airline kilometers away, but nearly a vertical kilometer lower in elevation. Allozyme and genetic distance data are reported for all seven species in the P. lineatus group. Phyllodactylus gemmulus is the sister taxon of the remainder of the group, with P. lineatus as the sister taxon of the clade (Phyllodactylus n. sp. + P. essexi + P. hewitti + P. hexaporus + P. rupicolus). These last five species appear to have diverged from one another almost simultaneously, suggesting a climatic change that may have isolated ancestral populations throughout South Africa.

    "abstract": "Abstract The calling behaviour of male Hyperolius marmoratus marmoratus was monitored continuously over a 21 day period in the laboratory. These data were then compared to the results of a study of calling behaviour and mating success in a natural population of these frogs. Males were classified as callers, intermittent callers or noncallers depending on their level of calling performance. We propose that intermittent calling behaviour allows a male to extend chorus attendance when levels of male-male competition are low. The frogs classified as callers in the captive population showed a high degree of repeatability in call rate (0.464) between nights. In accordance with this, there was no significant difference between a male's calling behaviour on the first and last nights of calling. These results have important implications for male mating success. The consistency of a caller's behaviour facilitates female choice based on male call rate which is evident on a nightly basis, as males that are going to mate call at faster rates than their unmated competitors. Additionally, time spent calling and total number of calls produced showed more within male variation than was found for call rate with repeatabilities of 0.233 and 0.208, respectively. This result is not surprising as males that mate do so early in the evening and thus produce fewer calls and spend less time calling than those that do not mate. Key words: calling behaviourchorus tenuremating success",

The extent to which this concealment limits predation during basking is not known, but available data suggests that such concealment may significantly reduce predation attempts. Using model snakes placed in the field, predation rates on small model snakes were tested, specifically whether attack rates differ between partially concealed model snakes and model snakes placed in open unconcealed positions. Results from the current study support previous studies that predation pressure was high (average = 22.15%), but was not significantly reduced by semi-sheltered basking. An important new finding of this study was the high number of model snakes that experience trampling by wild ungulates (average = 12.72%.) This suggests that snakes basking in open and sheltered areas are also at risk of being killed or injured through trampling by larger animals. This study makes an important contribution to understanding predation pressure in African snakes and highlights other threats that snakes are exposed to during basking and thermoregulation.",

In an effort to determine the distribution of this species more accurately, a working species distribution model was created for use in searching for more populations over a period of three breeding seasons. Twenty-one more wetlands containing the frog were discovered and a second species distribution model was created for use in spatial planning applications. Leptopelis xenodactylus occurs primarily in temperate, alluvial hummock wetlands in U-shaped valleys at mid-altitudes in southwestern KwaZulu-Natal. The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy of L. xenodactylus were recalculated including the new records and have increased by 9% and 429%, respectively. The known localities for L. xenodactylus were analysed in relation to the predictions of two downscaled climate change models and a vulnerability framework. Climate change was found to be a potentially significant threat to L. xenodactylus according to the downscaled HadMC2 model and the vulnerability framework, potentially affecting up to 80.5% of the geographic range, but not according to the downscaled GFDL2.1 model and the vulnerability framework which indicated that up to 22% of the geographic range might be affected. The better understanding of the distribution and habitat of L. xenodactylus and of the potential combined impact of climate change and land transformation on the species gained through this study will assist in improving its conservation management.",

To determine if variations in herpetofaunal species assemblages could be detected between derelict Eucalyptus plantations, cleared plantation woodlots, and untransformed sand thicket vegetation, a pitfall and funnel trap survey was conducted in coastal southern Mozambique. Herpetofaunal species richness for derelict Eucalyptus plantations was 13 ± 2.24 species, untransformed sand thicket vegetation 17 ± 2.34 species and cleared plantation woodlots 18 ± 3.14 species. Both Shannon-Weaver and Simpson Diversity Indices estimated the highest herpetofaunal species diversity in untransformed sand thicket vegetation and the lowest diversity in derelict Eucalyptus plantations. The herpetofaunal species assemblages of derelict Eucalyptus plantations and natural sand thicket vegetation were least similar (0.507 ± 0.041), while cleared plantation woodlots and derelict Eucalyptus plantations were most similar (0.753 ± 0.032) in terms of herpetofaunal community composition. In contrast to our expectations, significantly higher capture rates were reported for a fossorial anuran in derelict Eucalyptus plantations compared to both cleared plantation woodlots and untransformed sand thicket vegetation, which requires further investigation and discussion. As with most other studies investigating the effects of exotic timber plantations on biodiversity, our results indicate that the detectable herpetofaunal diversity decreased in Eucalyptus plantations when compared to natural or cleared plantation woodlots. Subsequently it would seem as though the active clearing of dilapidated timber plantations as part of rehabilitation efforts may positively affect herpetofaunal diversity.",

It is closely related to the widespread Western Rock Skink T. sulcata (Peters, 1867) from Namibia and South Africa, but heretofore a lack of samples has prevented a comprehensive assessment of T. ansorgii in a molecular phylogenetic context. We combine new genetic sampling from south-western Angola, including topotypical material of T. ansorgii, with published sequences from South Africa and Namibia to identify population structure, phylogenetic relationships, and divergence dates within this species complex. A multi-locus dataset of three nuclear and two mitochondrial loci recovered significant population structuring with a centre of diversity in south-western Angola and northern Namibia. Mitochondrial data recovered seven clades representing distinct geographic populations, while the nuclear data supported either two or three deeper groupings. Mito-nuclear discordance was observed with respect to the geographic boundary between T. ansorgii and T. sulcata. The nuclear data support a break along the western Kunene River (the political boundary between Angola and Namibia), while the mitochondrial data support this break ∼250 km to the north in south-western Angola. A time-calibrated BEAST phylogeny found the deepest species-level divergence to have occurred in the late Miocene/early Pliocene (∼6 mya), potentially related to the formation of the Kunene River. Our results support the recognition of both taxa at the species level, and add further evidence that south-western Angola is a centre of reptile diversity.",

The combination of low detectability and irregular feeding frequency of snakes has limited the resolution of available diet data for many of these species. A variety of methodologies exist for collecting snake feeding data, however, each of these varies in their strengths and biases. Here, we contrast characterisations of the diet of the brown house snake, Boaedon capensis, based on three common approaches to collecting feeding data: 1) examining gut contents from preserved museum specimens, 2) reviewing published literature, and 3) crowdsourcing feeding records from community science platforms. Gut contents included only mammal and reptile prey, presenting a significantly narrower diet breadth (Levins' Ba = 0.12) than the community science (Levins' Ba = 0.66) and literature (Levins' Ba = 0.49) datasets, which both also included amphibian and avian prey. Interpretation of museum data alone conveys that B. capensis has a relatively specialised, mammal-dominated diet whereas the community science and literature datasets indicate a much wider dietary breadth. Our findings reiterate the importance of utilising multiple methods to assess the dietary composition of snakes to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their feeding ecology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Energy metabolism varies considerably between different groups of endotherms, yet there is little or no reported variation among extant groups of reptiles. We measured lower resting metabolic rates (RMRs) in Kalahari tent tortoises (Psammobates oculiferus) than in sympatric Leopard tortoises (Geochelone pardalis). G. pardalis also had RMR values that were higher than the allometric prediction for reptiles whereas P. oculiferus had RMR values that were not significantly different from the prediction. Differences in RMR between the two species may have occurred because of the large differences in body mass, differing body temperatures, differences in growth rates, or because there may have been differences in the heat increment of feeding.",

His 659 herpetological contributions, spanning 47 years, include field and photographic guides, taxonomic revisions, phylogenies, ecological studies, annotated checklists, conservation assessments, type catalogues, notes on natural history, geographical distribution and snakebite, book reviews, editorials, obituaries, tributes and prefaces. Bill authored eight book titles, including his monumental Field Guide to Snakes and other Reptiles of Southern Africa (1988, revised in 1998), The Dangerous Snakes of Africa with Steve Spawls (1995, revised in 2020) and Tortoises, Terrapins and Turtles of Africa (2008). He edited the Red Data Book – Reptiles and Amphibians (1988) and was a co-editor of its successor, the Atlas and Red List of the Reptiles of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (2014). In addition to a corpus of faunal and systematic works, the topics of his publications also include reptile husbandry, karyology, snake hemipenes, snake venom, reptile diets and reproduction. Appendices presented here include a detailed bibliography of his herpetological publications; a chronological list of all the reptile and amphibian taxa he described; and details of patronyms named in his honour. Bill described 68 new taxa comprising 51 species (37 lizards [18 geckos], 7 chelonians, 4 snakes, 3 frogs), 15 genera (14 lizards, 1 snake), one subfamily (Platysaurinae) and one family (Xenodactylidae). Additional species bearing his name are expected to be published within the next few years. He was the most productive South Africa-based author of reptile names (65) in the modern era. As of 2020, he had been honoured by seven patronyms (one lizard, three snakes and one frog species, and a lizard and snake genus).",

We report new localities for this species, along with locality records for its sister species B. tasymena, including localities where they occur in sympatry, which has never been reported before. We also document evidence for the existence of a colour variant of B. tasymena that is identical to B. erythrodactylus in appearance. We also observed never before documented breeding behaviour in the poorly known B. erythrodactylus, where the male and female in amplexus used a submerged site in a river potentially for oviposition. We also explore why this may be a predator-avoidance strategy considering the presence of aquatic invertebrate predators active near the surface and absence of fully aquatic vertebrate predators, such as fish in headwater stream habitats. Predator-avoidance strategies are a vital component of organismal survival, particularly for amphibians with complex life cycles. Natural history observations are key to revealing such strategies and behaviour, and they form the basis of evolutionary biology and is also fundamental for conservation management.",

    "abstract": "Temperature profoundly influences the functioning of ectotherms and understanding the thermal biology of invasive species affords valuable insights regarding the suitability of different habitats. Yet, this remains an understudied aspect in the field of invasion biology. Here, we investigated the thermal physiology of the highly invasive Tropical House Gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia) in a coastal region of South Africa. The study site is near to the southernmost extent of the species’ distribution and we expected the physiology of individuals at the study site to differ compared to that of individuals inhabiting tropical regions. Relative to tropical geckos, we observed a decrease of 3.4°C in preferred body temperature (Tpref) to 24.0 °C, which was likely driven by selection for improved functioning within the cooler temperate climate. However, the lower (CTmin) and upper (CTmax) critical thermal limits were higher in geckos at the study site. CTmin was similar between sexes at 11.9 °C, whereas males had a higher CTmax by ≈ 1.9 °C reaching 39.7 °C. A broader tolerance range is typical of a highly variable climate, and we presume that the increase in CTmax allows geckos to better cope with occasional high temperatures. Further, sex-specific differences are uncommon in reptiles, but our study supports claims of improved heat tolerance in male geckos, argued to be related to their aggressive and territorial behaviour. The results also support claims that tropical geckos are more adaptable than previously thought, allowing them to invade new areas. Thereafter, their aggressive behaviour, dietary flexibility and year-round activity likely provides house geckos with a competitive advantage over some native reptiles.",

The species occurs in fragmented patches of coastal reed-bed wetland, which is a habitat that is threatened by urbanisation, agriculture, mining, and plantation forestry. We used a 16S rRNA Next Generation Sequencing approach to characterise the bacteriome of 20 adult H. pickersgilli from three localities and determined the prevalence of anti-Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) associated bacteria by comparing representative amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) sequences to known references using The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) tool of National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Results from three different populations were found to harbour similar skin microbial communities, dominated by a core set of bacterial taxa that included Proteobacteria (39.67% of total ASVs), Actinobacteria (14.83%) and Firmicutes (11.21%). Anti-Bd associated bacterial communities were identified from all three localities (4.12–15.47% of total ASVs), that may be contributing to the reported low frequency of occurrence of the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and may contribute to the lack of known morbidity or mortality from chytridiomycosis in H. pickersgilli. A higher prevalence of Chlamydiia in Mount Moreland suggests a possible alteration in the skin bacteriome composition in this population and warrants further investigation. Future studies should evaluate the relationship between the bacteriome of H. pickersgilli and the bacteria present in the environment to assess what role the environment plays in the bacteriome's formation.",

An emerging perspective suggests that conservation success is dependent on understanding the cognitive, emotional, and behavioural aspects that impact attitudes and behaviours towards biodiversity. This mixed-methods study attempted to shed light on how three communities in the vicinity of Nature's Valley in the Western Cape province of South Africa, perceive, interact with, and consider the protection of frogs. Overall, the three communities slightly disliked frogs, however, geo-specific variability between demographic profiles, cultural beliefs and myths, and memorial background evidently strongly impact human-frog interaction and willingness to tolerate and protect them. This complex interplay between cultural and personal factors, as well as grouped bio-spherical values, led to the conclusion that to ensure the success of frog conservation efforts, a generalist approach to pro-frog behavioural change should be followed by focusing on pro-environmental behavior in general first rather than attempting to change a specific aspect of human-frog interaction from the outset.",

    "abstract": "The African green snakes of the genus Philothamnus include c. 21 recognised species distributed across sub-Saharan Africa. Many of the species exhibit high morphological conservatism, exist sympatrically, and can have high population densities. This is presumably the reason why the number of species, their systematics, and taxonomy remain debated, and this may compromise the ability to conduct accurate species identifications based on morphological characters. To investigate and quantify this problem, we examined a large sympatric sample of ethanol-preserved Philothamnus specimens from Minziro Forest, Tanzania. Of the 248 specimens examined, 55 were P. heterolepidotus, 49 were P. hoplogaster, 33 were P. angolensis, and one was P. ornatus. A further 110 specimens could not be assigned to any species based on existing identification keys. Thus, this unidentified sample of Philothamnus comprises new forms or undescribed polymorphisms within recognised forms. We examined diagnostic morphological characters using a multivariate approach. Results revealed that if the presence or absence of the white spot character is ignored, many unidentified individuals fall within well-defined clusters based on other characters. These include the heart position, which we explore here as a new diagnostic character for this genus. A thorough revision using integrative taxonomy, for example combining morphological and genetic characteristics from across the spectrum of variability in this genus, could provide a better understanding of species limits, diversity, evolutionary history, and radiation of some of the most commonly encountered snakes in sub-Saharan Africa. This would also improve the taxonomic accuracy of regional herpetological biodiversity assessments.",

    "abstract": "Although the knowledge about the Tanzanian reptiles and amphibians has drastically increased in recent years, the knowledge on the amphibian and reptile fauna of the remaining forest reserves of the Uluguru Mountains (UMs) is only partially known. Amphibians and reptiles were studied in 17 forest reserves and sampled using diurnal and nocturnal time-constrained visual encounter surveys, acoustic surveys and opportunistic searches. A total of 51 quadrats of 25 × 25 m were randomly established on the forest floor, totalling 459 person-hours of sampling effort. Overall, 54 herpetofauna species (27 amphibian and 27 reptile species) were recorded from the area, including two anurans and seven reptile species, which are new records for the region. The estimated Chao1 species richness for the study region was 51 for amphibians and 76 for reptiles. Amphibian and reptile species composition did not differ significantly across the forest reserves, but similarities in species composition of different levels were evident across the reserves. For both communities, α-diversity and relative abundance did not vary significantly across the reserves. Based on multiple regression analyses, leaf-litter anuran species richness was positively influenced by percentage canopy cover, whereas abundance was negatively influenced by total fragment size. Partial correlations showed that variation in leaf-litter anuran abundance was explained by relative humidity, percentage canopy cover and soil moisture, while controlling for altitude. Percentage canopy cover was also the best predictor of species richness of leaf-litter anurans. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of protecting the UMs forest reserves for herpetofauna conservation.",

Using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), the Ca and P concentration and content of 30 fertile eggs was determined within 10 days prior to anticipated hatching, and compared with those of size-matched unbanded eggs (eggs that failed to form an opaque band around the lesser circumference, indicative of presumed infertility). Shell contained the highest Ca concentration and content, followed by the foetus, followed by the intra-abdominal yolk. Foetal tissue had the highest P concentration and content, followed by intra-abdominal yolk. The Ca and P concentration of intra-abdominal yolk of foetuses in fertile eggs varied more widely than did the yolk of unbanded eggs, based on coefficient of variation. Ca concentration of fertile egg yolk was in some cases found to exceed that of the yolk of unbanded eggs, suggesting that Ca is stored there after being removed from the shell, however, yolk Ca content was consistently lower in fertile than in unbanded eggs, indicating net yolk Ca depletion. Yolk P concentration and content of fertile eggs was consistently lower than that of unbanded eggs, suggesting a net depletion of yolk P reserves, without replenishment. The Nile crocodile appears to follow the classic archosaurian pattern of Ca mobilisation, whereby the shell supplies the majority of foetal Ca, but the intra-abdominal yolk contains substantial Ca reserves for use by the hatchling. This study provides clinicians and researchers with information on sample collection and analysis of Nile crocodile egg and foetal tissue, provides baseline descriptive data on Ca and P concentration and content, discusses the effect of potential covariates on Ca and P concentration and content, and discusses the movement of Ca and P from reserves within the egg to the developing foetus.",

The specimens provide additional records of the two known species of African vine snakes, Thelotomis capensis and T. kirtlandii in Tanzania. A specimen of T. kirtlandii is the largest ever caught and represents only the second record for Tanzania, with a range extension of more than 700 kilometres. The signifieance of several West African forest snakes entering Tanzania, including Boiga blandingii and Typhlops angolensis, are commented upon and the status of the northeastern population of T. c. mossambicanus, containing T. kirtlandii features, is discussed.",

Sound recordings obtained by way of directional manual recordings were used to analyse call structure and call type while Passive Acoustic Monitoring with Song Meter® technology were used to survey circadian call patterns. Following confirmation of species identity, the detailed vocalisation analysis indicated a much more diverse repertoire than previously known. Three call types were observed with Type A consisting of two or three compressed notes; Type B consisting of a multi-note vocalisation, containing multiple pulses and notes produced in rapid succession; and Type C being a multi-note vocalisation consisting of rapidly released, randomly-spaced single notes. Detailed descriptions of call repertoires, including patterns and call types are useful for species identification and for use in comparison studies.",

Twelve sites, each encompassing a combination of vegetation type, elevation, slope and aspect, were sampled for S. inornatus using dug quadrats, pitfall-and funnel-trap arrays, and coverboard arrays. Seven S. inornatus were recorded, at least one by each sampling method. Individuals were captured at the forest edge and in the grassland part of the forest-grassland ecotone and none were captured in the interior of the forest. None of the sampling methods were suitable for the long-term monitoring of S. inornatus, although a modification of the coverboard array using terracotta tiles instead of corru-board tiles should be tested. Five S. inornatus captured were introduced to the Johannesburg Zoo's ex-situ insurance and captive-breeding population. Nine other sympatric species of herpetofauna were recorded during the survey, with the Bush Squeaker Arthroleptis wahlbergii Smith, 1849 the most caught and S. inornatus ranking fifth. This study provides information that is useful for addressing some of the conservation actions and research needed for S. inornatus, but more research on the biology of this skink (particularly on its life history and population size) and habitat management interventions (restoration and rehabilitation of its habitat) are required to assist with improving its conservation status.",

These responses mean that they are good bioindicators of acidic waters. Exposure to a pH less than 3 results in death of all embryos and tadpoles as a result of an accelerated decline in body sodium due to sodium efflux. pH 4 affects the hatching success, growth and the incidence of malformation among embryos and tadpoles. pH 5 and pH 6 do not appear to have any detrimental effects on embryos or tadpoles.",

    "abstract": "Viviparity has evolved independently multiple times within squamate reptiles. In the Lacertidae, two genera and several species from the Northern Hemisphere are known to be viviparous. However, although viviparity is present in many African reptiles, all African lacertids were considered exclusively oviparous. The lacertid genus Tropidosaura is restricted to mountainous grassland habitats across central and southern South Africa. Prompted by the dissection of a gravid T. essexi specimen containing well-developed embryos, we dissected additional gravid females from two museum collections to assess parity mode in the four Tropidosaura species. Gravid females of three species contained developing eggs, but all gravid Tropidosaura essexi specimens examined exhibited simple placental development or contained well-developed embryos with the presence of a simple placenta and an absence of any eggshell. The large yolks and simple placentae suggest that viviparity in T. essexi is lecithotrophic. T. essexi thus represents the only known viviparous species of lacertid in Africa and therefore, the first known viviparous lacertid in the Southern Hemisphere, revealing yet another independent case of the evolution of viviparity within the squamates. T. essexi occurs at higher maximum elevations than any of its oviparous congeners, and the recorded litter size in T. essexi was slightly higher than the clutch sizes of other members of the genus. Previously reported oviparity in T. essexi may either be the result of specimen misidentification or potential bimodal reproductive in this species, but this latter explanation is unlikely, given that none of the T. essexi examined in this study showed evidence of oviparity.",

Wulf’s collecting expeditions to various southern African countries, especially Namibia, Angola, South Africa and Lesotho, contributed significantly to making the herpetological collection at Ditsong National Museum of Natural History (formerly Transvaal Museum) one of the largest such collections on the continent. He generated 72 herpetology-related publications, including significant lizard taxonomic revisions. His publications include descriptions of 16 herpetological taxa (13 lizards, two snakes and one frog). To date, nine animal taxa (four lizards, five invertebrates) have been named in his honour. We include personal recollections, based on our association with him since the 1980s. A bibliography of Wulf’s herpetological publications is also provided.",

However, the taxonomic relationships and phylogeographic patterns of these geckos are not fully understood. Here we show that some specimens of Tarentola geckos from Mauritania and southern Morocco previously identified as T. hoggarensis can actually be assigned to T. panousei, a taxon treated as a synonym until now. Because the corresponding type specimen has apparently been lost, we designate a neotype for T. panousei referring to a suitable specimen from the type locality. Based on a morphological examination of the neotype and comparative material we provide a detailed redescription of T. panousei and evaluation of its diagnostic characters. Moreover, we report on a syntopic occurrence of T. annularis and T. panousei on an isolated acacia tree in the Western Sahara and the (micro) habitat use of both species.",

Both belong to the family, Psammophiidae. The Striped Beaked Snake (Kladirostratus acutus) was originally assigned to the genus Rhamphiophis, because of its beak-like snout. However, molecular evidence indicates that K. acutus is more closely related to Psammophylax. Thus, the “beak” of K. acutus must have evolved independently of that seen in Rhamphiophis. We studied the cranial morphology of K. acutus and representatives of Psammophylax and Rhamphiophis to identify possible traits that may reflect independent derivation of a beak-shaped snout relative to Rhamphiophis. We found that K. acutus retains four main cranial features in common with the Psammophylax: (1) an open fenestra between the premaxilla, nasals and septomaxilla, (2) a lack of fusion between the septomaxilla and the vertical lamina of the nasal, (3) the conchal processes of the septomaxilla extend beyond the dorsal margin of the septomaxilla and (4) a lack of contact between the prefrontals and the dorsal laminae of the nasals. Simultaneously, K. acutus displays traits associated with adaptation to semi-fossorial life in snakes such as a shortening of the maxilla, modification of the premaxilla, elongation of the nasal region, and a narrowing of the braincase.",

    "abstract": "Arboreal chameleons must navigate a complex, three-dimensional landscape consisting of trees, bushes and/or grasses of various sizes. This complexity equates to the microhabitat of chameleons, that is, the branches upon which they perch and through which they move. Therefore, chameleons rely on their ability to grip perches available to them, and this is evident by their specialised adaptations such as their prehensile tail and their grasping hands and feet. To date, ecological studies of chameleons have relied on gathering data on perch use only at night because locating chameleons during the daytime is extremely difficult. However, the night-time perch represents the sleeping perch of individuals, and this is not necessarily reflective of overall diel perch use. Many other arboreal reptiles are constrained to using thin perches at night, but by day their microhabitat is more variable, using thicker branches, limbs or tree trunks. To assess whether this well-entrenched paradigm (night-time perch use being constrained to thin perches) also extends to fully arboreal chameleons, daytime and night-time perch diameters were measured for the Cape Dwarf Chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, and were compared using analyses of variance statistical approaches. Neither perch diameters nor variance in perch diameters differed between the two photoperiods, and the variance in diameters of perches used was remarkably high. Despite this variance, there was a significant, positive relationship between body size and the diameter of perches used. Unlike other reptiles, the results show that for B. pumilum the night-time perch use is not different than diurnal perch use, and there appears to be a fairly wide range of perches used by chameleons of a given body size over both photoperiods. Nevertheless, the positive trend for chameleons of larger body sizes to choose larger perches than smaller chameleons implies that there are some upper and lower constraints for the diameters of perches used, possibly relating to their ability to effectively grip a range of perch sizes.",

The population is thought to be decreasing, but there are almost no data about this Sahara-Sahel endemic lizard. Recently, a sixth population was found in Mauritania, at the coastal peripheral zone of the Diawling National Park, which constitutes a remarkable opportunity to gather ecological information for the first time and to plan conservation actions. Here we assess the P. zolii regional distribution in Mauritania, estimate population abundance, analyse the species activity patterns, characterise the occupied habitats, assess local threats, evaluate the national conservation status, and define an action plan for the local conservation of the species. P. zolii is locally rare and exhibits a much-localised distribution, but additional sampling is needed in other humid areas to fill out the knowledge gap on global distribution. The activity period is very restricted, limited to the central hours of the day, with low detectability and high specialisation in habitat use. The species is evaluated as Critically Endangered at the national level and is threatened by industrial and agriculture developments. These activities have degraded the suitable available habitats and hamper any dispersal possibility. Extreme climatic events related with sea-level rise could decimate the entire Mauritanian population. Any pet trade that may be stimulated by the current discovery should be carefully supervised and monitored. The discovery of this isolated population justifies that coastal habitats should be designated as integral protection zone and included inside the Diawling National Park.",
