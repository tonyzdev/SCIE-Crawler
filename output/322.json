    "abstract": "A comprehensive internal NASA study known as 'Access to Space' has sought to identify and assess major alternatives for the long-range direction the space transportation program should take. The scope of the study covered all U.S. civilian, commercial, and national security needs for space transportation for the next several decades. Three alternative approaches were identified: using current vehicles; developing new conventional technology vehicles, and developing new advanced technology vehicles. Large annual operations cost savings could be obtained only with new vehicles, and then only with considerable up-front investments. Seven other major factors were assessed. The third option is found to be the most attractive.",

    "abstract": "Plasma contactors could be used to ground satellites to space plasma to acquire a flow of electrons to propel or power the satellites. A tether would cut across geomagnetic field lines, producing a potential difference between the ends of the tether. Closing the connection between the ends would form a circuit in which an electrical load could be inserted. Design constraints of the circuit are low impedance and a fully reversible high current. The contactor would generate a neutral plasma to connect to the ionospheric plasma. The surface area of the connection would have to be kept large enough for the current density to be equal to the random electron current density in the unperturbed space plasmas. The other contactor would feed electrons and draw ions from the space plasma. Experimental results from spaceborne and ground-based space plasma simulator tests of hollow cathodes that have shown that multiampere currents can be collected are described.",

Vortex lift flaps have been wind tunnel tested on scale models, and it has been noted that a variety of effects can be obtained through the use of folding, hinged, and tabbed flap designs. Flap planforms can, moreover, be varied in length and in total area, as well as segmented, to yield unique combinations of drag reduction, vortex generation, longitudinal stability, and vortex flow reattachment. It is speculated that the vortex flap may be applicable to multimission fighters, and promote STOL performance.",

However, these technologies are usually judged to be very ambitious and very far off. This notion persists despite major advances in technology and vehicle design in the past decade. There appears to be four major misperceptions about SSTOs, regarding their mass fraction, their presumed inadequate performance margin, their supposedly small payloads, and their extreme sensitivity to unanticipated vehicle weight growth. These misperceptions can be dispelled for SSTO rockets using advanced technologies that could be matured and demonstrated in the near term. These include a graphite-composite primary structure, graphite-composite and Al-Li propellant tanks with integral reusable thermal protection, long-life tripropellant or LOX-hydrogen engines, and several technologies related to operational effectiveness, including vehicle health monitoring, autonomous avionics/flight control, and operable launch and ground handling systems.",

The oblique shape reduces wave drag in proportion to the wing length, and can achieve reductions by factors of 4-16. Variable sweep would be accompanied by fuel pumping to maintain an acceptable center of gravity and tail loading. The lift forces remain balanced and thus remove fuselage loads considerations. Extra tail loading to handle longitudinal moments of center-of-lift shifts with variable sweep aircraft are also eliminated. However, oblique wings couple the roll, pitch and yaw axes and require digital controls to provide balancing forces. NASA has initiated a four phase design, construction and flight test program to examine the flight envelope of oblique wings on the F-8 aircraft.",

LEBUs are thin plates or ribbons suspended in a turbulent boundary layer to sever or break up the large vortices that form the convoluted outer edge of the layer. Other turbulence-control techniques are discussed, including one that involves the injection of control vortices into the turbulent boundary layer to modify or substitute for large-eddy structures.",

NASA has developed advanced computational design tools and methodology, subsonic and transonic NLF (natural laminar flow) and LFC airfoils, practical laminar wing construction techniques, and practical leading-edge treatments applicable to civil and military transports.

Miscible with water up to 95% by mass, it also has high density and has been extensively characterized for materials compatibility, safety, transportation, storage and handling. Before any serious attempt to use the proposed oxidizer in hybrids, though, the usual performance figures must first be obtained. The simplest are time-independent, equilibrium rocket performance numbers that include chamber temperature, temperature at the nozzle throat, and key species in the exhaust. These numbers must be followed by several other important performance evaluation, including burning rates, pressure dependence, susceptibility to instabilities and temperature sensitivity.",

Atomic oxygen, a strong oxidizing agent, is present in low concentrations at such altitudes, and a spacecraft can sweep up considerable volumes of it at orbital velocities of 5 miles/s, especially if mission lifetimes are measured in years or decades. Material loss has been found to be a function of the fluence (the number of oxygen atoms striking a unit area of surface over a given period); fluence is proportional to atmospheric density, orbital velocity, surface attitude relative to velocity vector, and duration of exposure. Atmospheric density depends first on altitude and second on the phase of the 11-year solar activity cycle. Metals, in the experiments, reacted less than nonmetals. Graphs and a table are included, permitting calculation of how far a surface of various organic materials will recede on a spacecraft in low earth orbit. The limited data base on atomic oxygen interactions with materials, using both Shuttle flight experiments and ground-based facilities must be augmented. Space Station design is imminent, and the understanding of such interactions is critical to the success of that design.",

The space station system will comprise a manned base and associated unmanned platforms; while one of the platforms will be in polar orbit, another (or several) platforms will, like the manned base, have an orbital inclination of 28.5 deg. Because it is permanent, the space station will have to be semiautonomous from its mission control center. NASA will take a number of steps to foster the commercial utilization of the space station, and one of the design goals of the project is the definition of astronaut facilities that are very 'customer friendly'. Reliance on a single, program-wide contractor has been deemed undesirable; several major aerospace manufacturers will instead distribute responsibility among themselves for the various modules constituting the craft.",

For large aircraft, current research is concentrated on hybrid LFC concepts which combine suction and pressure-gradient control. At NASA Ames, an F-14 with variable wing sweep has been flight tested with smooth surface gloves on the wings; preliminary results indicate high transition Reynolds numbers to sweep angles as large as 25 deg. In addition, a 757 was flight tested with an NLF glove on the right wing just outboard of the engine pylon; and the LF was found to be suprisingly robust.",

NLF research at NASA concentrates on expanding the practical application of NLF drag reduction technology; payoffs include progress with liquid-crystal flow visualization, NLF on three-dimensional bodies, and the effects of acoustics on laminar stability. Fuel savings from 2 to 4 percent are expected if laminar flow could be achieved over the forward 50 percent of engine nacelles on large transports depending on the configuration. It is concluded that the skill required to use NLF for drag reduction depends on understanding the conservative design corridors within which laminar flow is durable and reliable.",

There are over 7,000 objects making up 2.4 X 10 to the 6th kg of debris in LEO with velocities up to 7 km/sec. The least costly way of minimizing hazards from debris is to make spent rocket stages inert, to preclude failures after their useful life, by insuring that all residual propellants and pressurant gases are vented while the stage is still subject to command. A more costly option is the actively controlled deorbit of spent stages and spacecraft at the end of their useful mission life. The removal of inert stages or spacecraft is too costly to be practical. The least expensive methods of removal are deorbit for altitudes below 25,000 km and placing the object in earth-escape trajectory for objects at higher altitudes. NASA is developing a special radar to measure the existing small-particle debris and its changes over time, and international agreements are expected to set standards of operational practices to minimize debris.",

Another concern is that of management-complexity, which could inflate total costs and substantially counteract the anticipated benefits of spreading program costs among a number of nations. It is presently suggested that these problems can be substantially reduced by having each nation become responsible for one (or more) complete flight system. Each nation's role in mission operations must be clear, and the cleanliness of interfaces among flight systems must carry over into mission operations.",

It has demonstrated a precision of +/- 2.5 m/sec in a swirling jet flow. Low-noise silicon-micromachined microphones developed and incorporated in a novel two-tier, hybrid packaging scheme at the University of Florida used printed circuit board technology to realize a MEMS-based directional acoustic array.

    "abstract": "A relatively new area of interest in aerospace systems survivability is the growing threat of spacecraft penetration by orbital debris. Orbital debris, or space junk, is composed of the man-made remnants of non-functioning spacecraft still orbiting the Earth. NASA estimates that there are currently over 100,000 orbital debris particles 1 centimeter in diameter or larger that cannot be tracked by existing radar, with the population growing at approximately 4% per year in low earth orbits. With an average velocity of over 8.7 km/sec, these projectiles can penetrate and disable many vulnerable spacecraft systems. Since the likelihood of spacecraft penetration increases with spacecraft surface area, large spacecraft (such as the International Space Station) and communication satellite fleets (such as Iridium) have begun to adopt survivability enhancement strategies similar to those employed by combat aircraft. Collision avoidance maneuvers are commonly practiced by the Space Shuttle and are planned by the International Space Station to decrease their susceptibility to impact by trackable orbital debris; likewise, improved shielding, internal equipment placement, and improved crew operations following penetration can reduce the vulnerability of spacecraft to loss following orbital debris impact. Computer simulations such as the Manned Spacecraft and Crew Survivability (MSCSurv) program at the NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center have recently been developed to quantify and reduce the likelihood of crew or spacecraft loss following orbital debris penetration. The AIAA Survivability Technical Committee is working to enable the transfer of military-developed survivability technologies to help the aerospace industry cope with this growing threat.",

Steps which will be taken to endow the computer systems with the ability to move from heuristic reasoning to factual knowledge, i.e., learning from experience, are explored.

The materials to be processed would be at the apex of a convex shield, with the quality of vacuum limited mainly by the backscattering toward the wake surface of atmospheric molecules which have collided with molecules leaving the SURF surface. A stainless steel skin on the SURF, cured in orbit, is proposed as a means to minimize the molecules outgassed from the surface.

The very low structural frequencies typical of very large, radio frequency antenna structures would be especially difficult for a control system to counteract. Vibration control difficulties extend across the frequency spectrum, even to optical and IR reflector systems. Current research and development efforts are characterized with respect to goals and prospects for success.",

NASP will thereby generate technology base data for three distinct types of aircraft: upper-atmosphere hypersonic-cruise aircraft, LEO space transports, and military transatmospheric vehicles. The current concept-validation phase of NASP focuses on airbreathing propulsion, lightweight/high-strength heat-resistant materials, and computational fluid dynamics.",

Attention is given to up to three stages, Mach numbers (sub-, 2, or 3), expendable boosters, drop tanks (DT), and storable (S) or cryogenic fuels. All the concepts feature lifting bodies with circular cross-section and most have a 7 ft diam, 15 ft long payload bay as well as a crew compartment. Expendable elements impose higher costs and in some cases reduce all-azimuth launch capabilities. Single-stage vehicles simplify the logistics whether in H or V configuration. A two-stage H vehicle offers launch offset for the desired orbital plane before firing the rocket engines after take-off and subsonic acceleration. A two-stage fully reusable V form has the second lowest weight of the vehicles studied and an all-azimuth launch capability. Better definition of the prospective mission requirements is needed before choosing among the alternatives.",

Attention is presently given to the experimental and developmental initiatives to be made by a NASA/industry five-year program that began in 1983. Aeroacoustic data acquired from experiments conducted in NASA facilities can be used in the development of empirical noise prediction methods, in the improvement of existing noise prediction methodology, in the evaluation of proposed reduced noise designs, and in the establishment of useful scaling relationships for selected noise-generating mechanisms.",

Plans call for the FTS to assist the astronauts in the assembly, maintenance, servicing, and inspection of Space Station Freedom. The FTS project is driven by five major objectives: to reduce Space Station dependence on crew EVA, improve crew safety, enhance crew utilization, promote remote servicing capabilities for platforms, and accelerate technology transfer from research to U.S. industry. Another part of the FTS project is a ground system that will support operations and system evolution. Not only will the FTS provide a needed operational capability during the assembly and operation of Space Station Freedom, it will also provide an expanding foundation for proving more advanced robotic and telepresence concepts in space.",

The technology objective for data management calls for a fault-tolerant, distributed, expandable and adaptable, as well as repairable and user-friendly, flight data management system that employs state-of-the-art hardware and software. The space station's power system includes the largest element, a 'solar blanket', and the heaviest component, the batteries, of all the subsystems.

ACEE has explored two basic methods for achieving drag-reducing boundary layer laminarization: the use of suction through the wing structure (via slots or perforations) to remove boundary layer turbulence, and the encouragement of natural laminar flow maintenance through refined design practices. Wind tunnel tests have been conducted for wide bodied aircraft equipped with high aspect ratio supercritical wings and winglets. Maneuver load control and pitch-active stability augmentation control systems reduce fuel consumption by reducing the drag associated with high aircraft stability margins. Composite structures yield lighter airframes that in turn call for smaller wing and empennage areas, reducing induced drag for a given payload. In combination, all four areas of development are expected to yield a fuel consumption reduction of 40 percent.",

Both designs have an 1100 n. mi. cross-range capability, with the V-2 orbiter having small wings with winglets for hypersonic trim and the H-2-Sub requiring larger, swept wings. The rockets would be cryogenic, while airbreathing initial boosters would be either turbofans, turbojets and/or ramjets. Dynamic loading is lower in the launch of a V-2. The TPS is a critical factor due to thinner leading edges than on the Shuttle and may require heat-pipe cooling. Airframe structures made of metal matrix composites have passed finite element simulations of projected loads and can now undergo proof-of-concept tests, although whisker-reinforced materials may be superior once long-whisker technology is developed.",

The images, equal in quality to those transmitted from Saturn several years earlier despite the signal being weaker by 6 dB due to the increased distance, were received from Voyager 2 during its January 24, 1986 flyby of Uranus. Solutions to the problem of the weakening signal were found in modifications to Voyager's image processing system and NASA's ground tracking network. In April 1985, Voyager's prime flight data computer was reconfigured to accept only nonimaging science data, and its backup, only imaging data; the latter was reprogrammed to determine only arithmetic differences between adjacent pixel intensities rather than absolute intensities. By image compression, equivalent imaging information could be sent at lower bit rates. Instead of Golay coding, Reed-Solomon onboard encoding was used. These techniques gained the equivalent of 4-dB in imaging yield. Additional improvements were gained by using earth station antennas in pairs (the Parkes radio telescope and the Canberra ground station antenna). Moves under way to prepare for the Voyager encounter with Neptune in 1989 are described (using additional antennas and arrays, scaling up the Deep Space Network antennas from 64 m to 70 m, etc.) to assure almost Saturn-equivalent pictures despite a further 3.5-dB drop in signal strength.",

Although the Venusian surface is changing relatively rapidly by vulcanism and tectonic processes, the Magellan images make it clear that erosion is very slow. It is seen that some of the lava flows are highly fluid, etching narrow channels for hundreds of kilometers through the crust. Magellan also revealed some peculiarly Venusian formations, the tesserated areas where ridges and faults crosshatch the region into large blocks.",

The MSBS holds the model in an arbitrary position in the wind tunnel test section and measures the forces and moments acting on the model. Technologies for building a large MSBS have been developed, and research is being done to reduce building costs. Magnetic suspension is advantageous because it completely eliminates interference from mechanical support systems such as stings or struts and it allows for easy rotation and translation of the model. Advances allowing operation at higher temperatures, probably using liquid nitrogen instead of liquid helium may reduce the cost of MSBS operation. A large MSBS would require power controllers with capacity up to 10 MW, efficiency approaching 98 percent and the ability to reverse the sign of both voltage and current. Technologies include the electro-magnetic position sensor, model positioning sensing, digital controller, and a precalibrated resistance strain-gage balance.",

The flight envelope had been expanded to Mach 1.1 and an altitude of 40,000 ft by December 1985. Notably, the X-29 has provided in-flight data which could not be faithfully depicted in a simulator, e.g., flare procedures during landing, and has shown that the stability adjustments, although adequate for controlling the aircraft, are not rapid enough to offer a satisfactory margin of harmony. The tests are now being performed in the transonic regime, where supercritical airfoil and forward swept wing drag reduction become significant factors.",

    "abstract": "Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid state process that pan be used to join materials without melting. The process was invented by The Welding Institute (TWI), Cambridge, England. Friction stir welding exhibits several advantages over fusion welding in that it produces welds with fewer defects and higher joint efficiency and is capable of joining alloys that are generally considered non-weldable with a fusion weld process. In 1994, NASA-Marshall began collaborating with TWI to transform FSW from a laboratory curiosity to a viable metal joining process suitable for manufacturing hardware. While teamed with TWI, NASA-Marshall began its own FSW research and development effort to investigate possible aerospace applications for the FSW process. The work involved nearly all aspects of FSW development, including process modeling, scale-up issues, applications to advanced materials and development of tooling to use FSW on components of the Space Shuttle with particular emphasis on aluminum tanks. The friction stir welding process involves spinning a pin-tool at an appropriate speed, plunging it into the base metal pieces to be joined, and then translating it along the joint of the work pieces. In aluminum alloys the rotating speed typically ranges from 200 to 400 revolutions per minute and the translation speed is approximately two to five inches per minute. The pin-tool is inserted at a small lead angle from the axis normal to the work piece and requires significant loading along the axis of the tool. An anvil or reaction structure is required behind the welded material to react the load along the axis of the pin tool. The process requires no external heat input, filler material, protective shielding gas or inert atmosphere typical of fusion weld processes. The FSW solid-state weld process has resulted in aluminum welds with significantly higher strengths, higher joint efficiencies and fewer defects than fusion welds used to join similar alloys.",

The aerospike received serious consideration for NASA's current space shuttle, but was eventually rejected in 1969 in favor of high chamber pressure bell engines, in part because of perceived technical risk. The aerospike engine (discussed below) has several performance advantages over conventional bell engines. However, these performance advantages are difficult to validate by ground test. The space shuttle, a multibillion dollar program intended to provide all of NASA's future space lift could not afford the gamble of choosing a potentially superior though unproven aerospike engine over a conventional bell engine. The X-33 demonstrator provides an opportunity to prove the aerospike's performance advantage in flight before commiting to an operational vehicle.",

Subsystems of each of these options are described, and a sketch of a projected SD system is shown. The PV technology is well developed and proven, but its low efficiency calls for solar arrays of large areas, which affect station dynamics, control, and drag compensation. The SD systems would be less costly to operate than VP, and are more efficient, needing less deployed area. The major drawback of the SD is its infancy.

    "abstract": "The next generation launch-on-demand manned orbital vehicles will ideally be able to perform plane change maneuvers for rendezvous. Plane-changes of, e.g., 11 deg, will require a 3000 fps on-orbit maneuver velocity. Any plane-change capabilities beyond 800 fps rapidly increase the necessary vehicle weight. Sensitivity studies of the payload weight/vehicle weight, the presence or absence of air-breathing engines, high acceleration, etc., indicated that advances are required in the payload stowage pallet, thermal protection system, fault detection electronics, line-replaceable units, and accessibility to realize one-day turnaround. The spacecraft would also need autonomous systems checks and launch from minimum support sites reached by air ferry. A horizontal take-off, two-stage subsonic launch vehicle so far offers the lowest weight, maximum flexibility and minimum support combination of all configurations under consideration.",

Mission to Planet Earth is NASA's suggested share and the centerpiece of the U.S. contribution to understanding the environment, the Global Change Research Program. The first major element of the mission would be the Earth Observing System, which would give the simultaneous, comprehensive, long-term earth coverage lacking previously. NASA's Geosynchronous Earth Observatory with two additional similar spacecraft would be orbited by the U.S., plus one each by Japan and the European Space Agency. These would be the first geostationary satellites to span all the disciplines of the earth sciences. A number of diverse data gathering payloads are also planned to be carried aboard the Polar Orbiting Platform. Making possible the long, continuous observations planned and coping with the torrent of data acquired will require technical gains across a wide front. Finally, how all this data is consolidated and disseminated by the EOS Data and Information System is discussed.",

Reliability and cost improvements derive from the design of an engine with fewer components, wider operating margins, conventional materials, and innovative manufacturing techniques; this is exemplified by the STME's combustion chamber, in which the structural jacket and all minifolds are cast as a single piece. 'Platelet' technology is under active consideration as a basis for the nozzle design. The use of hydrostatic bearings in both the turbine and pump ends of the STME turbopump will eliminate bearing-life limitations.",

Current research concentrates on statistical analyses of the burst of neutrinos to determine whether they have mass, and on confirming how stars build in stages from hydrogen, to helium, to neon, to silicon, to iron, and then explode as supernovas. Attempts will also be made to detect a black hole or pulsar at the center of the supernova.",

    "abstract": "In 1971, the U.S. Congress cut off funding for development of supersonic transport aircraft prototypes when it was argued that the pollution created by SSTs could reduce the stratospheric ozone content and increase the incidence of skin cancer. At present, the theory of ozone depletion is in a rather uncertain state. Two examples of this are cited. First, ozone depletion may depend more on the availability of surfaces of aerosols and particles than on the content of chlorine. Second, it has been discovered that NO(x) can tie up active chlorine and thus reduce depletion from that source. We are therefore left with the paradoxical result that under certain circumstances SSTs flying in the lower stratospheric can actually counteract, at least partially, any ozone-depleting effects of CFCs. A recent study by scientists at the Brookhaven National Laboratory showed that melanoma rates would not be affected by changes in the ozone layer. If these results are confirmed, then much of the fear associated with ozone depletion disappears. It is difficult to tell how all this will affect a future supersonic transport program, since it is not clear whether a fleet of SSTs will increase or offset ozone depletion.",

The primary subsystems of a hybrid system consist of the oxidizer tank and feed system, an injector system, a solid fuel grain enclosed in a pressure vessel case, a mixing chamber, and a nozzle. The hybrid rocket has an inert grain, which reduces costs of development, transportation, manufacturing, and launch by avoiding many safety measures that must be taken when operating with solids. Other than their use in launch vehicles, hybrids are excellent for simulating the exhaust of solid rocket motors for material development.",

    "abstract": "There is currently little air traffic, except near major international airports. Ground-supervised aircraft fly along specific routes and, as part of the air traffic management (ATM) process, air traffic controllers at various facilities negotiate with individual pilots on the routes and altitudes to be used. On long-distance flights, as aircraft burn fuel and become lighter, pilots would like to fly at higher altitudes to increase their efficiency. This requires permission from the ATM system, which can be hard due to high-frequency voice communications. Therefore, communications satellites are starting to be used for such exchanges. During the next decade--and certainly by the year 2007, 50 years after the launch of Sputnik 1--the FAA will start relying heavily upon satellites to perform many of the day-to-day communications, navigation, and surveillance activities associated with managing air traffic.",

The observatory will carry into orbit two cameras, a pair of spectrographs, a photometer, and fine guidance sensors optimized for astrometry. The diffraction limit for the 2.4-m aperture of the HST corresponds to 90 percent of the radiation from a point source falling within a circle of 0.1 arcsec angular radius at a wavelength of 633 nm. The 15-year mission will make observations in the ultraviolet as well as the optical spectral region, thus, widening the wavelength window to a range extending from the Lyman alpha wavelengnth of 122 nm to just about 2 microns. The observational program that awaits the HST will include the study of planetary atmospheres, in particular the search for aerosols; the study of globular star clusters within the Galaxy; and the determination of the present rate of expansion of the universe. The HST will achieve resolutions of 0.1 arcsec consistently, regardless of observation duration. The HST engineering challenge is also discussed.",

The space station also imposes unique design conditions on individual subsystems, such as the power distribution and energy storage hardware. In particular, the thermal control subsystem must be designed to meet a variety of mission, payload, and housekeeping tasks that demand a large heat rejection capacity.

Among the major problems being addressed is the mechanism by which magmas are generated, extruded, and intruded, at convergent and divergent plate boundaries and within plates. By contrast to current understanding of rifting, almost nothing is known about how the process of subduction begins. The methods used to measure tectonic plate phenomena are: laser ranging to both the moon and man-made satellites, and VLBI.",

Of some 220,000 active general aviation aircraft in the U.S., 195,000 are piston engine powered single- or twin-engine aircraft, that conflict with the large high-speed commercial jet transports throughout the operating spectrum. The access to airport conflict shows that the limiting factor is not airspace or airport size, but rather airway structures and airport systems that have failed to keep pace with demand. Design and development of an aircraft that can routinely fly a 150 mph approach, achieve rapid but controlled deceleration to touchdown speed, and turn off at an early exit is required. GPS satellites could provide precision approach capability to all airports and runways for commercial and general aviation aircraft.",

The active control portion of the program investigated Wing Load Alleviation (WLA) through the use of active controls, drag reduction, and the effect of active pitch controls on fuel consumption. It was found that applying active control functions at the beginning of the aircraft design cycle brings the best benefit, and that if active control and advanced aerodynamic airframe configurations are applied to transport aircraft design concurrently with new lightweight materials, fuel consumption can be reduced by as much as 40 percent.",
