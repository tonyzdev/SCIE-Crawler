The effectiveness of the changes being called for, employment of student-centered, active learning pedagogy, is now well supported by evidence. The relevant data have come from a number of different disciplines that include the learning sciences, cognitive psychology, and educational psychology. There is a growing body of research within specific scientific teaching communities that supports and validates the new approaches to teaching that have been adopted. These data are reviewed, and their applicability to physiology education is discussed. Some of the inherent limitations of research about teaching and learning are also discussed.",

It is strongly induced by cold exposure, linking this environmental stimulus to adaptive thermogenesis. PGC-1alpha stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and promotes the remodeling of muscle tissue to a fiber-type composition that is metabolically more oxidative and less glycolytic in nature, and it participates in the regulation of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It is highly likely that PGC-1alpha is intimately involved in disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiomyopathy. In particular, its regulatory function in lipid metabolism makes it an inviting target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of obesity and Type 2 diabetes.",

As a research tool, a major application of this technology is the rapid and accurate assessment of changes in gene expression as a result of physiology, pathophysiology, or development. This method can be applied to model systems to measure responses to experimental stimuli and to gain insight into potential changes in protein level and function. Thus physiology can be correlated with molecular events to gain a better understanding of biological processes. For clinical molecular diagnostics, real-time PCR can be used to measure viral or bacterial loads or evaluate cancer status. Here, we discuss the basic concepts, chemistries, and instrumentation of real-time PCR and include present applications and future perspectives for this technology in biomedical sciences and in life science education.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a traditional lecture-based curriculum versus a modified \"flipped classroom\" curriculum of cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal physiology delivered to first-year graduate students. Students in both courses were provided the same notes and recorded lectures. Students in the modified flipped classroom were required to watch the prerecorded lectures before class and then attend class, where they received a quiz or homework covering material in each lecture (valued at 25% of the final grade) followed by a question and answer/problem-solving period. In the traditional curriculum, attending lectures was optional and there were no quizzes. Evaluation of effectiveness and student performance was achieved by having students in both courses take the same multiple-choice exams. Within a comparable group of graduate students, participants in the flipped course scored significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) on the cardiovascular, respiratory, and weighted cumulative sections by an average of >12 percentage points. Exam averages for students in the flipped course also tended to be higher on the renal section by ∼11 percentage points (P = 0.06). Based on our experience and responses obtained in blinded student surveys, we propose that the use of homework and in-class quizzes were critical motivating factors that likely contributed to the increase in student exam performance. Taken together, our findings support that the flipped classroom model is a highly effective means in which to disseminate key physiological concepts to graduate students.",

Humans normally maintain a body temperature at 37°C, and maintenance of this relatively high temperature is critical to human survival. This concept is so important that control of thermoregulation is often the principal example cited when teaching physiological homeostasis. A basic understanding of the processes underpinning temperature regulation is necessary for all undergraduate students studying biology and biology-related disciplines, and a thorough understanding is necessary for those students in clinical training. Our aim in this review is to broadly present the thermoregulatory process taking into account current advances in this area. First, we summarize the basic concepts of thermoregulation and subsequently assess the physiological responses to heat and cold stress, including vasodilation and vasoconstriction, sweating, nonshivering thermogenesis, piloerection, shivering, and altered behavior. Current research is presented concerning the body's detection of thermal challenge, peripheral and central thermoregulatory control mechanisms, including brown adipose tissue in adult humans and temperature transduction by the relatively recently discovered transient receptor potential channels. Finally, we present an updated understanding of the neuroanatomic circuitry supporting thermoregulation.",

Smooth muscle lacks the striations characteristic of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Layers of smooth muscle cells line the walls of various organs and tubes in the body, and the contractile function of smooth muscle is not under voluntary control. Contractile activity in smooth muscle is initiated by a Ca 2+ -calmodulin interaction to stimulate phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin. Ca 2+ sensitization of the contractile proteins is signaled by the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway to inhibit the dephosphorylation of the light chain by myosin phosphatase, thereby maintaining force generation. Removal of Ca 2+ from the cytosol and stimulation of myosin phosphatase initiate the process of smooth muscle relaxation.",

Indeed, several institutions have reduced their lectures to 15 min in length based upon the \"common knowledge\" and \"consensus\" that there is a decline in students' attention 10-15 min into lectures. A review of the literature on this topic reveals many discussions referring to prior studies but scant few primary investigations. Alarmingly, the most often cited source for a rapid decline in student attention during a lecture barely discusses student attention at all. Of the studies that do attempt to measure attention, many suffer from methodological flaws and subjectivity in data collection. Thus, the available primary data do not support the concept of a 10- to 15-min attention limit. Interestingly, the most consistent finding from a literature review is that the greatest variability in student attention arises from differences between teachers and not from the teaching format itself. Certainly, even the most interesting material can be presented in a dull and dry fashion, and it is the job of the instructor to enhance their teaching skills to provide not only rich content but also a satisfying lecture experience for the students.",

These preferences can be assessed using the VARK questionnaire. We administered the VARK questionnaire to undergraduate physiology majors enrolled in a capstone physiology laboratory at Michigan State University; 48 of the 86 students (55.8%) who returned the completed questionnaire voluntarily offered gender information. The responses were tallied and assessed for gender difference in learning style preference; 54.2% of females and only 12.5% of males preferred a single mode of information presentation. Among the female students, 4.2% of the students preferred V, 0% of the students preferred A, 16.7% of the students preferred printed words (R), and 33.3% of the students preferred using all their senses (K). In contrast, male students were evenly distributed in preference, with 4.2% of the students preferring A, R, or K, respectively, while 0% of the students preferred V. Furthermore, 45.8% of female and 87.5% of male respondents preferred multiple modes [female: 2 modes (12.5%), 3 modes (12.5%), and 4 modes (20.8%); males: 2 modes (16.7%), 3 modes (12.5%), and 4 modes (58.3%)] of presentation. In summary, a majority of male students preferred multimodal instruction, specifically, four modes (VARK), whereas a majority of female students preferred single-mode instruction with a preference toward K. Thus, male and female students have significantly different learning styles. It is the responsibility of the instructor to address this diversity of learning styles and develop appropriate learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "The approach that most animal cells employ to regulate intracellular pH (pH(i)) is not too different conceptually from the way a sophisticated system might regulate the temperature of a house. Just as the heat capacity (C) of a house minimizes sudden temperature (T) shifts caused by acute cold and heat loads, the buffering power (beta) of a cell minimizes sudden pH(i) shifts caused by acute acid and alkali loads. However, increasing C (or beta) only minimizes T (or pH(i)) changes; it does not eliminate the changes, return T (or pH(i)) to normal, or shift steady-state T (or pH(i)). Whereas a house may have a furnace to raise T, a cell generally has more than one acid-extruding transporter (which exports acid and/or imports alkali) to raise pH(i). Whereas an air conditioner lowers T, a cell generally has more than one acid-loading transporter to lower pH(i). Just as a house might respond to graded decreases (or increases) in T by producing graded increases in heat (or cold) output, cells respond to graded decreases (or increases) in pH(i) with graded increases (or decreases) in acid-extrusion (or acid-loading) rate. Steady-state T (or pH(i)) can change only in response to a change in chronic cold (or acid) loading or chronic heat (or alkali) loading as produced, for example, by a change in environmental T (or pH) or a change in the kinetics of the furnace (or acid extrudes) or air conditioner (or acid loaders). Finally, just as a temperature-control system might benefit from environmental sensors that provide clues about cold and heat loading, at least some cells seem to have extracellular CO(2) or extracellular HCO(3)(-) sensors that modulate acid-base transport.",

    "abstract": "The curriculum is packed with so much content that teachers resort to telling students what they know and students simply commit facts to memory. The packed curriculum leaves little time for students to acquire a deep understanding of the subject or to develop life-long skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, and communication. However, learning is not committing a set of facts to memory, but the ability to use resources to find, evaluate, and apply information. This paper addresses these concerns by discussing \"how we learn\" and reviewing the literature on what works to improve learning. It is clear that active processing of information, not passive reception of information, leads to learning. That is, students must construct their own understanding of concepts, relationships, and procedures. Teachers can encourage this process by carefully considering the type and organization of information as well as instructional strategies. Specifically, teachers should reduce the total amount of factual information students are expected to memorize, reduce our use of the passive lecture format, and devote much more effort to helping students become active, independent learners and problem solvers. Collaborative learning activities, interactive models, educational games, and establishing a culture of inquiry/scholarship are critical for achieving these goals.",

While most people simply assume that their GI tract will work properly to use nutrients, provide energy, and release wastes, few nonscientists know the details about how various nutrients are digested and how the breakdown products traverse the cells lining the small intestine to reach the blood stream and to be used by the other cells of the body. There have been several recent discoveries of new transporters that likely contribute to the absorption of oligopeptides and fatty acids. In addition, details are being clarified about how transporters work and in what forms nutrients can be absorbed. The enzymes that digest basic carbohydrates, proteins, and fats have been identified in various segments of the GI tract, and details are becoming clearer about what types of bonds they hydrolyze. Usually, detailed information about the digestion of basic nutrients is presented and learned in biochemistry courses and detailed information about absorption via transepithelial transport of the breakdown products of digestion is studied in physiology courses. The goal of this Staying Current article is to combine the details of the biochemistry of digestion with the updated information about the physiology of nutrient absorption into one source for teachers of physiology. Insights are included about some of the diseases and conditions that can bring about malabsorption of food in the GI tract and their consequences.",

With the percentage of the population over 65 yr of age expanding, managing the health and independence of this population is an ongoing concern. Advancing age is associated with a decrease in cognitive function that ultimately affects quality of life. Understanding potential adverse effects of aging on brain blood flow and cognition may help to determine effective strategies to mitigate these effects on the population. Exercise may be one strategy to prevent or delay cognitive decline. This review describes how aging is associated with cardiovascular disease risks, vascular dysfunction, and increasing Alzheimer's disease pathology. It will also discuss the possible effects of aging on cerebral vascular physiology, cerebral perfusion, and brain atrophy rates. Clinically, these changes will present as reduced cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and the onset of dementia. Regular exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function, and we hypothesize that this occurs through beneficial adaptations in vascular physiology and improved neurovascular coupling. This review highlights the potential interactions and ideas of how the age-associated variables may affect cognition and may be moderated by regular exercise.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis is a core concept necessary for understanding the many regulatory mechanisms in physiology. Claude Bernard originally proposed the concept of the constancy of the “milieu interieur,” but his discussion was rather abstract. Walter Cannon introduced the term “homeostasis” and expanded Bernard's notion of “constancy” of the internal environment in an explicit and concrete way. In the 1960s, homeostatic regulatory mechanisms in physiology began to be described as discrete processes following the application of engineering control system analysis to physiological systems. Unfortunately, many undergraduate texts continue to highlight abstract aspects of the concept rather than emphasizing a general model that can be specifically and comprehensively applied to all homeostatic mechanisms. As a result, students and instructors alike often fail to develop a clear, concise model with which to think about such systems. In this article, we present a standard model for homeostatic mechanisms to be used at the undergraduate level. We discuss common sources of confusion (“sticky points”) that arise from inconsistencies in vocabulary and illustrations found in popular undergraduate texts. Finally, we propose a simplified model and vocabulary set for helping undergraduate students build effective mental models of homeostatic regulation in physiological systems.",

Such cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms do not operate in isolation but are closely coordinated with respiratory and other regulatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. The brain regulates the cardiovascular system by two general means: 1) feedforward regulation, often referred to as \"central command,\" and 2) feedback or reflex regulation. In most situations (e.g., during exercise, defensive behavior, sleep, etc.), both of these general mechanisms contribute to overall cardiovascular homeostasis. The review first describes the mechanisms and central circuitry subserving the baroreceptor, chemoreceptor, and other reflexes that work together to regulate an appropriate level of blood pressure and blood oxygenation and then considers the brain mechanisms that defend the body against more complex environmental challenges, using dehydration and cold and heat stress as examples. The last section of the review considers the central mechanisms regulating cardiovascular function associated with different behaviors, with a specific focus on defensive behavior and exercise.",

This approach repurposes class time to focus on application and discussion; the acquisition of basic concepts and principles is done on the students' own time before class. While current flipped classroom research has focused on student preferences and comparative learning outcomes, there remains a lack of understanding regarding its impact on students' approaches to learning. Focusing on a new flipped classroom-based course for basic medical sciences students, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate students' adjustments to the flipped classroom, their time on task compared with traditional lectures, and their deep and active learning strategies. Students in this course worked through interactive online learning modules before in-class sessions. Class time focused on knowledge application of online learning module content through active learning methods. Students completed surveys and optional prequiz questions throughout the term to provide data regarding their learning approaches. Our results showed that the majority of students completed their prework in one sitting just before class. Students reported performing less multitasking behavior in the flipped classroom compared with lecture-based courses. Students valued opportunities for peer-peer and peer-instructor interactions and also valued having multiple modes of assessment. Overall, this work suggests that there is the potential for greater educational gains from the flipped classroom than the modest improvements in grades previously demonstrated in the literature; in this implementation of the flipped classroom, students reported that they developed independent learning strategies, spent more time on task, and engaged in deep and active learning.",

    "abstract": "Total body potassium content and proper distribution of potassium across the cell membrane is of critical importance for normal cellular function. Potassium homeostasis is maintained by several different methods. In the kidney, total body potassium content is achieved by alterations in renal excretion of potassium in response to variations in intake. Insulin and beta-adrenergic tone play critical roles in maintaining the internal distribution of potassium under normal conditions. Despite homeostatic pathways designed to maintain potassium levels within the normal range, disorders of altered potassium homeostasis are common. The clinical approach to designing effective treatments relies on understanding the pathophysiology and regulatory influences which govern the internal distribution and external balance of potassium. Here we provide an overview of the key regulatory aspects of normal potassium physiology. This review is designed to provide an overview of potassium homeostasis as well as provide references of seminal papers to guide the reader into a more in depth discussion of the importance of potassium balance. This review is designed to be a resource for educators and well-informed clinicians who are teaching trainees about the importance of potassium balance.",

    "abstract": "Faculty dissatisfaction with diminishing levels of student engagement in lifestyle medicine sessions prompted this exploratory project that compared differences in students’ substantive engagement in medical preclinical and clinical level lifestyle medicine sessions. The preclinical and clinical level sessions had the same learning objectives and learning tasks, properly aligned with that level of student learning, but were offered in different learning formats, either traditional classroom approaches or technology-enhanced approaches. At the preclinical level, we transferred a nonmandatory, face-to-face session to a nonmandatory, fully online session. At the clinical level, we introduced two novel technology tools. We utilized Zoom technologies, which afforded students the ability to access the session from anywhere, and employed Hickey’s use of “promoting” student submissions as one method for increasing student-student interaction during the synchronous session. We used indicators of behavioral engagement of Henrie et al. (Henrie CR, Halverson LR, Graham CR. Comput Educ 90: 36–53, 2015) as the framework for determining applicable engagement behaviors, including attendance, assignment completion, interactions (responding/feedback/endorsements), and the quality of (and faculty satisfaction with) the face-to-face and/or online interactions. We expected to observe higher levels of engagement behaviors in the technology-enhanced approach and found that to be the case at both the preclinical and clinical levels, in both mandatory/nonmandatory and synchronous/asynchronous formats. However, it was the increase in both the level and substance of the students’ interactions in the technology-enhanced sessions that provided surprising results. A review of the sessions with enhanced engagement highlight the role of student autonomy, a construct with strongly established associations to student motivation and engagement.",

This research compared the performances of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic), GPT-3.5, GPT-4-1106 (OpenAI), Copilot free version (Microsoft), and Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google) versus students on MCQs from the medical neuroscience course database to evaluate chatbots reliability. 5 successive attempts of each chatbot to answer 200 USMLE-style questions were evaluated based on accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness. MCQs were categorized into 12 categories/topics. The results indicated that at the current level of development, selected AI-driven chatbots, on average, can accurately answer 67.2% of MCQs from the medical neuroscience course, which is 7.4% below the students' average. However, Claude and GPT-4 outperformed other chatbots with 83% and 81.7% correct answers, which is better than the average student result. They followed by Copilot - 59.5%, GPT-3.5 - 58.3%, and Gemini - 53.6%. Concerning different categories, Neurocytology, Embryology, and Diencephalon were the three best topics, with average results of 78.1% - 86.7%, and the lowest results were Brainstem, Special senses, and Cerebellum, with 54.4% - 57.7% correct answers. Our study suggested that Claude and GPT-4 are currently two of the most evolved chatbots. They exhibit proficiency in answering MCQs related to neuroscience that surpasses that of the average medical student. This breakthrough indicates a significant milestone in how AI can supplement and enhance educational tools and techniques.",

We focused on encouraging students' active learning in lectures, whereas previous studies have made more use of audience response technology during lectures for formative or summative assessment. Students voluntarily answered questions posed during lectures with their personal response system (clickers), with individual answers automatically collated for immediate histogram display. This feedback then dictated the focus of followup discussions in the lecture. Student and instructor attitudes were surveyed through voluntary interviews with student responses correlated with their degree of clicker participation and individual exam results. Active lectures were found to increase both student motivation and engagement. Students who participated in answering questions achieved better results than students who chose not to. Students with the lowest scores in a prerequisite course (previous semester physiology exam marks of &lt; 60%) showed significantly better outcomes from the use of clickers than both middle-achieving (60-75%) and high-achieving (&gt;75%) entry students. Significant improvement was evident in both mid- and end-semester exam results compared with student cohorts from preceding years, although this could also be influenced by many other factors. Increased student engagement and the immediate feedback obtained during lectures were advantages commonly noted by lecturing staff.",

A blended (hybrid) course combines traditional face-to-face and WBL approaches in an educational environment that is nonspecific as to time and place. To provide educational services for an undergraduate second-year elective course in acid-base physiology, a rich, student-centered educational Web-environment designed to support PBL was created by using Web Course Tools courseware. The course is designed to require students to work in small collaborative groups using problem solving activities to develop topic understanding. The aim of the study was to identify the impact of the blended WBL-PBL-collaborative learning environment on student learning outcomes. Student test scores and satisfaction survey results from a blended WBL-PBL-based test group (n = 37) were compared with a control group whose instructional opportunities were from a traditional in-class PBL model (n = 84). WBL students scored significantly (t = 3.3952; P = 0.0009) better on the final acid-base physiology examination and expressed a positive attitude to the new learning environment in the satisfaction survey. Expressed in terms of a difference effect, the mean of the treated group (WBL) is at the 76th percentile of the untreated (face-to-face) group, which stands for a \"medium\" effect size. Thus student progress in the blended WBL-PBL collaborative environment was positively affected by the use of technology.",

We borrowed concepts from Benson and Mazur and applied these concepts to enhance student involvement during the respiratory component of the medical physiology class. The medical physiology class consisted of 256 first-year medical students. The peer-instruction technique was used for 10 classes. Each class of 50 min was divided into three or four short presentations of 12-20 min. Each presentation was followed by a one-question, multiple-choice quiz on the subject discussed. Questions ranged from simple recall to those testing complex intellectual activities. Students were given 1 min to think and to record their first answer. Subsequently, students were allowed 1 min to discuss their answers with their classmates and possibly correct their first response. The percentage of correct answers increased significantly (P < 0.05) after discussion for both recall and intellectual questions. These data demonstrate that pausing three to four times during a 50-min class to allow discussion of concepts enhanced the students level of understanding and ability to synthesize and integrate material.",

A randomized crossover design in which students either answered questions individually or during peer instruction was used to control for time and order effects.

Immediately after completing the exam as individuals, students from group A answered a randomly selected subset of questions from exam 1 in groups of two (1 group had 3 students) to test the effectiveness of collaborative-group testing on test performance and level of student retention. On the next exam ( exam 2, 4 wk later), students from both groups answered questions in the traditional format as individuals and responded to the same subset of questions from exam 1. The subset of questions was analyzed to determine the level of retention of the original test material. In addition, immediately after completing the exam as individuals, students from group B answered a randomly selected subset of questions from exam 2 in groups of two (1 group had 3 students). Finally, on the next exam ( exam 3, 4 wk later), students from both groups answered questions in the traditional format as individuals and responded to the same subset of questions from exam 2. This protocol followed a randomized crossover design to control for time and order effects. Student retention of course content was reduced when students completed the original examinations individually. In sharp contrast, student retention was improved ( P &lt; 0.05) when students completed the original examinations in groups. Results suggest that collaborative testing is an effective strategy to enhance learning and increase student retention of course content.",

Sixty-three physiology teachers responded to the 18-question survey; 35 of the respondents also responded to a request for written comments about this issue prior to taking the survey. Three categories of possible factors contributing to physiology being hard to learn were defined: 1) the nature of the discipline, 2) the way it is taught, and 3) what students bring to the task of learning physiology. Respondents thought that characteristics of the discipline (it requires causal reasoning, it uses graphs and mathematics, and it is highly integrative) and characteristics of students (they believe that learning and memorizing are the same thing, they cannot or will do attempt to integrate, and they compartmentalize) were significantly more important than any aspect of teaching in making physiology hard to learn. Recommendations are offered in this article to help students deal with the sources of difficulty that were identified.",

The aims of the study were to investigate if participation in formative assessment was associated with improved course outcomes, if offering incentives for completing quizzes affected student participation, and if quiz performance was predictive of summative examination outcomes. Results showed that students who elected to use online quizzes performed better in summative examinations. Offering course credit of between 0.5% and 2% per quiz increased student participation. However, evidence was found for widespread inappropriate use of unsupervised online quizzes when incentives for participation were applied. Predictive validity of online quizzes could be demonstrated when comparing the first of several quiz attempts with subsequent summative examination scores.",

This technique usually involves learning in small groups, which are supervised by tutors. It is becoming evident that PBL in a small-group setting has a robust positive effect on student learning and skills, including better problem-solving skills and an increase in overall motivation. However, very little research has been done on the educational benefits of PBL in a large classroom setting. Here, we describe a PBL approach (using tutorless groups) that was introduced as a supplement to standard didactic lectures in University of British Columbia Okanagan undergraduate biochemistry classes consisting of 45–85 students. PBL was chosen as an effective method to assist students in learning biochemical and physiological processes. By monitoring student attendance and using informal and formal surveys, we demonstrated that PBL has a significant positive impact on student motivation to attend and participate in the course work. Student responses indicated that PBL is superior to traditional lecture format with regard to the understanding of course content and retention of information. We also demonstrated that student problem-solving skills are significantly improved, but additional controlled studies are needed to determine how much PBL exercises contribute to this improvement. These preliminary data indicated several positive outcomes of using PBL in a large classroom setting, although further studies aimed at assessing student learning are needed to further justify implementation of this technique in courses delivered to large undergraduate classes.",

    "abstract": "While hypertension has predominantly been attributed to perturbations of the vasculature, kidney, and central nervous system, research for almost 50 yr has shown that the immune system also contributes to this disease. Inflammatory cells accumulate in the kidneys and vasculature of humans and experimental animals with hypertension and likely contribute to end-organ damage. We and others have shown that mice lacking adaptive immune cells, including recombinase-activating gene-deficient mice and rats and mice with severe combined immunodeficiency have blunted hypertension to stimuli such as ANG II, high salt, and norepinephrine. Adoptive transfer of T cells restores the blood pressure response to these stimuli. Agonistic antibodies to the ANG II receptor, produced by B cells, contribute to hypertension in experimental models of preeclampsia. The central nervous system seems important in immune cell activation, because lesions in the anteroventral third ventricle block hypertension and T cell activation in response to ANG II. Likewise, genetic manipulation of reactive oxygen species in the subfornical organ modulates both hypertension and immune cell activation. Current evidence indicates that the production of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-17, and interleukin-6, contribute to hypertension, likely via effects on both the kidney and vasculature. In addition, the innate immune system also appears to contribute to hypertension. We propose a working hypothesis linking the sympathetic nervous system, immune cells, production of cytokines, and, ultimately, vascular and renal dysfunction, leading to the augmentation of hypertension. Studies of immune cell activation will clearly be useful in understanding this common yet complex disease.",

Thus, attempts to teach students all that they will need to know is futile. Rather, it is important that students develop an interest and love for lifelong learning. Inspiring and motivating students is critical because unless students are inspired and motivated our efforts are pointless. Once students are inspired and motivated, there are countless resources available to learn more about a subject. Thus, teachers must abandon the mistaken notion that unless they \"cover the content\" students will be unprepared for the future and they will have failed as teachers. Teachers must not worry about \"losing\" or \"wasting\" valuable lecture time for in-class discussion, collaborative problem-solving, and inquiry-based activities that take time away from covering content. Rather than worrying about covering content, teachers must design activities to focus student learning on how to use scientific knowledge to solve important questions. This is important because learning is not committing a set of facts to memory but the ability to use resources to find, evaluate, and use information. In fact, memorizing anything discourages deep thinking. Deep thinking is essential because understanding is the residue of thinking! To encourage thinking we must create a joy, an excitement, and a love for learning. We must make learning fun; because if we are successful, our students will be impatient to run home, study, and contemplate-to really learn.",

The goal of this study was to compare the perceptions of active learning between students who were exposed to active learning in the classroom (n = 116) and professional-level physiology faculty members (n = 9). Faculty members reported a heavy reliance on lectures and minimal use of educational games and activities, whereas students indicated that they learned best via the activities. A majority of faculty members (89%) had observed active learning in the classroom and predicted favorable effects of the method on student performance and motivation. The main reported barriers by faculty members to the adoption of active learning were a lack of necessary class time, a high comfort level with traditional lectures, and insufficient time to develop materials. Students hypothesized similar obstacles for faculty members but also associated many negative qualities with the traditional lecturers. Despite these barriers, a majority of faculty members (78%) were interested in learning more about the alternative teaching strategy. Both faculty members and students indicated that active learning should occupy portions (29% vs. 40%) of face-to-face class time.",

While many studies have shown positive effects when engaging lectures are used in undergraduate settings, the literature surrounding use of the learning technique for professional students is inconclusive. The novelty of this study design allowed a direct comparison of engaging physiology lectures versus didactic lecture formats in the same cohort of 120 first-year School of Dentistry DMD students. All students were taught five physiological systems using traditional lecture methods and six physiological systems using engaging lecture methods. The use of engaging lectures led to a statistically significant higher average on unit exams compared with traditional didactic lectures (8.6% higher, P < 0.05). Furthermore, students demonstrated an improved long-term retention of information via higher scores on the comprehensive final exam (22.9% higher in engaging lecture sections, P < 0.05). Many qualitative improvements were also indicated via student surveys and evaluations, including an increased perceived effectiveness of lectures, decrease in distractions during lecture, and increased confidence with the material. The development of engaging lecture activities requires a significant amount of instructor preparation and limits the time available to provide traditional lectures. However, the positive results of this study suggest the need for a restructuring of the physiology curriculum to incorporate more engaging lectures to improve both the qualitative experiences and performance levels of professional students.",

In each situation, we want to control for differences in the denominator when the thing we really care about is the numerator. But there is peril lurking in a ratio: only if the relationship between numerator and denominator is a straight line through the origin will the ratio be meaningful. If not, the ratio will misrepresent the true relationship between numerator and denominator.

These emotions form a set of basic, evolved functions that are shared by all humans. Laughter is part of a universal language of basic emotions that all humans recognize. Health care providers and educators may utilize the power of laughter to improve health and enhance teaching and learning. This is an important consideration because teaching is not just about content: it is also about forming relationships and strengthening human connections. In this context, when used effectively, humor is documented to build relationships and enhance performance. Specifically, humor improves student performance by attracting and sustaining attention, reducing anxiety, enhancing participation, and increasing motivation. Moreover, humor stimulates multiple physiological systems that decrease levels of stress hormones, such as cortisol and epinephrine, and increase the activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system. To achieve these benefits, it is important to use humor that is relevant to the course content and not disparaging toward others. Self-effacing humor illustrates to students that the teacher is comfortable making mistakes and sharing these experiences with the classroom. In this brief review, we discuss the history and relationship between humor, laughing, learning, and health with an emphasis on the powerful, universal language of laughter.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the learning styles of our medical students and investigate the relation of learning styles with each of satisfaction with different instruction methods and academic achievement in them. This study was carried out with the participation of 170 first-year medical students (the participation rate was 91.4%). The researchers prepared sociodemographic and satisfaction questionnaires to determine the characteristics of the participants and their satisfaction levels with traditional training and PBL. The Kolb learning styles inventory was used to explore the learning styles of the study group. The participants completed all forms at the end of the first year of medical education. Indicators of academic achievement were scores of five theoretical block exams and five PBL exams performed throughout the academic year of 2008-2009. The majority of the participants took part in the \"diverging\" (n = 84, 47.7%) and \"assimilating\" (n = 73, 41.5%) groups. Numbers of students in the \"converging\" and \"accommodating\" groups were 11 (6.3%) and 8 (4.5%), respectively. In all learning style groups, PBL satisfaction scores were significantly higher than those of traditional training. Exam scores for \"PBL and traditional training\" did not differ among the four learning styles. In logistic regression analysis, learning style (assimilating) predicted student satisfaction with traditional training and success in theoretical block exams. Nothing predicted PBL satisfaction and success. This is the first study conducted among medical students evaluating the relation of learning style with student satisfaction and academic achievement. More research with larger groups is needed to generalize our results. Some learning styles may relate to satisfaction with and achievement in some instruction methods.",

The purpose of the study was to determine if the use of the online quizzes was associated with improvements in summative exam scores and if the online quizzes were valid predictors of summative exam performance. A retrospective analysis was performed on the course scores from three different groups of Exercise Physiology students. Students in group 1 completed the original version of the course, those in group 2 completed an updated version of the course that included more rigorous exam questions, and those in group 3 completed the same updated version of the course but with the addition of 10 required online quizzes. Results showed that the overall mean summative exam score from group 3 was significantly higher than that from group 2 (81.79 +/- 8.26 and 78.72 +/- 9.61, respectively). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.50) was also found between individual mean online quiz scores and individual mean exam scores for those students in group 3. It was concluded that the formative online quizzes did enhance summative exam performance and that the online quizzes were valid predictors of exam performance.",

    "abstract": "Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This thirteenth installment of Explorations in Statistics explores the log transformation, an established technique that rescales the actual observations from an experiment so that the assumptions of some statistical analysis are better met. A general assumption in statistics is that the variability of some response Y is homogeneous across groups or across some predictor variable X. If the variability-the standard deviation-varies in rough proportion to the mean value of Y, a log transformation can equalize the standard deviations. Moreover, if the actual observations from an experiment conform to a skewed distribution, then a log transformation can make the theoretical distribution of the sample mean more consistent with a normal distribution. This is important: the results of a one-sample t test are meaningful only if the theoretical distribution of the sample mean is roughly normal. If we log-transform our observations, then we want to confirm the transformation was useful. We can do this if we use the Box-Cox method, if we bootstrap the sample mean and the statistic t itself, and if we assess the residual plots from the statistical model of the actual and transformed sample observations.",

The aim is to understand the preferred sensory modality (or modalities) of students for learning. Teachers can use this knowledge to facilitate student learning. Moreover, students themselves can use this knowledge to change their learning habits. Five hundred undergraduate students belonging to two consecutive batches in their second year of undergraduate medical training were invited to participate in the exercise. Consenting students (415 students, 83%) were administered a printed form of version 7.0 of the VARK questionnaire. Besides the questionnaire, we also collected demographic data, academic performance data (marks obtained in 10th and 12th grades and last university examination), and self-perceived learning style preferences. The majority of students in our study had multiple learning preferences (68.7%). The predominant sensory modality of learning was aural (45.5%) and kinesthetic (33.1%). The learning style preference was not influenced by either sex or previous academic performance. Although we use a combination of teaching methods, there has not been an active effort to determine whether these adequately address the different types of learners. We hope these data will help us better our course contents and make learning a more fruitful experience.",

One such classification scheme uses the VARK instrument, which categorizes learning preferences as visual (V), auditory (A), reading-writing (R), or kinesthetic (K). Many students have a single, strong preferences (“unimodal”), whereas others have multiple (“multimodal”) learning preferences. Although limited in scope and reliability, knowledge of student learning preferences is important for reasons of pedagogy. Teaching and student learning styles may also affect student academic success in science coursework and fulfillment of student career goals. In our study, we determined the learning preferences of upper-division students in a human physiology course during a 2-yr period at a public undergraduate institution in California. We also sought to determine the association between individual learning styles and stated career intentions. We found that the majority of students interested in the health professions have multimodal learning preferences. Furthermore, a greater percentage of premedical students had multimodal preferences compared with predental and prescientist students. When data were compared by gender, we found that more female than male students had multimodal learning preferences. We also observed some gender differences when separating student groups by career choice. For example, more premedical men had multimodal preferences compared with nonpremedical men. In contrast to men, women showed little differences in their learning style profiles whether premedical or not and also self-predicted their learning preferences more accurately. Thus, career choice may be an important consideration in determining whether or not there are gender differences among students.",

Advancing age is the major risk factor for CVD, primarily due to stiffening of the large elastic arteries and the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction. In contrast, regular aerobic exercise protects against the development of large elastic artery stiffness and vascular endothelial dysfunction with advancing age. Moreover, aerobic exercise interventions reduce arterial stiffness and restore vascular endothelial function in previously sedentary middle-aged/older adults. Aerobic exercise exerts its beneficial effects on arterial function by modulating structural proteins, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, and restoring nitric oxide bioavailability. Aerobic exercise may also promote \"resistance\" against factors that reduce vascular function and increase CVD risk with age. Preventing excessive increases in abdominal adiposity, following healthy dietary practices, maintaining a low CVD risk factor profile, and, possibly, selective use of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals also play a major role in preserving vascular function with aging.",

We offered the course for three consecutive years and evaluated its impact on student perception and confidence using a combination of pre- and postcourse survey questions and coded open-ended responses. Students showed gains in both the perception of their understanding of primary scientific papers and of their abilities to communicate science to scientific and layperson audiences. These results indicate that this unique format can teach both communication skills and basic science to undergraduate biology students.

    "abstract": "Academic self-concept is one’s perception of his or her ability in an academic domain and is formed by comparing oneself to other students. As college biology classrooms transition from lecturing to active learning, students interact more with each other and are likely comparing themselves more to other students in the class. Student characteristics can impact students’ academic self-concept; however, this has been unexplored in the context of undergraduate biology. In this study, we explored whether student characteristics can affect academic self-concept in the context of an active learning college physiology course. Using a survey, students self-reported how smart they perceived themselves to be in the context of physiology relative to the whole class and relative to their groupmate, the student with whom they worked most closely in class. Using linear regression, we found that men and native English speakers had significantly higher academic self-concept relative to the whole class compared with women and nonnative English speakers. Using logistic regression, we found that men had significantly higher academic self-concept relative to their groupmate compared with women. Using constant comparison methods, we identified nine factors that students reported influenced how they determined whether they were more or less smart than their groupmate. Finally, we found that students were more likely to report participating more than their groupmate if they had a higher academic self-concept. These findings suggest that student characteristics can influence students’ academic self-concept, which in turn may influence their participation in small-group discussion and their academic achievement in active learning classes.",

This teaching review is written at a level appropriate for first- and second-year medical students. Specific concepts discussed include ion equilibrium potentials, electrochemical forces driving ion movements across membranes, the role of ion channels in determining membrane resting potentials and action potentials, and the conduction of action potentials within the heart.

    "abstract": "An understanding of the complexity of the cardiovascular system is incomplete without a knowledge of the venous system. It is important for students to understand that, in a closed system, like the circulatory system, changes to the venous side of the circulation have a knock-on effect on heart function and the arterial system and vice versa. Veins are capacitance vessels feeding blood to the right side of the heart. Changes in venous compliance have large effects on the volume of blood entering the heart and hence cardiac output by the Frank-Starling Law. In healthy steady-state conditions, venous return has to equal cardiac output, i.e., the heart cannot pump more blood than is delivered to it. A sound understanding of the venous system is essential in understanding how changes in cardiac output occur with changes in right atrial pressure or central venous pressure, and the effect these changes have on arterial blood pressure regulation. The aim of this paper is to detail simple hands-on physiological assessments that can be easily undertaken in the practical laboratory setting and that illustrate some key functions of veins. Specifically, we illustrate that venous valves prevent the backflow of blood, that venous blood pressure increases from the heart to the feet, that the skeletal muscle pump facilitates venous return, and we investigate the physiological and clinical significance of central venous pressure and how it may be assessed.",

Life Sci 28: 89–94, 1981). Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are secreted from cardiomyocytes in response to cardiac stretch as in the case of heart failure, whereas C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is secreted from endothelial and renal cells in response to cytokines and endothelium-dependent agonists, such as acetylcholine. Binding ANP or BNP to natriuretic peptide receptor A induces cyclic guanylyl monophosphate as second messenger in the target cells to mediate the following: natriuresis; water diuresis; increasing glomerular filtration rate; decreasing systemic sympathetic activities; plasma volume; cardiac output and blood pressure; and curbing mitoses of heart fibroblasts and hypertrophy of cardiovascular muscle cells. ANP, BNP, and CNP are cleared from the bloodstream by natriuretic peptide receptor C and degraded by an ectoenzyme called neprilysin (NEP). The plasma levels of BNP are typically &gt;100 pg/ml in patients with congestive heart failure. Sacubitril/valsartan is an angiotensin receptor NEP inhibitor that prevents the clinical progression of surviving patients with heart failure more effectively than enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. A thorough understanding of the renal and cardiovascular effects of natriuretic peptides is of major importance for first-year medical students to gain insight into the significance of plasma levels of BNP in patients with heart failure.",

When designed well, blended learning courses in medicine can facilitate students to improve themselves in self-learning, understanding, and problem solving, ultimately enhancing their learning efficiency. However, blended teaching methods are usually used in only a single course, so it is unclear whether these methods can work well in a variety of basic medical courses. The goal of this study is to explore students' perceptions of whether blended laboratory courses are helpful for them in overcoming the difficulties they experience. Blended laboratory courses were taken by medical students at Guilin Medical University. Approximately 71.1% of the students agreed that online lecture courses improved their understanding of threshold concepts and the underlying theories. The majority of the students (63.01%) held the opinion that the blended laboratory courses were more effective than other types of courses in achieving the knowledge goals. The majority of the teachers believed that students' interest in experimentation operations, hands-on abilities, confidence, and other factors were greatly improved compared with those of students taught using the traditional teaching model (face to face). In addition, the average scores for the quizzes of laboratory courses were significantly improved in the blended learning method compared with the traditional learning method. Blended laboratory courses are successful and welcomed by both students and teachers in undergraduate laboratory courses.",

This study investigated the capabilities of Gemini Advanced, a large language model (LLM), in creating clinical vignettes that align with LOs, and comprehensive tutor guides. This study used a faculty-written clinical vignette about diabetes mellitus for third-year medical students. We submitted the LOs and the associated clinical vignette and tutor guide to the LLM to evaluate their alignment and generate new versions. Four faculty members compared both versions using a structured questionnaire. The mean evaluation scores for original and LLM-generated versions are reported. The LLM identified new triggers for the clinical vignette to align it better with the LOs. Moreover, it restructured the tutor guide for better organization and flow and included thought-provoking questions. The medical information provided by the LLM was scientifically appropriate and accurate. LLM-generated clinical vignette scored higher (3.0 vs. 1.25) for the alignment with the LOs. However, the original version scored better for being educational-level appropriate (2.25 vs. 1.25) and adhering to PBL design (2.50 vs. 1.25). The LLM-generated tutor guide scored higher for better flow (3.0 vs. 1.25), comprehensive and relevant content (2.75 vs. 1.50) and thought-provoking questions (2.25 vs. 1.75). However, LLM-generated learning material lacked visual elements. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that Gemini could align and improve PBL learning materials.

    "abstract": "This article is intended for instructors who teach cardiovascular physiology. In our physiology course exercise physiology is used as a tool to review and integrate cardiovascular and respiratory physiology. It is assumed that the students already have mastered the fundamentals of cardiovascular and respiratory physiology. Because this paper is part of a cardiovascular refresher course, I have deleted much of the respiratory physiology. The objectives of this presentation are for the student to 1) understand the relationship between maximal oxygen consumption and endurance during sustained exercise and be able to define \"maximal oxygen consumption\"; 2) understand the determinants of of maximal oxygen consumption; 3) understand the effects of dynamic exercise on the cardiovascular system and mechanisms for these effects; 4) understand the relationships between exercise intensity and major cardiorespiratory parameters, including heart rate, cardiac output, blood flow distribution, left ventricular stroke volume, arterial pressures, total peripheral resistance, and arterial and venous blood oxygen content; 5) be able to compare and contrast the cardiovascular effects of dynamic and isometric exercise in man and the mechanisms responsible for the major differences; and 6) be able to apply knowledge of the cardiovascular effects of exercise to understanding the causes of cardiovascular symptoms in disease and in diagnosis of disease states. This material contains many areas that stimulate discussion with students and allow exploration of concepts that are challenging for the student. This give and take between teachers and student is difficult to summarize in an article of this sort. Therefore, subjects that in my experience often stimulate questions and discussion with the students are indicated in the text.",

Variables were studied via a quasi-experimental, Solomon four-group design on 141 students at a small west-Texas university. Treatment groups were taught using a continuum-based, active-learning model implemented over the course of a semester. Control groups were taught using traditional didactic lecture methods. To assess the effects of the continuum-based active learning strategies, students were administered a comprehensive physiology content exam, the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, and attitude surveys. Factorial analyses indicated that the treatment groups acquired significantly more content knowledge and were significantly more self-efficacious than students in the control groups. There were no significant differences in motivation. Attitude surveys indicated that students in both the treatment and control groups demonstrated a positive attitude toward active learning, believed it helped (or would help) them to learn the material, and would choose an active learning course in the future.",

    "abstract": "The Bernard Distinguished Lecturers are individuals who have a history of experience and expertise in teaching that impacts multiple levels of health science education. Dr. Joel Michael more than meets these criteria. Joel earned a BS in biology from CalTech and a PhD in physiology from MIT following which he vigorously pursued his fascination with the mammalian central nervous system under continuous National Institutes of Health funding for a 15-yr period. At the same time, he became increasingly involved in teaching physiology, with the computer being his bridge between laboratory science and classroom teaching. Soon after incorporating computers into his laboratory, he began developing computer-based learning resources for his students. Observing students using these resources to solve problems led to an interest in the learning process itself. This in turn led to a research and development program, funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), that applied artificial intelligence to develop smart computer tutors. The impact of problem solving on student learning became the defining theme of National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported research in health science education that gradually moved all of Dr. Michael's academic efforts from neurophysiology to physiology education by the early 1980's. More recently, Joel has been instrumental in developing and maintaining the Physiology Education Research Consortium, a group of physiology teachers from around the nation who collaborate on diverse projects designed to enhance learning of the life sciences. In addition to research in education and learning science, Dr. Michael has devoted much of his time to helping physiology teachers adopt modern approaches to helping students learn. He has organized and presented faculty development workshops at many national and international venues. The topics for these workshops have included computer-based education, active learning, problem-based learning, and the use of general models in teaching physiology.",

Microarray technology is very new; methodologies are still evolving, common standards have yet to be established, and many problems with experimental design and variability have still to be fully understood and overcome. This review will describe the time course of a microarray experiment-RNA isolation from sample, target preparation, hybridization to the microarray probe, data capture, and bioinformatic analysis. For each stage, the advantages and disadvantages of competing techniques are compared, and inherent sources of error are identified and discussed.",

Being invited to review a manuscript is an honor, not only because you are being recognized for your eminence in a particular area of research but also because of the responsibility and service you provide to the journal and scientific community. The purpose of this article is to define how best to peer review an article. We will stipulate several principles of peer review and discuss some of the main elements of a good manuscript review, the basic responsibilities of a reviewer, and the rewards and responsibilities that accompany this process.

Therefore, educators are encouraged to create an active-learning environment by incorporating active-learning strategies into the class. However, there is very little documentation of the effectiveness of active-learning strategies. Furthermore, faculty are often reluctant to incorporate new strategies without documentation of the effectiveness of these strategies. To address this concern, we compared the performance of two individual classes on an identical respiratory physiology examination. One class was taught respiratory physiology using active-learning strategies. The other class was taught respiratory physiology using the traditional lecture format. The results document that students who learned using active-learning strategies did significantly better (P < 0.05) on the respiratory physiology examination than students who learned by the traditional lecture format (61 +/- 2.2 vs. 86 +/- 1.0). Thus, by actively involving students in the learning process, academic performance is enhanced.",

The four major sensory modalities are visual, aural or auditory, read/write, and kinesthetic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between preferred learning style, gender, and course scores in an undergraduate physiology class. Students from the fall 2008 and spring 2009 Applied Human Physiology courses completed an online questionnaire in which they were asked to both provide descriptive information about themselves (e.g., gender and major) and self-assess their preferred sensory modality. A total of 901 students completed the questionnaire, 75% of which were female and 25% were male. The results from a chi(2)-analysis (chi(2) = 9.59, P < 0.05) indicated that females and males had significantly different learning style preferences. Females most preferred visual learning (46%) followed by aural (27%), read/write (23%), and kinesthetic (4%). Males most preferred visual learning (49%) followed by read/write (29%), aural (17%), and kinesthetic (5%). There was also a significant relationship (P < 0.05 by ANOVA) between preferred sensory modality and course scores.

    "abstract": "The steady-state maintenance of highly asymmetric concentrations of the major inorganic cations and anions is a major function of both plasma membranes and the membranes of intracellular organelles. Homeostatic regulation of these ionic gradients is critical for most functions. Due to their charge, the movements of ions across biological membranes necessarily involves facilitation by intrinsic membrane transport proteins. The functional characterization and categorization of membrane transport proteins was a major focus of cell physiological research from the 1950s through the 1980s. On the basis of these functional analyses, ion transport proteins were broadly divided into two classes: channels and carrier-type transporters (which include exchangers, cotransporters, and ATP-driven ion pumps). Beginning in the mid-1980s, these functional analyses of ion transport and homeostasis were complemented by the cloning of genes encoding many ion channels and transporter proteins. Comparison of the predicted primary amino acid sequences and structures of functionally similar ion transport proteins facilitated their grouping within families and superfamilies of structurally related membrane proteins. Postgenomics research in ion transport biology increasingly involves two powerful approaches. One involves elucidation of the molecular structures, at the atomic level in some cases, of model ion transport proteins. The second uses the tools of cell biology to explore the cell-specific function or subcellular localization of ion transport proteins. This review will describe how these approaches have provided new, and sometimes surprising, insights regarding four major questions in current ion transporter research. 1) What are the fundamental differences between ion channels and ion transporters? 2) How does the interaction of an ion transport protein with so-called adapter proteins affect its subcellular localization or regulation by various intracellular signal transduction pathways? 3) How does the specific lipid composition of the local membrane microenvironment modulate the function of an ion transport protein? 4) How can the basic functional properties of a ubiquitously expressed ion transport protein vary depending on the cell type in which it is expressed?",

This research was based on the ideas of David Ausubel (meaningful learning), Joseph Novak (concept maps), and Reuven Feuerstein (mediated learning experience). Students were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (mediated learning experience articulated with concept mapping) or a control group (traditional methodology). The intervention group constructed concept maps related to cardiovascular physiology and used them to solve problems related to this subject. The control group attended traditional discussion sessions and problem-solving sessions. All students were evaluated with two types of exams: problem-solving and multiple-choice exams. The intervention group performed significantly better on the problem-solving exams, but the difference was not significant in the multiple-choice exam. It was concluded that intervention promoted meaningful learning that allowed the students to transfer this knowledge to solve problems. The implemented strategy had a greater impact on the students who came into the study with the lowest cognitive competence, possibly because they were empowered by the intervention.",

The project goal was to create instructional resources that emphasized active learning in undergraduate anatomy and physiology classrooms. The resources (activity modules and professional development) addressed two factors thought to be limiting science education reform: instructors' knowledge of how to implement active learning instruction and time to design innovative curricula. Volunteer instructors with a strong interest in using active learning in their classrooms were recruited to use the ITIP modules and provide ease-of-use feedback and student assessment data. As the study unfolded, instructor attrition was higher than had been anticipated, with 17 of 36 instructors withdrawing. More surprisingly, instructors remaining with the project failed to use the modules and reported specific obstacles that precluded module use, including lack of support from academic leadership, unplanned class size increases and heavy teaching loads, a union strike, insufficient time to develop a mindset for change, inadequate technology/funding, an adverse human subjects ruling, incompatibility of modules with instructors' established content and expectations, and personal factors. Despite the lack of module use and obstacles, 8 of 19 site testers began independently to introduce new active learning instruction into their classrooms. In the larger picture, however, it is important to note that only 8 of the initial 36 volunteers (22%) actually ended up changing their instruction to include opportunities for student active learning. These findings underscore the difficulty of implementing instructional change in college classrooms.",

Active learning was encouraged by hypothesis formation and predictions prior to classes, with opportunities for students to amend their e-learning submissions after classes. Automatic or tutor feedback was provided on student submissions. Evaluation of the course was conducted via student questionnaires, individual student interviews, and analysis of student marks in examinations and of the e-learning component. Student feedback on this entire subject in the university-wide quality of teaching survey was very high by University of Melbourne standards and most encouraging for the first implementation of such a curriculum modification. Results from further detailed surveys of student interactions and engagement and correlation analysis between student responses were also very supportive of the effectiveness of the course. There were no significant differences between examination marks in the new course with e-learning and the previous year without e-learning. However, there was a significant correlation between assessment of student e-learning work and their final examination mark. Correlation analysis between various survey responses helped interpret results and strengthened arguments for e-learning and suggested future improvements for student use of e-learning. This mode of e-learning used to support face-to-face learning activities in the laboratory can be adapted for other disciplines and may assist students in developing a greater appreciation and a deeper approach for learning from their practical class experiences.",

This study investigated the efficacy of interactive lecturing in a module of eight respiratory physiology lectures in a second-year Physiology course with two distinct subcohorts: students with strong science backgrounds and those without. The comparison of student performance in the summative examinations of respiratory physiology allowed us to evaluate the efficacy of interactive lecturing for each subcohort. Formal teaching evaluations were used to gauge the students' perception of interactive lectures. To further validate our findings, we repeated the study in the following year. The introduction of interactive lecturing significantly improved learning outcomes, with this improvement being maintained for the period of this study. Furthermore, students with limited prior knowledge, who had typically performed very poorly in this module, achieved a similar learning outcome to those students with a good science background. From these summative results and the students' perceptions, we concluded that students that are alert, motivated and interested in the subject, and engaged in learning activities and that are being encouraged to think and receive constant feedback on their progress will become confident in their learning abilities and have improved learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The explosion of knowledge in all of the biological sciences, and specifically in physiology, has created a growing problem for educators. There is more to know than students can possibly learn. Thus, difficult choices have to be made about what we expect students to master. One approach to making the needed decisions is to consider those “core principles” that provide the thinking tools for understanding all biological phenomena. We identified a list of “core principles” that appear to apply to all aspects of physiology and unpacked them into their constituent component ideas. While such a list does not define the content for a physiology course, it does provide a guideline for selecting the topics on which to focus student attention. This list of “core principles” also offers a starting point for developing an assessment instrument to be used in determining if students have mastered the important unifying ideas of physiology.",

This exposure may lead to an improvement in academic performance. In this report, I describe the transition of a large undergraduate exercise physiology course from a traditional lecture format to a hybrid lecture-online format. A total of 658 final grades (traditional = 346, hybrid = 312) was used to evaluate the effect of course format on academic performance. The hybrid online portion was delivered using WebCT Vista, enhanced with various instructional technologies. The hybrid lecture portion was enhanced with an in-class response system. PowerPoint files were used to distribute in-class lectures in both formats of the course. Final student grades were 9.9% higher (83% of the increase due to an increase in the exam grade) when the course was administered in a hybrid format (P = 0.01), which translated to a one letter grade increase on a standard grading scale. Transition from a traditional lecture format to a hybrid format significantly enhanced student learning; presumably, this increase is due to the fact that students were able to increase their exposure to course content via access to material on WebCT.",

Nearly two-thirds of the respondents correctly matched their perceived and dominant assessed SMP. There was no statistical association between SMP and status. There was a very nearly significant relationship between sex and both perceived (χ(2) = 7.18, P = 0.06) and assessed (χ(2) = 17.36, P = 0.09) SMP. Finally, there was a significant relationship between perceived SMP and course scores (P = 0.01 by ANOVA).

Performance on the same multiple-choice final exam rose from a mean of 68% to 88% over the same time period.

Based on individual test scores, students were categorized as “high performing” (students with higher individual scores) or “low performing” (students with lower individual scores). Finally, student evaluations of the format were collected. Collaborative group testing enhanced student performance. Specifically, group scores were higher than individual scores ( P &lt; 0.001).

We have recently used a popular open-source course management system (CMS) called the modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment (Moodle) to construct an online site (DPhysiol) to facilitate our face-to-face teaching of physiology to a group of first-year students in the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery program. The integration of the Moodle site into our teaching was assessed using online log activity, student examination marks, and feedback from students. The freely available Moodle platform was simple to use, helped to effectively deliver course materials, and has features that allowed cooperative learning. Students who used the CMS throughout their academic year and commented favorably regarding its use as a complement to the face-to-face classroom sessions. The group of students used the CMS obtained significantly higher scores in the final examination compared with the previous class that did not use the CMS. In addition, there was a significant correlation between student participation and performance in online quizzes and their final examination marks. However, students' overall online usage of the CMS did not correlate with their examination marks. We recommend Moodle as a useful tool for physiology educators who are interested in integrating web-based learning into their existing teaching curriculum.",

If there are doubts about the suitability of the data for the requirements of a t-test, most notably the distribution being non-normal, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test may be used instead. However, although often applied, both tests may be invalid when discrete and/or extremely skew data are analyzed. In medicine, extremely skewed data having an excess of zeroes are often observed, representing a numeric outcome that does not occur for a large percentage of cases (so is often zero) but which also sometimes takes relatively large values. For data such as this, application of the t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test could lead researchers to draw incorrect conclusions. A valid alternative is regression modeling to quantify the characteristics of the data. The increased availability of software has simplified the application of these more complex statistical analyses and hence facilitates researchers to use them. In this article, we illustrate the methodology applied to a comparison of cyst counts taken from control and steroid-treated fetal mouse kidneys.",

College students enrolled in a Human Anatomy and Physiology course were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (organ dissections, virtual dissections, or plastic models). Each group received a 15-min lecture followed by a 45-min activity with one of the treatments. Immediately after the lesson and then 2 mo later, students were tested on anatomy and physiology knowledge and completed an attitude survey. Students who used plastic models achieved significantly higher overall scores on both the initial and followup exams than students who performed organ or virtual dissections. On the initial exam, students in the plastic model and organ dissection treatments scored higher on anatomy questions than students who performed virtual dissections. Students in the plastic model group scored higher than students who performed organ dissections on physiology questions. On the followup exam, when asked anatomy questions, students in the plastic model group scored higher than dissection students and virtual dissection students. On attitude surveys, organ dissections had higher perceived value and were requested for inclusion in curricula twice as often as any other activity. Students who performed organ dissections were more likely than the other treatment groups to agree with the statement that “science is fun,” suggesting that organ dissections may promote positive attitudes toward science. The findings of this study provide evidence for the importance of multiple types of hands-on activities in anatomy laboratory courses.",

There is a growing body of evidence showing that medical students can be included as teachers within a medical curriculum. Our aim was to design and implement a near-peer-led teaching program in an undergraduate medical curriculum and assess its acceptability among year 1 students. Students received six tutorials focusing on aspects of cardiac, respiratory, and blood physiology. Tutorials ran alongside standard module teaching. Students were taught in groups of ∼30 students/group, and an active teaching approach was used in sessions where possible. Using anonymous evaluations, student feedback was collected for the program overall and for each tutorial. The program was voluntary and open to all first-year students, and 94 (of 138) medical students from year 1 at Brighton and Sussex Medical School were recruited to the study. The tutorial program was popular among students and was well attended throughout. Individual tutorial and overall program quantitative and qualitative feedback showed that students found the tutorials very useful in consolidating material taught within the module. Students found the small group and active teaching style of the near-peer tutors very useful to facilitating their learning experience. The end-of-module written examination scores suggest that the tutorials may have had a positive effect on student outcome compared with previous student attainment. In conclusion, the present study shows that a near-peer tutorial program can be successfully integrated into a teaching curriculum. The feedback demonstrates that year 1 students are both receptive and find the additional teaching of benefit.",

This approach aids in focusing their attention on the topic and thus generating genuine interest in the mechanisms involved. This study was conducted to determine if offering voluntary active learning exercises would improve student understanding and application of the material covered. To compare performance, an anonymous cardiorespiratory evaluation was distributed to two groups of students during the fall (control, n = 168) and spring (treatment, n = 176) semesters. Students in both groups were taught by traditional methods, and students in the treatment group had the option to voluntary participate in two additional active learning exercises: 1) a small group discussion, where students would discuss a physiology topic with their Teaching Assistant before running BIOPAC software for the laboratory exercise and 2) a free response question, where students anonymously responded to one short essay question after the laboratory exercise. In these formative assessments, students received feedback about their present state of learning from the discussion with their peers and also from the instructor comments regarding perceived misconceptions. As a result of the participation in these activities, students in the treatment group had a better overall performance [χ(2) (degree of freedom = 1) = 31.2, P < 0.001] on the evaluation (treatment group: 62% of responses correct and control group: 49%) with an observed difference of 13% (95% confidence interval: 8, 17).

    "abstract": "Poor awareness among medical graduates about basic life support (BLS) is a matter of great concern. The presence of a trained rescuer is the key determinant of ultimate survival from life-threatening emergencies. To achieve this goal, early exposure to such life-saving skills is the right decision to foster these skills for medical students, which can be reenforced in succeeding years. Forty-two first-year medical students participated in this study. The entire procedure consisted of faculty training, assessment of knowledge of students by a pretest questionnaire, a lecture, a demonstration, and hands-on training using a mannequin (with special emphasis on the site, depth, rate, and sustainment of uninterrupted chest compressions). Posttest 1 was conducted to assess the knowledge gained. The retention of knowledge and skills in the second year was evaluated by posttest 2 and directly observed procedural skills, respectively. Student feedback was collected on five-point Likert scale. Analysis using a Freidman test indicated the mean rank for posttest 1 (2.81) to be significantly higher than the pretest (1.26), indicating a gain in knowledge. The mean rank for posttest 2 (1.93) was lower than for posttest 1 (2.81) but was significantly higher compared with the pretest (1.26), indicating a significant retention of knowledge during the second year. Directly observed procedural skill evaluation showed that 7% students could perform all the seven steps correctly and that 74% students could perform three or more steps correctly, signifying a good retention of skill. Two students taught BLS skills to their family members as well. The results of this study suggest that the program provides students with sound basic knowledge and adequate practical skills in BLS.",

    "abstract": "Patients expect physicians to be lifelong learners who are able to interpret and evaluate diagnostic tests, and most medical schools list the development of lifelong learning in their program objectives. However, lecture is the most often utilized form of teaching in the first two years and is considered passive learning. The current generation of medical students has many characteristics that should support active learning pedagogies. The purpose of this study was to analyze student and faculty perceptions of active learning in an integrated medical curriculum at the second-year mark, where students have been exposed to multiple educational pedagogies. The first hypothesis of the study was that faculty would favor active learning methods. The second hypothesis was that Millennial medical students would favor active learning due to their characteristics. Primary faculty for years 1 and 2 and second-year medical students were recruited for an e-mail survey consisting of 12 questions about active learning and lecture. Students perceived that lecture and passive pedagogies were more effective for learning, whereas faculty felt active and collaborative learning was more effective. Students believed that more content should be covered by lecture than faculty. There were also significant differences in perceptions of what makes a good teacher. Students and faculty both felt that lack of time in the curriculum and preparation time were barriers for faculty. The data suggest that students are not familiar with the process of learning and that more time may be needed to help students develop lifelong learning skills.",

    "abstract": "Alternatives and/or supplements to animal dissection are being explored by educators of human anatomy at different academic levels. Clay modeling is one such alternative that provides a kinesthetic, three-dimensional, constructive, and sensory approach to learning human anatomy. The present study compared two laboratory techniques, clay modeling of human anatomy and dissection of preserved cat specimens, in the instruction of muscles, peripheral nerves, and blood vessels. Specifically, we examined the effect of each technique on student performance on low-order and high-order questions related to each body system as well as the student-perceived value of each technique. Students who modeled anatomic structures in clay scored significantly higher on low-order questions related to peripheral nerves; scores were comparable between groups for high-order questions on peripheral nerves and for questions on muscles and blood vessels. Likert-scale surveys were used to measure student responses to statements about each laboratory technique. A significantly greater percentage of students in the clay modeling group \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" with positive statements about their respective technique. These results indicate that clay modeling and cat dissection are equally effective in achieving student learning outcomes for certain systems in undergraduate human anatomy. Furthermore, clay modeling appears to be the preferred technique based on students' subjective perceptions of value to their learning experience.",

    "abstract": "The flipped classroom was utilized in a two-semester, high-content science course that enrolled between 50 and 80 students at a small liberal arts college. With the flipped model, students watched ~20-min lectures 2 days/wk outside of class. These videos were recorded via screen capture and included a detailed note outline, PowerPoint slides, and review questions. The traditional format included the same materials, except that lectures were delivered in class each week and spanned the entire period. During the flipped course, the instructor reviewed common misconceptions and asked questions requiring higher-order thinking, and five graded case studies were performed each semester. To determine whether assessments included additional higher-order thinking skills in the flipped vs. traditional model, questions across course formats were compared via Blooms Taxonomy. Application-level questions that required prediction of an outcome in a new scenario comprised 38 ± 3 vs. 12 ± 1% of summative assessment questions (<0.01): flipped vs. traditional. Final letter grades in both formats of the course were compared with major GPA. Students in the flipped model performed better than their GPA predicted, as 85.5% earned a higher grade (vs. 42.2% in the traditional classroom) compared with their major GPA. These data demonstrate that assessments transitioned to more application-level compared with factual knowledge-based questions with this particular flipped model, and students performed better in their final letter grade compared with the traditional lecture format. Although the benefits to a flipped classroom are highlighted, student evaluations did suffer. More detailed studies comparing the traditional and flipped formats are warranted.",

Clickers were used to gather anonymous student responses to questions posed within the class period after individual thought and peer discussion. Students ( n = 293, 88% of students completing the courses) completed a perceptual survey on clicker effectiveness inserted into the Student Assessment of Learning Gains online instrument. Across courses and years, students uniformly rated several dimensions of clicker use as providing good to great gain in engaging them in active learning, increasing participation and involvement during class, maintaining attention, applying material immediately, providing feedback concerning their understanding, and offering an anonymous format for participation. Within these four sections, quiz grades were compared between clicker and nonclicker years. Significant increases in pre- and posttest scores were seen in Exercise Physiology in clicker years and on some, but not all material, in Anatomy and Physiology I and II based on content quizzes. Human Pathophysiology results were unexpected, with higher quiz scores in the nonclicker year. The results support the hypothesis of increased engagement with clicker use. The hypothesis of increased student performance was not consistently supported. Increased performance was seen in Exercise Physiology. In Anatomy and Physiology I and II, performance improved on some content quizzes. In Human Pathophysiology, performance did not improve with clickers.",

Each cohort of students was randomly split into 10 small PBL groups and exposed to weekly PBL activity. Within each group, the students were divided into a proposition half and an opposition half. Students were given 1 wk for debate preparation. The students' responses were recorded on a formulated questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze quantitative data, and results are presented as percentages. The usefulness of debate in alleviating potential difficulties in communicating with patients was agreed to by 69% (n = 126) of participants. That these sessions evoked critical thinking among students was reported by 78% (n = 142). This series of debates helped 61% (n = 111) of students to learn effectively about controversial issues. Seventy-one percent (n = 130) considered that debate promoted argument generation and interpretation skills. Enhanced ability to analyze and research evidence was reported by 59% (n = 108) of students. One hundred and thirteen students (62%) agreed that debate helped them to improve clinical decision-making, and 75% of students agreed that debates encouraged tolerance toward diverse viewpoints/convincing strategies.

Although this innovative teaching format is gaining attention, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of flipped teaching on student performance. We compared student performance and student attitudes toward flipped teaching with that of traditional lectures using a partial flipped study design. Flipped teaching expected students to have completed preclass material, such as assigned reading, instructor-prepared lecture video(s), and PowerPoint slides. In-class activities included the review of difficult topics, a modified team-based learning (TBL) session, and an individual assessment. In the unflipped teaching format, students were given PowerPoint slides and reading assignment before their scheduled lectures. The class time consisted of podium-style lecture, which was captured in real time and was made available for students to use as needed. Comparison of student performance between flipped and unflipped teaching showed that flipped teaching improved student performance by 17.5%. This was true of students in both the upper and lower half of the class. A survey conducted during this study indicated that 65% of the students changed the way they normally studied, and 69% of the students believed that they were more prepared for class with flipped learning than in the unflipped class. These findings suggest that flipped teaching, combined with TBL, is more effective than the traditional lecture.",

    "abstract": "Studies completed with undergraduate populations have shown that attendance positively correlates with academic performance. A marked decline in classroom attendance within medical school has recently been noticed with the availability of video capture of lectures and other online material. This study compares these in the era of online material. It took place during the second-year Gastrointestinal and Renal Systems module. Attendance was mandatory at team-based learning and case-based learning sessions on new material and voluntary at lectures (29 sessions) and case-based learning on material previously covered (9 sessions). Attendance was recorded prospectively. All lectures were recorded, and all related files were available to students online. Performance was based on a 118 multiple-choice question final examination. Students voluntarily completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The study group consisted of 78 students (68% of 114 total) of whom 48 completed the MSLQ. Mean attendance was 24%, with 33% of students attending none of the nonmandatory sessions. The median score on the final exam for participants was 86.0 (range: 28.8). High levels of self-efficacy and the ability to self-regulate effort were predictive of low attendance. Attendance was positively predicted by an orientation toward peer learning and help seeking. There was no correlation between the percentage of classes attended and performance on the final exam. We conclude that different facets of self-regulated learning predict attendance, with highly confident students being the least likely to attend, and that attendance at in-class sessions is no longer a good marker for performance.",

A medical graduate, being a lifelong learner, should inculcate the habit of SDL. In the present study, the SDL abilities of first year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students were assessed using a questionnaire. Based on their experience, students were also asked about the prerequisites of SDL, how it can be promoted, and their expectations from the teachers. Students scored high in most of the SDL skills. However, they felt they need improvement in time management. Furthermore, the students are required to develop their interpersonal communication skills, and they also find it difficult to express messages effectively in oral presentations. Most of the students felt they need help in finding the correct learning resources. According to them, the students should be focused, motivated and stress-free, have time management skills, and be able to search learning resources for successful implementation of SDL. They felt that events that encourage active participation by students, if organized at regular intervals, could promote SDL. Some felt that evaluation of SDL would motivate them to take it seriously. According to the students, teacher should act as a facilitator, a mentor, as well as an evaluator.",

Patients are widely employed to teach clinical and interpersonal skills in the clerkship phase of their medical education (M3-M4), but have not been extensively included in the preclinical curriculum (M1-M2) when students are focused on acquiring foundational biomedical science knowledge. To maximize learning and help students connect foundational and clinical science concepts to real-world clinical problems, we involved a real patient in the creation and implementation of a case-based learning (CBL) activity in our preclinical curriculum. Using the patient's narrative as a framework, the CBL addressed relevant aspects of physiology, pathophysiology, anatomy, pharmacology, and nutrition, as well as clinical care decisions, health literacy, and medical ethics. The intervention was implemented with the 2019 and 2020 graduating medical school classes during the Gastrointestinal Systems course in the second year of our curriculum. The results of a survey revealed that, overall, a majority of the students agreed or strongly agreed that the activity increased engagement in class, increased the depth of discussion within their teams, increased the depth of discussion between teams, helped students to apply basic science concepts to the clinical material in the case, helped students better understand the disease processes described in the case, enhanced awareness of the complexity of patient care, provided an authentic learning experience, and elicited a feeling of empathy.",

Recognizing such challenges, a team of biomedical scientists and inclusivity educators developed and implemented a pilot training program within an academic health sciences center as an initial step to educate faculty and staff regarding their roles in the promotion of an inclusive academic environment, receptive to all students, including underrepresented students. The 3-h workshop included didactic modules, videos, teaching modules, and active attendee participation. Faculty and staff were presented common terminology and ways to promote the development of an inclusive and diverse academic workforce. Compared with pre-workshop, post-workshop survey results indicated a statistically significant improvement in attendee knowledge of correctly identifying definitions of “implicit bias,” “status leveling,” “color-blind racial attitudes,” “tokenism,” and “failure to differentiate.” Additionally, by the end of the workshop, participants had a statistically significant increase in self-perceptions regarding the importance of improving diversity and recognizing biases and stereotypes in graduate education, knowing what to say when interacting with people from different cultures, and the ability to acknowledge bias when mentoring students from groups underrepresented in the biomedical field. This preliminary initiative was successful in the introduction of faculty and staff to the importance of fostering an inclusive academic environment and thereby developing a diverse workforce.",

One version comprised narration and animations, whereas the other animation comprised narration and still images. Fifty-four undergraduate students from level 3 pharmacology and physiology undergraduate degrees participated. Half of the students watched the full animation, and the other half watched the stills only. Students watched the presentation once and then answered a short essay question. Answers were coded and marked blind. The \"animation\" group scored 3.7 (SE: 0.4; out of 11), whereas the \"stills\" group scored 3.2 (SE: 0.5). The difference was not statistically significant.

However, when combined with the physiology group, the significance disappeared. Feedback from students was extremely positive and identified four main themes of interest.

    "abstract": "The laboratory has been given a central role in physiology education, and teachers report that it is motivating for students to undertake experimental work on live animals or measuring physiological responses on the students themselves. Since motivation is a critical variable for academic learning and achievement, then we must concern ourselves with questions that examine how students engage in laboratory work and persist at such activities. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how laboratory work influences student motivation in physiology. We administered the Lab Motivation Scale to assess our students' levels of interest, willingness to engage (effort), and confidence in understanding (self-efficacy). We also asked students about the role of laboratory work for their own learning and their experience in the physiology laboratory. Our results documented high levels of interest, effort, and self-efficacy among the students. Correlation analyses were performed on the three motivation scales and exam results, yet a significant correlation was only found between self-efficacy in laboratory work and academic performance at the final exam. However, almost all students reported that laboratory work was very important for learning difficult concepts and physiological processes (e.g., action potential), as the hands-on experiences gave a more concrete idea of the learning content and made the content easier to remember. These results have implications for classroom practice as biology students find laboratory exercises highly motivating, despite their different personal interests and subject preferences. This highlights the importance of not replacing laboratory work by other nonpractical approaches, for example, video demonstrations or computer simulations.",

The study investigated the perceptions and effects of implementing the BL-BOPPPS model on student learning outcomes in an introduction course of HSM. The intervention group consisted of 55 students introduced to the BL-BOPPPS model, while the control group consisted of 54 students who received a conventional lecture. After the end of course, the eﬀectiveness of teaching was self-assessed with questionnaires by all students, and examination scores for the two groups were compared. The students’ satisfaction levels of BL-BOPPPS teaching strategy were up to 81.8% in the intervention group. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significant elevation of perception scores of skills ( P = 0.001), initiative ( P = 0.002), self-control ( P = 0.008), self-efficacy ( P = 0.001), motivation ( P = 0.004), and the academic performance ( P = 0.001). The BL-BOPPPS model could stimulate the enthusiasm and interest of health students; boost students’ skills, initiative, and motivation in learning; and improve the self-directed learning ability, academic performance, and teaching quality. The findings provide a basis of evidence for the promotion of the BL-BOPPPS model in various disciplines in Chinese colleges and universities.",

It also provides instructors with a flexible and feasible model to better understand the students' learning needs and to supervise students' learning behaviors. In this study, we adopted SPOC flipped classroom blended teaching in the physiology course for clinical undergraduate students of Kunming Medical University. Compared with the control group [lecture-based learning (LBL)], the SPOC flipped classroom method significantly increased the scores of students in the preclass test (65.13 ± 12.45 vs. 53.46 ± 8.09, SPOC vs. LBL) and postclass test (80.43 ± 14.29 vs. 69.01 ± 12.81, SPOC vs. LBL), which is induced by students' increased interest in self-learning. More importantly, the significant difference between the preclass scores of the two groups suggested that the video lecture-based preview is more effective than the textbook-based preview. The study indicated that the SPOC flipped classroom was effective in enhancing the examination scores of students, reflecting an improved learning efficiency and a deeper understanding of the knowledge. In summary, the flipped classroom based on SPOC improves learning outcomes compared with LBL and has a wide application in the learning of basic medical courses.",

On the basis of publications and conference presentations, it is clear that the core concepts, conceptual frameworks, and the homeostasis concept inventory have been used by faculty in many ways to improve and assess student learning and align instruction and programs. A growing number of colleagues focus their teaching on physiology core concepts, and some core concepts have been used as explicit themes or organizing principles in physiology or anatomy and physiology textbooks. The core concepts published in 2011 were derived from inputs from a diverse group of physiology instructors and articulated what this group of instructors expressed a decade ago. On the basis of current feedback from the physiology teaching community as a consequence of the use of core concepts in teaching and learning, we have revisited these concepts and made revisions to address issues that have emerged. In this article, we offer revised definitions and explanations of the core concepts, propose an additional core concept (“physical properties of matter” which combines two previous concepts), and describe three broad categories for the revised core concepts. Finally, we catalog published resources for each of the core concepts that provide instructors tools to focus facilitation of student learning on goals (learning outcomes), activities and assessments to enable students to develop and apply their understanding of the core concepts of physiology.",

Adv Physiol Educ 31: 34–40, 2007) sought to better understand this difficulty by asking faculty for their perceptions of why students struggle to learn in HAP. Later research built on these findings by investigating why students find physiology difficult (Sturges D, Maurer T. Internet J Allied Health Sci Pract 11: 1–10, 2013). However, without replication, these claims are limited in their generalizability. There is a need in physiology education research to replicate studies like these across different institutions to support generalizations. We, therefore, replicated both of these studies by collecting survey responses from 466 students at 4 different institutions and 17 instructors at 15 different institutions. We found that students in our study identified similar factors as the students surveyed in the original study. Students most strongly agreed with items that attributed the difficulty of HAP to the nature of the discipline, as opposed to the way physiology is taught or the way students approach learning it. Faculty in our sample, like those in the original study by Michael, agreed most strongly with items that attributed physiology’s difficulty to discipline specific factors. Our data reinforce the results of Sturges and Maurer and Michael. We can more confidently claim that HAP students and faculty believe the difficulty in learning physiology is the result of inherent features of the discipline itself and not factors related to instruction or the students themselves.",

However, various challenges arise during online assessment, which include reliability, when done without monitoring and practical concerns like Internet connectivity issues. This study was done to assess the medical students' perceptions of the reliability, usefulness, and practical challenges of online tests. One hundred first-year undergraduate medical students taking up online classes and tests in the subject of physiology were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire with items regarding practical challenges, reliability, and usefulness of the online tests, in general, and about different types of online assessment methods, in particular, were sent to the students online. Each item was rated on a five-point Likert scale, and the responses were analyzed anonymously. A large percentage of students used mobile phones (81.4%) to undertake online tests. Although most students (73.2%; P < 0.001) felt that online tests helped them substantially in learning the subject, network connectivity issues were considered to be a matter of serious concern (85.5%, P < 0.001). Among the assessment methods used, viva voce by video conferencing was thought to be most reliable (83%, P < 0.001). Multiple-choice question-based assessment when done online was felt to be more practically feasible with faster feedback than classroom assessment. The results of the study suggest that medical students find online formative assessments helpful for their learning, despite their concerns about reliability and practical challenges.",

Instructors can use syllabi as a mechanism to convey important information to students. Moreover, a syllabus can be considered a tool to create inclusive biology courses by transmitting information to all students equitably. In this study, we examined 75 biology course syllabi collected from a research-intensive institution to examine what content instructors include. We reviewed the syllabi to determine the presence or absence of elements and assessed to what extent there were differences in the presence or absence of certain syllabus elements based on course level and course size. We found that instructors are most likely to include content about course expectations and least likely to include content about creating positive classroom climate on their course syllabi. Despite university requirements, many instructors did not include the university-mandated criteria and they did not include elements that could increase how inclusive students perceive the course to be. However, instructors more often included inclusive content when it was required by the university. We also found that students enrolled in upper level courses and small enrollment courses are provided with less content on their syllabi, which we would then interpret as a less inclusive syllabus. We discuss the implications of how these results may differentially impact students in these courses and how the syllabus can be a tool for creating more inclusive college biology courses.",

For the second half of the semester, animal physiology was taught exclusively over Zoom. Here we describe how a flipped teaching format that was used before the pandemic eased the transition from face-to-face teaching to online instruction. The preclass preparation resources and the active learning materials that were already in place for flipped teaching were helpful in the transition to solely online teaching. Therefore, the focus during the transition was to reconfigure active learning and examinations from the face-to-face format to the online platform. Instead of small group discussions in the classroom, teams interacted in Zoom Breakout Rooms. Rather than taking exams in-person during scheduled class time, students submitted exams online. Additionally, students prerecorded their project presentations instead of presenting them “live” during the last week of classes. Overall, students felt that the class smoothly transitioned to a remote only format. These and other changes to the instructional methods will be implemented during the Spring 2021 semester when the course is taught fully online.",

Our students, a population dominated by pre-med and physiology majors, think the latter and have encouraged us to challenge this model, and it turns out scientists and education researchers agree with our students (4, 31, 32). In an effort to remedy this, we began a long-term redesign of the introductory biology sequence to become what is now a sequence of inquiry laboratories we term \"Teams and Streams\" (TS). In these TS inquiry labs, student research teams pose a scientific question/hypothesis, propose an experimental design, perform multi-week investigations and then present their findings in various forms (web, interviews, and papers). The response to this classroom laboratory design has been overwhelmingly positive. In a qualitative study of student opinion (where 260 student responses were studied), surveys conducted at the end of semesters where traditional scripted labs were used (n = 70 comments) had predominantly negative opinions (80% negative responses), whereas the reverse was true for students (n = 190 comments) who participated in courses using the TS inquiry labs (78% positive responses). In a quantitative assessment of content knowledge, students who participated in new TS inquiry labs (n = 245) outscored their peers in traditional labs (n = 86) on Medical College Admission Test-style standardized exams (59.3 +/- 0.8% vs. 48.9 +/- 1.3%, respectively; P < 0.0001). We believe these quantitative data support the qualitative findings and suggest the TS inquiry lab approach increases student learning.",

However, distinct from tossing a coin or a die, the probability of finding the channel closed or open is not a fixed number but can be modified (i.e., we can cheat) by some external stimulus, such as the voltage. Single-channel records can be obtained using the appropriate electrophysiological technique (e.g., patch clamp), and from these records the open probability and the channel conductance can be calculated. Gathering these parameters from a membrane containing many channels is not straightforward, as the macroscopic current I = iNP o , where i is the single-channel current, N the number of channels, and P o the probability of finding the channel open, cannot be split into its individual components. In this tutorial, using the probabilistic nature of ion channels, we discuss in detail how i, N, and P o max (the maximum open probability) can be obtained using fluctuation (nonstationary noise) analysis (Sigworth FJ. G Gen Physiol 307: 97–129, 1980). We also analyze the sources of possible artifacts in the determination of i and N, such as channel rundown, inadequate filtering, and limited resolution of digital data acquisition by use of a simulation computer program (available at www.cecs.cl ).",

    "abstract": "Aldosterone plays a pivotal role in electrolyte and fluid homeostasis and thus control of blood pressure. The “classical” view of aldosterone action is that it targets epithelia of the distal colon and renal nephron to stimulate Na + (re)absorption and K + secretion. In these cells, aldosterone binds steroid receptors, promoting translocation to the nucleus, where they modulate gene expression with the induced proteins stimulating transport. This “genomic” action is dependent on transcription and translation and has a latency of 0.5–1.0 h. Recently, more rapid actions of aldosterone that are independent of transcription and translation have been described. These “nongenomic” actions are mediated by a distinct receptor that is insensitive to inhibitors of the classical mineralocorticoid receptor, such as spironolactone. The present review describes advances in our understanding of the classical model of aldosterone action as well as those that broaden this model to encompass nongenomic actions, nonepithelial targets, production of aldosterone outside of the adrenal gland, novel mechanisms of specificity, and novel mechanisms for mediating genomic actions.",

Performance on exam items about concepts taught using PW-PR was compared with performance on concepts taught using didactic lectures followed by group work. Calibrated Peer Review, a Web-delivered program, was used to collect student essays and to manage anonymous peer review after students \"passed\" three calibration peer reviews. Results show that the students had difficulty relating concepts. Relationship errors were categorized as (1) problems recognizing levels of organization, (2) problems with cause/effect, and (3) overgeneralizations. For example, some described cells as molecules; others thought that vesicles transport materials through the extracellular fluid.

The evaluative study compared two groups of second-year undergraduate students studying a module on epithelial transport: one group worked independently using the CAL program and associated learning materials, and the other group followed a conventional practical class approach, working in the laboratory under supervision. Knowledge gain of each group was measured by means of a test consisting of a range of question types (e.g., short-answer factual, calculation, interpretation) given to students before and after the module. Student attitude to both approaches was assessed by questionnaire, and the resource requirements were also compared. It was found that the knowledge gain of both groups of students was the same, that students had a positive attitude toward using CAL programs of this type, and that the cost of the conventional laboratory-based approach was five times greater. The potential for integrating CAL programs into the undergraduate curriculum is discussed.",

In many systems physiology courses, students attend lectures and are given homework and reading assignments to complete outside of class. The effectiveness of this traditional approach was compared with an approach in which a wireless classroom communication system was used to provide instant feedback on in-class learning activities and reading assignment quizzes. Homework was eliminated in this approach. The feedback system used stimulated 100% participation in class and facilitated rapid formative assessment. The results of this study indicate that learning of systems physiology concepts including physiology is at least, as if not more, effective when in-class quizzes and activities with instant feedback are used in place of traditional learning activities including homework. When results of this study are interpreted in light of possible effects of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on student learning in the test group, it appears that the modified instruction may be more effective than the traditional instruction.",

We also obtained explanations for the students’ answers either as free responses or with follow-up multiple-choice questions. These results suggest that students have a number of underlying conceptual difficulties about cardiovascular phenomena. One possible source of some misconceptions is the students’ inability to apply simple general models to specific cardiovascular phenomena.

It is important that a student become aware of how he or she is learning (2). When students are given the opportunity to learn by themselves, they develop learning skills to become self-directed learners (3). SDL is a process in which students take the initiative with or without the help of others in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material resources for learning, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies, and evaluating learning outcomes (1).The undergraduate medical program (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery; MBBS) at Melaka Manipal Medical College (MMMC) (Manipal Campus), India is a 5-yr, intense academic program. In MMMC, the first-year MBBS physiology curriculum is divided into four blocks.Block 1: Basic concepts, blood, nerve, and muscle physiology.Block 2: Cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal physiology.Block 3: Endocrine, reproductive, and renal physiology.Block 4: Central nervous system and special senses.In each block, students had six SDL sessions of 2.5 h each, which included 2 h of presentation session, followed by 0.5 h of evaluation of the topic covered in the presentation. During presentation sessions, the class of 136 students were divided into four groups according to their roll numbers and each group was led by a faculty member. Students were asked to present the learning objectives individually. Due to time constraints, it was not possible for all students to present in all SDL sessions. But it was ensured that all students presented at least once in the entire block. For every learning objective presented, students were encouraged to go into discussion sessions to create group dynamics. The subject experts guided the students to focus on learning objectives whenever they deviated from it and also clarified their misconceptions. Two days after the presentation session, the evaluation was administered, which consisted of true or false questions, fill in the blanks, and short-answer questions. To determine the effectiveness of SDL, the average score obtained by the students for all of the six SDL evaluations in block 3 were compared with block 3 lecture exam scores using Student's paired t-test. Lecture exam scores were significantly lower than SDL exam scores (72 ± 0.40 vs. 76 ± 0.21). These results suggest that SDL may be an effective learning tool. Furthermore, feedback from the students (Table 1 showed more of a positive approach to this strategy, even though a few students were negative. Based on the comments and performance, we consider that SDL helps students realize that learning is a life-long process and that they are responsible for acquiring knowledge in the vast field of medicine.

A directed method of case analysis is described that helps students deepen and solidify their understanding of anatomical and physiological facts, concepts, and principles. The successful case had four distinctive features as follows: clear learning objectives, a concise and informative scenario, straightforward and didactic questions, and an emphasis on information readily available to the student. A directed case study is presented, and its salient features are described. A procedure for integrating case analyses into an undergraduate anatomy and physiology course is outlined. Student response to this type of case study suggests that this method improves the ease of learning, the depth of learning, and an appreciation of the relevance of and a curiosity about anatomy and physiology. The addition of case analyses to a two-semester integrated course in anatomy and physiology was also associated with an improvement in exam performance. The regular use of directed case analysis is a valuable addition to the traditional methods of lecture, textbook reading, and laboratory for the teaching of human anatomy and physiology.",

    "abstract": "The Department of Physiology of Pramukhswami Medical College at Anand, Gujarat, India, started using problem-based learning in a modified way along with didactic lectures to improve students' understanding and motivate them toward self-directed study. After the didactic lectures were taken for a particular system, clearly defined short clinical problems related to that system were given to the students in the tutorial classes. Each tutor was assigned three to four groups of five to six students each. Problems were accompanied with relevant questions so as to streamline the thought processes of the first-year undergraduates. The tutor then facilitated the study process, and the students discussed among themselves to derive their solutions. At the end of the sessions, feedback was taken from the students through a planned questionnaire on a three-point scale. Of a total of 278 students over a span of 3 yr from 1999 to 2002, 74.4% of students favored a judicious mixture of didactic lectures and case-oriented problem solving in tutorial classes to be an efficient modality in understanding a system under study, and 84% of students stated the mixture of didactic lectures and case-oriented problem solving to be beneficial in relating a clinical condition to the basic mechanism; 82% of students believed that this module helped with better interactions among their batch mates, and 77.2% of students hoped to perform better in the university examination due to this new teaching/learning modality. They also expressed that this gave them ample motivation to do self-directed learning. It may therefore be concluded from the results of the present study that it is possible to have a problem-based learning module in the form of case-oriented problem-solving tutorials coexistent with the traditional didactic lecture module in the first year of medical education under a conventional curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Most students have spent the majority of their school career in passive learning environments in which faculty were disseminators of information, and students were required to memorize information or use specified algorithms to \"solve problems.\" In an active learning environment, students are encouraged to engage in the process of building and testing their own mental models from information that they are acquiring. In such a learner-centered environment, faculty become facilitators of learning, and students become active participants, engaging in a dialogue with their colleagues and with the instructor. To create a successful active learning environment, both faculty and students must make adjustments to what has been their respective \"traditional\" roles in the classroom. For the instructor who is committed to promoting active learning, the challenge lies in helping students understand the necessity of becoming active colleagues in learning. This process can be facilitated if the curriculum includes exercises to direct students' attention to a number of issues that impact their learning. This paper describes four such exercises designed to help students form appropriate course expectations, recognize the need for seeking clarification when communicating, recognize the role of personal experience in building mental models, and become familiar with study aids for building formal models.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that peer instruction enhances student performance on qualitative problem-solving questions. To test this hypothesis, qualitative problems were included in a peer instruction format during our Physiology course. Each class of 90 min was divided into four to six short segments of 15 to 20 min each. Each short segment was followed by a qualitative problem-solving scenario that could be answered with a multiple-choice quiz. All students were allowed 1 min to think and to record their answers. Subsequently, students were allowed 1 min to discuss their answers with classmates. Students were then allowed to change their first answer if desired, and both answers were recorded. Finally, the instructor and students discussed the answer. Peer instruction significantly improved student performance on qualitative problem-solving questions (59.3 +/- 0.5% vs. 80.3 +/- 0.4%). Furthermore, after peer instruction, only 6.5% of the students changed their correct response to an incorrect response; however, 56.8% of students changed their incorrect response to a correct response. Therefore, students with incorrect responses changed their answers more often than students with correct responses. In conclusion, pausing four to six times during a 90-min class to allow peer instruction enhanced student performance on qualitative problem-solving questions.",

Experimentally increasing synaptic levels of serotonin with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has been shown to reliably decrease the expression of aggressive behavior. Here, we describe a method by which fluoxetine can be noninvasively administered to male Betta splendens (an attractive model for the study of aggressive behavior) and describe a simple laboratory exercise that allows students to experimentally investigate the physiological mechanisms of aggressive behavior. We demonstrate that relatively short-term exposure (3 h) of male bettas to as little as 3 μg/ml of fluoxetine-treated aquarium water is sufficient to reduce the expression of specific aggressive behaviors. We emphasize the physiological concepts that can be addressed with this exercise, including the role of the serotonergic system in regulating aggression, and the interplay of environmental contaminants and physiology in regulating the expression of behavior. We also highlight important aspects of experimental design. This exercise can be flexibly altered to accommodate one or several laboratory periods. It is also low cost, is low impact to the animals, and requires minimal preparation time for instructors.",

The costs associated with one-on-one mentoring, and the lack of a sufficient number of faculty members to give intensive attention to undergraduate researchers, make one-on-one mentoring impractical. We therefore developed and implemented the \"research-intensive community\" model with the aim of aligning diverse goals of participants while simultaneously optimizing research productivity. The fundamental organizational unit is a team consisting of one graduate student and three undergraduates from different majors, supervised by a faculty member. Undergraduate workshops, Graduate Leadership Forums, and computer-mediated communication provide an infrastructure to optimize programmatic efficiency and sustain a multilevel, interdisciplinary community of scholars dedicated to research. While the model radically increases the number of undergraduates that can be supported by a single faculty member, the inherent resilience and scalability of the resulting complex adaptive system enables a research-intensive community program to evolve and grow.",

In this inaugural paper we explore the essential distinction between standard deviation and standard error: a standard deviation estimates the variability among sample observations whereas a standard error of the mean estimates the variability among theoretical sample means. If we fail to report the standard deviation, then we fail to fully report our data. Because it incorporates information about sample size, the standard error of the mean is a misguided estimate of variability among observations. Instead, the standard error of the mean provides an estimate of the uncertainty of the true value of the population mean.",

The model is solved using a desktop, Windows-based program, allowing students to calculate time-dependent solutions and interactively alter over 750 parameters that modify physiological function. The model can be used to understand proposed mechanisms of physiological function and the interactions among physiological variables that may not be otherwise intuitively evident. In addition to open-ended or unstructured simulations, we have developed 30 physiological simulations, including heart failure, anemia, diabetes, and hemorrhage. Additional stimulations include 29 patients in which students are challenged to diagnose the pathophysiology based on their understanding of integrative physiology.

The study instruments were Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (LSI) and a questionnaire describing the students' demographic characteristics. Sample selection was not done, and all first-year students ( n = 547) were targeted. This study was designed in two phases. In the first year, the study instruments were delivered to the target group. The next year, the same instruments were delivered again to those who had fully completed the first questionnaire ( n = 525). Of these, 455 students had completed the instruments truly and constituted the study group. The majority of the students were assimilators and convergers in both the first and second years. A change in learning style was observed between 2 yr in 46.9% of the students in the integrated curriculum, in 49.3% of the students in the hybrid curriculum, and 56.4% of the students in the PBL curriculum. The least and most changes observed between the learning style groups were in assimilators and divergers, respectively. Curriculum models and other independent variables had no significant effect on the change between learning styles. The learning styles of medical students may change over time. Further followup studies in larger groups are needed to clarify this relation.",

    "abstract": "The relation between lecture attendance and learning is surprisingly weak, and the role of learning styles in this is poorly understood. We hypothesized that 1) academic performance is related to lecture attendance and 2) learning style influences lecture attendance and, consequently, affects performance. We also speculated that the availability of alternative resources would affect this relationship. Second-year Bachelor of Science physiology students (n = 120) self-reported their lecture attendance in a block of 21 lectures (attendance not compulsory) and use of alternative resources. Overall self-reported lecture attendance was 73 ± 2%. Female students (n = 71) attended more lectures (16.4 ± 0.6) than male students (14.3 ± 0.08, n = 49) and achieved a higher composite mark in all assessments (73.6% vs. 69.3%, P < 0.02). Marks in the final exam were not statistically different between the sexes and correlated only weakly with lecture attendance (r = 0.29, n = 49, P < 0.04 for male students; r = 0.10, n = 71, P = not significant for female students; and r =0.21, n = 120, P < 0.02 for the whole class). Of the students who passed the exam, poor attenders (<11 lectures) reported significantly more use of lecture recordings (37 ± 8%, n = 15, vs. 10 ± 1%, n = 85, P < 0.001). In a VARK learning style assessment (where V is visual, A is auditory, R is reading/writing, and K is kinesthetic), students were multimodal, although female students had a slightly higher average percentage of the R learning style (preferred read/write) compared with male students (28.9 ± 0.9%, n = 63, vs. 25.3 ± 1.3%, n = 32, P < 0.03). Lecture attendance was not correlated with measured learning style. We concluded that lecture attendance is only weakly correlated with academic performance and is not related to learning style. The substitution of alternative materials for lecture attendance appears to have a greater role than learning style in determining academic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Medical students are expected to possess self-directed learning skills to pursue lifelong learning. Previous studies have reported that the readiness for self-directed learning depends on personal attributes as well as the curriculum followed in institutions. Melaka Manipal Medical College of Manipal University (Karnataka, India) offers a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) twinning program that is of 5 yr in duration. Keeping in mind the amount of time that the curriculum has devoted for self-directed learning, we explored the self-directed learning readiness of first-year MBBS students ( n = 130) using a self-directed learning readiness scale (SDLRS) and explored the correlation between SDLRS scores of high achievers, medium achievers, and low achievers with their academic performance in physiology examinations. Students were requested to respond to each item of the SDLRS on a Likert scale. Median scores of the three scales of the SDLRS were compared across the three groups of students using a Kruskall-Wallis test. SDLRS scores of the students ( n = 130) were correlated with their marks in theory papers of first, second, and third block-end examinations using Spearmann's correlation coefficient. The mean item score for desire for learning was found to be higher followed by self-control and self-management. Data analyses showed significantly high ( P &lt; 0.03) median scores for self-control for high achievers compared with medium and low achievers. Between the groups, high achievers had a higher score for all the three scales of the SDLRS followed by low and medium achievers. SDLRS scores and academic performance of the three groups of students were found to exhibit a weak correlation. This study threw light on the fact that despite having a high desire for learning and ability of self-control, students need to be supported in their self-management skills.",

    "abstract": "A number of professions rely on exercise prescription to improve health or athletic performance, including coaching, fitness/personal training, rehabilitation, and exercise physiology. It is therefore advisable that the professionals involved learn the various tools available for designing effective training programs. Mathematical modeling of athletic training and performance, which we henceforth call “performance modeling,” is one such tool. Two models, the critical power (CP) model and the Banister impulse-response (IR) model, offer complementary information. The CP model describes the relationship between work rates and the durations for which an individual can sustain them during constant-work-rate or intermittent exercise. The IR model describes the dynamics by which an individual's performance capacity changes over time as a function of training. Both models elegantly abstract the underlying physiology, and both can accurately fit performance data, such that educating exercise practitioners in the science of performance modeling offers both pedagogical and practical benefits. In addition, performance modeling offers an avenue for introducing mathematical modeling skills to exercise physiology researchers. A principal limitation to the adoption of performance modeling is a lack of education. The goal of this report is therefore to encourage educators of exercise physiology practitioners and researchers to incorporate the science of performance modeling in their curricula and to serve as a resource to support this effort. The resources include a comprehensive review of the concepts associated with the development and use of the models, software to enable hands-on computer exercises, and strategies for teaching the models to different audiences.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle contraction is associated with the production of ROS due to altered O 2 distribution and flux in the cell. Despite a highly efficient antioxidant defense, a small surplus of ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide, may serve as signaling molecules to stimulate cellular adaptation to reach new homeostasis largely due to the activation of redox-sensitive signaling pathways. Recent research has highlighted the important role of NF-κB, MAPK, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, along with other newly discovered signaling pathways, in some of the most vital biological functions, such as mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defense, inflammation, protein turnover, apoptosis, and autophagy. There is evidence that the inability of the cell to maintain proper redox signaling underlies some basic mechanisms of biological aging, during which inflammatory and catabolic pathways eventually predominate. Physical exercise has been shown to activate various redox signaling pathways that control the adaptation and remodeling process. Although this stimulatory effect of exercise declines with aging, it is not completed abolished. Thus, aged people can still benefit from regular physical activity in the appropriate forms and at proper intensity to preserve muscle function.",

    "abstract": "Dr. Carl Wiggers' careful observations have provided a meaningful resource for students to learn how the heart works. Throughout the many years from his initial reports, the Wiggers diagram has been used, in various degrees of complexity, as a fundamental tool for cardiovascular instruction. Often, the various electrical and mechanical plots are the novice learner's first exposure to simulated data. As the various temporal relationships throughout a heartbeat could simply be memorized, the challenge for the cardiovascular instructor is to engage the learner so the underlying mechanisms governing the changing electrical and mechanical events are truly understood. Based on experience, we suggest some additions to the Wiggers diagram that are not commonly used to enhance cardiovascular pedagogy. For example, these additions could be, but are not limited to, introducing the concept of energy waves and their role in influencing pressure and flow in health and disease. Also, integrating concepts of exercise physiology, and the differences in cardiac function and hemodynamics between an elite athlete and normal subject, can have a profound impact on student engagement. In describing the relationship between electrical and mechanical events, the instructor may find the introduction of premature ventricular contractions as a useful tool to further understanding of this important principle. It is our hope that these examples can aid cardiovascular instructors to engage their learners and promote fundamental understanding at the expense of simple memorization.",

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of the composition and structure of the mammalian cell membrane, biologists have had a clearer understanding of how substances enter and exit the cell's interior. The selectively permeable nature of the cell membrane allows the movement of some solutes and prevents the movement of others. This has important consequences for cell volume and the integrity of the cell and, as a result, is of utmost clinical importance, for example in the administration of isotonic intravenous infusions. The concepts of osmolarity and tonicity are often confused by students as impermeant isosmotic solutes such as NaCl are also isotonic; however, isosmotic solutes such as urea are actually hypotonic due to the permeant nature of the membrane. By placing red blood cells in solutions of differing osmolarities and tonicities, this experiment demonstrates the effects of osmosis and the resultant changes in cell volume. Using hemoglobin standard solutions, where known concentrations of hemoglobin are produced, the proportion of hemolysis and the effect of this on resultant hematocrit can be estimated. No change in cell volume occurs in isotonic NaCl, and, by placing blood cells in hypotonic NaCl, incomplete hemolysis occurs. By changing the bathing solution to either distilled water or isosmotic urea, complete hemolysis occurs due to their hypotonic effects. With the use of animal blood in this practical, students gain useful experience in handling tissue fluids and calculating dilutions and can appreciate the science behind clinical scenarios.",

The two main goals of the study were: to determine the impact of e-learning on student success in mastering the course, and to assess user satisfaction after the introduction of e-learning. The study compared a group of students who attended the physiology course before, with a group of students who attended the physiology course after the Moodle platform was fully implemented as an educational tool. Formative and summative assessment scores were compared between these two groups. The impact of high vs. low Moodle use on the assessment scores was analyzed. The satisfaction among Moodle users was assessed by the survey. The study found that attendance of face-to-face lectures had a positive impact on academic performance. The introduction of Moodle in the presented model of teaching increased interest of students, attendance of face-to-face lectures, as well as formative and summative scores. High frequency of Moodle use was not always associated with better academic performance, suggesting that the introduction of a new method of teaching was most likely equally accepted by low- and high-achieving students. Most of the students agreed that Moodle was easy to use and it complemented traditional teaching very well, but it could not completely replace traditional face-to-face lectures. The study supports continuing the use of web-based learning in a form of blended learning for physiology, as well as for other courses in medical education.",

This study investigated the impact of online feedback quizzes on the learning experiences and outcomes of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory physiology course. Four quiz models were tested, which differed in the amount of credit available, the number of attempts permitted, and whether the quizzes were invigilated or unsupervised, timed or untimed, or open or closed book. All quizzes were composed of multiple-choice questions and provided immediate individualized feedback. Summative end-of-course examination marks were analyzed with respect to performance in quizzes and were also compared with examination performance in the year before the quizzes were introduced. Online surveys were conducted to gather students' perceptions regarding the quizzes. The vast majority of students perceived online quizzes as a valuable learning tool. For all quiz models tested, there was a significant relationship between performance in quizzes and end-of-course examination scores. Importantly, students who performed poorly in quizzes were more likely to fail the examination, suggesting that formative online quizzes may be a useful tool to identify students in need of assistance. Of the four quiz models, only one quiz model was associated with a significant increase in mean examination performance. This model had the strongest formative focus, allowing multiple unsupervised and untimed attempts. This study suggests that the format of online formative assessments is critical in achieving the desired impact on student learning. Specifically, such assessments are most effective when they are low stakes.",

A 42-item survey that included 28 items of the adapted academic motivation scale for HAP based on self-determination theory was administered in class during the first 3 wk of each semester. Students with higher grade point averages, who studied for longer hours and reported to be more motivated to succeed, did better academically in these classes. There was a significant relationship between students' scores on the adapted academic motivation scale and performance. Students were more extrinsically motivated to succeed in HAP courses than intrinsically motivated to succeed, and the analyses revealed that the most significant predictor of final grade was within the extrinsic scale (introjected and external types). Students' motivations remained stable throughout the course sequence. The data showed a significant relationship between HAP students' expected grade and their final grade in class. Finally, 65.5% of students overestimated their final grade, with 29% of students overestimating by two to four letter grades.",

While solving the puzzle, the students had to describe the cardiac cycle by relating the concepts of heart morphology and physiology. To evaluate short-term learning, the number of wrong answers and grades in the assessment exercise were compared between the control and game groups. To evaluate medium-term learning, we compared the grades obtained by students of the control and game groups in questions about cardiac physiology that formed part of the academic exam.

    "abstract": "Our students are naturally curious, with powerful intrinsic motives to understand their world. Accordingly, we, as teachers, must capitalize on this inherently active and curious nature so that learning becomes a lifelong activity where students take initiative for learning, are skilled in learning, and want to learn new things. Achieving this goal requires an understanding of student attitudes, beliefs, characteristics, and motivations. To achieve this goal, we administered the intrinsic motivation inventory (IMI) to assess our students' interest and enjoyment, perceived choice, and perceived competence while taking our undergraduate exercise physiology class (46 students; 20 female students and 26 male students). The interest and enjoyment subscale is considered the self-reported measure of intrinsic motivation. The perceived choice and perceived competence concepts are theorized to be positive predictors of both self-reported and behavioral measures of intrinsic motivation. Our results documented a significant increase in course grade with an increase in survey score for the interest and enjoyment subscale of the IMI when female and male students were combined. Specifically, each increase in survey score for the interest and enjoyment subscale of the IMI was associated with a significant ( P &lt; 0.05) increase of 3.9% in course grade. However, the increase in survey score was associated with a significantly greater ( P &lt; 0.05) increase in course grade for male (6.1%) compared with female (0.3%) students.

    "abstract": "Because the heart and lungs are confined within the thoracic cavity, understanding their interactions is integral for studying each system. Such interactions include changes in external constraint to the heart, blood volume redistribution (venous return), direct ventricular interaction (DVI), and left ventricular (LV) afterload. During mechanical ventilation, these interactions can be amplified and result in reduced cardiac output. For example, increased intrathoracic pressure associated with mechanical ventilation can increase external constraint and limit ventricular diastolic filling and, therefore, output. Similarly, high intrathoracic pressures can alter blood volume distribution and limit diastolic filling of both ventricles while concomitantly increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to increased DVI, which may further limit LV filling. While LV afterload is generally considered to decrease with increased intrathoracic pressure, the question arises if the reduced LV afterload is primarily a consequence of a reduced LV preload. A thorough understanding of the interaction between the heart and lungs can be complicated but is essential for clinicians and health science students alike. In this teaching review, we have attempted to highlight the present understanding of certain salient aspects of cardiopulmonary physiology and pathophysiology, as well as provide a resource for multidisciplined health science educators and students.",

Robert K. Crane originally described the cellular model of absorption of Na(+) and glucose by a \"cotransport process\" in 1960. Over the past 50+ yr, numerous groups have tested and verified Crane's hypothesis. Eventually, Wright and colleagues cloned the Na(+)-glucose cotransporter (SGLT1; the product of the SLC5A1 gene) in 1987. This article provides a \"hands-on\" laboratory exercise using the everted mouse jejunal preparation (everted sac) that allows students to investigate various components of the Na(+)-glucose cotransport absorptive cell model (e.g., Na(+) dependence of SGLT1, inhibition of SGLT1, and inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase). Additionally, the laboratory exercise includes a case-based study of glucose-galactose malabsorption in which the students conduct an internet search and participate in a small-group discussion during the laboratory period to better understand the basic principles and functions of the Na(+)-glucose absorptive process of the small intestine. This laboratory exercise was introduced into the second-year undergraduate physiology curriculum in 2008, and >850 physiology students have participated in this laboratory exercise. The students have produced very robust and reproducible data that clearly illustrate the theory of the cellular model for Na(+)-glucose absorption by the jejunum.",

    "abstract": "Open educational resources (OERs) are becoming increasingly common as a tool in education, particularly in medical and biomedical education. However, three key barriers have been identified to their use: 1) lack of awareness of OERs, 2) lack of motivation to use OERs, and 3) lack of training in the use of OERs. Here, we explore these three barriers with teachers of medical and biomedical science to establish how best to enhance the use of OERs to improve pedagogical outcomes. An online survey was completed by 209 educators, many of whom (68.4%) reported using OERs in their teaching and almost all (99.5%) showing awareness of at least one OER. The results suggest that key problems that prevent educators from adopting OERs in their teaching include suitability for particular classes, time, and copyright. Most (81.8%) educators were somewhat, very, or extremely comfortable with OERs so there is no innate motivational barrier to adoption. A lack of training was reported by 13.9% of respondents, and 40% of respondents stated that there was little or no support from their institutions. OER users were no more comfortable with technology or better supported by departments but tended to be aware of a greater number of sources of OERs. Our study illustrates key opportunities for the expansion of OER use in physiology and medical teaching: increased breadth of awareness, increased institutional support (including time, training, and copyright support), and greater sharing of diverse OERs to suit the range of teaching challenges faced by staff in different subdisciplines.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to critically evaluate the accuracy and readability of English Wikipedia articles on the respiratory system and its disorders and whether they can be a suitable resource for medical students. On April 27, 2014, English Wikipedia was searched for articles on respiratory topics. Using a modified DISCERN instrument, articles were independently scored by three assessors. The scoring targeted content accuracy, frequency of updating, and quality of references. The readability of articles was measured using two other instruments. The mean DISCERN score for the 40 articles identified was 26.4 ± 6.3. Most articles covered causes, signs and symptoms, prevention, and treatment. However, several knowledge deficiencies in the pathogenesis of diseases, investigations needed, and treatment were observed. The total number of references for the 40 articles was 1,654, and the references varied from 0 to 168 references, but several problems were identified in the list of references and citations made. The readability of articles was in the range of 9.4 ± 1.8 to 22.6 ± 10.7 using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level instrument and 10.0 ± 2.6 to 19.6 ± 8.3 using the Readability Coleman-Liau index. A strong correlation was found between the two instruments ( r 2 = 0.744, P &lt; 0.001). The agreement between the assessors had mean κ scores in the range of 0.712–0.857. In conclusion, despite the effort placed in creating Wikipedia respiratory articles by anonymous volunteers (wikipedians), most articles had knowledge deficiencies, were not accurate, and were not suitable for medical students as learning resources.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present article is to describe a puzzle developed for use in teaching cardiac physiology classes. The puzzle presents figures of phases of the cardiac cycle and a table with five columns: phases of cardiac cycle, atrial state, ventricular state, state of atrioventricular valves, and pulmonary and aortic valves. Chips are provided for use to complete the table. Students are requested to discuss which is the correct sequence of figures indicating the phases of cardiac cycle. Afterward, they should complete the table with the chips. Students of biology, dentistry, medicine, pharmacy, and nursing graduation courses from seven institutions performed the puzzle evaluation. They were invited to indicate whether the puzzle had been useful for learning about the subject by filling one of four alternatives. Of the students, 4.6% answered that it was not necessary but helped them to confirm what they had learned, 64.5% reported that although they had previously understood the cardiac cycle, the puzzle helped them to solve doubts and promoted a better understanding of it, and 30.9% said that they needed the puzzle to understand the cardiac cycle, without differences among courses, institutions, and course semesters. The results of the present study suggest that a simple and inexpensive puzzle may be useful as an active learning methodology applied after the theoretical lecture, as a complementary tool for studying cardiac cycle physiology.",

Studies have shown that medical students have positive perceptions about the value of ultrasound in teaching courses like anatomy and physiology. The purpose of the present study was to provide objective evidence of whether ultrasound helps students learn cardiac physiology. In this study, 20 medical students took a pretest to assess their background knowledge of cardiac physiology. Next, they acquired ultrasound video loops of the heart. Faculty members taught them nonelectrical aspects of cardiac physiology using those loops. Finally, students took a posttest to evaluate for improvements in their knowledge. Students also completed an anonymous questionnaire about their experience. The mean pretest score was 4.8 of 9 (53.3%). The mean posttest score was 7.35 of 9 (81.7%). The mean difference was significant at P < 0.0001. Student feedback was very positive about the ultrasound laboratory. Ninety-five percent of the students agreed or strongly agreed that the ultrasound laboratory was a valuable teaching tool and that it improved their understanding of cardiac physiology. All students agreed or strongly agreed the laboratory was helpful from a visual learning standpoint. A hands-on ultrasound laboratory can indeed help medical students learn the nonelectrical components of cardiac physiology.",

Assessment for learning is best elucidated as a process by which the assessment information can be used by teachers to modify their teaching strategies while students adjust and alter their learning approaches. Effectively implemented, formative assessments can convert classroom culture to one that resonates with the triumph of learning. In this paper, we present 10 maxims that show ways that formative assessments can be better understood, appreciated, and implemented.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing the usability of e-learning materials is necessary to reduce extraneous cognitive load and maximize their potential educational impact. However, this is often neglected, especially when time and other resources are limited. We conducted a randomized trial to investigate whether a usability evaluation of our multimedia e-learning resource, followed by fixing of all problems identified, would translate into improvements in usability parameters and learning by medical residents. Two iterations of our e-learning resource [ version 1 (V1) and version 2 (V2)] were compared. V1 was the first fully functional version and V2 was the revised version after all identified usability problems were addressed. Residents in internal medicine and anesthesiology were randomly assigned to one of the versions. Usability was evaluated by having participants complete a user satisfaction questionnaire and by recording and analyzing their interactions with the application. The effect on learning was assessed by questions designed to test the retention and transfer of knowledge. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with both versions, with good ratings on the System Usability Scale and adjective rating scale. In contrast, analysis of video recordings revealed significant differences in the occurrence of serious usability problems between the two versions, in particular in the interactive HandsOn case with its treatment simulation, where there was a median of five serious problem instances (range: 0–50) recorded per participant for V1 and zero instances (range: 0–1) for V2 ( P &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in tests of retention or transfer of knowledge between the two versions. In conclusion, usability evaluation followed by a redesign of our e-learning resource resulted in significant improvements in usability. This is likely to translate into improved motivation and willingness to engage with the learning material. In this population of relatively high-knowledge participants, learning scores were similar across the two versions.",

    "abstract": "The heart is often regarded as a compression pump. Therefore, determination of pressure and volume is essential for cardiac function analysis. Traditionally, ventricular performance was described in terms of the Starling curve, i.e., output related to input. This view is based on two variables (namely, stroke volume and end-diastolic volume), often studied in the isolated (i.e., denervated) heart, and has dominated the interpretation of cardiac mechanics over the last century. The ratio of the prevailing coordinates within that paradigm is termed ejection fraction (EF), which is the popular metric routinely used in the clinic. Here we present an insightful alternative approach while describing volume regulation by relating end-systolic volume (ESV) to end-diastolic volume. This route obviates the undesired use of metrics derived from differences or ratios, as employed in previous models. We illustrate basic principles concerning ventricular volume regulation by data obtained from intact animal experiments and collected in healthy humans. Special attention is given to sex-specific differences. The method can be applied to the dynamics of a single heart and to an ensemble of individuals. Group analysis allows for stratification regarding sex, age, medication, and additional clinically relevant covariates. A straightforward procedure derives the relationship between EF and ESV and describes myocardial oxygen consumption in terms of ESV. This representation enhances insight and reduces the impact of the metric EF, in favor of the end-systolic elastance concept advanced 4 decades ago.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced teaching to be shifted to an online platform. Since the flipped teaching (FT) model has been shown to engage students through active learning strategies and adapt both synchronous and asynchronous components, it was a convenient choice for educators familiar with this instructional method. This study tested the effectiveness of a virtual FT method during the pandemic in a graduate-level physiology course. Besides assessing knowledge gained in the virtual FT format, student surveys were used to measure student perception of their adjustment to the new FT format, their confidence in completing the course successfully, and the usefulness of assessments and assignments in the remote FT. Students reported that they adjusted well to the remote FT method (P < 0.001), and their confidence in completing the course in this teaching mode successfully improved from the beginning to the end of the semester (P < 0.05). Students expressed a positive response to the synchronous computerized exams (90.32%) and the formative group (93.51%) and individual (80.65%) assessments. Both collaborative activities (93.55%) and in-class discussions (96.77%) were found to be effective. The course evaluations and the overall semester scores were comparable to the previous semesters of face-to-face FT. Overall, students' perceptions and performance suggested that they embraced the virtual FT method and the tested teaching method maintained the same strong outcome as before. Thus, this study presents a promising new instructional method in the teaching of future physiology courses.",

Although the utilization of interactive anatomy software greatly contributes to an active learning environment and efficient use of time, simply providing textbook readings, access to anatomy software, and models is not enough to engage students to become active in reaching their learning goals. Time constraints, meaningful technology implementation, resource abundance, and unfamiliarity are challenges that decrease the effectiveness of both facilitating and learning anatomy. The present study investigated the use of three supplemental learning tools to support anatomy instruction in a self-regulated manner. Friedman test results demonstrated significant differences for perceived engagement [χ 2 (2) = 15.74, P &lt; 0.001, W = 0.23] but not for perceived learning. Survey responses demonstrated that perceived engagement was greatest with the nondigital supplemental learning tool compared with the two technology-enhanced learning tools (iBooks Author + SoftChalk and SoftChalk alone). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated statistically significant relationships between the nondigital supplemental learning tool and anatomy practical scores ( P &lt; 0.001). The technology-enhanced supplemental learning tools did not further increase learning outcomes as measured by practical scores compared with nondigital learning tools. Incorporation of instructor-created instructional materials independent of technology is an efficient method to drive self-regulated learning, enhance engagement, and improve anatomy course outcomes and may overcome barriers associated with a purely self-directed PBL model.",

VLs include simulations, electronic notebooks, videos and augmented reality. As part of the 'VL Project', comprising 5 academic institutions in Ireland, we sought to determine how VLs might enhance practical learning in undergraduate life science students at Dundalk Institute of Technology (DkIT). From 2021-2024, we exposed students to VLs multiple degrees (e.g. BSc Bioscience, BSc Pharmaceutical Science, BSc Biopharmaceutical Science). We focused on Labster simulations, and Lab Archives electronic notebooks. Over 600 students performed VLs in 14 modules from 1st-4th year (e.g. Biotechnology, Immunology, Bioanalytical Science). We surveyed students before, and after using VLs and conducted focus groups to evaluate emergent themes in depth. Among respondents (n=263), the most beneficial component of laboratory experiences, as indicated by 58% of students was experimental work (opposed to pre-practical talks or post-laboratory assessments). 90% of students agreed with the statement: \"VLs enhanced my level of confidence with experimental science\". 75% of students stated VLs should only be used to complement face-to-face (F-2-F) teaching. Thematic focus group analysis revealed students valued VLs as pre-lab tools, allowing repeated engagement with, and troubleshooting of experiments in a safe, non-time limited manner. In conclusion, students reinforced they valued hands-on experience, in-person instructor guidance and real-world demonstration for experimental work. VLs can complement, but should not replace face-to-face laboratory experiences in undergraduate life sciences.",

While many studies have explored the capabilities of GenAI to complete assessments, few have implemented educative activities to highlight GenAI risks and benefits, or explored physiology students' perceptions and uses of GenAI. Our study implemented a learning activity, designed using constructivist principles, to allow for physiology students to explore GenAI and consider its use in assessment tasks. The activity engaged students (n=236) enrolled in a second-year physiology subject over two years. The activity began with students directed to critique a sample exam answer as a form of content revision. The answer had been covertly generated by ChatGPT, and it lacked depth and contained some hallucinated facts. Students then engaged in discussion about the use of GenAI for university study and assessment. Questions were used to stimulate thought and discussion, and student responses were collected via Padlet (492 posts). Thematic analysis of the comments highlighted students' beliefs about using GenAI, and perceived benefits and risks. There was a general trend of increasing acceptance of using GenAI, and using if for assessment, over time. Students were concerned about breaching academic integrity guidelines, information accuracy and sources, and the negative effect it may have on their learning. At the conclusion of the activity, the revelation that ChatGPT wrote the sample exam answer reinforced the need for responsible GenAI use.",

While the educational merit of such gamified learning activities continues to be realized, guides on the development of ERs are lacking, as well as student perceptions on how, if, and where they should be integrated into medical curricula. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the experiences of building anatomy-themed virtual ERs of differing formats at two separate institutions: Queen’s University Belfast (QUB) and Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine (VCOM), focusing on abdominal and upper limb anatomy respectively. Google Workspace applications served as the primary platform. 3D models were built using photogrammetry techniques or Virtual Human Dissector software (www.toltech.net) and integrated into the ER. Of 69 students and staff invited at QUB, 9 (13%) participated in the in-person virtual ER in teams of 2-3 (7 medical students, 2 anatomy instructors). Of 27 VCOM medical students invited, 8 (30%) agreed to participate and individually completed VCOM’s virtual ER remotely. Anonymous surveys and a focus group revealed the ERs to be enjoyable and engaging and encouraged participants to think about material in a new way while helping them to identify knowledge gaps. Strengths and weaknesses of different designs (linear versus nonlinear), delivery methods (in-person versus remote) and grouping of participants (team-based versus individual) were realized and discussed, revealing opportunities for optimizing the experience.

Our results indicate that raw average scores on weekly examinations were 14 percentage points higher for students in the VLE compared with those for students in a conventional lecture hall setting. Moreover, normalized test scores were over 5 points higher for students in the VLE. This analysis suggest that a core curriculum can be effectively presented to students using the VLE, thereby making it possible for faculty to spend less class time relaying facts and more time engaging students in discussion of scientific theory.",

Straightforward definitions both of preload and afterload that are concise yet still comprehensive can be developed using the Law of LaPlace to describe the relationships among chamber pressure, chamber radius, and wall thickness. Within this context, the term “preload” can be defined as all of the factors that contribute to passive ventricular wall stress (or tension) at the end of diastole, and the term “afterload” can be defined as all of the factors that contribute to total myocardial wall stress (or tension) during systolic ejection. The inclusion of “wall stress” in both definitions helps the student appreciate both the complexities of cardiac pathophysiology and the rationale for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 700 undergraduates studying physiology at community colleges, a liberal arts college, and universities were surveyed to determine the prevalence of our misconceptions about respiratory phenomena. A misconception about the changes in breathing frequency and tidal volume (physiological variables whose changes can be directly sensed) that result in increased minute ventilation was found to be present in this population with comparable prevalence (approximately 60%) to that seen in a previous study. Three other misconceptions involving phenomena that cannot be experienced directly and therefore were most likely learned in some educational setting were found to be of varying prevalence. Nearly 90% of the students exhibited a misconception about the relationship between arterial oxygen partial pressure and hemoglobin saturation. Sixty-six percent of the students believed that increasing alveolar oxygen partial pressure leads to a decrease in alveolar carbon dioxide partial pressure. Nearly 33% of the population misunderstood the relationship between metabolism and ventilation. The possible origins of these respiratory misconceptions are discussed and suggestions for how to prevent and/or remediate them are proposed.",

Our primary goals were to improve the ability of students to design experiments and analyze data. We assessed these abilities at the beginning and end of the semester by giving students an evaluation tool consisting of an experimental scenario, data, and four questions of increasing complexity. To control for nontreatment influences, the improvement scores (final minus initial score for each question) of students taking both the laboratory and the companion lecture course were compared with those of students taking the lecture course only. The laboratory + lecture group improved more than the lecture-only group for the most challenging question. This evidence suggests that our inquiry-based curriculum is achieving its primary goals. The evaluation tool that we developed may be useful to others interested in measuring experimental analysis abilities in their students.",

Medical educators of physiology have long recognized the value of such methods, using animal-based laboratories to demonstrate difficult physiological principles. Due to ethical and other concerns, a replacement of this teaching tool has been sought. Here, the author describes the use of a full-scale human patient simulator for such a workshop. The simulator is a life-size mannequin with physical findings (palpable pulses, breath/heart sounds, blinking eyes, etc.) and sophisticated mechanical and software models of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. It can be connected to standard physiological monitors to reproduce a realistic clinical environment. In groups of 10, first-year medical students explore Starling's law of the heart, the physiology of the Valsalva maneuver, and the function of the baroreceptor in a clinically realistic context using the simulator. With the use of a novel pre-/postworkshop assessment instrument that included student confidence in their answers, student confidence improved for all questions and survey items following the simulator session (P < 0.0001). The students give these laboratory exercises uniformly superior evaluations with > 85% of the students rating the workshop \"very good\" or \"excellent\".",

    "abstract": "Recognition of the importance of glial cells in nervous system functioning is increasing, specifically regarding the modulation of neural activity. This brief review focuses on some of the morphological and functional interactions that take place between astroglia and neurons. Astrocyte-neuron interactions are of special interest because this glia cell type has intimate and dynamic associations with all parts of neurons, i.e., somata, dendrites, axons, and terminals. Activation of certain receptors on astrocytes produces morphological changes that result in new contacts between neurons, along with physiological and functional changes brought about by the new contacts. In response to activation of other receptors or changes in the extracellular microenvironment, astrocytes release neuroactive substances that directly excite or inhibit nearby neurons and may modulate synaptic transmission. Although some of these glial-neuronal interactions have been known for many years, others have been quite recently revealed, but together they are forming a compelling story of how these two major cell types in the brain carry out the complex tasks that mammalian nervous systems perform.",

    "abstract": "Experimental designs involving repeated measurements on experimental units are widely used in physiological research. Often, relatively many consecutive observations on each experimental unit are involved and the data may be quite nonlinear. Yet evidently, one of the most commonly used statistical methods for dealing with such data sets in physiological research is the repeated-measurements ANOVA model. The problem herewith is that it is not well suited for data sets with many consecutive measurements; it does not deal with nonlinear features of the data, and the interpretability of the model may be low. The use of inappropriate statistical models increases the likelihood of drawing wrong conclusions. The aim of this article is to illustrate, for a reasonably typical repeated-measurements data set, how fundamental assumptions of the repeated-measurements ANOVA model are inappropriate and how researchers may benefit from adopting different modeling approaches using a variety of different kinds of models. We emphasize intuitive ideas rather than mathematical rigor. We illustrate how such models represent alternatives that 1) can have much higher interpretability, 2) are more likely to meet underlying assumptions, 3) provide better fitted models, and 4) are readily implemented in widely distributed software products.",

One hundred sixteen years later, Mosso's career, scientific accomplishments, and legacy in the study of muscular fatigue were commemorated at the 2005 International Congress of Physiological Sciences. After receiving his degree in Medicine and Surgery from Turin, Italy, in 1870, Mosso was able to study and interact with renowned physiologists as Wilhelm Ludwig, Du Bois-Reymond, Hugo Kronecker, and Etienne Marey. By 1879, he was Professor of Physiology at the University in Turin, where he conducted research pertaining to blood circulation, respiration, physical education, high-altitude physiology, and muscular fatigue. Using tracings from the ergograph (concentric contractions of the flexor muscles of the middle finger that were volitionally or electrically stimulated), he was able to characterize muscle fatigue and to associate its occurrence with central or peripheral influences. He demonstrated that exercise would increase muscular strength and endurance while prolonging the occurrence of fatigue, which he postulated was a chemical process that involved the production of toxic substances such as carbonic acid. The phenomenon of contracture was described, and his collective studies led to the formulation of laws pertaining to exhaustion and to the 1891 publication of La Fatica (Fatigue). Besides La Fatica, Mosso will be remembered as a scientist with a love for physiology, a concern for the social welfare of his countrymen, and as one who sought to integrate physiological, philosophical, and psychological concepts in his experimental studies.",

We assessed our modifications using formative (laboratory exams, oral presentations, and laboratory reports) and summative evaluations (surveys, laboratory notebook, and an end of semester project). Students appreciated the freedom offered by the new curriculum and the opportunity to engage in the inquiry process. Results from both forms of evaluation showed a marked improvement due to the curricular revisions. Our analyses indicate an increased confidence in students' ability to formulate questions and hypotheses, design experiments, collect and analyze data, and make conclusions.

Mandela School of Medicine (NRMSM; Durban, South Africa) embarked on a problem-based curriculum in which the learning of physiology was integrated with relevant clinical scenarios. Students are expected to gain an understanding of physiology through self-directed research with only certain aspects being covered in large-group resource sessions (LGRSs). It has gradually become evident that this approach has resulted in significant gaps in students' understanding of basic physiological concepts. A survey of student perceptions of needs for physiology was undertaken to gain a better understanding of their perceived problems and also to inform them of proposed curricular changes. Students were asked to what extent they thought physiology was essential for their understanding of pathology, interpretation of patients' clinical signs and presentation of symptoms, and analysis of laboratory results. Students were also invited to detail the difficulties they experienced in understanding in LGRSs on clinical and physiological topics. The results of the survey indicate that greater interaction of students with experts is needed. In particular, students felt that they lacked the basic conceptual foundations essential for the learning and understanding of physiology, since the difficulties that the students identified are mainly terminological and conceptual in nature.",

Three laboratory formats were tested: traditional 1-wk-long cookbook laboratories, two 7-wk-long inquiry laboratories, and one 14-wk-long inquiry laboratory. As the level of inquiry increased, student learning gains on content exams trended upward even while traditional content coverage taught decreased. In a quantitative assessment of content knowledge, students who participated in the 14-wk-long inquiry laboratory format outscored their peers in both 7- and 1-wk-long lab formats on Medical College Admissions Test exam questions (scores of 64.73%, 61.97%, and 53.48%, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). In a qualitative study of student opinions, surveys conducted at the end of semesters where traditional 1-wk laboratories ( n = 167 students) were used had low response rates and predominately negative opinions (only 20% of responses were positive), whereas those who participated in 7-wk ( n = 543) or 14-wk ( n = 308) inquiry laboratories had high response rates and 71% and 96% positive reviews, respectively. In an assessment of traditional content coverage in courses, three indexes were averaged to calculate traditional forms of coverage and showed a decrease by 44% over the study period. We believe that the quantitative and qualitative data support greater student-driven inquiry in the classroom laboratory, which leads to deeper learning in fewer topic areas (less teaching) and can reap gains in scientific thinking and fundamental understanding applicable to a broader range of topic areas (more learning) in introductory biology.",

In the mid-20th century, it was established that α-adrenergic activation inhibits, whereas cholinergic stimulation promotes, insulin secretion; this demonstrated the importance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems in pancreatic endocrine function. It was later established that insulin injected peripherally could act within the brain, leading to the discovery of insulin and insulin receptors within the brain and the receptor-mediated transport of insulin into the central nervous system from endothelial cells. The insulin receptor within the central nervous system is widely distributed, reflecting insulin's diverse range of actions, including acting as an adiposity signal to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure, regulation of systemic glucose responses, altering sympathetic activity, and involvement in cognitive function. As observed with central insulin administration, the pancreatic hormones glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and amylin can each also reduce food intake. Pancreatic and also gut hormones are released cephalically, in what is an important mechanism to prepare the body for a meal and prevent excessive postprandial hyperglycemia.",

Our teaching approach, which focuses on concepts rather than details, encourages quantitative analysis and a logical problem-solving approach. Identifying any dangers to the patient is a vital first step. Concepts such as an “appropriate response” to a given perturbation and the need for electroneutrality in body fluids are used repeatedly. Our Electrolyte Workshop was developed using Flash and followed an iterative design process. Two case-based tutorials were built in this first phase, with one tutorial including an interactive treatment simulation. Users select from a menu of therapies and see the impact of their choices on the patient. Appropriate text messages are displayed, and changes in body compartment sizes, brain size, and plasma sodium concentrations are illustrated via Flash animation. Challenges encountered included a shortage of skilled Flash developers, budgetary constraints, and challenges in communication between the authors and the developers. The application was evaluated via user testing by residents and specialists in internal medicine. Satisfaction was measured with a questionnaire based on the System Usability Scale. The mean System Usability Scale score was 78.4 ± 13.8, indicating a good level of usability. Participants rated the content as being scientifically sound; they liked the teaching approach and felt that concepts were conveyed clearly. They indicated that the application held their interest, that it increased their understanding of hyponatremia, and that they would recommend this learning resource to others.",

As clinician-teachers in a resource-constrained environment, we investigated whether heuristic evaluation of our multimedia e-learning resource by a panel of experts would be an effective and efficient alternative to testing with end users. We engaged six inspectors, whose expertise included usability, e-learning, instructional design, medical informatics, and the content area of nephrology. They applied a set of commonly used heuristics to identify usability problems, assigning severity scores to each problem. The identification of serious problems was compared with problems previously found by user testing. The panel completed their evaluations within 1 wk and identified a total of 22 distinct usability problems, 11 of which were considered serious. The problems violated the heuristics of visibility of system status, user control and freedom, match with the real world, intuitive visual layout, consistency and conformity to standards, aesthetic and minimalist design, error prevention and tolerance, and help and documentation. Compared with user testing, heuristic evaluation found most, but not all, of the serious problems. Combining heuristic evaluation and user testing, with each involving a small number of participants, may be an effective and efficient way of improving the usability of e-learning materials. Heuristic evaluation should ideally be used first to identify the most obvious problems and, once these are fixed, should be followed by testing with typical end users.",

The method of loci (MOL) is a mnemonic device that relies on spatial relationships between “loci” (e.g., locations on a familiar route or rooms in a familiar building) to arrange and recollect memorial content. In the present study, we hypothesized that the use of MOL leads to better understanding of the topic among students, which can be observed through better student performance on assessments. Students were divided into two groups: group 1 was taught insulin and diabetes mellitus through didactic lectures and a self-directed learning session, whereas group 2 was taught insulin and diabetes mellitus through didactic lectures and MOL. Memory palaces for insulin and diabetes mellitus were generated by students under supervision of the teacher and taught by students as well. A questionnaire survey and open-ended questions were given to the participants. Group 2, which underwent didactic lectures followed by a MOL interactive session, showed significantly improved performance on the assessments compared with group 1, which had been taught through didactic lectures and a self-directed learning session. Descriptive analysis showed that all students found MOL to be a helpful technique.",

    "abstract": "Anatomy and physiology interactive video clips were introduced into a blended learning environment, as an optional resource, and were accessed by ~50% of the cohort. Student feedback indicated that clips were engaging, assisted understanding of course content, and provided lecture support. Students could also access two other optional online resources, lecture capture recordings and an interactive atlas of anatomy, and individuals were tracked with respect to their access behavior, learning approach, and subject score. Deep learning was highest among those accessing the clips or atlas or those accessing more online resources, and thus self-regulatory skill development might be a useful approach to increase student access to optional online resources. Those who accessed clips, lecture capture recordings, or atlas achieved a significantly higher subject score than those who did not. When combinations of resources used were considered, we found an approximately linear relationship between number of resources accessed and subject score, with a 16% difference in score between those who accessed none or all of the resources. However, the low resource access rate suggests that academic advantage may not be simply due to the learning support offered by the resources. As students accessing the optional resources tended to be more self-regulated, it may be that it was the extra effort made with respect to other subject resources, rather than just the access to the online resources, that contributed to higher subject score. Further studies are required to establish the relationships between academic performance, optional online resource access, and deep learning.",

Here we report data covering a 3-yr period in a physiology subject that has been redesigned for blended and online presentation. Consistent with previous reports, we show that when we undertook a blended mode of delivery, students demonstrated better grades than traditional modes of teaching; however the absence of didactic teaching in this subject resulted in lower grades overall. Students have very strong positive attitudes to weekly quizzes (80% positive approval) but report ambivalent attitudes to online self-directed learning (61% negative perception), even though they had 2-h weekly facilitated workshops. Overwhelmingly, students who undertook the subject in a self-directed online learning mode requested more face-to-face-teaching (70% of comments). From these data, we suggest that there is a quantifiable benefit to didactic teaching in the blended teaching mode that is not reproduced in online self-directed learning, even when face-to-face guided inquiry-based learning is embedded in the subject.",

Student responses as to how this contributes to their learning satisfaction were investigated using a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of closed- and open-ended questions that were based on three determinants of learning satisfaction: perceived course learnability, learning community support, and perceived learning effectiveness. Regarding course learnability, students responded positively on questions regarding the relevance of the subject for their future careers. However, students identified a number of distractions that prevented them from paying full attention to their studies. As far as learning community support was concerned, respondents indicated that they were more comfortable asking a peer for support if they were unsure of concepts than approaching the lecturing staff. Most of the students study in their second language, and this was identified as a stumbling block for success. There was a difference in opinion among students regarding the use of technology for teaching and learning of anatomy and physiology. From students' perceptions regarding learning effectiveness, it became clear that students' expectations of anatomy and physiology were unrealistic; they did not expect the module to be so comprehensive. Many of the students were also “grade oriented” rather than “learning oriented” as they indicated that they were more concerned about results than “owning” the content of the module. Asking students to evaluate aspects of the teaching and learning process have provided valuable information to improve future offerings of anatomy and physiology.",

TBL is a learner-centered strategy that uses a very structured individual and group accountability process and requires small groups to work together to solve problems. This study served to investigate whether the TBL concept could be modified and adopted to the fifth-year cornea module of an ophthalmology course. Questionnaires (using a Likert scale of 1-5) were distributed to 169 fifth-year medical students attending the cornea module applied as TBL in an ophthalmology course. The questionnaire consisted of two categories: the TBL format (7 items) and an open-ended question about the class (1 item). Feedback was then evaluated. The majority of students felt that modified TBL sessions were better at fulfilling learning objectives (121 students, 71.59%), enabled better understanding (134 students, 79.28%), were more interesting (146 students, 86.39%), ensured greater student participation (123 students, 72.78%), and involved greater effort on the part of students (148 students, 87.57%) compared with traditional teaching methods. Most of the students (129 students, 76.33%) agreed that more such sessions should be organized in the future. In conclusion, after adjustments to improve weaknesses, such as the short time allocation and students' lack of prior background, the outcomes of this modified TBL approach on the cornea module of an ophthalmology course provide a good basis for its continuation.",

While acknowledging this conversation is important, many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty shy away from engaging these topics. STEM educators often hesitate to participate in these discussions due to their self-perceived lack of knowledge or training. However, as institutions welcome ever-diversifying student populations, STEM faculty must consider how their teaching and mentoring approaches affect their students. During the 2018 American Physiological Society (APS) Institute for Teaching and Learning, STEM faculty and administrators engaged in conversations to better understand how their own approaches to diversity, equity, and inclusion affect the success of their students. During my plenary workshop, \"Inclusive Practices for Diverse Student Populations,\" participants investigated their own perspectives and practices. They also discussed approaches to implementing inclusive practices that complement active pedagogical best practices. In an attempt to replicate this workshop environment, I ask you to engage with an interactive set of exercises to investigate your own perspective on the topics of diversity, inclusion, and equity. After you consider your own approaches to these topics, I provide practical examples of inclusive practices that align or enhance active leaning pedagogy. By building confidence, providing support, and promoting various pathways to success, inclusive practices enhance student learning and decrease social disparities in STEM education, ultimately supporting STEM innovation.",

Therefore, we present the concept of the mobile learning laboratory (MobLeLab), which is a collection of smartphone applications that allow scientific data collection, such as physiological variables, for educational purposes. The three types of MobLeLabs (simulators, built-in, and plug-in) are presented, as well as ideas on how to use smartphone sensors to collect physiological data.

Although the data themselves can be consistent with a normal distribution, they need not be. Instead, it is the theoretical distribution of the sample mean or the theoretical distribution of the difference between sample means that must be roughly normal. The most versatile approach to assess normality is to bootstrap the sample mean, the difference between sample means, or t itself. We can then assess whether the distributions of these bootstrap statistics are consistent with a normal distribution by studying their normal quantile plots. If we suspect that an inference we make from a t test may not be justified-if we suspect that the theoretical distribution of the sample mean or the theoretical distribution of the difference between sample means is not normal-then we can use a permutation method to analyze our data.",

    "abstract": "The present study examined the relationship between second-year medical students' group performance and individual performance in a collaborative-learning environment. In recent decades, university professors in the scientific and humanistic disciplines have successfully put into practice different modalities of collaborative approaches to teaching. Essentially, collaborative approach refers to a variety of techniques that involves the joint intellectual effort of a small group of students, which encourages interaction and discussion among students and professors. The present results show the efficacy of collaborative learning, which, furthermore, allowed students to participate actively in the physiology class. Average student's grades were significantly higher when they engaged in single-best-response, multiple-choice tests as a student team, compared with taking the same examinations individually. The method improved notably knowledge retention, as learning is more effective when performed in the context of collaborative partnership. A selected subset of questions answered wrongly in an initial test, both individually and collectively, was used on a second test to examine student retention of studied material. Grade averages were significantly improved, both individually and groupwise, when students responded to the subset of questions a second time, 1, 2, or 3 wk after the first attempt. These results suggest that the collaborative approach to teaching allowed a more effective understanding of course content, which meant an improved capacity for retention of human physiology knowledge.",

Such conditions include changing the environmental context from when some to-be-learned material is studied to when that material is restudied; increasing the delay from when something is studied to when it is tested or restudied; and interleaving, rather than blocking, the study or practice of the components of to-be-learned knowledge or skills.

However, despite its significance, bioscience is a difficult academic hurdle for many students to master. The introduction of active learning strategies, including small team-based guided-inquiry learning approaches, has been shown to significantly reduce this hurdle and improve assessment outcomes for the learner. Guided team-based activities can aid in this approach by also building broader skills and capabilities, like teamwork and communication, as well as subject-specific knowledge and skills, thereby positively influencing student assessment outcomes. This paper details the redesign and evaluation of two first-year Bioscience for Paramedics units with the introduction of guided-inquiry learning, as well as other active learning strategies, and assesses their impact on student performance. Results indicate that active learning used within a classroom and in the large lecture theater setting improved students' grades with positive student perception of their learning experience.",

The value of the basic sciences in primary medical education was assessed by exploring the perceived clinical relevance and test performance trends among medical students, interns, residents, and experienced clinicians. A pilot study conducted in 2014 involved administration of a voluntary 60-item multiple-choice question test to 225 medical students and 4 interns. These participants and 26 teaching clinicians rated the items for clinical relevance. In 2016, a similarly constructed test (main study) was made a mandatory formative assessment, attempted by 563 students in years 2, 4, and 6 and by 120 commencing general practice residents. Test scores, performance trends, clinical relevance ratings, and correlations were assessed using relevant parametric and nonparametric tests. Rank order and pass-fail decisions were also reviewed. The mean test scores were 57% (SD 7.1) and 52% (SD 6.1) for the pilot and main studies, respectively. Highest scores were observed in pathology and social sciences. Overall performance increased with increasing year of study. Test scores were positively correlated with perceived relevance. There were moderate correlations (r = 0.50-0.63; P < 0.001) between participants' scores in the basic science and summative exams. Assessments may be key to fostering relevance and integration of the basic sciences. Benchmarking knowledge retention and result comparisons across topics are useful in program evaluation.",

Despite numerous analyses, few studies have isolated the impact of dissection versus prosection from the numerous variables that are involved in anatomy education. This study used a retrospective design to assess the effect of peer teaching with dissection or prosection on anatomical knowledge retention of the peer teachers. Exam scores were analyzed from three cohorts of students (N = 184) who were enrolled in a Musculoskeletal System course in an allopathic medical school between academic years 2014-2017. Students in the first 2 yr learned anatomy of an assigned region through traditional dissection, whereas students in the third year learned anatomy of the same regions on prosected specimens. The effect of these instructional methods on anatomical knowledge retention was measured by student performance on a teaching-readiness quiz, written exam, and practical examination. One advantage of this study is the stability of variables between cohorts. Student groups peer taught the same objectives; course sequencing and content remained consistent between years; students spent the same amount of time learning their material, regardless of learning modality (dissection or prosection); and students were tested in the same manner. Comparisons of student performance data suggest that anatomy knowledge was equivalent, regardless of the instructional method (dissection or prosected cadavers) but is strongly associated with prior anatomy experience. Findings from this study support previous studies that conclude that there are no disparities in the effectiveness of learning anatomy via dissection or prosection.",

In this study, 60 junior surgical residents of Xiangya Medical College were enrolled. “Diabetic foot” was selected as the content of this study. Residents were divided into an FC-CTBL group and an FC group. FC-CTBL and FC were compared on the basis of residents’ feedback questionnaires, residents’ learning burden, test scores from a pre-quiz, and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE). Residents were more satisfied with the FC-CTBL model compared with FC. In the FC-CTBL group, more participants said that the course improved their teamwork skills, analytical skills and their confidence in tackling unfamiliar problems. Residents in the FC-CTBL group also spent significantly less time preparing for class and performed better in the OSCE than those in the FC group. FC-CTBL stimulates residents’ learning motivation, decreases their workload, improves their performance in the OSCE and may help to enhance clinical thinking and teamwork skills.

We found poor alignment of learning outcomes in programs with physiology majors (or equivalent) from 17 Australian universities and the 15 core concepts developed by a team in the United States. The objective of this project was to reach Australia-wide consensus on a set of core concepts for physiology, which can be embedded in curricula across Australian universities. A four-phase Delphi method was employed, starting with the assembling of a Task Force of physiology educators with extensive teaching and curriculum development expertise from 25 Australian universities. After two online meetings and a survey, the Task Force reached agreement on seven core concepts of physiology and their descriptors, which were then sent out to the physiology educator community across Australia for agreement. The seven core concepts and their associated descriptions were endorsed through this process (n = 138). In addition, embedding the core concepts across the curriculum was supported by both Task Force members (85.7%) and educators (82.1%). The seven adopted core concepts of human physiology were Cell Membrane, Cell-Cell Communication, Movement of Substances, Structure and Function, Homeostasis, Integration, and Physiological Adaptation. The core concepts were subsequently unpacked into themes and subthemes. If adopted, these core concepts will result in consistency across curricula in undergraduate physiology programs and allow for future benchmarking.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first time Australia-wide agreement has been reached on the core concepts of physiology with the Delphi method. Embedding of the core concepts will result in consistency in physiology curricula, improvements to teaching and learning, and benchmarking across Australian universities.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 struck the world suddenly and unexpectedly. Since traditional education requires face-to-face communication, to avoid further spreading of the virus a majority part of that education has moved online. Our study attempts to compare the differences between online medical education with a unique course design and traditional face-to-face education. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a total of 4,098 medical students between 2019 and 2020, including two groups of students who received online education and classroom education for the same subjects, respectively. Freshmen enrolled in September 2018 received traditional classroom physiology and pharmacology education in the spring semester of 2019. Because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, freshmen who were enrolled in September 2019 received online physiology and pharmacology education in the spring semester of 2020. The final marks of the two groups of students were recorded and compared. Data on students participating in online discussions, learning, homework, and watching instructional videos were also recorded. There was no significant difference in the final academic performance between the two groups [average mark: 55.93 (online education) vs. 56.27 (classroom education), P = 0.488]. Further analysis showed that student participation rates in online discussions, online learning, and online viewing of instructional videos were closely correlated with final grades in online courses (P < 0.01). In conclusion, our results suggest that the pedagogical effects of online education during COVID-19 were promising, and we provide a well-designed medical online course to inspire further improvements in online education.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a massive temporary conversion of offline education to online education worldwide. Previous studies have noted that more students believed they had better learning experience in face-to-face learning. However, with our method of online teaching, we still showed a relatively similar performance result compared with offline education.",

    "abstract": "Much of the research on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students' motivation measures the relationship between student motivation and academic outcomes, focusing on the student's mindset. Our mixed-methods research takes a different approach and considers the relationship between student motivation and instructional practices. Teaching practices and student motivation were analyzed simultaneously in undergraduate Biology classes using a self-determination theory-based survey to measure students' motivation during courses that were observed using the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS), and observation notes were collected to document instructor and student behaviors. Quantitative data were used to differentiate students' motivational levels, and qualitative data were collected to describe how instructors use specific teaching practices. The results provide a lens into how students' intrinsic motivation varies alongside the instructional practices and interactions in these classes. We found a correlation between higher levels of student motivation in interactive lectures and student-centered teaching profiles. This study highlights how the same practice can be implemented by multiple instructors with varying student motivation scores, pointing out the importance of fidelity to evidence-based instructional practice methods. The results of this study are discussed in the context of published empirical studies examining evidence-based instructional practices that are conceptually supportive of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Active learning practices observed in this study correlated to positive learning outcomes are discussed and may serve as a guide for instructors interested in implementing specific active learning practices. Recommendations for instructors and departments that are interested in flexible methods to monitor progress toward active learning practices in biology and other STEM disciplines by combining the COPUS and self-determination survey results are presented.",

These tools were developed using two computer programs: the Crossword Construction Kit and The New Puzzle Factory. Instructors are encouraged to optimize the value of the tools by using the additional options presented at the end of each of the puzzles. The additional options encourage students to become active learners by creating their own tools. Although the principles of these four tools can be adapted to many disciplines, these specific games focused on gastrointestinal physiology.

Misconceptions have been studied in a variety of science disciplines, but little attention has been given to the faulty models that students have for physiological processes. In this study 393 undergraduates in three different research universities were asked to predict the changes in heart rate and strength of cardiac contraction and breathing frequency and depth of breathing (physiological parameters that can be directly and personally perceived) under conditions that result in predicted that heart rate would increase but that the strength of contraction would decrease or stay unchanged. Approximately one-half of the students predicted that breathing frequency would increase but depth of breathing would decrease (also erroneous). Explanations for these erroneous predictions were elicited, and the reasons offered revealed significant misconceptions about cardiac and respiratory mechanics. The persistence of such misconceptions was demonstrated in a small group of first-year medical students. A general approach to detecting and remediating misconceptions is discussed.",

The typical representation of the acinus as a \"bunch of grapes\" bears no resemblance to its real anatomy; the alveoli are not independent little balloons. Because of the prevalence of this misconception, Laplace's law, as it applies to spheres, has been invoked as a mechanical model for the forces of alveolar inflation and as an explanation for the necessity of pulmonary surfactant in the alveolus. Alveoli are prismatic or polygonal in shape, i.e., their walls are flat, and Laplace law considerations in their inflation apply only to the very small curved region in the fluid where these walls intersect. Alveoli do not readily collapse into one another because they are suspended in a matrix of connective tissue \"cables\" and share common, often perforated walls, so there can be no pressure differential across them. Surfactant has important functions along planar surfaces of the alveolar wall and in mitigating the forces that tend to close the small airways. Laplace's law as it applies to cylinders is an important feature of the mechanics of airway collapse, but the law as it applies to spheres is not relevant to the individual alveolus.",

    "abstract": "Many human anatomy courses are taught using cat dissection. Alternatives are available, but information regarding learning outcomes is incomplete. In 2003, approximately 120 undergraduates enrolled in a human anatomy course were assigned to one of two treatment groups. In the control group, students performed cat dissections (emphasizing isolation and identification) of the muscular, digestive, and cardiovascular systems. In the experimental treatment group, students built clay sculptures of each human body system. Student learning was evaluated by using both low- and high-difficulty questions. On pre- and postexperiment control exams, there were no significant differences in student performance. On exams after a cat dissection vs. a human-clay sculpting experience, the students in the human-clay sculpting treatment group scored significantly higher than their classmates in the cat dissection group on both the low- and high-difficulty questions. Student attitudes toward dissection and taking future human anatomy courses were also measured. There were no differences in student attitudes at the beginning of the experiment; afterward, students exposed to a cat dissection experience viewed dissection more favorably than students in the human-clay sculpting treatment group. There were no treatment effects on student willingness to take future human anatomy courses. The experimental design makes it difficult to conclude precisely why students assigned to the human-clay sculpting experience performed better on exams, but as each method was performed in this particular human anatomy course, our data indicate that human-clay sculpting may be a viable alternative to cat dissection in an anatomy course in which the students focus on human anatomy.",

Seven days later, students were assigned to the opposite supplementation group before attending a second follow-on lecture, equal in duration to that of week 1. At the conclusion of each lecture, students were required to complete a mood perception questionnaire to assess the perceived level of mood state, concentration, and arousal during the lecture. The results showed that after caffeine consumption, students perceived themselves to be significantly more awake, clear minded, energetic, alert, and anxious ( P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, students also felt they were better able to concentrate and had a greater level of arousal than when the placebo was consumed ( P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the results of this investigation show that university students report enhanced perceptual feelings of behavior and mood state when a low dose of caffeine is consumed 60 min prior to a 75-min academic lecture.",

    "abstract": "A single examination does not fulfill all the functions of assessment. The present study was undertaken to determine the reliability and student satisfaction regarding the objective structured practical examination (OSPE) as a method of assessment of laboratory exercises in physiology before implementing it in the forthcoming university examination. The present study was undertaken in the Department of Physiology of Melaka Manipal Medical College, Manipal Campus, India. During the OSPE, students were made to rotate through 11 stations, of which 8 stations were composed of questions that tested their knowledge and critical thinking and 2 stations were composed of skills that students had to perform before the examiner. One station was kept as the rest station. Performance of the students was assessed by comparing the students' scores in the traditional practical examination (TPE) and OSPE using \"Bland-Altman technique.\" Student perspectives regarding the OSPE were obtained by asking them to respond to a questionnaire. The Bland-Altman plot showed that approximately 63% of the students showed a performance in the scores obtained using the OSPE and TPE within the acceptable limit of 8; 32% of the students scored much above the anticipated difference in the scores, and the rest scored below the anticipated difference in the scores on the OSPE and TPE. Feedback indicated that students were in favor of the OSPE compared with the TPE. Feedback from the students provided scope for improvement before the OSPE was administered for the first time in the forthcoming university examination.",

    "abstract": "The advent of internet-based delivery of basic medical science lectures may unintentionally lead to decreased classroom attendance and participation, thereby creating a distance learning paradigm. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that classroom attendance/participation may be positively correlated with performance on a written examination for first-year medical school instruction. The study subjects consisted of 115 first-year medical students. The introductory respiratory structure-function instruction was designed to include one noncompulsory pretest, four short postinstruction noncompulsory self-evaluation tests that were unannounced as to date and time, and one compulsory comprehensive examination. The relationship between attendance/participation, measured by the number of noncompulsory tests taken, and performance on the comprehensive examination was determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient, one-way ANOVA, and a chi(2)-test of significance. The average score on the pretest was 28%; for the same items on the comprehensive examination (posttest), the average score was 73%. For the 80 students who took the pretest, this translated to an overall score increase of 161%. Attendance/participation in four or five of the noncompulsory tests resulted in an 83.3% pass rate on the comprehensive exam compared with a rate of 52.9% for attendance/participation in three, two, one, or none of the five noncompulsory tests; the overall pass rate was 60.9%. There was a significant association between a high rate of classroom attendance/participation and a high score on the comprehensive examination (Pearson's chi(2) = 8.599, P < 0.01). These findings suggest that classroom attendance/participation may be a significant determinant of performance of medical students on comprehensive examinations in first-year basic medical science courses. It is concluded that a substantial number of first-year medical students in this study could be at risk for poor performance because they may believe that there is an equivalency between internet- and classroom-based instruction in basic medical science courses.",

    "abstract": "This article summarizes a presentation made at the Teaching Refresher Course of the American Physiological Society, which was held at the Experimental Biology meeting in 2007. The intestinal epithelium has important ion transport and barrier functions that contribute pivotally to normal physiological functioning of the intestine and other body systems. These functions are also frequently the target of dysfunction that, in turn, results in specific digestive disease states, such as diarrheal illnesses. Three emerging concepts are discussed with respect to ion transport: the complex interplay of intracellular signals that both activate and inhibit chloride secretion; the role of multiprotein complexes in the regulation of ion transport, taking sodium/hydrogen exchange as an example; and acute and chronic regulation of colonic sodium absorption, involving both sodium channel internalization and de novo synthesis of new channels. Similarly, recently obtained information about the molecular components of epithelial tight junctions and the ways in which tight junctions are regulated both in health and disease are discussed to exemplify ways to teach about intestinal barrier properties. Finally, both genetically determined intestinal diseases and those arising as a result of infections and/or inflammation are described, and these can be used as the means to enhance the basic and clinical relevance of teaching about intestinal epithelial physiology as well as the impact that the understanding of such physiology has had on associated therapeutics. The article also indicates, where relevant, how different approaches may be used effectively to teach related concepts to graduate versus medical/professional student audiences.",

The appeal of the bootstrap is that we can use it to make an inference about some experimental result when the statistical theory is uncertain or even unknown.

The purpose of this study was to investigate sources that stimulate the interest of students in an undergraduate course in zoophysiology. Observations, informal conversational interviews, and responses to a survey were used to identify sources of interest. Five situational variables and one predominantly individual variable are documented to influence the catching of interest of students. The situational variables are live animals, \"Ah-ha!\" experiences, meaningfulness, social involvement, and humor, whereas the predominantly individual variable is background knowledge. We conclude that the situational variables are largely under the control of the faculty and should be considered when planning instruction. By focusing on the enhancement of situational interest in physiology lessons, faculty members can find ways to foster students' involvement in specific content areas and increase levels of academic motivation.",

High-fidelity patient simulators (HFPS) are usually reserved for the clinical years of medical education and are geared to improve clinical decision skills, teamwork, and patient safety. Finding ways to incorporate HFPS into preclinical medical education represents more of a challenge, and there is limited literature regarding its implementation. The main objective of this study was to implement a HFPS activity into a problem-based curriculum to enhance the learning of basic sciences. More specifically, the focus was to aid in student learning of cardiovascular function curves and help students develop heart failure treatment strategies based on basic cardiovascular physiology concepts. Pretests and posttests, along with student surveys, were used to determine student knowledge and perception of learning in two first-year medical school classes. There was an increase of 21% and 22% in the percentage of students achieving correct answers on a posttest compared with their pretest score. The median number of correct questions increased from pretest scores of 2 and 2.5 to posttest scores of 4 and 5 of a possible total of 6 in each respective year. Student survey data showed agreement that the activity aided in learning. This study suggests that a HFPS activity can be implemented during the preclinical years of medical education to address basic science concepts. Additionally, it suggests that student learning of cardiovascular function curves and heart failure strategies are facilitated.",

However, the influence of sex (female vs. male) on this relationship is understudied. Furthermore, there have been several studies examining the impact of attendance on course grades that challenge the conventional wisdom. To address these issues, we determined the effect of class attendance on examination scores for female and male students enrolled in our undergraduate exercise physiology class of 51 students (20 female students and 31 male students). The experiment was designed not to interfere with the normal conduct of the course. Attendance was recorded in each class, and, although regular attendance was encouraged, it was not required and did not factor into the final grades. The final grade reflected the average days of attendance for female students only. Specifically, female students earning a grade above the class average attended 89 ± 4% of the classes; however, female students earning a grade below the class average attended only 64 ± 6% of the classes. In sharp contrast, there was no difference in the number of classes attended for male students earning grades above or below the class average (84 ± 3% vs. 79 ± 5%). Accordingly, some male students were absent frequently but scored above the class average, whereas other male students attended many classes but scored below the class average. Thus, the influence of regular attendance on examination performance is more important for female students than male students.",

Student activities were identical across POGIL variations and highly similar for control. Participants' knowledge was evaluated before (pretest), immediately after (posttest), and 2 wk later (followup). Control and POGIL groups showed no improvement at posttest, whereas NRO and NF groups both recalled more material than at pretest ( P = 0.002 and P &lt; 0.0005, respectively). In a surprise test 2 wk later, control ( P &lt; 0.0005), NRO ( P = 0.03), and NF ( P &lt; 0.0005) groups recalled less than at posttest. The POGIL group showed the smallest drop in knowledge ( P = 0.05). Importantly, the control group's knowledge was below pretest levels ( P &lt; 0.0005), whereas the POGIL, NRO, and NF groups' knowledge was not. Self-assessment of knowledge was consistent across groups at pretest, but POGIL participants had the lowest confidence at posttest and 2 wk later. At followup, the control, NRO, and NF groups showed greater confidence in their knowledge than the POGIL group ( P = 0.03, P = 0.002, and P = 0.004, respectively).

It was conducted over a 4-yr period with first-year undergraduates (∼180 students/cohort) taking a mammalian physiology course, but the procedure adopted would be applicable to any other laboratory-based discipline. The process was found to be efficient in staff time, enabling a summative practical report to be marked in &lt;1 h (&lt;5% of the time that had previously been required for staff marking), facilitating rapid feedback to students on their performance. When samples of the peer-assessed reports were marked by a single member of staff, there was excellent correlation between peer and staff marks ( r = 0.96–0.98), although peer-awarded marks exceeded staff marks by an average of 2.5–3.0%. The validity of peer marking was independent of both the sex of the marker and the staff score awarded to the marker for the same piece of work. Feedback from students was largely positive; they reported that the procedure adopted was effective in increasing their understanding of the underlying physiology and contributed to their understanding of best practice in presenting a laboratory report. Seventy percent of students agreed that it was acceptable for peer assessment to contribute a small (up to 5%) component of the overall mark for the course. The results are discussed in relation to other reports of peer marking, particularly when used to assess an academic product or process in a scientific discipline.",

To explore the effects of different forms of instruction on students' conceptions of and approaches to learning science, two questionnaires were administered before and after the instruction: the Conceptions of Learning Science Questionnaire and the Approaches to Learning Science Questionnaire. Analysis of covariance results revealed that the students in the internet-assisted instruction group showed less agreement than the traditional instruction group in the less advanced conceptions of learning science (such as learning as memorizing and testing). In addition, the internet-assisted instruction group displayed significantly more agreement than the traditional instruction group in more sophisticated conceptions (such as learning as seeing in a new way). Moreover, the internet-assisted instruction group expressed more orientation toward the approaches of deep motive and deep strategy than the traditional instruction group. However, the students in the internet-assisted instruction group also showed more surface motive than the traditional instruction group did.",

This classic paper demonstrates that a progressive decline in apparent viscosity occurs when blood flows through glass capillary tubes of diminishing radius, which was later designated as the \"Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect.\" Subsequent studies have shown that apparent viscosity continues to decline at diameters that correspond to the arteriolar segments of the systemic vascular tree, where the majority of the total peripheral resistance resides and is actively regulated in vivo. The Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect thus reduces microvascular resistance, thereby maintaining local tissue perfusion at a relatively lower blood pressure. The paper by Fåhraeus and Lindqvist can be used as a platform for a plenary discussion of these concepts as well as of the relationships among hematocrit, vessel diameter, red blood cell deformability, and resistance to blood flow and how these factors may affect the work of the heart.",

Real patients were used instead of written scenarios in TBL sessions. This study aimed to compare former lecture-based and the current TBL methods in terms of knowledge retention, in-class learner engagement, and learner reactions. First, we determined in-class engagement and satisfaction of the students for the lectures given in the 2013-2014 academic year. The following year, besides the same criteria, we also determined individual (IRAT) and group readiness test (GRAT) scores in the TBL group. End-of-clerkship exam scores for both groups were recorded. Additionally, opinions of patients about their experiences throughout the TBL process were determined. One year later (2015 for lecture and 2016 for TBL), both groups sat for an MCQ test to determine their knowledge retention levels. We found no difference between groups regarding end-of-clerkship exam scores. The mean knowledge retention test score of the TBL group was significantly higher than that of the lecture group (5.85 ± 1.74 vs. 3.28 ± 1.70). The differences between IRAT, GRAT, and retention test scores in the TBL group were significant. The mean student satisfaction score on a five-point scale was 3.01 ± 0.9 (median = 3) in the lecture group and 4.11 ± 1.1 (median = 4) in the TBL group.

    "abstract": "Notable challenges, such as mental distress, boredom, negative moods, and attitudes, have been associated with learning in the cadaver dissection laboratory (CDL). The ability of background music (BM) to enhance the cognitive abilities of students is well documented. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of BM in the CDL and on stress associated with the dissection experience. After 8 wk of normal dissection without BM, various genres of BM were introduced into the cadaver dissection sessions of 260 medical and dental students for 3 wk. Feedback on the impact of BM on students in the CDL and students' attitude were accessed using a questionnaire. Psychological stress assessment was done using Psychological Stress Measure 9. Two batches of 30 students each were made to dissect same areas of the body for 2 h, one batch with BM playing and the other batch without. The same examination was given to both groups at the end. Over 90% of the participants expressed a desire to incorporate BM into the CDL; 87% of the sampled population that expressed love for music also reported BM to be a very useful tool that could be used to enhance learning conditions in the CDL. A strong positive relationship was established between love for music and its perception as a tool for learning in the CDL ( P &lt; 0.001). Students that studied under the influence of BM had significantly higher scores ( P &lt; 0.001) in the overall examination result. BM reduced the level of stress associated with the dissection experience by ∼33%.",

The design was based largely on the literature on concepts and mechanisms of self-efficacy. A structured telephone survey was conducted with 30 program alumni from the inaugural school who were no longer in high school. Near-term effects, enduring effects, contextual considerations, and diffusion and dissemination were queried. Students reported high incoming attitudes toward STEM education and careers, and these attitudes showed before versus after gains ( P &lt; .05). Students in this modest sample overwhelmingly attributed elevated and enduring levels of impact on their interest and confidence in pursuing a science or healthcare-related career to the program. Additionally, 63% subsequently took additional science or health courses, 73% participated in a job or educational experience that was science related during high school, and 97% went on to college. Four of every five program graduates cited a health-related college major, and 83% offered their strongest recommendation of the program to others. Further study and evaluation of simulation-based experiences that capitalize on informal, naturalistic learning and promote self-efficacy are warranted.",

We therefore performed an exploratory study identifying various factors possibly related to the educational scores of these medical students. Questionnaires were sent out to all first preclinical year medical students, with 79.8% being returned (245/307 questionnaires). Positive correlations were revealed between the premedical year grade point average (pre-MD GPA) and anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry scores ( R = 0.664, 0.521, and 0.653, respectively, P &lt; 0.001 for all) by Pearson's method. Using multiple linear regression analysis, anatomy scores could be predicted by pre-MD GPA, student satisfaction with anatomy, the percentage of expected reading, monthly earnings, reading after class and near exam time, and duration of sleeping periods near exam time ( R = 0.773, R 2 = 0.598, P &lt; 0.001).

Biochemistry scores could be calculated by pre-MD GPA, the percentage of expected reading, motivation to study medicine, student satisfaction with biochemistry, and exam performance expectations ( R = 0.794, R 2 = 0.630, P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, pre-MD GPA and the percentage of expected reading are factors involved in producing good academic results in the first preclinical year.

As researchers, we often express absolute change as percent change so we can account for different initial values of the response. But this creates a problem: percent change is really just a ratio, and a ratio is infamous for its ability to mislead. This means we may fail to find a group difference that does exist, or we may find a group difference that does not exist. What kind of an approach to science is that? In contrast, analysis of covariance is versatile: it can accommodate an analysis of the relationship between absolute change and initial value when percent change is useless.",

The main aim of this study was to provide external validation of internally developed multiple-choice assessments in a new medical school. The CBSE is a practice exam for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and is purchased directly from the NBME. We administered the CBSE five times during the first 2 yr of medical school. Student scores were compared with scores on newly created internal summative exams and to the USMLE Step 1. Significant correlations were observed between almost all our internal exams and CBSE scores over time as well as with USMLE Step 1 scores. The strength of correlations of internal exams to the CBSE and USMLE Step 1 broadly increased over time during the curriculum. Student scores on courses that have strong emphasis on physiology and pathophysiology correlated particularly well with USMLE Step 1 scores. Student progress, as measured by the CBSE, was found to be linear across time, and test performance fell behind the anticipated level by the end of the formal curriculum. These findings are discussed with respect to student learning behaviors. In conclusion, the CBSE was found to have good utility as a progress test and provided external validation of our new internally developed multiple-choice assessments. The data also provide performance benchmarks both for our future students to formatively assess their own progress and for other medical schools to compare learning progression patterns in different curricular models.",

Evaluations are constantly employed in the classroom to assist students in the learning process and to help teachers improve the teaching process. The use of active methodologies encourages students to participate in the learning process, encourages interaction with their peers, and stimulates thinking about physiological mechanisms. This study examined the performance of medical students on physiology over four semesters with and without active engagement methodologies. Four activities were used: a puzzle, a board game, a debate, and a video. The results show that engaging in activities with active methodologies before a physiology cognitive monitoring test significantly improved student performance compared with not performing the activities. We integrate the use of these methodologies with classic lectures, and this integration appears to improve the teaching/learning process in the discipline of physiology and improves the integration of physiology with cardiology and neurology. In addition, students enjoy the activities and perform better on their evaluations when they use them.",

Therefore, a controlled trial to evaluate the impact of testing methodology on examination performance in a veterinary physiology course was designed and implemented. Formalized surveys and focus group discussions were also used to determine student attitudes toward the examination formats. In total, 134 first-year veterinary students and 11 PhD/MS students were administered a total of 4 exams throughout 1 semester (2 on paper and 2 electronically) using a split-halves design. The paper (P) and electronic (E) exams contained 25 identical multiple-choice questions. Students were randomly assigned to two groups and were given exams in one of two sequences (E-P-E-P or P-E-P-E). Participants consented to and completed two anonymous surveys vis à vis their experience. Out of a maximum raw score of 25, the mean score for electronic examinations (20.8; 95% confidence interval, 20.3-21.2) was significantly (P = 0.01) greater than that for paper examinations (20.3; 95% confidence interval, 20.0-20.7). However, students expressed numerous concerns with the electronic examination format, and, at the completion of the study, 87% preferred to take their examination on paper rather than the electronic format. These data show that student attitudes concerning the examination format are not primarily determined by examination results, and that the additional anxiety related to the electronic examination format plays a large role in student attitudes.",

Two consecutive classes of dental students learned the physiology of the autonomic nervous system through the nonflipped (traditional lecture) or the flipped approach. Students' learning was assessed with an identical quiz at the end of the module. The mean score in the flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach ( P < 0.01). Mean score on the content-based quiz questions in the flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach ( P < 0.05). Performance on case-based questions did not show a significant difference ( P = 0.12). Mean quiz performance of the lower 27% scorers in the flipped approach was higher than that in the nonflipped approach ( P < 0.05). Mean quiz performance of the upper 27% scorers showed an increase in the flipped approach as well ( P < 0.05), but to a less extent than that of the lower 27% scorers ( P < 0.01).

To learn if FT improved student performance, scores from the quizzes and exams of a fully flipped classroom with retrieval exercises were compared with those of five semesters of traditional lecture-based [unflipped (UF)] teaching in an undergraduate sophomore-level physiology course. Student attitude surveys were also evaluated. Student performance on both the quizzes and exams was significantly higher in the FT class in general compared with that of the UF teaching. Interestingly, however, when the individual exam scores were compared between the two styles, the scores for students in the FT were significantly higher for exams 2 and 3, yet lower for exam 1. The shift in performance from exam 1 to exams 2 and 3 is likely explained by the need for time to adjust to the new teaching style. Students reported an overall positive perception of FT in their course evaluations at the end of the semester. In conclusion, FT improved student performance compared with that of lecture-based traditional teaching practice, but required some time to adjust in the beginning of the semester.",

Physiotherapy students were more active and social when completing learning tasks and achieved significantly higher grades in physiology compared with students enrolled in Sport and Exercise Science and Occupational Therapy programs. To promote academic engagement and achievement by all three groups, discussion questions, case studies, and study guides were included. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using these modified resources to promote active learning, enhance academic social interactions, and provide a supportive learning environment. The occupational therapy students showed increased academic achievement (from 57.9 to 66.5%) following implementation of the new resources, but there was no change in the already high-performing physiotherapy students (73.1%) and, more concerningly, the sport and exercise science students (from 54.6 to 56.7%). Fewer sport and exercise science students had prior learning in chemistry (30.4% of participants) and also spent little time outside class studying (8 h/wk), compared with the physiotherapy cohort (70.0% chemistry; 13 h/wk studying). Findings of this research demonstrate that creating a supportive and active learning environment are important factors in promoting the learning of physiology for some cohorts. Background knowledge, academic self-regulatory skills, and the experience of teaching staff are factors that must be considered when endeavoring to increase student academic achievement. Future studies should examine the effect of students' academic self-regulation and the use of remedial chemistry classes when learning physiology.",

In the sympathetic release test, the subject is gently heated by placing the feet and calves in a commercially available foot warming pouch or immersing the feet and calves in warm water and wrapping the subject in blankets. Skin blood flow is estimated from measurements of skin temperature in the fingers. Normally skin temperature of the fingers is 65–75°F in cool conditions (environmental temperature: 59–68°F) and rises to 85–95°F during body heating. Deviations in this pattern may mean that there is abnormal sympathetic vasoconstrictor control of skin blood flow. Abnormal skin blood flow can substantially impair an individual's ability to thermoregulate and has important clinical implications. During whole body heating, the skin temperature from three different skin sites is monitored and oral temperature is monitored as an index of core temperature. Students determine the fingertip temperature at which the reflex release of sympathetic activity occurs and its maximal attainment, which reflects the vasodilating capacity of this cutaneous vascular bed. Students should interpret typical sample data for certain clinical conditions (Raynaud's disease, peripheral vascular disease, and postsympathectomy) and explain why there may be altered skin blood flow in these disorders.",

Although the overall average percentage committed to cardiovascular mechanisms in physiology textbooks ( n = 7) was 16.1% and pathology textbooks ( n = 4) was 17.5%, there was less emphasis on mechanisms in most internal medicine textbooks ( n = 6), with a total average of 6.9%. In addition, flow diagrams explaining mechanisms were lacking. However, eMedicine topics ( n = 48) discussed mechanisms adequately in 22.9% (11 of 48) topics, and the percentage of content allocated to cardiovascular mechanisms was higher (15.8%, 46.2 of 292) compared with that of any internal medicine textbooks. Only 29 YouTube videos fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 YouTube were educationally useful, scoring 14.1 ± 0.5 (mean ± SD).

In conclusion, despite the importance of mechanisms, most textbooks and YouTube videos were deficient in cardiovascular mechanisms. eMedicine topics discussed cardiovascular mechanisms for some diseases, but there were no flow diagrams or multimedia explaining mechanisms.

These activities require minimal equipment and are easily adapted to small-group demonstrations or a larger-group inquiry format where students can design a protocol and collect and analyze data from their classmates. Specifically, breath-hold duration is measured during a number of maneuvers, including after end expiration, end inspiration, voluntary prior hyperventilation, and inspired hyperoxia. Further activities illustrate the potential contribution of chemoreflexes through rebreathing and repeated rebreathing after a maximum breath hold. The outcome measures resulting from each intervention are easily visualized and plotted and can comprise a comprehensive data set to illustrate and discuss complex and integrated cardiorespiratory physiology.",

The application of the parasympathetic neurotransmitter ACh at varying concentrations allows students to observe an increase in intestinal smooth muscle tone with increasing concentrations of this muscarinic receptor agonist. Construction of a concentration-effect curve allows students to calculate an EC50 value for ACh and consider some basic concepts surrounding receptor occupancy and activation. Application of the hormone epinephrine to the precontracted intestine allows students to observe the inhibitory effects associated with sympathetic nerve activation. Introduction of the drug atropine to the preparation before a maximal concentration of ACh is applied allows students to observe the inhibitory effect of a competitive antagonist on the physiological response to a receptor agonist. The final experiment involves the observation of the depolarizing effect of K(+) on smooth muscle. Students are also invited to consider why the drugs atropine, codeine, loperamide, and botulinum toxin have medicinal uses in the management of gastrointestinal problems.",

    "abstract": "In physiological education, blended course formats (integration of face-to-face and online instruction) can facilitate increased student learning, performance, and satisfaction in classroom settings. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of using blending course formats in laboratory settings. We evaluated the impact of blended learning on student performance and perceptions in an undergraduate exercise physiology laboratory. Using a randomized, crossover design, four laboratory topics were delivered in either a blended or traditional format. For blended laboratories, content was offloaded to self-paced video demonstrations (∼15 min). Laboratory section 1 (n = 16) completed blended laboratories for 1) neuromuscular power and 2) blood lactate, whereas section 2 (n = 17) completed blended laboratories for 1) maximal O2 consumption and 2) muscle electromyography. Both sections completed the same assignments (scored in a blinded manner using a standardized rubric) and practicum exams (evaluated by two independent investigators). Pre- and postcourse surveys were used to assess student perceptions. Most students (∼79%) watched videos for both blended laboratories. Assignment scores did not differ between blended and traditional laboratories (P = 0.62) or between sections (P = 0.91). Practicum scores did not differ between sections (both P > 0.05). At the end of the course, students' perceived value of the blended format increased (P < 0.01) and a greater percentage of students agreed that learning key foundational content through video demonstrations before class greatly enhanced their learning of course material compared with a preassigned reading (94% vs. 78%, P < 0.01). Blended exercise physiology laboratories provided an alternative method for delivering content that was favorably perceived by students and did not compromise student performance.",

    "abstract": "Spirometers are used globally to diagnose respiratory diseases, and most commercially available spirometers \"correct\" for race. \"Race correction\" is built into the software of spirometers. To evaluate pulmonary function and to make recordings, the operator must enter the subject's race. In fact, the Joint Working Party of the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society recommends the use of race- and ethnic-specific reference values. In the United States, spirometers apply correction factors of 10-15% for individuals labeled \"Black\" and 4-6% for people labeled \"Asian.\" Thus race is purported to be a biologically important and scientifically valid category. However, history suggests that race corrections may represent an implicit bias, discrimination, and racism. Furthermore, this practice masks economic and environmental factors. The flawed logic of innate, racial difference is also considered with disability estimates, preemployment physicals, and clinical diagnoses that rely on the spirometer. Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia (1832) may have initiated this mistaken belief by noting deficiencies of the \"pulmonary apparatus\" of blacks. Plantation physicians used Jefferson's statement to support slavery, believing that forced labor was a way to \"vitalize the blood\" of deficient black slaves. Samuel Cartwright, a Southern physician and slave holder, was the first to use spirometry to record deficiencies in pulmonary function of blacks. A massive study by Benjamin Apthorp Gould (1869) during the Civil War validated his results. The history of slavery created an environment where racial difference in lung capacity become so widely accepted that race correction became a scientifically valid procedure.",

    "abstract": "Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method that offers students the opportunity to develop self-regulatory strategies as an explicit learning outcome. As a multifaceted PBL environment, the guidance of tutors is important to students as they develop self-regulatory learning (SRL) skills and self-efficacy, the most focused motivational element in SRL. The present study examines the relationship between academic achievement and PBL self-efficacy levels, as well as the role played by tutors. A cross-sectional study was conducted with third- year medical students (n = 257; 75%). The SRL perception (SRLP) scale, the self-efficacy for PBL scale (SPBL), tutor evaluation scale (TES), and an achievement test were used to gather data in this study. In every scale, participant scores were higher than the midpoint, which is 3. There were positive correlations between SRL, self-efficacy, and the tutoring scores of tutors. As the correlation between SRLP and achievement was not significant, achievement was removed from the regression equation, and only SPBL and TES results were used. The results of the regression analysis indicated that SPBL and TES explained 36% of the variance. The level of self-efficacy in PBL predicted the students' SRL abilities, as did tutor evaluations. The findings show that students used their SRL skills and had beliefs about their ability to learn effectively in the PBL context. Both the tutors' tutoring skills and the students' self-efficacy made important contributions to improving the students' self-regulated learning skills.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, much criticism against animal use for physiology teaching has been made. Hence, replacement by suitable alternatives has increased in several pedagogical approaches. This study examined students' perceptions of animal versus virtual (video/computer) laboratory classes in physiological sciences associated with the effectiveness of the problem-based learning (PBL) hybrid curriculum. Three cohorts of medical students from the University of Ribeirão Preto, who participated in animal or virtual physiology classes or both, were asked to fill out a 5-point Likert questionnaire about knowledge acquisition/motivation, importance to PBL learning goals, skills acquired, need for animal use, academic formation, learning impairment, and alternative methods. We also assessed their grades in the final exam. A total of 350 students were included, in which 108 participated only in virtual classes, 120 only in practical animal laboratory classes, and 122 in both approaches. The majority agreed that the two methods improved their knowledge acquisition/motivation and helped to reinforce tutorial goals and to acquire skills. However, the cohort who experienced both approaches favored animal laboratory. Students believe animal use is needed and did not impair their learning. Conversely, their opinion about academic formation without animal laboratory classes was divided, as was whether this approach inspired them to seek alternative methods. Despite the different perceptions, there was no difference among the groups' final grades (7.3 ± 1 vs. 7.2 ± 1 vs. 7.2 ± 2 for virtual or practical animal laboratory classes or both, respectively). Therefore, virtual activities are not as effective as animal use in the opinions of the students, but they are successful strategies in physiology learning that can be used in practical classes in a hybrid PBL curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Flipped classroom teaching has been used by many educators to promote active learning in higher education. This andragogy is thought to increase student engagement by making them more accountable for their learning and increase time on task in the classroom. While there are several systematic reviews that point to improved student results, it remains unclear if flipped classrooms have positive learning effects in physiology education. Flipped classroom teaching was introduced in two advanced physiology subjects (advanced neuroscience, semester 1, and cardiorespiratory and renal physiology, semester 2). Changing the mode of content delivery reduced the time students needed to spend listening to lectures by one-third, without sacrificing either learning content or academic standards. Higher pass rates were observed with larger number of students earning distinction and high-distinction grades. Statistically significant improvements in final grades were observed from both subjects (semester 1: 2017, 49.28 ± 20.16; 2018, 53.29 ± 19.77, t268 = 2.058, P = 0.0405; semester 2: 2017, 58.87 ± 21.19; 2018, 67.91 ± 20.40, t111 = 2.306, P = 0.023). Finally, students' perception of their learning experience remained at or above the university benchmarks (median score of >80% for all iterations of the subjects). While the most frequent and persistent area that students suggested could be improved was reduction of content, equal numbers of students commented that no improvement in the subjects was required. Despite the generally positive attitude to recorded didactic teaching content, classroom attendance remained very low, and students did not engage with the active learning content. This suggest that more emphasis needs to be placed on promoting class attendance by developing better active learning content.",

Flipped classroom was introduced to teach respiratory pathophysiology in 2018. We compared the exam results in respiratory pathophysiology in 2017 and 2018 and the exam results in blood pathophysiology from both years (taught by the same teacher, in a traditional way). Groups were compared with Student’s t test. Students answered a survey after finishing the term. Two hundred and one students were examined in 2018 (and 229 in 2017). Gender distribution and the qualifications obtained in general pathology (in the previous year) were comparable in both years. Results in respiratory pathophysiology were significantly better in 2018 than in 2017 (mean: 48 vs. 42 out of 100; P = 0.004), but the results in blood pathophysiology remained similar. The improvement was significant only in students who scored below the median (mean: 40 vs. 33; P = 0.009) and was more evident in male than in female students (mean: 52 vs. 44; P = 0.01) and in those who did not have an academic delay (mean 51 vs. 44; P = 0.002). Most students considered that flipped classroom was more attractive and helped them to learn more and with less effort. Flipped classroom increased medical students’ knowledge acquisitions in pathophysiology. It was more beneficial to male students and those with lower qualifications with no academic delay.",

To keep students engaged with the university, we implemented a teaching-learning model that relates physiology contents to the COVID-19 pandemic using online educational platforms. A 1-mo web course was proposed for health sciences students from the Federal University of Pampa. It included synchronous meetings twice a week and asynchronous activities using scientific articles, case studies, and interactive online tools. The students approved the methodology developed, assessing it as dynamic and innovative. They reported that the activity helped to better understand the relations between COVID-19 and physiological systems. The web course also contributed to the identification of reliable sources of news and stimulated the sharing of scientific content with their families. We concluded that the use of online platforms contextualizing the physiology content considering current events helps students in learning human physiology and improves their abilities to apply this information to their daily life, in this specific case, regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Four focus group interviews were held with 32 medical students, following a determined purposeful sampling method.

The analysis of the students' perceptions of SR revealed 13 themes in the impact of SRT: 7 for medical students, 4 for the medical school, and 2 for the studied target groups. The students explained SR with concepts of responsibility, volunteering, sensitivity, kindness, and community orientation and believed that SRT practices based on service learning effectively deepen the understanding of SR and the needs of the target groups in which they work. Communication, teamwork, leadership, and project management skills were defined as students' achievements. SRT practices had a positive effect on the studied target groups by meeting their physical and emotional needs; furthermore, they increased their medical school's recognition and accountability in society.

Following an initial research cooperation, the Brazilian and German teams decided to replicate some of the POPNeuro activities in Germany. The POPNeuro spin-off developed the first activities in Germany included neuroscience disclosure activities during the TUC Open Campus Day and a Neuroscience of Learning course for sports and physical education teachers. During the activities, participants took a quiz to identify the prevalence of neuromyths and knowledge of neuroscience facts. The results demonstrate a high prevalence of neurotmyths between the different participants. Despite the socio-cultural differences, these results are in line with previous results from POPNeuro in Brazil. Considering our experience and the participants' evaluations, we are confident that promoting the internationalization of this successful neurophysiology outreach program, expanding the Brazilian POPNeuro program in Germany will have a positive impact. This initiative represents a model of international cooperation that should be stimulated.",

    "abstract": "This article explores an innovative educational approach using a metabolic board designed to enhance understanding of muscle metabolism across three endurance training zones: Z1 (light intensity), Z2 (moderate intensity), and Z3 (intense/severe intensity). The aerobic threshold marks the transition from light to moderate domains, and the anaerobic threshold separates moderate from intense domains, with both thresholds adapting to training. Exercises within each training zone elicit specific adaptive responses through distinct signaling pathways, but the metabolic profile induced remains relatively constant across these intensity domains. The assembly of the metabolic board is guided by interpretative questions derived from recent incremental exercise studies. By interacting with the board, students gain clear insights into the rationale for choosing between continuous and interval exercises. This interactive tool simplifies complex physiological processes into understandable components, clarifying the relationships among motor unit types and its metabolism and principal energy sources at each intensity level. By assembling the board, students demystify muscle metabolism as a continuum of responses crucial for sustaining various exercise intensities. This integration of theoretical knowledge with practical application empowers students and professionals to make informed decisions about training prescriptions, a critical element of training periodization.",

    "abstract": "While trust is an essential resource in successful social exchanges, the basis of trust in the student-professor relationship in higher education has not been extensively studied. The purpose of the present study was to gain a better understanding of how trust is developed within a medical school learning environment. To that end, we applied a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews. Interview guides were developed based on the leading model of organizational trust, which posits that trustworthiness can be modeled based on three factors of a trustee, namely their perceived ability, benevolence and integrity. Eleven faculty members and 11 medical students in their core clerkships agreed to participate, providing in-depth viewpoints that were transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Faculty interviews sought to develop a model describing how trust develops in the medical school learning environment and student interviews interrogated how faculty performed within each trust domain to corroborate best practices. The research team applied interpretive-phenomenological analysis to develop consensus around the key themes. Arising from the data we propose a model showing how faculty demonstrate their ability, benevolence and integrity to learners as well as features of a learning environment that promote trust, including positive student traits. Finally, we recommend a series of best practices for faculty wishing to develop a trusting learning climate.",

This study explored the extent to which the creation and usage of LOs might be facilitated by three leading chatbots: ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini Advanced. We posed three main questions, as follows. Question A: When given course content, can chatbots create LOs that are consistent with five best practices in writing LOs? Question B: When given LOs for a low level of the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy, can chatbots convert them to a higher level? Question C: When given LOs, can chatbots create assessment questions that meet six criteria of quality? We explored these questions in the context of four undergraduate courses: Applied Exercise Physiology, Human Anatomy, Human Physiology, and Motor Learning. According to instructor ratings, chatbots had a >70% success rate on most individual criteria for Questions A-C. However, chatbots' \"difficulties\" with a few criteria (e.g., provision of appropriate context for an LO's action, assignment of an appropriate Revised Bloom's taxonomy level) meant that, overall, only 38.3% of chatbot outputs fully met all criteria and thus were possibly ready for use with students. Our findings thus underscore the continuing need for instructor oversight of chatbot outputs, but also illustrate chatbots' potential to expedite the design and improvement of LOs and LO-related curricular materials such as Test Question Templates (TQTs), which directly align LOs with assessment questions.",

    "abstract": "Academic stress is one of the primary factors threatening university students' well-being and performance. Undergraduate students who are working towards applying to medical school, defined as being on the pre-medicine or \"premed\" pathway, are suspected to have higher academic stress compared to their peers who are not premed. However, what factors contribute to academic stress for premed students is not well understood. We sought to answer: Do undergraduates perceive premeds have higher, same, or lower stress than non-premeds? How do academic stress levels between these groups actually differ? What aspects of being premed cause academic stress? and Who has left the premed track and why? We surveyed 551 undergraduates from one large institution in the U.S., and answered our research questions using descriptive statistics, chi-squares, and linear regressions. Overwhelmingly, participants perceived that premed students experience greater academic stress than their counterparts. Yet, we found no significant differences in academic stress reported among students in our sample (p > 0.05). Premed students reported their academic stress was exacerbated by not feeling competitive enough to get into medical school and by needing to maintain a high GPA. Further, students with lower GPAs were more likely to leave the premed track compared to those with higher GPAs (p = 0.005). Students reported leaving the premed track because another career appeared more interesting and because of the toll the premed track took on their mental health. In conclusion, our findings can inform instructors and universities on how to best support premed students.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Medical schools were incorporating active learning strategies in anatomy teaching to accommodate diverse student bodies. Formative assessment and art as a hands-on learning method had been explored as alternatives to traditional teaching methods. Those methods allowed students to practice and assess their understanding of anatomy as they progress. The current study investigated the effectiveness of \"Art in Anatomy\" lab sessions in enhancing preclerkship medical students' comprehension of challenging anatomical topics and determining if differences were related to their year in medical school. Methods: This study involved 41 pre-clinical year medical students at CUSM-SOM who participated in \"Art in Anatomy\" sessions. Results showed pre-session and post-session quiz scores, with differences calculated for first-year and second-year medical students. Results: The study revealed a significant skew in pre- and post-session data, with Year 2 students showing lower mean and smaller range on pre-session quiz scores. Post-session quiz scores showed higher mean and median scores but reversed on post-session. Both Year 1 and Year 2 students showed improved scores, with 68% experiencing a score increase of 0, 1, 3, or 4 points, and 32% experiencing a 2-point increase. Conclusions and Future Directions: Art in Anatomy sessions could effectively support medical students in learning human anatomy during pre-clerkship years. The method provided formative feedback, aiding immediate recall of anatomical knowledge. Future research should explore different art forms and correlate post-session quiz scores with other students' exam scores, such as End of Course, NBME, and practical exam scores.",

At Monash University, there has been a marked increase in student completion of the Physiology Major for the Bachelor of Science degree. Despite the projected employment growth across health professions, medicine remains the prioritized career aspiration for many physiology students. Alumni career paths are insightful to understanding career trends and possibilities, but there is currently no published information on the employment outcomes of Physiology Major graduates. The professional networking LinkedIn platform was used to track Monash University Bachelor of Science alumni, who graduated with a Physiology Major in 2017 and 2018 (n 1/4 286). Searching the alumni by name on LinkedIn identified 63% of these graduates (n 1/4 180), each of whose further study and profession at the time of data collection in 2023 was noted and categorically analyzed using a coding protocol. Physiology graduates were most commonly employed in health professions (43%) followed by research-related careers (18%) and business or law practice (14%). Of the health professions, a quarter of graduates were studying or working in medicine while the rest were working in allied health areas, with physiotherapy being the most common. Among those in research-related careers, just over half pursued doctoral qualification followed by 24% in research assistant roles and 15% in clinical trial coordination. These findings will reinvigorate the undergraduate physiology curriculum to broaden student awareness of and preparedness for career opportunities within the health professions and research workforce. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to report on Physiology Major graduate employment outcomes, using LinkedIn. The data show that almost half of graduates pursued a career in a health profession after completion of their science degree, followed by 18% in a research career and 14% in business or law practice. With gaps in the health profession workforce, greater efforts are necessary to enhance career awareness for Physiology graduates.",

However, limited data exist on SDL resource preferences among medical students in India since the inception of LLM like ChatGPT. To address this, 64 medical students participated in a classroom-based SDL session on anemia. Students freely selected resources during a 40-minute preparation period, followed by 20 minutes of writing responses to a total of five higher-order knowledge questions (i.e., questions start with ‘explain why’). Post-session, they anonymously reported their resource use. Among 63 valid responses, 47.62% used one resource, 39.68% used two, and 14.29% used three. Search engines (61.9%) and LLM chatbots (60.32%) were the most frequently used, followed by textbooks (26.98%), with less reliance on notes, journals, and videos.

Thirty-seven biotechnology students from the Federal University of Paraíba, Brazil, enrolled in human physiology and parasitology courses and participated in the innovative ParasitoPhysioart project. The students were tasked with recreating artworks illustrating key parasitology concepts and their physiological effects on the human body. For instance, one group reinterpreted Wassily Kandinsky's \"Several Circles\" to represent the lifecycle of Toxoplasma gondii and its effect on the eyes, highlighting how the parasite, transmitted through contaminated soil or food, can invade various organs, including the retina and choroid, potentially leading to blindness. Another group reimagined Clovis Jr.'s \"Nossa Senhora Aparecida,\" replacing the original branches with drawings of Ascaris lumbricoides, a parasite transmitted through contaminated fruits or vegetables. The artwork emphasized the parasite's impact on the lungs, which can cause symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. A voluntary survey answered after the project revealed that 62% of students (n=39) considered physiology challenging. However, about 86% reported that the multidisciplinary approach of combining art with scientific concepts motivated them to study and helped them better understand the disciplines. Results suggest that the artistic reinterpretations vividly illustrated the intersection of parasitology and physiology, highlighting this interdisciplinary approach's educational and creative potential.",

    "abstract": "In development the interrelationship between physiology and anatomy is challenging as learners must appreciate how physiological processes and anatomical structures change over time. In addition, the dynamic relationships between structure and function are often concealed largely due to the inaccessibility of the embryo in higher-order organisms. This makes it difficult for students to appreciate normal intricate balances or interpret physiological consequences of developmental disruptions to normal embryological development. In this paper, the applicability of the chick embryo model for use in practical classes is explored as students can observe developmental processes firsthand within a controlled in ovo environment. Practical approaches involved in developing the chick embryo model are described and then expanded to demonstrate how the model can be utilized to showcase the cardiovascular system development as an example. The model is further adapted to explore the effect of teratogenic disruptors such as ethanol on normal cardiovascular processes and highlights how prenatal alcohol exposure results in cardiovascular anomalies associated with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), such as septal defects and altered cardiac physiology. In class, students can directly observe chick development from 0-to-8 days post-fertilisation. Measurable outcomes, such as comparisons in septal thickness, are calculated, while questions and answers to stimulate student discussion around functional changes and the impact of maternal consumption of alcohol are provided as resource material. The method outlined uses relatively inexpensive materials and requires little space, making it a cost-effective educational tool to support student learning of embryology.",

The use of student-generated questions has been studied in medical education and other academic fields but not in undergraduate Anatomy and Physiology (A&amp;P) education. Mixed results from existing literature hint at three possibly important components of effective assignments for students writing test questions: assignment structure, instructor/expert feedback, and alignment with summative assessment. Accordingly, this study investigated the impact of each of these components on students' learning or perceptions of learning. Our methods included (A) a reanalysis of papers on medical student question-writing, (B) a survey of 22 A&amp;P instructors who have tried this method, and (C) detailed studies of efforts at two institutions to implement structured discussion-board assignments in which undergraduate A&amp;P students write and share practice questions. Collectively, these approaches revealed positive correlations between each of the three components and students' learning or perception thereof. In light of these data - especially our students' satisfaction with our implementation of discussion-board assignments - we suggest that structured question-writing and question-sharing activities with instructor feedback and clear connections to summative assessment can increase student engagement and learning.",

Thirty-eight students majoring in integrated Chinese and Western medicine were assigned either the traditional teaching method or the combined BOPPPS-CBL approach. Academic performance and questionnaire surveys were employed to evaluate teaching effectiveness and student satisfaction. The results revealed that the BOPPPS-CBL method significantly improved the average score in the pathology experimental course, increasing from 3.36 to 3.64 points (p&lt; 0.05), and eliminated the proportion of C-level students, which decreased from 10% to 0%. Notably, the average score and performance in the pathology theory course also improved, particularly in questions assessing clinical thinking ability. Moreover, questionnaire surveys indicated that the majority of students were satisfied with the BOPPPS-CBL teaching model, with over 80% advocating for its continued use. In conclusion, the integration of the BOPPPS and CBL models in the pathology experimental course achieved significant improvements in both classroom effectiveness and academic performance.

Traditional resources like plastic models are well-established but may not be accessible to all students. Digital tools, such as interactive 3D models, enhance learning by providing detailed representations of anatomical structures. However, there is limited research on integrating digital tools as supplementary resources rather than primary teaching methods—especially in anatomy education. This study compared the impact of traditional versus digital anatomical tools, used alone and in combination, on students' motivation, engagement, cognitive load, satisfaction, and perceptions of relevance. A total of 471 undergraduate students in a Health Sciences anatomy laboratory (including Health Studies, Kinesiology, and Nursing) were divided into three groups: (1) plastic models, (2) digital anatomy software, or (3) both. Quantitative results showed digital tools increased satisfaction, perceived relevance, and engagement, particularly when combined with plastic models. Interestingly, in some cases, digital tools' impact on motivation subscales varied with academic program, with only Health Studies students showing increased attention. Qualitative feedback highlighted the tactile benefits of plastic models and the flexibility and depth of digital tools. These findings suggest a hybrid approach integrating physical and digital resources can optimize anatomy education by catering to diverse learning preferences, enhancing accessibility, and increasing engagement, particularly for students in less anatomy-intensive programs.",

    "abstract": "What if the best students–the truly curious, creative, and intellectually fearless–are the very ones quietly filtered out by the admissions process? This Personal View confronts a hard truth: the medical admissions process, hailed as rigorous and fair, systematically selects against deep thinkers. By elevating GPA, MCAT scores, and strategically curated experiences, the system rewards compliance, performance, and risk avoidance–traits antithetical to authentic learning. Premedical education has become a crucible of conformity. Students quickly learn that exploration is dangerous, ambiguity is punished, and box-checking is everything. Great students–those who read widely, think deeply, and challenge assumptions–either contort themselves into applicants or quietly walk away. The result? A profession that mistakes obedience for excellence. This piece argues that the admissions process does not just miss great minds–it repels them. The consequence is not merely academic; it‘s clinical. When medicine favors superficial metrics over intellectual vitality, it cultivates practitioners who fear uncertainty, avoid reflection, and cling to algorithms instead of insight. Reform cannot be cosmetic. Holistic review, in its current form, is too often symbolic rather than substantive. If we want physicians who can think beyond protocols and adapt to complexity, we must stop selecting for test-takers and start selecting for thinkers. Until then, we will keep losing our most promising minds–not because they failed the system, but because the system failed them.",

    "abstract": "Educational research has demonstrated that the use of concrete objects or manipulatives in the classroom enhances problem-solving skills and conceptual learning. This project examines the use of manipulatives in a neurophysiology curriculum and assesses their effectiveness on student comprehension. Three activities, building an ion channel, building a nerve cell, and passive membrane properties, were developed using modeling clay and beads as manipulatives. Their effect on learning was assessed in a neurobiology class that had been divided into an experimental group that worked with manipulative-based activities and a control group that did not. After the experimental group had completed the manipulative activity, both groups were given a quiz. Students who had used manipulatives scored significantly better than those who had not. In a second study, students were given a quiz before and after completing a manipulative activity. Students who had used manipulatives showed the greatest grade improvement. These studies suggest that manipulative activities can be used to enhance learning in the neurophysiology curriculum.",

    "abstract": "The roots of physiology lie in laboratory observation, and physiology courses continue to rely on laboratory observation to provide students with practical information to correlate with their developing base of conceptual knowledge. To this end, animal laboratories provide a functioning example of interactions among organ systems and a source of data for student analysis. However, there are continuing objections to using animals for teaching, and animal labs are costly in time and effort. As an alternative laboratory tool, computer software can simulate the operation of multiple organ systems: responses to interventions illustrate intrinsic organ behavior and integrated systems physiology. Advantages of software over animal studies include alteration of variables that are not easily changed in vivo, repeated interventions, and cost-effective hands-on student access. Nevertheless, simulations miss intangible aspects of experimental physiology, and results depend critically on the assumptions of the model. We used both computer and animal demonstrations in teaching cardiovascular physiology to first-year medical students. The students rated both highly, but the computer-based session received a higher rating. We believe that both forms of teaching have educational merit. At the introductory level, the computer appears to provide an effective alternative.",

    "abstract": "We recently developed an educational game for reviewing respiratory physiology in a large classroom. The “Who Wants to be a Physician?” game encouraged medical students to be active participants in the learning process. An evaluation of the game documented that students enjoyed the active format, and the students reported that the game enhanced their ability to understand and retain information. However, the evaluation also revealed that the game had limitations. Specifically, the students recommended the use of multiple-choice questions to match the Medical Board Examination format and to speed up the game (i.e., cover more topics). The students also wanted to increase their level of participation and interaction. Finally, we wanted to emphasize the benefits of peer instruction as a collaborative learning tool. To address these limitations, we designed a new game, “Survivor.” Survivor incorporated multiple-choice questions and emphasized peer instruction and a capacity to gather information and solve novel problems. In addition, participation was increased by including the student audience in the game. Finally, an evaluation instrument was utilized to assess the effectiveness of this instructional tool in an academic setting. As a result of these improvements, the evaluation documents that the newly developed tool is a more effective educational game that couples fun and creative excitement with proven and effective educational concepts.",

The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to investigate the prevalence and persistence of blood circulation misconceptions among prospective elementary teachers and 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of learning activities for discovering what students know and can explain about blood circulation and lung function. The context was an undergraduate introduction to biology course taught by two professors across three semesters at a state university. Independent reviewers identified five categories of erroneous ideas about blood circulation. Many categories still presented problems to students at the end of the course: 70% of prospective elementary teachers did not understand the dual blood circulation pathway, 33% were confused about blood vessels, 55% had wrong ideas about gas exchange, 19% had trouble with gas transport and utilization, and 20% did not understand lung function. Results show that an interview about a drawing as a final exam was significantly better at revealing different errors and a higher frequency of erroneous ideas compared with an essay exam. There is an urgent need for instructional tools to help undergraduate students realize the discrepancies between their own ideas about blood circulation and those of the scientific community.",

Of the 10 misconceptions proposed by the authors, 9 misconceptions were confirmed. Of these nine misconceptions, only one misconception appeared to have been alleviated by the current teaching strategy employed during the progression from level 1 to 3 study. The remaining eight misconceptions prevailed throughout the course of the degree program, suggesting that students enter and leave university with the same misconceptions in certain areas of exercise physiology and biochemistry.

    "abstract": "In this work, we describe the use of several strategies employing the philosophies of active learning and problem-based learning (PBL) that may be used to improve the teaching of metabolic biochemistry to medical and nutritional undergraduate students. The main activities are as follows: 1) a seminar/poster system in a mini-congress format (using topics of applied biochemistry); 2) a true/false applied biochemistry exam (written by peer tutors); 3) a 9-h exam on metabolism (based in real publications); 4) the Advanced Biochemistry course (directed to peer tutors, where students learn how to read and criticize real medical papers); 5) experiments about nutrition and metabolism, using students as volunteers, and about free radicals (real science for students); 6) the BioBio blog (taking advantage of the “web age,” this enhances out of class exchanges of information between the professor, students, and peer tutors); 7) student lectures on public health issues and metabolic disorders directed to the community and lay people; and 8) the BioBio quiz show. The main objective of these activities is to provide students with a more practical and interesting approach to biochemistry, such as the application of theoretical knowledge to real situations (diseases, experiments, media information, and scientific discoveries). In addition, we emphasize the importance of peer tutor activities for optimized learning of both students and peer tutors, the importance of a closer interaction between students and teaching staff, and the necessity to initiate students precociously in two broad fields of medical activity: “real” basic science and contact with the public (also helping students–future doctors and nutritionists–to be able to communicate with lay people). Most activities were evaluated by the students through written questionnaires and informal conversations, along various semesters, indicating good acceptance and approval of these methods. Good student scores in the biochemistry exams and seminars indicated that these activities are also working as valid educational tools.",

During the 3 yr analyzed, 307 students had an average score of 47% (SD 9.9) in the long essay questions and 64% (SD 9.9) in the MCQs. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation ( r = 0.62, P &lt; 0.01) between MCQs and long essay questions. When student performance was grouped by final course grade, a statistically significant correlation between MCQ and long essay scores existed only for the 210 students who received a passing grade ( r = 0.20, P &lt; 0.01). The MCQ and long essay question scores were not correlated for the 57 students who failed ( r = 0.25, P = 0.06) or for the 40 students who achieved honors and distinctions ( r = −0.27, P = 0.11). MCQ scores were significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.01) than essay scores for each of the groups when analyzed by two-way ANOVA. The results of this study suggest that for most students, the strong correlation between scores on MCQs and essay questions indicates that student performance was independent of testing format. For students at either end on the performance spectrum, the lack of correlation suggests that the performance in one of the testing formats had a strong influence on the final course grade. In addition, those students who failed the course were likely to be weak in both testing modalities, whereas students in all grade groups were more likely to perform better in the MCQs than in the long essay questions.",

We suggest that a more narrow focus on scientific thinking, using a new method for reading a series of journal articles that track the evolution of a single project over a period of years, can more realistically convey the excitement and challenges of research science and perhaps stimulate some students to consider research careers for themselves. Our approach, termed \"CREATE\" (for Consider, Read, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze data, and Think of the next Experiment), has proven successful at both demystifying the scientific literature and humanizing science/scientists in undergraduate biology courses (8), and we suggest that it could be profitably expanded to physiology courses.",

In their classic work, they recorded action potentials from single C-fibers of a cutaneous nerve in cats while applying carefully graded stimuli to the skin (Bessou P, Perl ER. Response of cutaneous sensory units with unmyelinated fibers to noxious stimuli. J Neurophysiol 32: 1025–1043, 1969). They discovered polymodal nociceptors, which responded to mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli in the noxious range, and differentiated them from low-threshold thermoreceptors. Their classic findings form the basis of the present method that undergraduate medical students experience during laboratory exercises of sensory physiology, namely, quantitative testing of the thermal detection and pain thresholds. This diagnostic method examines the function of thin afferent nerve fibers. We collected data from nearly 300 students that showed that 1) women are more sensitive to thermal detection and thermal pain at the thenar than men, 2) habituation shifts thermal pain thresholds during repetititve testing, 3) the cold pain threshold is rather variable and lower when tested after heat pain than in the reverse case (order effect), and 4) ratings of pain intensity on a visual analog scale are correlated with the threshold temperature for heat pain but not for cold pain. Median group results could be reproduced in a retest. Quantitative sensory testing of thermal thresholds is feasible and instructive in the setting of a laboratory exercise and is appreciated by the students as a relevant and interesting technique.",

Participants ( n = 250) first read and reread 30 immunology and reproductive physiology concepts and were then repeatedly assessed, without feedback, according to one of the following four randomly assigned schedules: 1) immediately after learning and again 9 and 19 days later [uniform ( days 1, 10, and 20)]; 2) 7, 14, and 21 days after learning [uniform ( days 8, 15, and 22)]; 3) immediately after learning and again 5 and 15 days later [expanding ( days 1, 6, and 16)]; and 4) 1, 6, and 16 days after learning [expanding ( days 2, 7, and 17)]. All participants completed a final assessment 29 days after learning the physiology concepts. Mean final assessment scores ± SE for the uniform ( days 1, 10, and 20), uniform ( days 8, 15, and 22), expanding ( days 1, 6, and 16), and expanding ( days 2, 7, and 17) groups were 36.15 ± 1.97, 32.31 ± 1.87, 45.80 ± 2.56, and 39.71 ± 2.48, respectively. There were no differences in final assessment scores between the two expanding retrieval groups, but expanding ( days 1, 6, and 16) group scores were significantly higher than those in both uniform retrieval groups (ANOVA, F = 6.52, P = 0.00). Also, the combined mean of the two expanding retrieval conditions (42.57 ± 1.80) was significantly higher ( F = 14.09, P = 0.00) than the combined mean of the two uniform retrieval conditions (34.10 ± 1.36). The results indicate that participants benefited more from expanding retrieval practice, particularly when the first assessment was administered immediately after learning.",

    "abstract": "Here we incorporate recent advances in Drosophila neurogenetics and “optogenetics” into neuroscience laboratory exercises. We used the light-activated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and tissue-specific genetic expression techniques to study the neural basis of behavior in Drosophila larvae. We designed and implemented exercises using inexpensive, easy-to-use systems for delivering blue light pulses with fine temporal control. Students first examined the behavioral effects of activating glutamatergic neurons in Drosophila larvae and then recorded excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) mediated by ChR2 activation at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Comparison of electrically and light-evoked EJPs demonstrates that the amplitudes and time courses of light-evoked EJPs are not significantly different from those generated by electrical nerve stimulation. These exercises introduce students to new genetic technology for remotely manipulating neural activity, and they simplify the process of recording EJPs at the Drosophila larval NMJ. Relatively little research work has been done using ChR2 in Drosophila , so students have opportunities to test novel hypotheses and make tangible contributions to the scientific record. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of student experiences suggest that these exercises help convey principles of synaptic transmission while also promoting integrative and inquiry-based studies of genetics, cellular physiology, and animal behavior.",

Permutation methods operate on the observations-the data-we get from an experiment. A permutation procedure answers this question: out of all the possible ways we can rearrange the observations we got, in what proportion of those arrangements is the sample statistic we care about at least as extreme as the one we got?

A total of 152 medical students was followed throughout the first 2 yr of medical education between 2008 and 2010. Students completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and revised form of the Ways of Coping questionnaire both at the beginning of the first year and at the end of the second year. These forms provided data about the characteristics and main coping strategies (problem focused or emotion focused) of the students and revealed the change over time. At the end of the second year, participants also completed a satisfaction questionnaire asking their satisfaction with lectures, problem-based learning, and practicals. The authors used block, problem-based learning, and practical exam scores of the students attained in the past 2 yr as academic achievement indicators. No sociodemographic variable was related to coping strategy. The majority of students (80.9%) adopted problem-focused coping. A shift occurred in the main coping strategies of some students in both sides. Problem-focused coping scores decreased over time. Problem-focused coping positively correlated with satisfaction with practicals and practical exam scores, whereas emotion-focused coping showed the same correlation negatively. The main coping strategy also predicted satisfaction and exam success in practicals. In conclusion, a main coping strategy may be helpful to predict student satisfaction and academic achievement with some student-centered instruction methods. Determining undesired coping strategies may provide an opportunity for intervention to prevent relevant dissatisfaction and failure.",

    "abstract": "The brain relies on the salvage of preformed purine and pyrimidine rings, mainly in the form of nucleosides, to maintain its nucleotide pool in the proper qualitative and quantitative balance. The transport of nucleosides from blood into neurons and glia is considered to be an essential prerequisite to enter their metabolic utilization in the brain. Recent lines of evidence have also suggested that local extracellular nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) degradation may contribute to brain nucleosides. Plasma membrane-located ectonucleotidases, with their active sites oriented toward the extracellular space, catalyze the successive hydrolysis of NTPs to their respective nucleosides. Apart from the well-established modulation of ATP, ADP, adenosine (the purinergic agonists), UTP, and UDP (the pyrimidinergic agonists) availability at their respective receptors, ectonucleotidases may also serve the local reutilization of nucleosides in the brain. After their production in the extracellular space by the ectonucleotidase system, nucleosides are transported into neurons and glia and converted back to NTPs via a set of purine and pyrimidine salvage enzymes. Finally, nucleotides are transported into brain cell vescicles or granules and released back into the extracellular space. The key teaching concepts to be included in a two-to three-lecture block on the molecular mechanisms of the local nucleoside recycling process, based on a cross talk between the brain extracellular space and cytosol, are discussed in this article.",

    "abstract": "In this project, the traditional lecture hall presentation of acid-base physiology in the first-year medical school curriculum was replaced by interactive, computer-assisted instruction designed primarily for the iPad and other mobile computer platforms. Three learning modules were developed, each with ∼20 screens of information, on the subjects of the CO 2 -bicarbonate buffer system, other body buffer systems, and acid-base disorders. Five clinical case modules were also developed. For the learning modules, the interactive, active learning activities were primarily step-by-step learner control of explanations of complex physiological concepts, usually presented graphically. For the clinical cases, the active learning activities were primarily question-and-answer exercises that related clinical findings to the relevant basic science concepts. The student response was remarkably positive, with the interactive, active learning aspect of the instruction cited as the most important feature. Also, students cited the self-paced instruction, extensive use of interactive graphics, and side-by-side presentation of text and graphics as positive features. Most students reported that it took less time to study the subject matter with this online instruction compared with subject matter presented in the lecture hall. However, the approach to learning was highly examination driven, with most students delaying the study of the subject matter until a few days before the scheduled examination. Wider implementation of active learning computer-assisted instruction will require that instructors present subject matter interactively, that students fully embrace the responsibilities of independent learning, and that institutional administrations measure instructional effort by criteria other than scheduled hours of instruction.",

Although the roots of this knowledge date back to the Vedic and post-Vedic eras, it is generally believed that a dedicated branch for healthcare was gradually established approximately between 400 BCE and 200 CE. Probably because the language of documentation of these early textbooks is in Sanskrit, a language that is not in day-to-day use among the general population even in India, many significant contributions of Ayurveda have remained unrecognized in the literature related to the history of medicine. In this communication, the discovery of blood circulation has been taken up as a case, and a few important references from the representative Ayurveda compendia that hint at a preliminary understanding of the cardiovascular system as a “closed circuit” and the heart acting as a pump have been reviewed. The central argument of this review is that these contributions from Ayurveda too must be recorded and credited when reviewing the milestones in the history of medicine, as Ayurveda can still possibly guide various streams of the current sciences, if revisited with this spirit.",

    "abstract": "Students entering medical college generally show vast diversity in their school education. It becomes the responsibility of teachers to motivate students and meet the needs of all diversities. One such measure is teaching students in their own preferred learning style. The present study was aimed to incorporate a learning style-based teaching-learning program for medical students and to reveal its significance and utility. Learning styles of students were assessed online using the visual-auditory-kinesthetic (VAK) learning style self-assessment questionnaire. When respiratory physiology was taught, students were divided into three groups, namely, visual ( n = 34), auditory ( n = 44), and kinesthetic ( n = 28), based on their learning style. A fourth group (the traditional group; n = 40) was formed by choosing students randomly from the above three groups. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic groups were taught following the appropriate teaching-learning strategies. The traditional group was taught via the routine didactic lecture method. The effectiveness of this intervention was evaluated by a pretest and two posttests, posttest 1 immediately after the intervention and posttest 2 after a month. In posttest 1, one-way ANOVA showed a significant statistical difference ( P=0.005). Post hoc analysis showed significance between the kinesthetic group and traditional group ( P=0.002). One-way ANOVA showed a significant difference in posttest 2 scores ( P &lt; 0.0001). Post hoc analysis showed significance between the three learning style-based groups compared with the traditional group [visual vs. traditional groups (p=0.002), auditory vs. traditional groups (p=0.03), and Kinesthetic vs. traditional groups (p=0.001)]. This study emphasizes that teaching methods tailored to students' style of learning definitely improve their understanding, performance, and retrieval of the subject.",

The primary purpose of this study was to determine if a series of very brief retrieval quizzes could significantly improve the retention of previously tested information throughout an anatomy and physiology course. A second purpose was to determine if there were any significant differences between expanding and uniform patterns of retrieval that followed a standardized initial retrieval delay. Anatomy and physiology students were assigned to either a control group or groups that were repeatedly prompted to retrieve a subset of previously tested course information via a series of quizzes that were administered on either an expanding or a uniform schedule. Each retrieval group completed a total of 10 retrieval quizzes, and the series of quizzes required (only) a total of 2 h to complete. Final retention of the exam subset material was assessed during the last week of the semester. There were no significant differences between the expanding and uniform retrieval groups, but both retained an average of 41% more of the subset material than did the control group (ANOVA, F = 129.8, P = 0.00, η p 2 = 0.36). In conclusion, retrieval practice is a highly efficient and effective strategy for enhancing the retention of anatomy and physiology material.",

In this regard, Captain America's performances in several movies to date can be used to explain actual science. Granted, script writers and movie directors may or may not be interested in whether the physical performances they depict can be explained, but that is irrelevant. The point is to make a connection using science to explain how the superhero can run faster, jump higher, or lift more than is humanly possible.

    "abstract": "Auscultation torsos are widely used to teach position-dependent heart sounds and murmurs. To provide a more realistic teaching experience, both whole body auscultation mannequins and torsos have been used in clinical examination skills training at the Medical Faculty of the University of Muenster since the winter term of 2008-2009. This training has since been extended by simulated patients, which are normal, healthy subjects who have undergone attachment of the electronic components of the auscultation mannequins to their chests to mimic pathophysiological conditions (\"hybrid models\"). The acceptance of this new learning method was examined in the present pilot study. In total, 143 students in their second preclinical year who were participating in auscultation training were randomized into an intervention group (hybrid models) and a control group (auscultation mannequins). One hundred forty-two (99.3%) of these students completed a self-assessment Likert-scale questionnaire regarding different teaching approaches (where 1 = \"very poor\" to 100 = \"very good\"). The questionnaire focused on the \"value of learning\" of different teaching approaches. Direct comparison showed that students evaluated the hybrid models to be significantly more effective than the auscultation mannequins (median: 83 vs. 64, P < 0.001). The cardiac auscultation training was generally assessed positively (median: 88). Additionally, verbal feedback was obtained from simulated patients and tutors (trained students who had successfully passed the course a few semesters earlier). Personal feedback showed high satisfaction from student tutors and simulated patients. Hybrid simulators for teaching cardiac auscultation elucidated positive responses from students, tutors, and simulated patients.",

    "abstract": "While the first year of medical school is challenging for all students, there may be specific issues for students from rural areas, economically disadvantaged backgrounds, ethnic minorities, or nontraditional age groups. A Summer Prematriculation Program (SPP) was created to prepare entering at-risk students for the demands of medical school. For the past 2 yr, an emphasis was placed on the development of appropriate study plans and skills. On presurveys, students predicted an increase in their number of study hours per lecture hour, from 7.6 h in undergraduate coursework to 9.1 h in medical school coursework ( n = 35). These study plans were infeasible given the rigorous didactic lecture schedule in medical school. Interventions were made through lectures on study plans and modeling of appropriate study habits using engaging lectures in the SPP physiology course. At the end of the program, a postsurvey was given, and students reported a reduction in the planned hours of study to a more realistic 3.9 h of study time per hour of lecture. Furthermore, students planned to decrease their use of textbooks while increasing their use of concept mapping, videos, and peer teaching. The majority of students completing the SPP program with a study skills emphasis performed well in the Medical Physiology course, with 4 students honoring in the course, 27 students passing, and 2 students remediating the course after an initial failure. These results indicate that at-risk medical students may have inappropriate study plans that can be improved through participation in a program that emphasizes study skills development.",

    "abstract": "Calls for reform in science education have promoted active learning as a means to improve student engagement (SENG). SENG is generally acknowledged to have a positive effect on student learning, satisfaction, and retention. A validated 14-question survey was used to assess SENG in a variety of upper- and lower-level physiology courses, including 100-level Anatomy and Physiology 1, 300-level Animal Physiology, 400-level Advanced Physiology, and 500-level Medical Physiology courses. The results indicated that SENG did not vary consistently by course level, format, or curriculum. The highest levels of SENG were found in the Advanced Physiology course, which included SENG as a primary objective of the course. Physiology student SENG scores were compared with National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) scores. The results demonstrated that physiology students enrolled in the Anatomy and Physiology 1 course reported lower levels of SENG than first-year students that completed the NSSE. Students enrolled in the Advanced Physiology course reported higher levels of SENG than fourth-year students that completed the NSSE. Assessment of SENG offers insights as to how engaged students are, identifies where efforts may best be applied to enhance SENG, and provides a baseline measure for future comparisons after targeted course modifications.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, institutions of higher education are adopting fully online degree programs to provide students with cost-effective, accessible postsecondary education. A concern these degrees raise is: Will students be prepared for the next step of their career paths after completing their Bachelor’s degree online? Biology undergraduates often begin their degrees wanting to become medical doctors, but no studies have explored whether students in a fully online biology degree program are being prepared to be admitted to medical school. In this study, we surveyed Introductory Biology students at one institution who were pursuing Bachelor of Science degrees in Biological Sciences, either in an online or an in-person program. The most prevalent career goal for both in-person students (65.2%) and online students (39.7%) was a medical doctor. Online students were more confident in their intentions to become doctors than their in-person peers. However, online students knew fewer criteria that medical schools consider when admitting students than in-person students [in-person: mean = 3.7 (SD 1.6); online: mean =2.7 (SD 1.7)] and were less likely to plan to become involved in premedical activities, such as undergraduate research. Finally, compared with in-person students, fewer online students were able to name at least one science student (in-person: 76.7%; online: 9.7%), academic advisor (in-person: 21.3%; online: 6.5%), and faculty member (in-person: 33.7%; online: 6.5%) with whom they could talk about pursuing a career in medicine. This work highlights knowledge gaps between students enrolled in a fully online biology degree and an in-person biology degree that are important for developers of online biology degree programs to understand and rectify to better prepare online biology students for admission to medical school.",

Our hope is that the insights we gained during a 4-yr journey in a new medical school will be transferable to others engaged with curriculum development. Here, we present an interpretive analysis of our personal experiences together with some original research data and a synthesis of the literature. We will argue that a focus on teaching faculty is the key to successful curriculum integration and suggest an agenda for faculty development. Our essay begins by exploring what curriculum integration really means and what its purpose might be. Our case study explores the challenges of building a shared understanding among stakeholders and of negotiating learning outcomes and methods of teaching as well as the process of developing content and assessment. We feel that many of our experiences in the new medical school are applicable in other settings, such as curriculum reform in established schools and for developers of competency-based premedical curricula. We conclude with recommendations to assist other curriculum planners and teachers by offering some benefits of hindsight.",

Exercise science undergraduate students (n= 242) filled out a survey containing questions of demographic characteristics, achievement goals, social-cultural attitudes toward appearance (using Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-3), and obesity bias measurements (using the antifat attitudes test and fat phobia scale). The results indicated that students were explicitly biased toward overweight and obese individuals, held had high task and ego goals, and had high internalization of an athletic body type ideal, as determined by mean scores being above the median values for each scale. Internalization of the athletic body type predicted obesity bias for fat phobia, weight control blame, and physical/romantic attractiveness. In conclusion, exercise science students may enter programs socialized from society and sport, and, potentially, these psychosocial attitudes and beliefs may have implications to working with future clients, especially for those of the general population and those whose body shape and size are different than themselves.",

Aligned with the conceptual frameworks of Core Principles of Physiology, and Vision and Change Core Concepts, Phys-MAPS can be used to evaluate student learning of core physiology concepts at multiple time points in an undergraduate physiology program, providing a valuable longitudinal tool to gain insight into student thinking and aid in the data-driven reform of physiology curricula. Phys-MAPS questions have a modified multiple true/false design and were developed using an iterative process, including student interviews and physiology expert review to verify scientific accuracy, appropriateness for physiology majors, and clarity. The final version of Phys-MAPS was tested with 2,600 students across 13 universities, has evidence of reliability, and has no significant statement biases. Over 90% of the physiology experts surveyed agreed that each Phys-MAPS statement was scientifically accurate and relevant to a physiology major. When testing each statement for bias, differential item functioning analysis demonstrated only a small effect size (<0.008) of any tested demographic variable. Regarding student performance, Phys-MAPS can also distinguish between lower and upper division students, both across different institutions (average overall scores increase with each level of class standing; two-way ANOVA, P < 0.001) and within each of three sample institutions (each ANOVA, P ≤ 0.001). Furthermore, at the level of individual concepts, only evolution and homeostasis do not demonstrate the typical increase across class standing, suggesting these concepts likely present consistent conceptual challenges for physiology students.",

The identification of learning styles using subjective evidence from VARK questionnaires (where V is visual, A is auditory, R is read/write, and K is kinesthetic) combined with objective evidence from visual event-related potential (vERP) studies has never been investigated. It is questionable whether picture superiority effects exist in V learners and R learners. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate whether vERP could show the relationship between vERP components and VARK learning styles and to identify the existence of picture superiority effects in V learners and R learners. Thirty medical students (15 V learners and 15 R learners) performed recognition tasks with vERP and an intermediate-term memory (ITM) test. The results of within-group comparisons showed that pictures elicited larger P200 amplitudes than words at the occipital 2 site (P < 0.05) in V learners and at the occipital 1 and 2 sites (P < 0.05) in R learners. The between-groups comparison showed that P200 amplitudes elicited by pictures in V learners were larger than those of R learners at the parietal 4 site (P < 0.05). The ITM test result showed that a picture set showed distinctively more correct responses than that of a word set for both V learners (P < 0.001) and R learners (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the result indicated that the P200 amplitude at the parietal 4 site could be used to objectively distinguish V learners from R learners. A lateralization existed to the right brain (occipital 2 site) in V learners. The ITM test demonstrated the existence of picture superiority effects in both learners. The results revealed the first objective electrophysiological evidence partially supporting the validity of the subjective psychological VARK questionnaire study.",

    "abstract": "Current physical activity (PA) guidelines recommend that children accumulate at least 60 min of PA each day, and that adults should collaborate across sectors to increase opportunities for PA. Implementing brief classroom PA breaks (CPABs) is one way to help increase daily PA. The primary purpose of this study was to determine perceptions of a 14-wk CPAB program among elementary school children, in the first through fourth grades ( n = 254), at a suburban elementary school, and their teachers ( n = 18). The CPAB program was implemented by university exercise science students, and student and teacher perceptions were assessed through surveys. The children reported that the CPABs were very fun (86%), provided them with a nice break during the school day (88%), were very good for their health (94%), helped them feel more ready to learn (71%), and learn better (50%). The teachers reported that the students really enjoyed the CPABs (100%), that encouraging students to be physically active was either very important (83%) or important (17%), and that they were either very confident (72%) or confident (28%) that they themselves could lead the CPABs. No teacher reported that the CPABs hindered classroom learning. CPABs appear to be enjoyable to both students and teachers, easy to administer, and supportive of learning. Recommendations for improvements within the present collaboration were minimal and could be easily addressed with firmer entrenchment of the program. This collaboration was beneficial and fun for the vast majority involved, and others are urged to implement similar programs.",

    "abstract": "This laboratory session provides hands-on experience for students to visualize the beating human heart with ultrasound imaging. Simple views are obtained from which students can directly measure important cardiac dimensions in systole and diastole. This allows students to derive, from first principles, important measures of cardiac function, such as stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output. By repeating the measurements from a subject after a brief exercise period, an increase in stroke volume and ejection fraction are easily demonstrable, potentially with or without an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (which indicates preload). Thus, factors that affect cardiac performance can readily be discussed. This activity may be performed as a practical demonstration and visualized using an overhead projector or networked computers, concentrating on using the ultrasound images to teach basic physiological principles. This has proved to be highly popular with students, who reported a significant improvement in their understanding of Frank-Starling's law of the heart with ultrasound imaging.",

    "abstract": "Team-based learning (TBL) is an emerging teaching and learning strategy being employed in medical schools. The College of Medicine at Alfaisal University has adopted a TBL approach as an instructional method for first-year medical students. The aim of the present study was to describe the TBL method employed at Alfaisal University College of Medicine and to assess first-year medical students' perceptions of this learning modality for the anatomy- and physiology-based blocks/courses in organ systems form of curriculum. A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was structured based on Kirkpatrick's theory and assessed three major domains: reaction, learning, and behavior. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Cronbach's α-coefficient tests were used to assess the validity and reliability of the construct, respectively. CFA showed an adequate validity of the survey and Cronbach's α revealed an acceptable internal uniformity (0.69). A total of 185 respondents rated reaction, learning, and behavior toward introduction of TBL as 3.53 ± 1.01, 3.59 ± 1.12, and 3.57 ± 1.12, respectively. Excellent students rated TBL highly in all major domains compared with borderline students (reaction, behavior, and learning domains with P values of <0.049, <0.035, and <0.031, respectively). Students who had prior teamwork experience rated TBL higher in terms of their learning experience compared with those who were rarely involved in team work. This study demonstrated that Alfaisal University first-year medical students perceived TBL positively as a teaching and learning strategy for functional anatomy, and prior involvement in teamwork and academic performance correlates with higher ratings of TBL.",

Visual models have the potential to enhance learning environments by providing visual representations of complex mechanisms. Despite their benefits, the use of visual models in undergraduate classrooms is still limited. For this study, we tested the effect of a learning sequence of activities related to the cardiac cycle using an augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones and tablets. We were interested in understanding the ability of students to draw and label figures reflecting cardiac function after experiencing the learning sequence using AR. Undergraduate students of the biomedical sciences (control n = 43, experimental n = 58) were enrolled in the course, and their drawings were evaluated using multiple levels of complexity (1 = basic to 5 = complex) through a pre-/posttest structure that included a learning sequence based on AR in the experimental group and regular lecture-based activities in the control group. The complexity of students’ drawings was evaluated on the anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects of heart contraction. We used Cohen’s kappa index for interrater reliability when determining the complexity of drawings. Control and experimental groups showed no differences in baseline knowledge (preexamination quiz). The students who experienced the AR activities showed an increase in the complexity of representation levels in posttest results and also showed a significant difference in scores for the final exam in the heart physiology course. Our results indicate that using AR enhances the comprehension of anatomical and physiological concepts of the cardiac cycle for undergraduate biomedical students.",

In a following class, the students provided saliva samples to evaluate their levels of stress, received an anxiety test, and then undertook an exam to assess their understanding of the cardiac cycle. The traditional teaching methodology consisted of two lectures (∼2-h duration) on blood pressure control systems, delivered orally. In the third class, the students provided saliva samples, received an anxiety test, and then undertook an exam to assess their understanding of blood pressure control systems. The level of stress was assessed with the concentrations of the stress biomarkers cortisol and alpha-amylase in saliva. Anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire. The students achieved significantly higher average scores in exams when the active learning strategy was applied compared with the use of traditional theoretical classes. The active methodology resulted in significantly lower levels of stress and anxiety, as well as improved student performance, compared with the use of traditional lectures.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic required a shift to online learning that posed particular challenges for the education of dental students. Basic science courses were presented in an online, asynchronous format to facilitate small group rotations through preclinical work. The success of active learning was previously examined in a Dental Physiology course, and it was desired to reassess those methods in an online environment. Students were provided with prerecorded lectures containing learning activities, and the effectiveness was compared with traditional lecture recordings. On surveys, dental students had more positive perceptions of online recordings that incorporated active learning strategies, with higher perceived effectiveness of the lecturer, ability to pay attention, motivation to study, and confidence with the material. This was similar to the previous study, in which face-2-face (F2F) active learning was more positively reviewed than traditional lectures. Compared with these past sections, the online cohort expressed similarly positive perceptions of the active learning sections, but the online traditional lectures were perceived to be less effective than F2F lectures. Despite the differences in student perceptions, unit exam scores were similar for didactic lectures in both online and F2F settings. Unit exam scores were significantly higher when active learning strategies were employed, with the highest performance levels in the F2F cohort. While active learning strategies continue to be effective, further research is needed to optimize these methods and engage students in online coursework. The results suggest the importance of active and collaborative learning opportunities in the education of students in physiology coursework.",

Students were required to make an oral presentation on designated clinical scenarios before and after the sessions, without prior notice, as an indicator of performance. In addition, questionnaires focusing on behavioral changes, awareness, and confidence of mastering EBM were administered before and after the sessions to assess the attitudinal and behavioral impact of the intervention on the participants. We found evidence of better postprogram performance in utilizing EBM-relevant concepts and resources when the enrolled medical students were giving oral presentations. Moreover, the participants reported increased awareness of EBM and, behaviorally, increased utilization of EBM-relevant resources provided by libraries. Also, they reported improvement on appropriately using EBM-relevant resources, and 99% of the participants reported strong confidence in practicing EBM. In conclusion, modules on EBM implemented with EMDs benefitted medical students in scenario-oriented PBL tutorials. Improvements in awareness, behavior, confidence, and performance in mastering EBM were noted.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 crisis necessitated abrupt transition to remote learning in medical schools. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on French undergraduate students and teachers, to identify practice changes, and to evaluate successes and areas for improvement of this remote learning experience. Data from 2 online questionnaires were analyzed with 509 participants among students and 189 among teachers from Sorbonne University. Responses to multiple choice, Likert response scale, and open-ended questions were evaluated. COVID-19 had negative impact on teaching continuity. Sixty-seven percent of students were in a dropout situation, and many suffered from psychological stress, leading to set up of a psychological support unit. Although most teachers (81%) and students (72%) had limited knowledge of digital resources, distance learning was quickly implemented, with a predominant use of Zoom. The analysis of several parameters revealed that students were significantly more satisfied than teachers by remote learning. Nevertheless, both students and teachers agreed to replace classical lectures by digital media and to promote in-person teaching in small interactive groups. This paper shares tips for faculty rapidly establishing remote learning. This comparative study of the students’ and teachers’ points of view underlines that new medical curricula should include more digital contents. We make recommendations regarding general university organization, equipment, and curricular development for long-term implementation of digital resources with reinforced relationships between faculty and students.",

However, the applicability of these pedagogies in laboratory courses remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the academic performance, proficiency in procedural skills, and perception of nursing students in physiology laboratory classes delivered with nontraditional classroom (NTC) pedagogies comprising the combination of e-learning, peer teaching, and flipped classroom. Each class was subdivided into two equal halves by successive student identification (ID) number and randomly assigned to the control or NTC group. Compared to the control class, NTC teaching significantly enhanced mean score of six preclass tests (67.77 ± 9.83 vs. 62.94 ± 9.70), with \"B\" graders increased obviously, suggesting that preclass e-learning was more effective than textbook-based preview, especially for general grasp of the topic. Similarly, average scores on postclass quizzes in the NTC group were improved (79.40 ± 9.12 vs. 74.43 ± 8.88). Lesser time cost and higher success rates were observed in trachea, artery, and heart catheterizations in the NTC group, although no disparities were found in ureteral intubation. The majority (∼74%) of students supported the reform and shared positive experiences with NTC methodology. They reported that virtual experiments and self-paced procedural skill videos affected pre- and in-class learning outcomes most, respectively. These findings indicated that NTC pedagogy was workable to improve students' subject scores and proficiency in complicated and direct-viewing procedural skills and was favorable to students.",

However, there is little evidence on the feasibility of online physiology teaching. This study demonstrated a 3-wk preliminary online physiology course based on Rain Classroom assisted by the mobile application WeChat. Eighty-seven nursing undergraduate students attended an online physiology course during the spring semester of the 2019-2020 academic year from March 9 to March 29. We determined the effects of the online physiology learning based on in-class tests, preclass preparation, and review rates for the course materials. We also measured the students' perceptions and attitudes about online learning with a questionnaire survey. Posttest scores from the first week to the third week in online physiology course (7.22 ± 1.83, 7.68 ± 2.09, and 6.21 ± 2.92, respectively) exceeded the pretest scores (5.32 ± 2.14, 6.26 ± 2.49, and 3.72 ± 2.22, respectively), and this finding was statistically significant (all P < 0.001). Moreover, the pretest scores were significant positive predictors of final grade (all P < 0.01). In addition, the percentage of preclass preparation increased in 3 wk, from 43.68% to 57.47% to 68.97%. From the first week to the third week, the review rate increased from 86.21% to 91.95%; however, the second week was the lowest of all (72.41%). Finally, students' perceptions about their online physiology learning experiences were favorable. In conclusion, online physiology instruction based on Rain Classroom assisted by WeChat was an effective strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The high demand for health professionals has led to increased demand for anatomy and physiology (A&P) courses and a transition to hybrid-style labs to meet the necessary increased enrollment without increasing the need for lab space and compromising educational quality. The transition to hybrid-style labs has only accelerated and become more important with the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been relatively unclear, however, how the hybrid style has impacted student learning, satisfaction, and performance. Furthermore, there is a general lack of research investigating the advantages and disadvantages across hybrid, online, and face-to-face styles. This lack of research is particularly obvious within biological sciences, including A&P. Attendance, practical grades, and overall grades were compared between face-to-face, hybrid, and online A&P lab styles. A survey was administered to compare student perceptions and experiences between hybrid and online lab styles. The hybrid style had many of the same advantages as online and face-to-face styles yet very few disadvantages. Hybrid lab students reported better experiences and greater satisfaction, attended more labs, and outperformed online lab students. Face-to-face lab students, however, outperformed hybrid lab students.

    "abstract": "The Physiology Core Concept of flow down gradients is a major concept in physiology, as pressure gradients are the key driving force for the bulk flow of fluids in biology. However, students struggle to understand that this principle is foundational to the mechanisms governing bulk flow across diverse physiological systems (e.g., blood flow, phloem sap flow). Our objective was to investigate whether bulk flow items that differ in scenario context (i.e., taxa, amount of scientific terminology, living or nonliving system) or in which aspect of the pressure gradient is kept constant (i.e., starting pressure or pressure gradient) influence undergraduate students' reasoning. Item scenario context did not impact the type of reasoning students used. However, students were more likely to use the Physiology Core Concept of \"flow down [pressure] gradients\" when the pressure gradient was kept constant and less likely to use this concept when the starting pressure was kept constant. We also investigated whether item scenario context or which aspect of the pressure gradient is kept constant impacted how consistent students were in the type of reasoning they used across two bulk flow items on the same homework. Most students were consistent across item scenario contexts (76%) and aspects of the pressure gradient kept constant (70%). Students who reasoned using \"flow down gradients\" on the first item were the most consistent (86, 89%), whereas students using \"pressures indicate (but don't cause) flow\" were the least consistent (43, 34%). Students who are less consistent know that pressure is somehow involved or indicates fluid flow but do not have a firm grasp of the concept of a pressure gradient as the driving force for fluid flow.

This study aimed to investigate the extent to which a set of 15 core concepts of physiology (developed by Michael and McFarland, U.S.-based educators) are reflected in the learning outcomes (LOs) of units (subjects) comprising physiology curricula in Australian universities. From publicly accessible online information, we identified 17 Australian universities that offered a physiology major for undergraduate degree students and downloaded 788 LOs from the 166 units that comprised the majors. Each LO was blindly mapped against the 15 core concepts by 8 physiology educators from 3 Australian universities. Additionally, text-matching software was employed to match keywords and phrases (identified as descriptors of the 15 core concepts) against the LOs. The frequency of individual words and two-word phrases for each core concept was calculated and ranked. There was variability in rating LOs for the same university among academic mappers; nevertheless, many of the 15 core concepts did not appear to be adequately covered in the LOs. Two core concepts most matched manually were in the top three most mapped by the software. These were, from most common, structure/function and interdependence. Our findings suggest a lack of alignment of LOs with the core concepts across Australian physiology curricula.

The purpose of our game, Who Wants To Be A Physician, was to provide students with an educational tool by which to review material previously presented in class. Our goal in designing this game was to encourage students to be active participants in their own learning process.

Detailed answers are included in the manual to assist the instructor or player in comprehension of the material. In addition, an evaluation instrument was used to assess the effectiveness of this instructional tool in an academic setting. Specifically, the evaluation instrument addressed five major components, including goals and objectives, participation, content, components and organization, and summary and recommendations. Students responded positively to our game and the concept of active learning.

In section 02 the lectures were used as an information source, which students combined with other information researched in the library to draft essays on assigned topics, i.e., an andragogical approach. Grading of the essays constituted 75% of a student's performance evaluation, with participation in class discussions making up the remaining 25%. There was no significant difference in overall performance outcome between the two sections (P > 0.47). Students from both sections valued the lectures, even though they served a different purpose in each section. However, overall the student rating of section 02 was significantly higher than that of section 01 (P < or = 0.05). This reflected different teaching methods rather than different teachers, because the ratings of the two instructors were virtually identical (P > 0.98).

    "abstract": "Synthesized mainly in adipocytes, leptin is a peptide hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of body weight and composition. The serum leptin concentrations of 193 Singapore university medical and bioscience undergraduates aged 19–26 yr were measured using a competitive ELISA kit, and their leptin levels were correlated with sex and body mass index (BMI). Mean leptin levels were more than twice as high in females than in males of corresponding weight status, especially among females of healthy weight who exhibited levels that were 5.7 times higher. Overweight individuals generally demonstrated higher circulating leptin concentrations than healthy-weight and underweight participants. The differences in mean leptin levels between underweight and overweight males ( P = 0.006), as well as between healthy-weight and overweight males ( P = 0.011) were statistically significant. Comparison tests of leptin levels between healthy-weight and underweight females were highly significant ( P = 0.001). Highly significant linear correlations between BMI and the logarithm of leptin concentration were observed in the female ( r = 0.44) and male ( r = 0.36) groups. These results reiterate the impact of gonadal steroids as mediators of the apparent sexual dimorphism in circulating leptin. The findings also corroborate evidence that adiposity determines leptin levels. This laboratory exercise has educational value for undergraduates by determining their BMIs, by alluding to the importance of maintaining healthy body composition, and by emphasizing the molecular mechanisms of body weight regulation and obesity, with special reference to leptin. This practical study also exemplifies the principles and applications of the competitive ELISA technique and integrates certain key concepts of physiology, molecular biology, immunology, and medicine.",

Describing lipoproteins as particles that are composed of lipid and protein and illustrating the variation in particle density that is determined by the constantly changing lipid and protein composition clarifies the metabolic pathway and physiological function of lipoproteins as lipid transporters.

The Acid/Base Primer was designed and evaluated within a conceptual framework of basic educational principles. Seventy-five first-year veterinary students (of 81; 93% response rate) participated in this study. Students took both a pre- and posttest of content understanding. After completing the Acid/Base Primer in pairs, each student filled out a survey evaluating the features of the program and describing his/her use and experience of it. Four pairs of students participated in interviews that elaborated on the surveys. Scores improved from 53 ± 2% on the pretest to 74 ± 1% on an immediate posttest. On surveys and in interviews, students reported that the program helped them construct their own understanding of acid/base physiology and prompted discussions in pairs of students when individual understandings differed. The case-based format provided anchors and a high degree of relevance. Repetition of concepts helped students develop a more complex network of understanding. Questions in the program served to scaffold the learning process by providing direction, accentuating the relevant features of the cases, and provoking discussion. Guidelines for software development were generated on the basis of the findings and relevant educational literature.",

Adv Physiol Educ 23: 82-90, 2000). This study addresses issues raised by the results of that work. In one group, a written protocol directed students to predict what would happen to frequency and depth of breathing during exercise on a bicycle ergometer, run the experiment, and compare their results to their predictions (\"predictor without verification\"). In a \"predictor with verification\" group, students followed the same written protocol but were also required to show the instructor their predictions before running the experiment. Students in a third group reported their predictions verbally to an instructor immediately before exercise and reviewed their results with that instructor immediately after exercise (\"instructor intervention group\"). Results of this study were consistent with our earlier work. The predictor with verification and predictor without verification protocols yielded similar results. The instructor intervention protocol yielded higher success rates in repairing students' mental models. We subsequently assessed the efficacy of a prediction period at the beginning of the lab session and a wrap-up period at the end to compare predictions and results. This predict and wrap-up protocol was more effective than the predictor without verification protocol, but it was not as effective as the instructor intervention protocol. Although these results may reflect multiple factors impacting learning in the student laboratory, we believe that a major factor is a mismatch between students' approaches to learning and the intended learning outcomes of the experience.",

A 36% remediation of the Sa/Po(2) misconception was found to be associated with case analysis. This repair was selective since the frequency of three other respiratory misconceptions was found to be unchanged after classroom instruction about respiratory physiology in lectures and laboratories. Remediation of the Sa/Po(2) misconception before an instructor-led, in-class case review was superficial and temporary. Explanations provided by students who correctly answered the Sa/Po(2) conceptual diagnostic test showed improved conceptual understanding following case analysis. These results suggest that a learning strategy where students actively confront their faulty notions about respiratory physiology is useful in helping them overcome their misconceptions.",

Students had elevated salivary cortisol in response to each of these stresses compared with basal conditions. These results reiterate the importance of glucocorticoids as mediators of the stress response.

We attempted to remedy this problem by using a case discussion method together with the Quantitative Circulatory Physiology (QCP) program. QCP is a Windows-based computer simulation program that offers almost real-time simulation and allows users to examine the time-dependent interactions of over 750 parameters. We evaluated students' perceptions by an anonymous questionnaire. Teachers' perceptions of this teaching approach were highly positive, as it improved students' perceptions of the complexity of biological processes, their ability to differentiate between acute and chronic responses, and promoted an integrative understanding of human body function. Teachers also identified some problems with the approach, including student difficulties in adopting self-directed learning, a lack of precision in student questions during the discussion sessions, and the lack of a tradition of using several textbooks to explain the changes observed. The results of the student questionnaire revealed that &gt;70% of the students reported that this type of learning gave them a better understanding of the complexity of physiological processes and the role of coordinated actions of several systems in the homeostatic response and enabled them to acquire a better understanding of human body functions. Thus, we conclude that this approach promotes an integrative understanding of cardiovascular and renal functions that is difficult to achieve with other methods.",

The P value associated with the magnitude of that test statistic answers this question: if the null hypothesis is true, what proportion of possible values of the test statistic are at least as extreme as the one I got? Although statisticians continue to stress the limitations of hypothesis tests, there are two realities we must acknowledge: hypothesis tests are ingrained within science, and the simple test of a null hypothesis can be useful.

Students' knowledge is often bound to situational descriptions rather than underlying principles. This study explores how medical students discern and process underlying principles in physiology. Indepth interviews, where students elaborated on principles related to blood pressure and blood pressure regulation, were carried out with 16 medical students in a problem-based learning curriculum. A qualitative, phenomenographic approach was used, and interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, qualitatively analyzed, and categorized. Four categories were outlined. The underlying principles were conceived as follows: 1) general conditions for body function at a specified time point, 2) transferable phenomena between organ systems and time points, 3) conditionally transferable phenomena between organ systems and time points, and 4) cognitive constructions of limited value in medical physiology. The results offers insights into students' thinking about underlying principles in physiology and suggest how understanding can be challenged to stimulate deep-level processing of underlying principles rather than situational descriptions of physiology. A complex conception of underlying principles includes an ability to problemize phenomena beyond long causal reasoning chains, which is often rewarded in traditional examinations and tests. Keywords for problemized processing are as follows: comparisons, differences, similarities, conditions, context, relevance, multiple sampling, connections, and dependencies.",

In particular, the complexity of the system and the condensed time available present a difficult challenge. Regardless of audiovisual aids (blackboard, PowerPoint presentations, ready-made models, or CD-ROMs), deep learning is difficult to achieve. Therefore, we developed an active learning component to teach about the nervous system based on the Chinese proverb “When I hear, I forget; when I see, I remember; and when I do, I understand.”Active learning produces meaningful learning, improves attitudes toward learning, and increases knowledge and retention (9), but is still not fully institutionalized in the undergraduate sciences.A few studies (3, 7, 8) have compared the effectiveness of PowerPoint presentations, student seminars, quizzes, and use of CD-ROMs with blackboard teaching and didactic lectures. In all these studies, it was found that active learning methods made a better impact than passive learning, but the active involvement of all the students was equally lacking. In the literature, we encountered only one study (5) that incorporated the making of clay models by the students themselves, to learn better.Play dough is an easy to use learning tool that can help students turn both concrete and imaginary things into colorful models. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to highlight the use of play dough in modeling the nervous tracts and also to compare the outcomes of such active learning by modeling over passive learning in medical students who were undergraduates in the first phase of the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery program in India. Random selection was done from a class of 100 students. Students were grouped into 2 groups, each composed of 50 students (a control group and a study group). The selection was done by instructing all the 100 students to be seated in the classroom anywhere they wished, and each student was asked to say aloud a number, from 1 to 100, in serial order. The odd numbers constituted the control group, and the even numbers constituted the study group. All students had the same academic qualifications (all of them had passed class XII of the Central Board of Secondary Education in India, with the same curriculum and science as one of the subjects), and there were no statistical differences between the control and study groups with respect to age or sex. Students were informed about the study, and written consent was obtained. Approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the institution.All 100 students were first taught about the different sensory and motor tracts using the blackboard, ready-made models, PowerPoint presentations, and CD-ROMs (passive learning) during a 75-min lecture. Immediately after the lecture, the 50 students in the control group were assessed with a questionnaire of 15 questions, each scoring a maximum of 4 points, making the total maximum score achievable 60 points (Table 1). The answer to each question was given 1, 2, 3, or 4 points, depending on its correctness and depth. The questionnaire was given immediately after class and then again 15 and 30 days later without any further instruction.Table 1. QuestionnaireQuestions1. Name the important ascending tracts of the spinal cord.2. Name the important descending tracts of the spinal cord.3. Name the sensations carried by the lateral spinothalamic tract.4. Name the sensations carried by the anterior spinothalamic tract.5. Name the sensations carried by the dorsal tract.6. Describe the course of first-order neurons of the anterior and lateral spinothalamic tracts.7. Describe the course of first-order neurons of the dorsal tract.8. Describe the course of second-order neurons of the anterior and lateral spinothalamic tracts.9. Describe the course of second-order neurons of the dorsal tract.10. Describe the course of third-order neurons of the sensory tracts.11. From where does the pyramidal tract arise?12. Why is it called the pyramidal tract?13. Where do the corticospinal fibers cross?14. What percentage of fibers of the corticospinal tract do not cross?15. Where do the fibers of the corticospinal tract end?Students in the study group were engaged in making models of the sensory and motor tracts under the supervision and guidance of the teachers. Students were first asked to prepare cross sections of the spinal cord, medulla oblongata, midbrain, thalamus, and cerebral cortex, using colored dough, and these sections were either placed on a flat surface or pierced to a steel/glass rod one above the other in that order. Later, students were instructed to make the tracts using dough wrapped around a flexible copper wire with different colored dough for different order neurons. Thus, the lateral spinothalamic tract, anterior spinothalamic tract, dorsal tract, and pyramidal tract were made. The tracts were then either placed or pierced appropriately in their respective places in the different sections of the spinal cord, medulla oblongata, midbrain, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. After finishing the task, students were asked to demonstrate and explain the course of the different tracts that they had modeled. Immediately after this activity, students were assessed by the same questionnaire as in the control group and then again after 15 and 30 days without any further instruction. The activity took an additional 60 min to complete in a time normally reserved for discussion sessions.Statistically, results were compared between the two groups (the control group and the study group).Control group scores were named as follows:Immediately after passive learning (C1)15 days after passive learning (C2)30 days after passive learning (C3)Study group scores were named as follows:Immediately after active learning/modeling (S1)15 days after active learning/modeling (S2)30 days after active learning/modeling (S3)The analysis was made by comparing the following pairs of scores by a Wilcoxan's signed rank test: C1 and S1, C2 and S2, and C3 and S3. The analysis was made by comparing the following pairs of scores by a paired t-test: C1 and C2, C1 and C3, S1 and S2, and S1 and S3. The respective z, t, and P values were determined. P values of <0.05 were considered significant. The results of the study are shown in Table 2. The results demonstrate that the mean total score in the study group was greater compared with the control group when scores were evaluated immediately after the class, after 15 days, and even after 30 days. There was also less deterioration in the mean total score in the study group compared with the control group when scores were evaluated after 15 days and 30 days.Table 2.

Combined passive and active learning methods have an advantage over only passive teaching methods (6), where active learning consisted of gathering information from the library and drafting essays on the topics assigned. Active learning in the form of case studies in physiology was also helpful for students in understanding elementary physiology material given in the form of didactic lectures (7). Improvement was seen in the students' achievement, motivation, and self-efficacy by active learning techniques such as inquiry-based models and think-pair-share activities (9). Innovative teaching methods such as computer-assisted learning (CD-ROMs), undergraduate projects, seminars, and physioquiz were found to increase pedagogical effectiveness (8).In the literature, we did find a few studies (1, 2, 4) in which models of various materials were constructed to increase the effectiveness of learning by students. Manipulative material like clay was used in only one study (5) to create ion channels and nerve cells. In these studies, the students showed gains in their knowledge immediately after the activities. Here, we show similar improvements, but also that long-term learning was enhanced.Although there are a variety of materials available in the market for making models, play dough was used in this study because the models could be made very easily without much time consumption, could be molded in any direction, and were distinctive because of color differentiation. The models may not be long lasting, but they can be done faster, and also any errors in creation of the models can be easily rectified within seconds, and the dough can be reused a number of times for the same purpose.The PowerPoint presentations and ready-made models may be easily forgotten, and the CD-ROMs may be boring for some students, whereas by making the models, each student was actively involved and was very much interested because it was something away from the books, CD-ROMs, and blackboard. Since almost every student faced difficulty in understanding and retaining the details of the nervous tracts, this topic was chosen for the activity. All the students expressed immense pleasure and gratitude for this activity and wanted the same for other difficult topics as well, which would help them to better understand physiology. Clearly, kinesthetic modes of learning, such as described here, impact short- and long-term learning gains.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "This study examined the effect of different anatomic representations on student learning in a human anatomy class studying the muscular system. Specifically, we examined the efficacy of using dissected cats (with and without handouts) compared with clay sculpting of human structures. Ten undergraduate laboratory sections were assigned to three treatment groups: cat dissection only, cat dissection with handouts, and human clay sculpting with handouts. Exams included higher-order questions that presented novel anatomic images and scenarios that the students did not practice in class. The higher-order anatomy exam questions varied the degree to which students in the different treatments had to transform the anatomic representation studied during laboratory activities to match the representation used in the exam questions. In this respect, exam questions manipulated the similarity between the surface features of the anatomic representations used in the classroom versus the exam. When identifying anatomic structures presented in a photograph or diagram, student performance improved significantly when transformation demands decreased, i.e., students in the human clay sculpting treatment group performed best on human anatomy questions and students in the cat dissection treatment group performed better on cat anatomy questions (independent of the use of handouts). There were similar, but nonsignificant, trends when students were asked functional anatomy questions presented in human and cat contexts. On survey questions designed to measure student attitudes about dissection versus nonanimal alternatives, students typically preferred the method used in their treatment group, suggesting that student preference is too fluid to factor into curricular decisions. When designing curricula, instructors must choose anatomic representations that support their course goals. Human representations are most effective when teaching the human muscular system.",

The translated questionnaire was tested for wording comprehension before its application in the actual study. Using the results of the VARK questionnaire, students were classified as unimodal or multimodal and according to the first preferred sensory modality used for learning as V, A, R, or K learners. Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and problems that required simple arithmetic calculations (arithmetic-type questions) were applied to the students. The relation between the main sensory modality used for learning and the grades obtained in each question type was analyzed both in unimodal and multimodal students. It was found that R unimodal students performed significantly better in arithmetic questions than A and K unimodal students ( P &lt; 0.001 by a Bonferroni multiple-comparison test after ANOVA). R unimodal students also performed better than R multimodal students in arithmetic questions ( P = 0.02 by a Mann-Whitney U-test). However, no differences were observed after MCQs in either unimodal or multimodal students with different first sensory modalities used for learning. When MCQ scores between unimodal and multimodal students were compared, no differences were detected. It was concluded that the sensory learning style used for learning affects student outcome when students receive arithmetic questions but not when MCQs are applied.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to compare student attitudes toward two different science laboratory learning experiences, specifically, traditional, cookbook-style, low-inquiry level (LL) activities and a high-inquiry level (HL) investigative project. In addition, we sought to measure and compare students' science-related attitudes and attitudes toward science. Students participated in 5 wk of LL activities followed by a 5-wk HL project. An open-ended survey administered at the end of the semester and analyzed by a χ 2 -test revealed that 1) students enjoyed the HL project more than the LL activities, 2) high-level inquiry did not have a negative effect on student motivation in the laboratory, and 3) students perceived that they learned more about physiology principles with the LL activities. Most students liked the HL project, particularly the independence, responsibility, freedom, and personal relevance. Of the students who did not like the HL project, many reported being uncomfortable with the lack of structure and guidance. Many students gained a more positive and realistic view about scientific research, often reporting an increased respect for science. Likert scale surveys administered before and after each 5-wk period showed no significant changes in student attitudes to scientific inquiry, adoption of scientific attitudes, enjoyment of science lessons, or motivation toward science when the three time points were compared. The findings in this study have helped to provide suggestions for better implementation of HL projects in the future.",

It was tested in the form of tRAT scores, the time required to complete the tRAT assignment, and individual performance on the unit examinations. Students in one section were given the iRAT at the beginning of the team-based learning session. The same set of questions was given to students as their tRAT immediately after their iRAT. Students in the second section were not given the iRAT before the tRAT. This pattern was reversed for the next scheduled team-based learning activity between the two sections. We found that the section having both the iRAT and tRAT scored higher on the tRAT and completed their assignments in less time than the section with the tRAT alone. This suggests that the tRAT combined with the iRAT is an effective team-based approach to the teaching of physiology compared with the tRAT alone.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether multiple-choice item difficulty could be predicted either by a subjective judgment by the question author or by applying a learning taxonomy to the items. Eight physiology faculty members teaching an upper-level undergraduate human physiology course consented to participate in the study. The faculty members annotated questions before exams with the descriptors “easy,” “moderate,” or “hard” and classified them according to whether they tested knowledge, comprehension, or application. Overall analysis showed a statistically significant, but relatively low, correlation between the intended item difficulty and actual student scores (ρ = −0.19, P &lt; 0.01), indicating that, as intended item difficulty increased, the resulting student scores on items tended to decrease. Although this expected inverse relationship was detected, faculty members were correct only 48% of the time when estimating difficulty. There was also significant individual variation among faculty members in the ability to predict item difficulty (χ 2 = 16.84, P = 0.02). With regard to the cognitive level of items, no significant correlation was found between the item cognitive level and either actual student scores (ρ = −0.09, P = 0.14) or item discrimination (ρ = 0.05, P = 0.42). Despite the inability of faculty members to accurately predict item difficulty, the examinations were of high quality, as evidenced by reliability coefficients (Cronbach's α) of 0.70–0.92, the rejection of only 4 of 300 items in the postexamination review, and a mean item discrimination (point biserial) of 0.37. In conclusion, the effort of assigning annotations describing intended difficulty and cognitive levels to multiple-choice items is of doubtful value in terms of controlling examination difficulty. However, we also report that the process of annotating questions may enhance examination validity and can reveal aspects of the hidden curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Engaging communication of complex scientific concepts with the general public requires more than simplification. Compelling, relevant, and timely points of linkage between scientific concepts and the experiences and interests of the general public are needed. Pop-culture icons such as superheroes can represent excellent opportunities for exploring scientific concepts in a mental “landscape” that is comfortable and familiar. Using an established icon as a familiar frame of reference, complex scientific concepts can then be discussed in a more accessible manner. In this framework, scientists and the general public use the cultural icon to occupy a commonly known performance characteristic. For example, Batman represents a globally recognized icon who represents the ultimate response to exercise and training. The physiology that underlies Batman’s abilities can then be discussed and explored using real scientific examples that highlight truths and fallacies contained in the presentation of pop-culture icons. Critically, it is not important whether the popular representation of the icon shows correct science because the real science can be revealed in discussing the character through this lens. Scientists and educators can then use these icons as foils for exploring complex ideas in a context that is less threatening and more comfortable for the target audience. A “middle-ground hypothesis” for science communication is proposed in which popculture icons are used to exploring scientific concepts in a bridging mental landscape that is comfortable and familiar. This approach is encouraged for communication with all nonscientists regardless of age.",

This study examined how a shift from discipline-focused instruction and assessment to integrated instruction and assessment affected student performance in a second-year medical school pathology course. We investigated this by comparing pathology exam scores between students exposed to traditional discipline-specific instruction and exams (DSE) versus integrated instruction and exams (IE). Exam content was controlled, and individual questions were evaluated using a modified version of Bloom's taxonomy. Additionally, we compared United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) step 1 scores between DSE and IE groups. Our findings indicate that DSE students performed better than IE students on complete pathology exams. However, when exam content was controlled, exam scores were equivalent between groups. We also discovered that the integrated exams were composed of a significantly greater proportion of questions classified on the higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy and that IE students performed better on these questions overall. USMLE step 1 exam scores were similar between groups. The finding of a significant difference in content complexity between discipline-specific and integrated exams adds to recent literature indicating that there are a number of potential biases related to curricular comparison studies that must be considered. Future investigation involving larger sample sizes and multiple disciplines should be performed to explore this matter further.",

    "abstract": "Here we describe a 4-yr course reform and its outcomes. The upper-division neurophysiology course gradually transformed from a traditional lecture in 2004 to a more student-centered course in 2008, through the addition of evidence-based active learning practices, such as deliberate problem-solving practice on homework and peer learning structures, both inside and outside of class. Due to the incremental nature of the reforms and absence of pre-reform learning assessments, we needed a way to retrospectively assess the effectiveness of our efforts. To do this, we first looked at performance on 12 conserved exam questions. Students performed significantly higher post-reform on questions requiring lower-level cognitive skills and those requiring higher-level cognitive skills. Furthermore, student performance on conserved questions was higher post-reform in both the top and bottom quartiles of students, although lower-quartile student performance did not improve until after the first exam. To examine student learning more broadly, we also used Bloom's taxonomy to quantify a significant increase in the Bloom's level of exams, with students performing equally well post-reform on exams that had over twice as many questions at higher cognitive skill levels. Finally, we believe that four factors provided critical contributions to the success of the course reform, including: transformation efforts across multiple course components, alignment between formative and evaluative course materials, student buy-in to course instruction, and instructional support. This reform demonstrates both the effectiveness of incorporating student-centered, active learning into our course, and the utility of using Bloom's level as a metric to assess course reform.",

    "abstract": "Science graduates require critical thinking skills to deal with the complex problems they will face in their 21st century workplaces. Inquiry-based curricula can provide students with the opportunities to develop such critical thinking skills; however, evidence suggests that an inappropriate level of autonomy provided to underprepared students may not only be daunting to students but also detrimental to their learning. After a major review of the Bachelor of Science, we developed, implemented, and evaluated a series of three vertically integrated courses with inquiry-style laboratory practicals for early-stage undergraduate students in biomedical science. These practical curricula were designed so that students would work with increasing autonomy and ownership of their research projects to develop increasingly advanced scientific thinking and communication skills. Students undertaking the first iteration of these three vertically integrated courses reported learning gains in course content as well as skills in scientific writing, hypothesis construction, experimental design, data analysis, and interpreting results. Students also demonstrated increasing skills in both hypothesis formulation and communication of findings as a result of participating in the inquiry-based curricula and completing the associated practical assessment tasks. Here, we report the specific aspects of the curricula that students reported as having the greatest impact on their learning and the particular elements of hypothesis formulation and communication of findings that were more challenging for students to master. These findings provide important implications for science educators concerned with designing curricula to promote scientific thinking and communication skills alongside content acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Used effectively, stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) technologies can engage students with complex disciplinary content as they are presented with informative representations of abstract concepts. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that stereoscopy may enhance learning and retention in some educational settings. Biological concepts particularly benefit from this type of presentation since complex spatially oriented structures frequently define function within these systems. Viewing biological phenomena in 3D as they are in real life allows the user to relate these spatial relationships and easily grasp concepts making the key connection between structure and function. In addition, viewing these concepts interactively in 3D and in a manner that leads to increased engagement for young prospective scientists can further increase the impact. We conducted two studies evaluating the use of this technology as an instructional tool to teach high school students complex biological concepts. The first study tested the use of stereoscopic materials for teaching brain function and human anatomy to four classes. The second study evaluated stereoscopic images to support the learning of cell structure and DNA in four different high school classes. Most important, students who used stereoscopic 3D had significantly higher test scores than those who did not. In addition, students reported enjoying 3D presentations, and it was among their top choices for learning about these complex concepts. In summary, our evidence adds further support for the benefits of 3D images to students' learning of science concepts.",

    "abstract": "High failure rates in introductory college science courses, including anatomy and physiology, are common at institutions across the country, and determining the specific factors that contribute to this problem is challenging. To identify students at risk for failure in introductory physiology courses at our open-enrollment institution, an online pilot survey was administered to 200 biology students. The survey results revealed several predictive factors related to academic preparation and prompted a comprehensive analysis of college records of >2,000 biology students over a 5-yr period. Using these historical data, a model that was 91% successful in predicting student success in these courses was developed. The results of the present study support the use of surveys and similar models to identify at-risk students and to provide guidance in the development of evidence-based advising programs and pedagogies. This comprehensive approach may be a tangible step in improving student success for students from a wide variety of backgrounds in anatomy and physiology courses.",

    "abstract": "The Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program, housed within the National Institute for General Medical Sciences, administers the Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) as a strategic mission to broaden the geographic distribution of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding within the United States. Undergraduate summer student mentored research programs (SSMRP) are a common feature of INBRE programs and are designed to increase undergraduate student interest in research careers in the biomedical sciences. Little information is available about student perspectives on how these programs impact their choices relative to education and careers. Therefore, we conducted qualitative interviews with 20 participants from the Arkansas INBRE SSMRP in the years 2002-2012. Each telephone interview lasted 30-45 min. An interview guide with a broad \"grand tour\" question was used to elicit student perspectives on SSMRP participation. Interviews were digitally recorded, then transcribed verbatim, and the transcript checked for accuracy. Content analysis and constant comparison were used to identify nine themes that were grouped into three temporal categories: before, during, and after the SSMRP experience. Students viewed the experience as positive and felt it impacted their career choices. They emphasized the value of mentoring in the program, and some reported maintaining a relationship with the mentor after the summer experience ended. Students also valued learning new laboratory and presentation skills and felt their research experience was enhanced by meeting students and scientists with a wide range of career interests. These data suggest that the Arkansas INBRE and the NIH IDeA program are successfully meeting the goal of increasing interest in research among undergraduates.",

Naturally, this has also affected learning/teaching techniques, and methods that are commonly referred to as \"e-learning\" have become an important part in modern education. Institutions have to decide if (and how) to implement this new form of teaching but face the problem that little subject-specific research has been published for different teaching modes and methods. The present study compares a course module of the physiology laboratory course for medical students in the preclinical phase before and after the introduction of computer-aided course instructions (CACI). Students were provided with an online questionnaire containing Likert items evaluating workspace redesign, acceptance of course instructions, incentive to actively participate in the course, and subjective gain of knowledge. CACI was clearly preferred over the previously used paper workbook. However, the questionnaire also revealed that the gain in knowledge, as subjectively perceived by the students, had not improved, which is in agreement with several studies that neglected a beneficial effect of e-learning on learning success. We conclude that the CACI meet today's student's expectations and that introducing this system seems justified from this perspective.",

These recommendations have been the primary driver for many of the recent enhancements, such as an increased emphasis on foundational science and changes in the clinical skills examination, including more advanced communication skills assessment. These recommendations will continue to inform future changes such as access to references (e.g., a map of metabolic pathways) or decision-making tools for use during the examination.

Students must choose appropriate learning strategies to develop their understanding, as their choices may influence both their understanding and their academic achievement. The primary aim of this study was to develop an understanding of why students experience difficulties with physiology and how they respond when facing the challenge of learning this discipline. Undergraduate allied health students ( n = 231) studying physiology were asked to identify the topics they had difficulty understanding, the strategies they used to deal with that difficult knowledge, and the reasons for their difficulties. Consenting students' responses were subjected to inductive and deductive thematic analyses, and their performance on examinations were collated. Students reported that they found physiology difficult due to their lack of familiarity with it and the level of detail required. To aid their understanding of difficult topics, students commonly reported reviewing information, seeking further information, and seeking social assistance, with more high-achieving students reporting reviewing records, and fewer reporting seeking social assistance than poor-achieving students. Most notably, a disconnect was found between students' reporting of difficult modules and their academic achievement on those modules, with students who cited difficulties performing equally well, if not better, than those who do not. Importantly, these findings suggest that students, in recognizing their difficulties and the reasons for them, can implement effective learning strategies to overcome them.",

The powers exhibited by each character differ and are dependent on how the X-Gene has modified their individual genomes. For instance, Wolverine possesses regenerative healing, Storm can control local weather systems, and Colossus can create an impenetrable \"organic steel\" layer around his body. Thanks to the establishment of the superhero genre in modern cinema, audiences are familiar with Colossus from films such as X-Men: Days of Future Past and Deadpool. While attaining this power might be attractive to many people, there are innumerate scientific obstacles to be overcome to replicate this \"organic steel\" layer. Due to its unique combination of high strength and flexibility, a graphene-based layer might be a more realistic material for Colossus' impenetrable skin and would also address a number of physiological issues associated with an \"organic steel\" layer. The actualization of this layer would depend on complex processes associated with protein folding, protein self-assembly, and changing the structure of his skin. In the classroom, Colossus can foster a multidisciplinary learning environment where concepts in physiology can overlap with topics in physics, engineering, and materials science. Just like other superheroes, Colossus can also be used to promote scientific content in outreach for the general public.",

    "abstract": "Physiology is commonly taught through direct experience and observation of scientific phenomena in “hands-on” practical laboratory classes. The value of such classes is limited by students’ lack of understanding of the underlying theoretical concepts and their lack of confidence with the experimental techniques. In our experience, students follow experimental steps as if following a recipe, without giving thought to the underlying theory and the relationship between the experimental procedure and the research hypotheses. To address this issue, and to enhance student learning, we developed an online virtual experiment for students to complete before an inquiry-based practical. The virtual experiment and “live” practical laboratory were an investigation of how autonomic nerves control contractions in the isolated rabbit ileum. We hypothesized that the virtual experiment would support students’ understanding of the physiological concepts, as well as the experimental design associated with the practical. Anonymous survey data and usage analytics showed that most students engaged with the virtual experiment. Students thought that it helped them to understand the practical physiological concepts and experimental design, with self-reported time spent on the virtual experiment (and not on lectures or practical class notes) a significant predictor of their understanding. This novel finding provides evidence that virtual experiments can contribute to students’ research skills development. Our results indicate that self-paced online virtual experiments are an effective way to enhance student understanding of physiological concepts and experimental processes, allowing for a more realistic experience of the scientific method and a more effective use of time in practical classes.",

As these tests can be performed relatively inexpensively and do not require high levels of technical expertise, they are ideally suited for use in the teaching laboratory, enabling undergraduate students to link theory to practice. The practicals described here permit students to examine their own blood and that of their peers and compare these with clinically accepted normal ranges. At the end of the practicals, students are required to answer a number of questions about their findings and to link abnormal values to possible pathological conditions by answering a series of questions based on their findings.",

Mostly PAL is utilized to specifically support teaching within one subject or a specific curricular situation. Here, we present a large-scale peer teaching program that aims to address the individual student's learning needs. In addition, it provides a platform for students to participate in academic teaching. A retrospective data analysis was performed to reveal the program's development and acceptance. The program was implemented in 2008/09 with three tutorials conducted by 24 student tutors to support students preparing for reexaminations. Since then, the program has continuously grown. In 2015/16, 140 tutors conducted 52 tutorials, consisting of 2,750 lessons for 1,938 tutees. New tutorial categories were continuously introduced. In 2015/16, these encompassed tutorials that were held concomitantly to the formal curriculum, tutorials that exceeded the contents of the formal curriculum, tutorials for preparation for the state examination, and electives. Evaluations among the tutees revealed that 93.5% of the respondents rated the courses overall as \"good\" or \"excellent\" ( n = 13,489) in 2015/16. All elements of the peer teaching program are managed by one academic group. This encompasses the organization of tutorials, the quality management, and the qualification of tutors, including content-related supervision and didactic training. We conclude that the implementation of a large-scale peer teaching program can complement the formal curriculum. This might be beneficial for both tutors who can actively train their didactic and content-related competencies, and tutees who can autonomously consolidate and expand their knowledge.",

Although both learning strategies have been thoroughly investigated, few studies have examined their additive effect with higher-order cognitive tasks such as the ability to identify themes across multiple texts, and none of those did so using physiology information. The purpose of the present study was to compare recall and thematic processing across five different physiology texts. Participants were randomly assigned to learn the texts using one of the following four learning strategies: 1) study-study-study (S-S-S) using a blocked order, 2) S-S-S using an interleaved order, 3) study-test-study (S-T-S) using a blocked order, and 4) S-T-S using an interleaved order. Over the course of the following week, the S-T-S groups had more stable recall of key text ideas compared with the S-S-S groups, and the S-T-S group had more stable recall of thematic information than the S-S-S group when interleaving was used as the presentation order.",

    "abstract": "Demonstrating how science relates to human health is an important step for generating K–12 student interest in health-related careers. Science outreach is often performed in urban areas; however, ~20% of K–12 schools are in rural areas. Michigan Technological University is located in Michigan’s upper peninsula, which accounts for 30% of the state’s land mass but only 3% of the total population. Our goal was to create a science outreach program for reaching K–12 students in our rural region. We assembled a team of undergraduate and graduate students, staff, and faculty to implement science outreach with K–12 students. Specifically, we leveraged existing national and international science outreach events [Physiology Friday, Physiology Understanding (PhUn) Week, National Biomechanics Day] to offer hands-on physiology and biomechanics activities during the year. Between 2016 and 2019, we connected with 31 K–12 schools and impacted 327 elementary (19%), 351 middle school (21%), and 1,018 high school (60%) students (total impact 1,696). Over 90% of the outreach visits took place at the K–12 schools. The hands-on activities were delivered by more than 85 undergraduate and graduate students and 10 faculty. Together, the supportive culture and resources within the department (e.g., outreach coordinator, participation from students and faculty, grant funding) were key to developing the program. We recommend starting with a single outreach event, working as a team, and being flexible with K–12 schools. The program also provided service-learning and professional development opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and faculty. Our robust science outreach program promoted “PhUn” all year-round with rural K–12 students.",

    "abstract": "Physiology is a key element of “bioscience” education within pre-registration nursing programs, but there is a lack of clarity on what is included. Physiology and bioscience content and delivery are highly varied across both higher education institutions and the related programs in the United Kingdom (UK). Despite evidence highlighting concerns over nurses’ lack of bioscience knowledge and unsafe practice, there is no universally agreed on curriculum with detailed outcomes of minimum levels of knowledge to support nurses in practice and patient care. This study aimed to inform the construction of discipline-specific physiology learning outcomes to clarify relevant physiological topics required in pre-registration nursing. Initially, 360 learning outcomes were identified from various sources. Using a modified Delphi approach, an expert panel from the Bioscience in Nurse Education group reviewed and modified the list to 195 proposed outcomes. These were circulated to universities in the UK who teach nursing ( n = 65). Outcomes that had 80% consensus were automatically included in the next round, with others recommended with modification (response rate 22%). The panel reviewed the modifications, and 182 outcomes were circulated in the second questionnaire (response rate 23%), and further panel review resulting in 177 outcomes agreed. These learning outcomes do not suggest how they should be delivered, but gives the basic level required for qualification as a nurse commensurate with the Nursing and Midwifery Council new standards for the “future nurse.”",

However, there are many questions about how these impacts occur. Improving grades, experiencing laboratory work, and working with research staff are important components, but developing a “science identity” is integral to this process. In this qualitative study, interviews with 25 past summer research fellows who are members of groups underrepresented in STEM (underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, first-generation college, and persons with financial or social disadvantages) provide insights into this process. The conversations validate that their summer research experiences helped them attain each of the program objectives, but their experiences differed, in part, based on their prior research experiences. Their narratives emphasized the strong impact that the program had on skills (e.g., research design, data analysis and presentation, time management/organization, writing, speaking, network development, math/statistics), confidence, motivation, and research career aspirations. As fellows learned more about research, they saw its relationship to medicine, and many integrated basic or clinical research into their career plans. Three central themes resulted from the discussions: the need to customize program goals for diverse participants, the pivotal role of the research mentor-student relationship, and the powerful impact of participating in a national scientific meeting. Recommendations for URE programs are proposed.",

Analysis was made of the effect of the game on learning and the students’ opinions about it. Dentistry students were divided into control and game groups. They attended lectures about the topics, after which the control group students were submitted to a test, whereas the game group performed the game activity before undertaking the test. The mean score was significantly higher for the game group, compared with the control group ( P &lt; 0.05). Pharmacy students also attended lectures about these topics; in the next class, the students performed a pretest and the activity with the educational game. After the game, a posttest was applied. The mean scores were significantly higher for the posttest than for the pretest ( P &lt; 0.05). Students of medicine attended the lectures and performed the activity with the educational game, without the learning assessment. All of the students answered a question, using a 5-point Likert-type scale, concerning whether they thought the activity with the game was useful for learning. The mean scores obtained by the dentistry, pharmacy, and medicine students were 4.7 ± 0.6, 4.9 ± 0.3, and 4.3 ± 0.1, respectively. The educational game increased the learning of the undergraduate students, in agreement with their opinions of the strategy.",

Each program had specific goals and measurable objectives. To assess the impact of these programs, APS both documented student completion of program tasks (e.g., designing experiments, analyzing data, writing abstracts) and developed reliable and valid survey instruments to quantify students’ self-ratings on a variety of research and career planning skills related to the program objectives. Results indicate that fellows as a whole and for most individual programs gained skills and knowledge in numerous areas: experimental design, data management, lab safety, statistical analysis, data presentation, scientific writing, scientific presentation, professional networking, professional networking at scientific meetings, authorship attribution, animal use in research, human subjects in research, roles of lab mates and mentors, and research career training and planning. Furthermore, there were few differences within the diversity comparison groups (women vs. men, URM fellows vs. non-URM fellows, etc.). Suggestions for improvement of URE programs are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Undergraduates with depression report that they would benefit from science role models who also have depression. If biology instructors who have depression reveal it to their students, it could help meet this need. However, it is unknown how instructors revealing their depression would impact all undergraduate science students, not just those with depression, and whether it would cause some students to have a negative perception of the instructor. To address this gap, an instructor of an undergraduate physiology course revealed her depression to the whole class in less than 3 s on two occasions. Undergraduates were surveyed about whether they remembered the instructor revealing depression, whether they perceived it to be appropriate, and what impact it had on them. Of the 289 undergraduates who participated in the survey, 90.6% remembered the instructor revealing her depression. Seventy-two percent of those students reported that the instructor revealing depression had a positive impact on them, 21.3% reported no impact, and 6.7% reported a negative impact. Women were disproportionately likely to report that the instructor revealing depression had a positive impact on the student/instructor relationship and the instructor's approachability. LGBTQ+ students were disproportionately likely to report that the instructor revealing depression had a positive impact on the extent the classroom feels inclusive and students with more severe depressive symptoms were more likely to report that it normalized depression broadly and in the context of science. This work adds to recent studies highlighting the potentially positive impact of instructors revealing their concealable stigmatized identities to undergraduates in class.",

It is expected that having these prerequisites will provide students with the knowledge and skills they will need to successfully learn the course content. Also, the material that the students are expected to have previously learned need not be included in a course. We wanted to determine how accurate instructors' understanding of their students background knowledge actually was. To do this, we wrote a set of multiple-choice questions that could be used to test students' knowledge of concepts deemed to be essential for learning respiratory physiology. Instructors then selected 10 of these questions to be used as a prerequisite knowledge test. The instructors also predicted the performance they expected from the students on each of the questions they had selected. The resulting tests were administered in the first week of each of seven courses. The results of this study demonstrate that instructors are poor judges of what beginning students know. Instructors tended to both underestimate and overestimate students' knowledge by large margins on individual questions. Although on the average they tended to underestimate students' factual knowledge, they overestimated the students' abilities to apply this knowledge. Hence, the validity of decisions that instructors make, predicated on the basis of their students having the prerequisite knowledge that they expect, is open to question.",

    "abstract": "Discussion and writing are very powerful ways to support learning. This article describes the use of a free, asynchronous online forum to expand student-teacher discussions beyond the time/place constraints of the physical physiology classroom. The main participants were medical students enrolled in physiology class at the University of Zagreb Medical School and their teachers. The assessment data were collected by the electronic administration of the software, by anonymous paper questionnaires, and by the results of the final examination in physiology. During one academic year, 25% (n = 55) of 220 students enrolled in a traditional physiology course participated in online discussions. Physiology teachers and other faculty also joined the forum. All forum members (n = 99) posted 395 messages. Nine documents were published by six students who participated in two online collaborative projects. The difference in the mean grade of the final examination in physiology between student members and nonmembers was statistically significant (P = 0.0328, t = 2.1526). Students who participated in Web discussions were self-selected. Likely, they are the most motivated students, who would perform better on the final examination with or without this resource. Nevertheless, using an online forum could be very successful in teaching critical thinking in physiology because the Internet removes traditional time/place barriers. However, new barriers related to technology and behavioral changes are created. For most teachers and students, the main obstacles to information technology implementation are lack of motivation and lack of professional incentives. To overcome these barriers, institutional support is needed for both students and teachers.",

The Lab Book is an interactive tutorial for exploring the relative influences of parameter changes on the cardiovascular system under normal, stressful, or pathophysiological conditions. The learners are guided to predict the direction and relative magnitude of changes of key variables in the cardiovascular system, evaluate the accuracy of their predictions, and describe the cause-and-effect mechanisms involved. Consequences of heart failure, hemorrhage, exercise, and changes in intrathoracic pressure can be explored. The results obtained in the Lab Book are based on a five-compartment mathematical Model, which reflects our current understanding of the basic control of the cardiovascular system. The Model was designed to be complex enough to be realistic, yet not so complex as to be overwhelming. An Information File contains definitions and descriptions of classical physiology about key concepts, including figures, and a detailed description of the Model.

    "abstract": "The primary motivation for integrating any form of education technology into a particular course or curriculum should always be to enhance student learning. However, it can be difficult to determine which technologies will be the most appropriate and effective teaching tools. Through the alignment of technology-enhanced learning experiences with a clear set of learning objectives, teaching becomes more efficient and effective and learning is truly enhanced. In this article, I describe how I have made extensive use of technology in two neuroscience courses that differ in structure and content. Course websites function as resource centers and provide a forum for student interaction. PowerPoint presentations enhance formal lectures and provide an organized outline of presented material. Some lectures are also supplemented with interactive CD-ROMs, used in the presentation of difficult physiological concepts. In addition, a computer-based physiological recording system is used in laboratory sessions, improving the hands-on experience of group learning while reinforcing the concepts of the research method. Although technology can provide powerful teaching tools, the enhancement of the learning environment is still dependent on the instructor. It is the skill and enthusiasm of the instructor that determines whether technology will be used effectively.",

We describe a collaborative assessment task in which groups of second-year dentistry students developed a complex concept map. In groups of four, the students were given a written, simulated, medical history of a patient and required to construct a concept map illustrating relevant pathophysiological concepts and pharmacological interventions. This report describes a research project aimed at making educational goals of the task more explicit through investigating student and faculty member understandings of the criteria that might be used to assess the concept map. Information was gathered about the perceptions of students in relation to the learning goals associated with the task. These were compared with faculty member perceptions. The findings were used to develop an assessment rubric intended to be more accessible to learners. The new rubric used the language of both faculty members and students to more clearly represent expectations of each criterion and standard. This assessment rubric will be used in 2005 for the next phase of the project.",

Since the 1980s, there has been a decline in animal laboratories offered in conjunction with medical physiology courses. The most important single reason for this is cost, but other contributing factors include the development of computer simulations, changes in medical education, and pressure from antivivisectionists. Unfortunately, the elimination of animal laboratories has occurred with relatively little consideration of the educational impact of this change. Although computer simulations are considered effective in helping students acquire basic physiological concepts, there is evidence some students acquire a more thorough understanding of the material through the more advanced and challenging experience of an animal laboratory. The fact that such laboratories offer distinct educational advantages should be taken into account when courses are designed.",

To reduce the administrative burden of staff members without compromising the student learning experience, we utilized dedicated computer software for short-answer question assessment for nearly 300 students and compared it with the more traditional, paper-based method of assessment of the same student cohort. Students were generally favorably disposed toward computer-assisted assessment (CAA): 75% of the students responded that for future assignments, they either had no preference for the method of assessment or would prefer CAA. Advantages were perceived to be remote access to the questions and ease of submission. The most common disadvantage cited was lack of internet access. Various advantages of CAA were mentioned by staff members: notably, the reduction in marking time and reduction of paperwork as well as the potential for the software to detect plagiarism and to administer anonymous marking. Disadvantages to CAA were the need to tailor questions to the technology, having to adapt to reading answers and marking onscreen, and the quality of feedback to students. All of the disadvantages could be overcome by training and improved versions of CAA software, currently under development. The use of CAA has proved to be a welcome addition to the tools available to staff members for the assessment of practical classes, and future improved versions of the software will increase the utility of this assessment method.",

Students are drawn into discussion by the power of learning that is associated with manipulating and thinking about objects. Specifically, the models encourage thinking about complex interactions, and the students appreciate manipulating objects and actually understanding how they work. Using models also allows us to show students how we think as well as what we know. Finally, students enjoy taking the models home to demonstrate to friends and family \"how the body works\" as well as use the models as future study aids.",

An Opinion Editorial (Op-Ed) was introduced as a novel assignment for final-year physiology and pharmacology undergraduates. This second phase of this study, reported here, demonstrated the efficacy of explicit teaching of the Op-Ed, using a one-shot, pre-/posttest research design. Baseline writing skills of students were determined from a communication assignment. Students were then explicitly taught how to write an Op-Ed and subsequently wrote an Op-Ed based on a recent, relevant scientific article. Most students achieved higher grades for their Op-Ed following explicit teaching [mean (SD) = 84.4% (9.1%), n = 216] compared with their communication assignment [mean (SD) = 74.7% (11.9%), n = 218]. Improvement in student writing was also evident by an increase in text readability, which mirrored the features of Op-Eds written by professional journalists. A survey of students (n = 142) indicated that most believed that the assignments were valuable and that their ability to write to a lay audience had improved. Members of the lay public were then surveyed for their opinions on student writing. Two assignments were selected from one student whose grades had improved after explicit teaching. Respondents (n = 78) indicated that the Op-Ed was easier to read than the communication assignment. Thus, explicit teaching of the Op-Ed improved the ability of students to write to members of the lay public.",

Mandela School of Medicine (Durban, South Africa) were given a brief to prepare oral presentations on topics related to disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and endocrine system in the form of \"patient-doctor\" role play and to submit written documents about their topics. This initiative was introduced to assist medical students in their application and understanding of physiology to clinical situations. The aims of the student presentations were to improve the understanding of the physiological basis of diseases; promote independent research, active, and group-based learning; encourage social interactions; and develop presentation and peer review skills. Students rose to the challenge, producing a variety of presentations reflecting a wealth of creativity, humour, sensitivity to local cultural issues, and analytic thinking skills. The quality of the supporting posters and computer-generated slides was outstanding. Numerous \"fun\" prizes for specific individual and group performances were given based on peer and staff evaluations. This exercise ran over a 5-yr period before the introduction of a problem-based learning medical curriculum. Student feedback obtained over these years is reported here. Students were asked to complete semistructured questionnaires, which elicited feedback on various aspects of the learning exercise, including whether it should be continued and how it could be improved upon, especially if they were in groups that did not function well. The feedback obtained revealed that most students perceived the presentations to be fun, informative, creative/innovative, and, most importantly, beneficial to their learning. The majority of students felt that this exercise improved their understanding of pathophysiology, taught them to research independently, and encouraged better class interactions and group learning. The inclusion of such initiatives is beneficial not only to students' understanding and their experience in studying physiology but also for the development of skills useful in their future careers.",

Overall, we found that students made extensive use of the tablet device for learning, using it in preference to laptop computers to retrieve information, record lectures, and access learning resources. In line with other studies, we found that undergraduate students only use familiar Web 2.0 technologies and that the tablet device did not alter this behavior for the majority of tools. We conclude that undergraduate science students can make extensive use of a tablet device to enhance their learning opportunities without institutions changing their teaching methods or computer systems, but that institutional intervention may be needed to drive changes in student behavior toward the use of novel Web 2.0 technologies.",

Examples of results collected by students during class are used to illustrate the type of data collected and analysis performed. During the laboratory, students are encouraged to connect factual information from their skeletal muscle lectures to their laboratory findings. This enables student learning in an active fashion; in particular, the isolated muscle preparation demonstrates that much of what makes muscle fast or slow is myogenic and not the product of the nervous or circulatory systems. This has far-reaching implications for motor control and exercise behavior and therefore is a crucial element in exercise science, with its focus on power and endurance sport activities. To measure student satisfaction with this active learning technique, a questionnaire was administered after the laboratory; 96% of the comments were positive in their support of active versus passive learning strategies.",

    "abstract": "Mobile learning has increasingly become interwoven into the fabric of learning and teaching in the United Kingdom higher education sector, and as technological issues become addressed, this phenomena has accelerated. The aim of the study was to examine whether learning using a mobile learning device (Samsung NC10 Netbook) loaded with interactive exercises promoted learning compared with a traditional library exercise. Using a randomized trial, 55 students from an undergraduate sports science course (n = 28) and medical course (n = 27) volunteered to participate in this study. A mixed-model design ANOVA was used to examine the percent change in test score after a 3-wk intervention. Results showed that there was a significant difference between the two courses (P < 0.001), methods (P = 0.01), and trials (P < 0.001). The findings suggested that both methods augmented student knowledge and understanding in sports science and medical students. The sports science group demonstrated proportionally greater increases in test performance when exposed to the mobile interactive intervention compared with the traditional library approach. Qualitative data suggest an increased level of engagement with the Netbooks due to the stimulating interactive content. In conclusion, the Netbooks were an effective additional learning tool, significantly enhancing knowledge and understanding in students. Further research should ensure that participants are assessed for preferred learning styles, the subjective task value of expectancy value, and readiness for mobile learning to ascertain if this has an effect on the potential for using mobile learning and interactivity.",

    "abstract": "Communicating physiology to the general public and popularizing science can be tremendously rewarding activities. Providing relevant and compelling points of linkage, however, between the scientific experiences and the interests of the general public can be challenging. One avenue for popularizing science is to link scientific concepts to images, personalities, and icons in popular culture. Currently, comic book superhero movies and television shows are extremely popular, and Batman was used as the vehicle for popularizing concepts of exercise science, neuroscience, and physiology in my recent book, Becoming Batman: the Possibility of a Superhero. The objective of this book was to bring scientific understanding to the broader public by using the physical image and impression everyone has of Batman and his abilities and then connecting this to the underlying science. The objective of this article is to share some of the details of the process and the positive and negative outcomes of using such an approach with other academics who may be interested in similar activities. It is my goal that by sharing this experience I may stimulate like-minded readers to initiate their own similar projects and to also be emboldened to try and integrate popular culture touchstones in their own teaching practice.",

    "abstract": "The study of human bioscience is viewed as a crucial curriculum in allied health. Nevertheless, bioscience (and particularly physiology) is notoriously difficult for undergraduates, particularly academically disadvantaged students. So endemic are the high failure rates (particularly in nursing) that it has come to be known as “the human bioscience problem.” In the present report, we describe the outcomes for individual success in studying first-year human physiology in a subject that emphasises team-based active learning as the major pedagogy for mastering subject learning outcomes. Structural equation modeling was used to develop a model of the impact team learning had on individual performance. Modeling was consistent with the idea that students with similar academic abilities (as determined by tertiary entrance rank) were advantaged (scored higher on individual assessment items) by working in strong teams (teams that scored higher in team-based assessments). Analysis of covariance revealed that students who studied the subject with active learning as the major mode of learning activities outperformed students who studied the subject using the traditional didactic teaching format (lectures and tutorials, P = 0.000). After adjustment for tertiary entrance rank (via analysis of covariance) on two individual tests (the final exam and a late-semester in-class test), individual student grades improved by 8% (95% confidence interval: 6–10%) and 12% (95% confidence interval: 10–14%) when students engaged in team-based active learning. These data quantitatively support the notion that weaker students working in strong teams can overcome their educational disadvantages.",

When President Obama spoke at the National Academy of Sciences in April 2009 (15b), he issued the following call to think of new ways to engage young people in science, mathematics, and technology: \"I want to persuade you to spend time in the classroom, talking and showing young people what it is that your work can mean, and what it means to you . . . think about new and creative ways to engage young people in science and engineering . . . to be makers of things, not just consumers of things.\" To reach the next generation of innovators, scientists must become better communicators, clearly informing and inspiring the public about their research (14). The training of scientists to participate in outreach has been primarily focused on formal education settings and working with K–12 teachers (12, 18). For example, in response to government agencies encouraging and, in some cases, requiring the integration of research, education, and outreach, the Space Science Institute (Boulder, CO) developed an annual 4-day workshop for scientists, which included 27 presentations on teaching science in schools and 1 panel discussion on engaging scientists in education through public outreach (15).Many programs place volunteers in classrooms and impact science literacy in the community (5). However, learning outside of the classroom in informal settings such as science centers often marks the beginning of curiosity in, and can significantly enhance the public understanding of, science (10a). These types of informal education opportunities outside the K–12 classroom, with audiences that can include adults, are less frequent, likely because scientists are unaware of the existence of such opportunities (1). Additionally, because of their informality, science centers provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to discuss their work in everyday, nontechnical language, which has been shown to improve the understanding of science concepts (7, 8). To date, most studies have examined the motivation of and challenges facing scientists participating in such outreach (1, 10, 13, 16). One study (13) of informal outreach conducted at public science fairs in Madrid, Spain, noted that the scientists involved were often encouraged by their senior colleagues to participate, while those senior scientists often felt a sense of duty to do such outreach. However, any lasting effect of participation in outreach on those scientists' attitudes, as well as their effectiveness in science communication to the public, has not been thoroughly examined.To address the challenges of recruiting, training, impacting, and retaining scientists in informal outreach and to capitalize on access to the public through a local science center, Washington University and the St. Louis Science Center (SLSC; http://www.slsc.org) collaborated to create a program that combines informal science communication and the professional development of graduate students. The program sought to produce scientists who were trained to be effective informal educators. Workshops developed and led by SLSC staff, followed by personalized coaching, covered essential science communication skills and culminated with a student-driven capstone project. Program evaluation showed significant benefits for both the public and the scientists. The public perceived an increased understanding of science and of scientists. The scientists reported improved views of science outreach.METHODSProgram development: a model to foster science communication skills.In 2005, several Washington University faculty members invited SLSC staff to design a science communication component for a soon-to-be-submitted National Science Foundation (NSF)-Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) proposal. The general goal of the component was to train an annual cohort of graduate students in the cognitive, computational, and systems neuroscience (CCSN) pathway (ccsn.wustl.edu) to present general brain science and, in particular, their research to a large public audience, such as that of the science center. Not only would this program benefit the graduate students, but it would also bring current scientific research and processes to science center visitors.Concurrent with Washington University's invitation, the same SLSC staff was involved in a growing number of Public Understanding of Research (PUR) initiatives within the Association of Science and Technology Centers, all encouraged by the NSF. Key among them was the seminal, invitational conference, \"Museums, Media and the Public Understanding of Research,\" (9) and collaborations that grew out of the conference (e.g., Robotic Research in the Public Eye, Nanotechnology Informal Science Education Network, Portal to the Public, and others). After the NSF-IGERT proposal was funded in 2006, SLSC staff learned that Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) had begun a similar program, MSI SciTech Chicago Outreach Pilot Exploration (MSCOPE), 6 mo earlier; it was the first such program in the United States. Serendipitously, one of the MSCOPE participants joined the SLSC evaluation staff in year 1 of the IGERT grant, contributing valuable program experience.The Science Communication for Brain Scientists program combined PUR techniques with existing training used for new SLSC staff. The program offered hands-on training, modeling, and personalized coaching in workshops. The workshops reviewed how scientists have been involved historically in PUR, who the \"publics\" are, face-to-face introductions to the audiences, general principles of how to reach these publics, an overview of the strategies (exhibit and program design) used in science centers, practice in front-end and formative evaluation, and areas of convergence in communication tools used by science centers and by scientists (e.g., scientific posters, National Institutes of Health language initiative, and talking with nonspecialist colleagues). To engage the students in their professional development through this science outreach training, students participated in the workshops in the SLSC so that they could easily move between the private meeting room and public exhibits. Additional incentives included free membership in the SLSC, meals during the presentation dates, and admission to special public lectures and the opening gala for SciFest.Learning goals.The learning goals of the Science Communication for Brain Scientists program were crafted by SLSC staff, Washington University faculty, and CCSN graduate student representatives. These goals were stated as follows: Introduce graduate students to the field of informal science education and its approaches to science communication.Provide graduate students opportunities to develop and deliver educational experiences about their research for the SLSC's general public audience while working closely with SLSC staff members.Enable graduate students to understand the significant gap in knowledge and language that exists between specialists and lay audiences in different settings.Assist graduate students in identifying and improving their audience engagement skills through observation, experimentation, and practice.Provide graduate students with professional development that will enable them to communicate effectively about their scientific research and its importance with a large and varied public.Cohort experience.The training program (Fig. 1) required graduate students to present their research to the public. Evaluations gauged the perceived impact on science understanding in the community and graduate student professional development. Students from three graduate programs (Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, and Neuroscience) were invited to participate in this training. Students self-selected to participate in the workshops and agreed to present at two events during the year. Funds were used exclusively to support salaries for the SLSC staff and to cover the costs of supplies for the exhibits. An initial group (cohort 1) of eight PhD candidates in neuroscience, psychology, or biomedical engineering participated. Students played a major role in the initiation of this program. The incentives to participate were primarily encouragement from faculty members and their peers. Participants had free access to SLSC exhibits and special events during the year but did not receive graduate credit, certification, or stipends. Training began with three 4-h workshops led by SLSC staff over consecutive weeks in the summer on the topics of audience, language, and presentation tools. These workshops included presentations, hands-on activities, small-group work, and discussion. For example, the Language Workshop included a lecture and hands-on demonstrations about effective and ineffective terms used in public signage. Workshops were followed by several hours of interaction with visitors in the SLSC to gauge visitor interest in brain science topics and develop a set of capstone projects. Once the capstone projects were identified, SLSC staff provided guidance on exhibit and program development, layout, and text and labeling.Fig. 1.Timeline of training in effective science communication to the public. This short program guided cohorts of graduate students through workshops and culminated with an interactive educational program at a local science center. The three 4-h workshops and two day-long presentations (SciFest and NeuroDay) were held at the St. Louis Science Center (SLSC), typically on weekends. Students designed, built, and refined their presentations on their own schedules. The graduate student participants demonstrated improvements in science communication.Download figureDownload PowerPointCohort 1 designed and built an integrative brain science event with hands-on activities and displays describing student research topics. Taking a page from the television series \"The Real World,\" they worked with SLSC staff and a graphic designer to create a \"house\" with neuroscience themes [titled \"The Real World–Neuroscience\" (RWN)]. For example, the \"kitchen\" had visitors eat jellybeans with and without holding their noses. The graduate student running the activity studies olfaction and explained to visitors how her research applied to an everyday experience, like eating a meal. Each of the six activities throughout the house was designed similarly to educate the public about the students' current research interests in the context of the real world. In addition, a 10-min video featured a laboratory tour and an interview with each student. The video, which looped continuously throughout the event, provided a glimpse into the world of a graduate student.Evaluation methodology.Evaluation activities addressed the impact of the training on the graduate student participants as well as the effectiveness or impact of their program for SLSC visitors. Key questions were as follows: What are the students' incoming levels of familiarity with informal science education? How does this change over the course of the training?What are the students' incoming comfort levels with presenting current science to nonscience audiences? How does this change over the course of the training?Given the optional nature of this component of the grant, what are the students' motivations for choosing to participate?What new skills do the students successfully apply in the development and delivery of their educational program(s)? How do they envision applying them in their professional careers?How effective are the students in communicating about the brain to SLSC visitors?Evaluation of this training program used multiple methods. Participating students completed pre- and postworkshop surveys (Supplemental Material, Supplemental Form 1),1 participated in brief, open-ended interviews immediately after delivery of their program at SciFest, an annual multiday science festival (http://scifeststl.org), and at NeuroDay, a day-long brain science expo at the SLSC as part of National Brain Awareness Week, and completed followup surveys at the conclusion of the year. Interviews were used to gain knowledge of the cohort experience to help shape the training program for future cohorts.At both SciFest and NeuroDay, visitors to RWN and the Amazing Brain Carnival (ABC) were invited to complete surveys as they exited the room (Supplemental Material, Supplemental Form 2). At each event, a randomized selection of visitors were invited to complete the survey. Approximately 10.5% of visitors completed surveys, averaged across the four events. RWN attracted ∼600 participants at both SciFest 2008 and NeuroDay 2009. ABC attracted ∼400 visitors during SciFest 2009 and >1,200 visitors during NeuroDay 2010. Sample sizes for participant feedback collected at each of the four offerings were as follows: SciFest 2008, n = 55; NeuroDay 2009, n = 36; SciFest 2009: n = 68; and NeuroDay 2010, n = 116.The SLSC has been a leader in the informal education field in developing and implementing tools to assess the impact of its educational programs. As one of many possible evaluation tools, the SLSC currently uses their System for Assessing Mission Impact (SAMI) to evaluate its broad suite of educational programs (11). SAMI is designed to assess the impact of educational programs on participants based on the SLSC's definition of \"impact,\" where impact results \". . . from a Science Center offering that enables a participant to make a personal connection between the content and experience of the offering and their own knowledge and experiences. In the short-term, this is illustrated by a change in knowledge, understanding, attitude, interest, or enjoyment.\" The development and refinement of SAMI has occurred over several years, with its earliest incarnation preceding the publication of seminal works such as Learning Science in Informal Environments, published by the National Research Council (NRC) (9a), and Evaluation Frameworks (15a), published by the NSF, by several years. SAMI thus provides a measure of impact similar to tools used in other publications (17).SAMI feedback forms (Supplemental Form 2) incorporate closed-ended questions on a four-point scale that address each of the key elements of the SLSC's definition of impact: knowledge, enjoyment, interest in science, and attitude toward science. The sum of the response scores to the four questions is referred to as the impact score (IS), which can range from a low of 4 to a high of 16. Individual answers are scored as 1 (\"no, not at all\"), 2 (\"only a little\"), 3 (\"quite a lot\"), and 4 (\"yes, definitely!\"). The standard wording for the questions is as follows: Did you, or others in your group, learn content and/or skills from this program?Did you enjoy this program?Did this program make you want to try another experience with science or technology?Did this program reinforce or increase any positive attitudes you have toward science or technology?As applied to the evaluation of the science communication training program, slight modifications were made. For surveys given to visitors, the references to \"program\" were edited to specifically refer to the program the graduate students created, either RWN or ABC. For surveys given to the graduate students, references to \"program\" were clarified to \"training program\" and references to \"science or technology\" were edited to refer to \"science communication.\"In addition, participating students were asked to describe their motivations for participating in the training and to reflect on their familiarity with informal science education and their comfort with presenting science to the nonscience audiences. Participating visitors were asked to describe what they learned about the brain and to rate their engagement with the graduate student presenters in addition to responding to the SAMI questions. Responses to these open questions were not statistically analyzed but were used by the SLSC trainers to guide future events and workshops. We found that the measures of impact on the public and the graduate students were highly similar between the 2 yr of this study. Here, we focus on comparing the overall IS (scored from 4 to 16) of RWN at Scifest and NeuroDay in years 1 and 2 with the overall ISs of five other informal science events at the SLSC and on comparing the measures of comfort in presenting to the public and familiarity with the scientific concepts (both scored from 1 to 4) in years 1 and 2.RESULTSImpact of RWN on science knowledge and perceptions of scientists.Cohort 1, a group of eight graduate students, five of whom were in at least their third year of their studies, premiered RWN in October 2008 during SciFest 2008. Approximately 600 visitors attended during the 5-h session. Evaluations of 42 adults and 13 children revealed an overall IS for this first presentation of 14.27 (of 16). When cohort 1 delivered their interactive exhibit again in March 2009 during NeuroDay, the IS was 14.78 (n = 32 adults and 13 children surveyed). In comparison, visitors who experienced other aspects of NeuroDay (e.g., lectures and demonstrations), but not RWN, had a significantly lower IS (13.25, P < 0.01 by one-way ANOVA). The combination of both offerings of the program yielded an IS of 14.50, which was higher than the overall collection of all educational programs offered by the SLSC in 2009 (IS of 13.89). Programs offered by the SLSC in 2009 that featured presentations by science content experts to nonscience audiences provide another comparison. The Family Med School program, which featured family-oriented hands-on activities, had an IS of 14.34, comparable to that of RWN. The Science Café program, in which science experts lecture about their research to adult audiences, had an IS of 13.55, significantly lower than RWN (P < 0.01 by one-way ANOVA).Survey respondents indicated a perceived understanding of the students' research and more about scientists and the scientific process. For example, at NeuroDay 2009, visitors to cohort 1's RWN were asked to describe how well they understood the students' research. The mean rating was 3.4 of 4, with 47% selecting the highest rating from the choices of \"don't understand at all\" (1), \"sort of understand\" (2), \"understand pretty well\" (3), and \"understand very well\" (4).Evolution of the model: cohort 2 and ABC.The year after cohort 1 completed the program, a second group of nine students (cohort 2) completed the summer workshop series and developed a novel educational program for SciFest 2009. Unlike cohort 1, the majority of cohort 2 had only completed 1 yr of their graduate studies when the summer workshops began. ABC featured new hands-on activities and drew >400 visitors. Surveys indicated that this program had a lower IS (13.30, n = 47 adults and 21 children, 17% of visitors) than the initial presentation of RWN (P < 0.03). The relatively higher impact of the first cohort may have arisen from its more established students, with greater prior presentation experience. Importantly, as with cohort 1, the opportunity for students to refine and repeat their presentation as part of NeuroDay 2010 raised the IS (14.17, P < 0.02), based on 69 adults and 47 children surveyed from the >1,200 visitors who entered the ABC room.NeuroDay 2010 provided another opportunity to examine the continued influence of science communication training on interactions with the public. Three graduate students (two students from cohort 1 and one student from cohort 2) plus six other graduate students, two postdoctoral fellows, and one faculty member presented a series of neuroscience demonstrations for SLSC audiences. The IS for demonstrations presented by the students from cohorts 1 and 2 was 14.04, which was higher than for other motivated scientist volunteers (13.80 for graduate students, 13.00 for postdoctoral fellows, and 13.70 for faculty members). Thus, 25 h of training and project development in science communication positively impacted the audience understanding of scientific content and perception of scientists and demonstrates improvement in the effectiveness of student communication after such training.Impact on graduate students: improved familiarity and comfort.Through the survey feedback collected before the workshops, after twice delivering their program, and finally 1 yr later, students showed increases in their self-rated familiarity with informal science education and comfort with presenting science to nonscience audiences. Table 1 shows the students' mean rating (out of 4) with regard to their familiarity of informal science education (differences over time were significant at P < 0.01 by a paired-samples t-test). Table 2 shows their mean ratings (out of 4) with regard to the comfort with presenting science to nonscience audiences (differences over time are significant at P < 0.02 by a paired-samples t-test).Table 1.

The primary reason that this program appealed to busy graduate students, and thus motivated their participation, was by focusing on their professional development and opportunities to discuss their research with the public. Additionally, exit surveys show that student presenters found their training for and involvement in SciFest and NeuroDay increased their interest in further opportunities for science outreach. Students indicated they were \"extremely interested\" (mean of 3.5 of 4) in future neuroscience presentations at the SLSC. Balancing training time with graduate students' busy schedules played a role in this; students preferred summer workshops, when classes were not in session. Continued participation was higher for students who had completed at least 2 yr of graduate study but declined as students approached graduation. First-year and fourth-year students cited the time commitment as their primary reason for withdrawing. We conclude that students in the middle stages of their graduate careers are most likely to complete professional development and continue participating in science outreach.Specific training in science communication augments scientists' impact on public understanding of science and perception of scientists. As shown from the students' feedback, the ability to effectively communicate content improves with repeated presentations (Supplemental Data–Responses). While the SLSC staff provided guidance and tools, ultimately it was the graduate students who educated visitors about brain science and informed them about their research. Thus, this model provides valuable and relevant professional development to graduate students in independence and communication skills.Talented graduate students who are invested in good science communication stand out among their peers. As one participant stated, \"I have a new appreciation for the challenges and opportunities associated with communicating science to laypeople.

    "abstract": "To address the need for greater flexibility in access to higher education, an online graduate course in physiology using case studies was developed and offered in summer 2012. Topics in both animal and human physiology were organized as modules that contained a case study with questions, a prerecorded online lecture, and three research journal articles. We followed best practices for teaching and learning in distance education, including the preparation of materials before the course starting date, a discussion board for responding to pre- and postcase discussion questions, and prompt reply to student queries. For exams, students generated their own questions based on new cases and developed their own case study for the final project. Although only 20% of students had previously taken an online course, all students stated that they would recommend this course to others. Postcase assessment indicated that students found the cases interesting, informative, and presented at the appropriate level. Most students said that the online course took them more time but that they learned more content and used the primary literature more than in a traditional class. Our results indicate that a well-organized physiology course using a case study format is a very effective model for online learning.",

    "abstract": "Different tools have been used to facilitate the teaching and learning process in different areas of knowledge. Practical activities represent a form of teaching in which students not only listen to theoretical concepts but are also able to link theory and practice, and their importance in the biological sciences is notable. Sometimes, however, there is neither the time nor the resources to promote laboratory practices in physiology classes. In this sense, home-based practical activities may be an interesting alternative. Here, different approaches of practical activities were used and students' perceptions of the contributions of home-based practical activities (HBPA) and laboratory-based practical activities (LBPA) for physiology learning were collected. After each approach, the students evaluated the activities through an anonymous questionnaire. A total of 49 students completed the questionnaires, and the results demonstrate that both HBPA and LBPA were considered important contributors to physiology learning but that this contribution was more significant in the case of LBPA (χ2 = 4.356, P = 0.037).",

    "abstract": "Using an educational data mining approach, first-year academic achievement of undergraduate nursing students, which included two compulsory courses in introductory human anatomy and physiology, was compared with achievement in a final semester course that transitioned students into the workplace. We hypothesized that students could be grouped according to their first-year academic achievement using a two-step cluster analysis method and that grades achieved in the human anatomy and physiology courses would be strong predictors of overall achievement. One cohort that graduated in 2014 (n = 105) and one that graduated in 2015 (n = 94) were analyzed separately, and for both cohorts, two groups were identified, these being \"high achievers\" (HIGH) and \"low achievers\" (LOW). Consistently, the anatomy and physiology courses were the strongest predictors of group assignment, such that a good grade in these was much more likely to put a student into a high-achieving group. Students in the HIGH groups also scored higher in the Transition to Nursing course when compared with students in the LOW groups. The higher predictor importance of the anatomy and physiology courses suggested that if a first-year grade-point average was calculated for students, an increased weighting should be attributed to these courses. Identifying high-achieving students based on first-year academic scores may be a useful method to predict future academic performance.",

    "abstract": "Drawings are an underutilized assessment format in Human Anatomy and Physiology (HA&P), despite their potential to reveal student content understanding and alternative conceptions. This study used student-generated drawings to explore student knowledge in a HA&P course. The drawing tasks in this study focused on chemical synapses between neurons, an abstract concept in HA&P. Using two preinstruction drawing tasks, students were asked to depict synaptic transmission and summation. In response to the first drawing task, 20% of students (n = 352) created accurate representations of neuron anatomy. The remaining students created drawings suggesting an inaccurate or incomplete understanding of synaptic transmission. Of the 208 inaccurate student-generated drawings, 21% depicted the neurons as touching. When asked to illustrate summation, only 10 students (roughly 4%) were able to produce an accurate drawing. Overall, students were more successful at drawing anatomy (synapse) than physiology (summation) before formal instruction. The common errors observed in student-generated drawings indicate students do not enter the classroom as blank slates. The error of \"touching\" neurons in a chemical synapse suggests that students may be using intuitive or experiential knowledge when reasoning about physiological concepts. These results 1) support the utility of drawing tasks as a tool to reveal student content knowledge about neuroanatomy and neurophysiology; and 2) suggest students enter the classroom with better knowledge of anatomy than physiology. Collectively, the findings from this study inform both practitioners and researchers about the prevalence and nature of student difficulties in HA&P, while also demonstrating the utility of drawing in revealing student knowledge.",

    "abstract": "During the last century, historians have discovered that between the 13th and 18th centuries, at least six sages discovered that the air we breathe contains something that we need and use. Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288) in Cairo and Michael Servetus (1511–1553) in France accurately described the pulmonary circulation and its effect on blood color. Michael Sendivogius (1566–1636) in Poland called a part of air “the food of life” and identified it as the gas made by heating saltpetre. John Mayow (1641–1679) in Oxford found that one-fifth of air was a special gas he called “spiritus nitro aereus.” Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1742–1786) in Uppsala generated a gas he named “fire air” by heating several metal calcs. He asked Lavoisier how it fit the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier never answered. In 1744, Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) in England discovered how to make part of air by heating red calc of mercury. He found it brightened a flame and supported life in a mouse in a sealed bottle. He called it “dephlogisticated air.” He published and personally told Lavoisier and other chemists about it. Lavoisier never thanked him. After 9 years of generating and studying its chemistry, he couldn't understand whether it was a new element. He still named it “principe oxigene.” He was still not able to disprove phlogiston. Henry Cavendish (1731–1810) made an inflammable gas in 1766. He and Priestley noted that its flame made a dew. Cavendish proved the dew was pure water and published this in 1778, but all scientists called it impossible to make water, an element. In 1783, on June 24th, Lavoisier was urged to try it, and, when water appeared, he realized that water was not an element but a compound of two gases, proving that oxygen was an element. He then demolished phlogiston and began the new chemistry revolution.",

    "abstract": "In the country presently, preclinical medical students are not routinely exposed to real patients. Thus, when they start clinical postings, they are found to have poor clinical reasoning skills. Simulated virtual patients (SVPs) can improve clinical skills without endangering real patients. This pilot study describes the development of two SVPs in endocrine physiology and their validation in terms of acquisition of clinical knowledge and student engagement. Two SVPs, Nandini Sharma (unintentional weight gain) and Sunil Yadav (polyuria), were created and published on the i-Human Patients platform through an iterative, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary collaborative process using the conceptual framework of Kim et al. (Kim S, Phillips WR, Pinsky L, Brock D, Phillips K, Keary J. Med Educ 40: 867–876, 2006). After internal and external peer validation, the SVPs were piloted on 40 students (20 students per virtual patient) over 2 wk. A cognitive pretest was conducted before exposure, and a posttest soon after. Faculty and student feedback were collected. Faculty found SVPs authentic, helpful as teaching-learning tools, and useful for giving feedback and for assessment. Students found SVPs more engaging than paper cases and helpful in developing clinical reasoning and in imparting clinical exposure. Pretest and posttest scores indicated knowledge gain ( P &lt; 0.01). Although challenging to create, SVPs created on the i-Human Patients platform improved learning in endocrine physiology and were well accepted by students and faculty as a means to provide early clinical exposure. More SVPs can be developed through collaboration between stakeholder departments and integrated into the curriculum for greater benefit.",

    "abstract": "Historically, attendance has been a marker of academic performance, but the current medical education literature has had mixed results. In addition, attendance is dropping in the preclinical curricula, whereas, at the same time, the focus on United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 performance is increasing. This present study is a mixed-method approach correlating student attendance and access to the formal curriculum in a second-year pathophysiology course to performance on Step 1. Additionally, survey and focus group data evaluated the usage and importance of both the formal curriculum and third-party resources. Out of 112 eligible students, 77 participated in the study. There was no correlation between attendance or access to the learning materials and Step 1 performance. There was a strong correlation between the performance on the final examination and that of Step 1 (r = 0.813; P < 0.001) and a moderate correlation between formative quiz (r = 0.321; P = 0.005) and individual readiness assessment test performance (r = 0.351; P = 0.002) and Step 1 performance. Survey and focus group data show that students place high importance on faculty-developed materials that they can use on their own, but not attendance. The third-party resources are highly used as an adjunct to the formal curriculum and to focus on Step 1 study. Attendance and access to the formal curriculum do not predict Step 1 performance, whereas performance on high- and low-stakes internal assessments do. Further study on how the lack of social interaction gained from attendance affects development of other competencies and the learning climate are warranted.",

This article describes the results of a 2-yr research study that involved efforts to develop the pedagogical expertise of a group of anatomy and physiology instructors at the college level. Data were collected through a series of individual interviews that included the use of the Teacher Beliefs Inventory questionnaire ( 23 ) along with observations onsite in participants' college classrooms and at process-oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) curriculum writing workshops. Findings indicated attitudinal shifts on the part of participants from teacher-centered to more student-centered pedagogy and supported the benefits of long-term professional development for instructors. Here, we documented the successful progress of these professors as they participated in a curriculum development process that emphasized student-centered teaching with the goal of promoting broader change efforts in introductory anatomy and physiology.",

    "abstract": "Anatomy has historically been a cornerstone in medical education regardless of specialty. It is essential for physicians to be able to perform a variety of tasks, including performing invasive procedures, examining radiological images, performing a physical examination of a patient, etc. Medical students have to be prepared for such tasks, and we can assist this by changing the way that we educate students in medical schools. Thus, newer medical curricula need to be designed according to needs of future physicians. In this report, we describe a unique program called the Integrated Clinical Anatomy Program (ICAP). The ICAP was developed at the College of Medicine of Alfaisal University in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Here, we describe the unique features of this program, including the structure and facilities of the Anatomy Resource Center. The Anatomy Resource Center plays a pivotal role in engaging the students for faculty-directed structured laboratory sessions as well as peer-assisted uniform student-centered learning. The ICAP has shown great promise, as reflected by early results from a nationwide progress test. Students from all years of the Alfaisal University medical school scored significantly higher than the national average on the anatomy and physiology component of the nationwide progress test examination, with P values of 0.0179 and 0.0015, respectively. We believe that the ICAP can be used as a model for teaching clinically applied functional anatomy to medical students in a hybrid curriculum around the world.",

    "abstract": "In the 19th century, the concept of experimental physiology originated in France with Claude Bernard, evolved in Germany stimulated by the teaching of Carl Ludwig, and later spread to Britain and then to the United States. The goal was to develop a physicochemical understanding of physiological phenomena. The first International Physiological Congress occurred in 1889 in Switzerland with an emphasis on experimental demonstrations. The XIIIth Congress, the first to be held outside of Europe, took place in Boston, MA, in 1929. It was a watershed meeting and indicated that American physiology had come of age. Meticulously organized, it was the largest congress to date, with over 1,200 participants from more than 40 countries. Getting to the congress was a cultural adventure, especially for the 400 scientists and their families from over 20 European countries, who sailed for 10 days on the S.S. Minnekahda. Many of the great physiologists of the world were in attendance, including 22 scientists who were either or would become Nobel Laureates. There were hundreds of platform presentations and many experimental demonstrations. The meeting was not without controversy as a conflict, still not completely settled, arose over the discovery of ATP. After the meeting, hundreds of participants made a memorable trip to the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA, which culminated in a \"good old fashioned Cape Cod Clambake.\" Although not as spectacular as the 1929 congress, the physiological congresses have continued with goals similar to those established more than a century ago.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to peer-assisted learning (PAL) in clinical training, there is scant literature on the efficacy of PAL during basic medical sciences teaching for preclinical students. A group of senior medical students aimed to design and deliver clinically oriented small-group tutorials after every module in the preclinical curriculum at a United Kingdom medical school. Twenty tutorials were delivered by senior students throughout the year to first- and second-year students. A baseline questionnaire was delivered to inform the development of the program followed by an end-point questionnaire the next year (n = 122). Quizzes were administered before and after five separate tutorials to assess changes in mean student scores. Additionally, each tutorial was evaluated via a questionnaire for participants (n = 949). All five posttutorial quizzes showed a significant improvement in mean student score (P < 0.05). Questionnaires showed students found the program to be relevant and useful for revision purposes and appreciated how tutorials contextualized basic science to clinical medicine. Students appreciated the interactive nature of the sessions and found receiving personalized feedback about their learning and consolidating information with someone familiar with the material to be useful. With the inclusion of the program, students felt there were now an adequate number of tutorials during the year. In conclusion, this study shows that senior medical students can design and deliver a program that adds value to the mostly lecture-based formal preclinical curriculum. We hope that our study can prompt further work to explore the effect of PAL on the teaching of basic sciences during preclinical studies.",

In addition, exercise can improve the pathogenesis and symptoms associated with a variety of chronic disease states and can attenuate drug-induced adverse effects. Exercise is a drug-free polypill. Because the benefits of exercise are clear and profound, Exercise is Medicine, a joint initiative between the American Medical Association and American College of Sports Medicine, was launched in 2007 to call on all health care providers to counsel patients and prescribe exercise in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease states. Pharmacists play an increasing role in direct patient care and are the most accessible health care providers in the community. Thus, pharmacists should be knowledgeable in counseling patients on the frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise that is appropriate for various conditions and disease states. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of didactic course offerings in United States pharmacy school curricula regarding training in exercise prescription. School websites were accessed for information regarding course offerings in PharmD programs. No United States pharmacy schools offered courses that were dedicted to the role of exercise in disease prevention or exercise prescription in disease management. Ninety percent of pharmacy schools did not offer courses with the keywords \"exercise,\" \"fitness, or \"physical activity\" in the title or description. The data suggest that student pharmacists are not adequately trained to counsel patients on the benefits of exercise or exercise prescription.",

    "abstract": "Didactic lectures are prevalent in physiology courses within veterinary medicine programs, but more active learning methods have also been utilized. Our goal was to identify the most appropriate learning method to augment the lecture component of our physiology course. We hypothesized that case-based learning would be well received by students and would be more effective at helping them learn physiological concepts compared with more traditional laboratory exercises. In this study, approximately one-half of the laboratory sessions for the two-semester course were dedicated to traditional hands-on laboratory exercises, whereas the remaining one-half of the sessions were dedicated to case-based exercises. The lecture portion of the course was not altered. Student attitudes were evaluated after each session and at the end of each semester via quantitative and qualitative survey questions. Student performance was evaluated using section exams and end-of-semester posttests. The vast majority of survey responses received were positive for both cased-based activities and traditional hands-on laboratories. In addition, participation in both types of active learning activities, but not lecture, was associated with retention of conceptual knowledge based on student performance between the section exams and posttests ( P < 0.002). These results indicate that both case-based learning and laboratory exercises are beneficial learning activities to incorporate into a lecture-based physiology course. However, positive survey responses were significantly greater following case-based activities vs. traditional hands-on laboratories, and only participation in case-based activities resulted in greater student performance on the posttest ( P < 0.04). Therefore, case-based activities may be the preferred supplemental learning activity for veterinary medical physiology.",

The concepts of human physiology lay the foundation for health professions courses, such as pathophysiology. The National Council Licensing Exam for registered nurses (a timed nursing licensure exam) and the American College of Sports Medicine timed licensure exams for exercise sciences students have a framework consisting of human physiology concepts and are computer adaptive testing (CAT) assessments. This provides a case for electronic testing (in the undergraduate class setting) as a preparatory measure for CAT licensing exams. Case studies have illustrated a high information retention rate, with students completing online homework vs. paper, as well. Additionally, in recent years, virtual laboratories for non-physical science majors have been described as safer and effective for the purposes of educating students in laboratory techniques and experimental measures. Lastly, a successful learning approach utilized by museums has been found to be effective in younger students as well: “touch learning” (tactile learning). It also is important to note that student discussions and the face-to-face teaching dynamic play a critical role in the undergraduate education process. As such, the teaching methodology discussed here combines e-learning, virtual laboratories, tactile learning, and face-to-face didactic instruction of human physiology in developing a course to engage undergraduate health professions students, increase retention of human physiology course materials, and simultaneously prepare students for the CAT assessments that are licensing exams.",

While in recent years many STEM faculty members have become aware of how well undergraduates can assist instructors in their teaching, many, if not most, university faculty still teach in traditional settings, where graduate students are the norm and use of undergraduates is a completely unexploited opportunity. Undergraduates can serve as effective teaching assistants and may bring unique skills and experience to undergraduate instruction not held by graduate students. Undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs) can provide additional support for reformed practices, which raise student learning. Based on cost, prior experience and success as students in same course, and shared vision with professors, a number of institutions have initiated UTA programs and reported increased student learning. The audience of this paper is faculty who are not familiar with the use of UTAs in university teaching, and the purpose is to review the literature on UTAs, contrast the contributions of UTAs and graduate teaching assistants, and examine the potential value of UTAs in undergraduate education.",

    "abstract": "Current interdisciplinary medical training calls for reforms and innovations in the assessment of pathophysiology education. Formative assessment is used to monitor student learning to provide ongoing feedback that can improve both learning and teaching. Beginning in 2016, we implemented a formative assessment composed of case-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for all students in all majors. In 2017, case study questions began to be employed in the formative assessment, and student-set, case-based questions were further introduced. Aiming to gather the students’ suggestions and feedback on the mixed-method assessment, we conducted a survey on aspects such as the effectiveness of the assessment, assessment content and completion, opinions on student-set questions, and the impact on pathophysiology learning for students from 2017 to 2019. In addition, we compared students’ semesterly final scores with those of previous students and evaluated the relationship between formative and summative assessment scores. The results for 1,277 students clearly showed that the reformed formative assessment system was well received by the students. The students thought that the formative assessment not only allowed for the provision of real-time feedback on the effectiveness of teaching and learning but also nurtured self-motivation, the development of analytical and problem-solving skills, and collaborative efforts. Both the semesterly final scores and the proportions of students scoring in higher score ranges increased after the implementation of the formative assessment, and the summative assessment scores were positively related to the formative assessment scores. Consequently, the reformed formative assessment system significantly improved the quality of pathophysiology education.",

    "abstract": "There has been growing evidence that flipped teaching (FT) can increase student engagement. Traditional lecture-based teaching (TT) method was compared with FT and FT combined with retrieval practice (FTR) in a 400-level Exercise Physiology course over eight semesters. In the FT format, lecture content was assigned for students to prepare before class along with an online quiz. During class, the assigned content and quiz questions were reviewed, and a team-based learning (TBL) activity was conducted. Students found FT implementation three times a week (FT3) to be overwhelming, which led to reconfiguration of the FT design to minimize the quiz and TBL sessions to one per week. Subsequently, FT was combined with retrieval exercises (FTR), which involved recalling information, thus promoting retention. The students in the FTR format were given weekly quizzes in class, where no notes were allowed, which affected their quiz grade negatively compared with FT ( P &lt; 0.0001). Again, no resources were permitted during FTR’s TBL sessions. When exam scores were compared with TT, student performance was significantly greater ( P &lt; 0.001) with the FT and FTR methods, suggesting these methods are superior to TT. While both male and female students benefited from FT and FTR methods compared with TT ( P = 0.0008), male students benefited the most (( P = 0.0001). Similarly, when the exam scores were organized into upper and lower halves, both groups benefited from FT and FTR ( P &lt; 0.0001) approaches. In conclusion, both FT and FTR methods benefit students more compared with TT, and male students are impacted the most.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the use of physiology core concepts within undergraduate physiology curricula to discern whether a common subset could be broadly recommended for inclusion in programmatic guidelines. A curricular survey tool was developed to evaluate the depth to which each core concept was included in physiology curricula. Seven self-selected physiology programs assessed core concept inclusion across all courses within the major (0 = not covered, 1 = minimally covered, and 2 = covered to a great extent). The top core concepts ranked by each institution varied considerably, but all were robustly represented across programs. The top five combined rankings for all institutions were as follows: 1) interdependence (1.47 ± 0.63); 2) structure/function (1.46 ± 0.72); 3) homeostasis (1.45 ± 0.71); 4) scientific reasoning (1.44 ± 0.70); and 5) cell-cell communication (1.38 ± 0.75). No common subset of specific core concepts was evident among the seven participating institutions. Next, results were compared with recent Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG) faculty and student surveys that ascertained perceptions of the top five most important core concepts. Three core concepts (homeostasis, structure/function, cell-cell communication) appeared in the top five in more than one-half of survey questions included. We recommend that future programmatic guidelines focus on inclusion of the core concepts of physiology as general models to scaffold learning in physiology curricula, but the programmatic guidelines should allow flexibility in the core concepts emphasized based on program objectives.",

Fundamental to the systematic organization of curriculum is understanding the interplay between three alignment factors present in all courses: assessments, TLAs (teaching and learning activities), and objectives, also known as the triadic model of alignment. Also important to this process is the inclusion of external alignment factors, such as cognitive level, professional skills, and the core concepts of physiology. When organized properly, alignment of internal and external factors provides a common language for discussing and comparing courses across departments and institutions. Databases such as e-CMS not only help organize curriculum, but also offer almost unlimited ways to combine, analyze, and share resultant data. This could provide value to students and their future employers by communicating with confidence the evidence-based knowledge, skills, and abilities gained in a course or program. The next phase of the alignment initiative that produced e-CMS is to develop a distributed online database for housing and sharing aligned assessments.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic triggered university lockdowns, forcing physiology educators to rapidly pivot laboratories into a remote delivery format. This study documents the experiences of an international group of 10 physiology educators surrounding this transition. They wrote reflective narratives, framed by guiding questions, to answer the research question: “What were the changes to physiology laboratories in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?” These narratives probed educators’ attitudes toward virtual laboratories before, during, and after the transition to remote delivery. Thematic analysis of the reflections found that before COVID-19 only a few respondents had utilized virtual laboratories and most felt that virtual laboratories could not replace the in-person laboratory experience. In response to university lockdowns, most respondents transitioned from traditional labs to remote formats within a week or less. The most common remote delivery formats were commercially available online physiology laboratories, homemade videos, and sample experimental data. The main challenges associated with the rapid remote transition included workload and expertise constraints, disparities in online access and workspaces, issues with academic integrity, educator and student stress, changes in learning outcomes, and reduced engagement. However, the experience generated opportunities including exploration of unfamiliar technologies, new collaborations, and revisiting the physiology laboratory curriculum and structure. Most of the respondents reported planning on retaining some aspects of the remote laboratories postpandemic, particularly with a blended model of remote and on-campus laboratories. This study concludes with recommendations for physiology educators as to how they can successfully develop and deliver remote laboratories.",

The articulated underlying goals for these efforts include an enhanced public understanding of science and science-related policy, an increased diversity in STEM careers, and an increase in the future STEM workforce. This effort is primarily driven by an underperformance of the United States that includes poor test performance and limited number of students pursuing STEM degrees. Despite this investment, attitudes toward STEM have not notably changed. The goal of this project was to determine students’ attitudes toward STEM in response to a previously established scientific outreach event. This event was used to address three common goals in STEM outreach: STEM literacy, diversity and inclusion, and career preparedness. We found there was a notable difference in the attitudes toward scientific activities and interest in pursuing a “Science Career” after participation in this event. Strikingly, interest in hypothesis development, the keystone of all STEM disciplines, was the least liked of all the activities offered during the event. Our data suggest that events designed to enhance interest in pursuing a STEM career may benefit from different elements compared with events designed to increase understanding of STEM literacy concepts, such as hypothesis development.",

    "abstract": "Online resources are becoming increasingly important in undergraduate education and have been associated with a number of advantages and positive outcomes on students’ learning experience. However, online resource use by veterinary students for physiology learning remains poorly understood. Thus the present questionnaire-based study aims to investigate the extent to which first- and second-year veterinary students use online resources, including online video clips and social media, in their physiology learning and if this is influenced by factors of age, gender, entry status, or year of study. One-hundred and twenty-two students across seven UK universities completed the survey. Traditional resources (the lecturer and recommended textbooks) were the most preferred sources for physiology learning. Nonetheless, 97.5% of students used Internet search engines to explore physiology topics. Furthermore, students’ tendency to contact their instructor regarding a physiology question was low. Rather, 92.6% said they would first search for an answer online. Particularly popular was the use of online video clips with 91.1% finding them valuable for physiology learning and 34.21% finding them more useful for understanding physiology than university taught material or lecture slides. YouTube was the most common online video clip platform used by students. Most students stated that they would enjoy interacting with course materials on an instructor-led social media page, but only 33.9% currently use social media to discuss physiology-related issues with classmates. Additionally, most students expressed concerns regarding the reliability of online resources but attempts to fact-check these resources were relatively low. Therefore, online resources represent an essential part of veterinary students’ physiology learning and this suggests that educators can significantly improve student engagement and understanding of physiology by integrating these resources.",

    "abstract": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a key index of renal function. The classic method for assessing GFR is the clearance of inulin. Several current methods using isotopic ( 125 I-iothalamate, 51 Cr-EDTA, or 99 Tc-DTPA) or nonisotopic (iohexol or iothalamate) markers are available. Clinically, GFR is estimated (eGFR) from serum creatinine or cystatin C levels. Estimated GFR based on creatinine and/or cystatin are less accurate than measured GFR. The creatinine-based equations calculate higher eGFR values (suggesting better kidney function) for black individuals. This upward adjustment for all black individuals is embedded in eGFR calculations on the belief of higher serum creatinine concentrations among black individuals than among white individuals. Thus “race-corrected” eGFR has become a widely accepted and scientifically valid procedure. However, race is not a genetic or biological category. Rather, race is a social construction defined by region-specific cultural and historical ideas. Furthermore, there is no accepted scientific method for classifying people as black or white individuals. Studies typically rely on self-identification of race. However, any person in the United States with any known black ancestry is considered to be a black individual. This is known as the “one-drop rule,” meaning that a single drop of “black blood” makes anyone a black individual. It does not matter if an individual has 50%, 25%, 5%, or 0.5% African ancestry. The limited accuracy and reliability of this approach would not be allowed for any other scientific variable. Admixture and migration have produced such broad variations that race categories should not be used as experimental variables.",

    "abstract": "As educators around the world are exploring new approaches to keep students involved in remote learning during the pandemic, we investigated the utility of memes in promoting engagement in the online environment. Medical students enrolled in a human physiology course at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sohar, Oman were provided with an option to create memes related to the learning outcomes in renal physiology. One hundred forty-six of 280 students chose to create memes (52%), and the remaining students chose to submit either a labeled diagram or a concept map. Students uploaded their work in the discussion forum of the learning management system. All students enrolled in the course were given an opportunity for interaction with the uploaded content by commenting and upvoting thereafter. Students were requested to give anonymous feedback on their experience specifically on the activity related to memes. Feedback received from 142 of 280 students through anonymous comments was subjected to thematic analysis. Based on the analysis of the data, we found that memes elicited interest in the topic, facilitated peer interaction, simplified complex ideas, enhanced retention of associated concepts, and fostered a positive learning environment.",

Students' achievement upon assessment of CVS physiology theory content was also evaluated. Most students were ready for online learning in terms of appropriate equipment and internet connectivity. Most students expressed a preference for face-to-face learning of CVS physiology; however, they relied on recorded videos mainly for learning, instead of real-time attendance of physiology learning activities. Most students also reported a negative experience of distance online learning of CVS physiology during the lockdown, and only a few students expressed connection with their instructor through the physiology learning activities. Students undertaking online learning and examination during the pandemic achieved comparably to the prior year's cohort of PBL students learning in person and undertaking paper-based assessment. This indicates that our medical students preferred asynchronous learning during the pandemic confinement and that they sufficiently achieved their learning outcomes in CVS physiology, displaying resilience in their adaptation to the online learning and examination format.",

Yet little is documented about the challenges that undergraduates perceive in such classrooms and the students' ways of navigating them. Via mixed methods, we studied undergraduates' lived experience in one form of learner-centered teaching, hybrid project-/problem-based learning (PBL), in introductory organismal biology at a baccalaureate institution. Prominent in qualitative analyses of student interviews and written reflections were undergraduates' initial expectation of and longing for an emphasis on facts and transmission of them. The prominence diminished from semester's middle to end, as students came to value developing ideas, solving problems collaboratively, and engaging in deep ways of learning. Collaboration and personal resources such as belief in self emerged as supports for these shifts. Quantitative analyses corroborated that PBL students transformed as learners, moving toward informed views on the nature of science, advancing in multivariable causal reasoning, and more frequently adopting deep approaches for learning than students in lecture-based sections. The qualitative and quantitative findings portray the PBL classroom as an intercultural experience in which culture shock yields over time to acceptance in a way supported by students' internal resources and peer collaboration. The findings have value to those seeking to implement PBL and other complex-learning approaches in a manner responsive to the lived experience of the learner.",

However, resources that are freely available online vary in accuracy and quality, and the vast majority rely on passive learning. Therefore, there is a need for interactive physiology teaching resources that facilitate application of knowledge, that can be accessed by students in their own time. The aim of this study was to design a digital escape room on the topic of cardiac arrhythmias and to evaluate this resource as a consolidation exercise to support learning and enjoyment of physiology. The digital escape room was designed as a series of interactive puzzles and created with a website page builder on a freely accessible WordPress site. To facilitate engagement, the escape room incorporated a countdown timer. Second-year medical students were invited to play the digital escape room remotely as a group exercise after delivery of the relevant teaching. Evaluation of the resource took place quantitatively with Google Analytics and Tag Manager software and qualitatively with a questionnaire (Microsoft Forms). Quantitative evaluation suggested that the puzzles were created across a range of difficulties but that most groups were able to complete the exercise and remained engaged throughout. Student feedback suggests that the format of the resource was rated positively, and most participants felt that the game helped to consolidate and apply their knowledge of cardiovascular physiology. Future studies will focus on examining whether the cardiovascular-themed digital escape room improves knowledge attainment among students studying physiology in higher education.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article describes the design and development of a new, freely accessible cardiovascular-themed digital escape room.

Six SPLICE modules were administered to the intervention while the control group followed the traditional curricula. The educational outcome was compared using an end-of-module assessment. In addition, 13-item and 8-item questionnaires were administered to students to evaluate the SPLICE and plenary sessions on a 5-point Likert scale. Furthermore, students' feedback was obtained on a 10-point rating scale and in in-depth small-group interviews. The majority of students perceived that the SPLICE module improved their communication and encouraged meaningful, active learning. Students found the plenary sessions to be well organized, with sufficient interaction with professionals.

They offer potential benefits in medical education. This study explored the student's feedback on the utilization of LLMs in medical education. We conducted an in-depth interview with open-ended questions with Indian medical students via telephone conversation. The recording (average time 55.28±18.04 min) was transcribed and thematically analyzed to find major themes and sub-themes. We used QDA Miner Lite v.2.0.8 (Provalis Research: Montreal, Canada) for the thematic analysis of the text. A total of 25 students from eight Indian states studying from the first to final year of studies participated in this study. Three major themes were identified about usage scenario, augmented learning, and limitation of LLMs. Students use LLMs for clarifying complex topics, searching for customized answers, solving MCQs, making simplified notes, and streamlining assignments. While they appreciated the ease of access, ready reference for getting clarity on doubts, lucid explanation of questions, and time-saving aspects of LLMs, concerns were raised regarding erroneous results, limited usage due to reliability and privacy issues, and the overreliance on chatbots for educational needs. Hence, they emphasized the need for training for the integration of LLM in medical education. In conclusion, according to students' perception, LLMs have the potential to enhance medical education. However, addressing challenges and leveraging the strengths of LLMs are crucial for optimizing their integration into medical education.",

In rats, placing an orotracheal tube is technically difficult primarily because of the small size of the subject and the lack of equipment specifically designed for this task. We describe a simple rat intubation technique in which the animal is suspended in dorsal recumbency on an inclined metal plate. The animal, anesthetized with ether, is fixed to a 70 degrees-inclined metal plate in a dorsal position by means of a Mersilene ribbon hooked around the upper incisors. This method of positioning the animal is the most important step in the intubation process and further facilitates the technique already described by other authors. A human otoscope was used as a laryngoscope, intubation was performed using the Seldinger technique, and a 14-gauge intravenous catheter served as an endotracheal tube. This inexpensive technique is quickly learned and can be used in any laboratory. Safe and reliable airway management can thus be achieved, permitting in vivo examinations and operations.",

Repair of this misconception was used as a measure to compare the impact of three student laboratory protocols on learning by 696 undergraduate students at 5 institutions. Students were tested for the presence of the misconception before and after performing a laboratory activity in which they measured the effect of exercise on tidal volume and breathing frequency. The first protocol followed a traditional written \"observe and record\" (\"cookbook\") format. In the second treatment group, a written protocol asked students to complete a prediction table before running the experiment (\"predictor\" protocol). Students in the third treatment group were given the written \"predictor\" protocol but were also required to verbalize their predictions before running the experiment (\"instructor intervention\" protocol). In each of the three groups, the number of students whose performance improved on the posttest was greater than the number of students who performed less well on the posttest (P < 0.001). Thus the laboratory protocols helped students correct the misconception. However, the remediation rate for students in the \"instructor intervention\" group was more than twice that observed for the other treatment groups (P < 0.001). The results indicate that laboratory instruction is more effective when students verbalize predictions from their mental models than when they only \"discover\" the outcome of the experiment.",

    "abstract": "Peer leading of small-group discussion of cases; use of modified subjective, objective, assessment of physiology (SOAP) notes; and opportunities for self-assessment were introduced into a Medical Physiology course to increase students' awareness and practice of professional behaviors. These changes arose from faculty members' understanding of the hidden curriculum and their efforts to reveal it to take increased advantage of its educationally beneficial aspects. Faculty members and students observed that the requirement for students to submit SOAP notes before their discussions meant that they were well prepared to participate. Student satisfaction with the protocol was high, with >95% of the students agreeing that discussants were well prepared and that the overall performance of their discussion group was good. A comparison of students' performance on selected exam questions showed that peer leading was equally as effective as a previously used teacher-centered approach. Students agreed that their ability to analyze a clinical case had improved using this protocol, an effect that persisted at least one semester after the end of the course. These approaches were time and cost efficient from a faculty perspective while serving the needs of the students. The use of SOAP notes and peer-led discussion were effective forms of instruction, in which students succeeded in learning medical physiology and in practicing professional behaviors.",

Positive pressures are reported for the brain, kidneys, and liver (6) and particularly in various tumors (3). Although the reported values differ, pressures probably range from −8 mmHg in the lungs to −3 or −2 mmHg in subcutaneous tissue to 0, +1, and +2 mmHg in the liver and kidneys or +6 mmHg in the brain (4, 6). Interstitial pressure can reach very high positive values in tumors (from 20 to >40 mmHg) (2, 3). Reported findings in freshly burned tissue describe even more negative interstitial pressures that can reach −20 to −30 mmHg (8).During seminars on capillary dynamics, teachers are often asked to clarify the whole concept in a brief explanation. One of the possible interpretations, in a form of a manual for students, is presented here. The Croatian edition of Guyton and Hall's textbook (6) was used as the main reference.Interstitial Hydrostatic Pressure: a Manual for Students Reported interstitial pressures range from −8 to +6 mmHg in different tissues and from less than −20 mmHg in burned tissue or more than +30 mmHg in tumors. The negative interstitial pressures in subcutaneous tissue and other tissues are usually attributed to the action of lymphatics (1, 6). It was stated by Guyton and Barber (5) that \"… the only probable source of energy that could create the negative hydrostatic pressure in the free fluid and the equivalent negative chemical potential in the intragel fluid is a lymphatic suction pump. Unfortunately, the existence of this has not yet been proved, but mechanisms by which the terminal lymphatic system could act as a suction pump have been proposed.\"Muscle contractions compress and evacuate lymph vessels. The flow is centripetal because of lymph valves. Thus, negative subcutaneous pressures might develop ex vacuo, after tissue compressions by muscles, if intact valves in lymph vessels are able to prevent lymph flow back to the uncompressed tissue.We can try to simplify this concept by looking at different organs and tissues in more detail (Table 1). All organs with positive interstitial hydrostatic pressure are more or less space confined and lack any content of compressible gases. Fluid traffic in them must be balanced, inflow volumes must equal outflow volumes, and the interstitial hydrostatic pressure can be considered to be a result of outflow resistance. \\ For instance, kidney interstitial pressure will rise in urinary tract obstruction, in lymphatic obstruction, in perirenal compression due to injury, etc. Less outflow resistance leads to lower positive values of interstitial pressure in confined organs.Negative values are normally found only in lungs and subcutaneous tissue. These are the only two body parts freely compressed by outside air pressure. In both tissues under normal perfusion, outflow capacities (venous blood and lymph) are greater than needed for the inflow volume and capillary permeability. Large outflow capacities drain most of the interstitial water and reduce its hydrostatic pressure to 0. The draining process is augmented by the physical work of neighboring muscles in subcutaneous tissue or by breathing in lung tissue. In both cases, tissue movements and pressure changes help blood and lymph to leave the tissue.Tissue structures are deformed by the pressure of outside air. Cellular and interstitial structures tend to obtain a shape and position of minimal energy. Their recoil forces \"stretch\" the well-drained interstitial space and reduce the hydrostatic pressure in it to sub-zero values, so sub-zero values of hydrostatic pressure in small tissue volumes can result from forces of recoil of the cellular and interstitial structures around it. An optimal shape and position of tissue structures can be achieved only in edematous tissue when the interstitial pressure becomes positive due to compromised fluid outflow. (7) Table 1.

    "abstract": "It is often difficult for educators to teach a kinesiology and applied anatomy (KAA) course due to the vast amount of information that students are required to learn. In this study, a convenient sample of students (class A) from one section of a KAA course played the speed muscle introduction and matching game, which is loosely based off the premise of the adult game of \"speed dating.\" The game involves student's taking on a \"muscle\" personality when introducing themselves to potential mates. The experimental group (class A) played the game at two time points throughout the semester after a series of lectures focusing on the body's muscles. A control group (class B) from another section of the KAA course still received the series of lectures but did not play the games throughout the semester. A postgame questionnaire given to class A revealed the following scores: 1) overall perception of the game (score: 4.43 +/- 0.68), whether goals and objectives were met (score: 4.05 +/- 0.67 to 4.95 +/- 0.22), and perceptions of the organization of the game (score: 3.81 +/- 0.81 to 4.48 +/- 0.60). Overall, the game was well received by class A. When evaluating outcome scores of final grades between the two groups, class A improved final grades by 5.82% for a mean grade of 79.52 +/- 10.0; however, the final grades were not statistically significant (P > 0.05) compared with class B (73.7 +/- 15.6). The results show that an interactive game may contribute to improved final grades in a KAA course and could be an alternative means of disseminating kinesiology information.",

To address these questions, students first completed the exam in the traditional format as individuals. After completing the exam as individuals, students completed the same exam in groups of two. Finally, the same questions were discussed by the instructor and students (instructor feedback). We found that students with individual incorrect responses changed their answers during group testing more often than students with individual correct responses (odds ratio: 7.58, P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, student feedback was more beneficial when group members had different individual answers than when they had same individual answers ( P &lt; 0.05). In addition, when group members had different individual answers, more answers were changed to correct responses than to incorrect responses (77% vs. 23%, P &lt; 0.01). It was more important to have the correct answer than to be the high-performing student, because the student with the correct response (being either the high- or low-performing student) generally prevailed (∼ 80% of the time, P = 0.5). Finally, the positive effects of group testing (77% of total effects, P &lt; 0.05) were due to students who changed their individual answer to the correct response after discussion with peers with the correct response and also with the incorrect individual response.",

Second, use simplified analogies, such as a bathtub, to help students conceptualize new ideas. Third, introduce the concept of alveolar to arterial O(2) differences and the mechanisms for increasing differences as additional lung units are added. Fourth, use the consistent thread of causes of hypoxemia through the lecture to maintain continuity and provide clinical relevance. Finally, use clinically relevant examples at each step and solidify new concepts by discussing differential diagnoses at the end of the lecture(s).",

    "abstract": "The cause-effect relationship between lactic acid, acidosis, and muscle fatigue has been established in the literature. However, current experiments contradict this premise. Here, we describe an experiment developed by first-year university students planned to answer the following questions: 1) Which metabolic pathways of energy metabolism are responsible for meeting the high ATP demand during high-intensity intermittent exercise? 2) Which metabolic pathways are active during the pause, and how do they influence phosphocreatine synthesis? and 3) Is lactate production related to muscular fatigue? Along with these questions, students received a list of materials available for the experiment. In the classroom, they proposed two protocols of eight 30-m sprints at maximum speed, one protocol with pauses of 120 s and the other protocol with pauses of 20 s between sprints. Their performances were analyzed through the velocity registered by photocells. Blood lactate was analyzed before the first sprint and after the eighth sprint. Blood uric acid was analyzed before exercise and 15 and 60 min after exercises. When discussing the data, students concluded that phosphocreatine restoration is time dependent, and this fact influenced the steady level of performance in the protocol with pauses of 120 s compared with the performance decrease noted in the protocol with pauses of 20 s. As the blood lactate levels showed similar absolute increases after both exercises, the students concluded that lactate production is not related to the performance decrement. This activity allows students to integrate the understanding of muscular energy pathways and to reconsider a controversial concept with facts that challenge the universality of the hypothesis relating lactate production to muscular fatigue.",

    "abstract": "The year 2010 is the centennial of the publication of the \"Seven Little Devils\" in the predecessor of Acta Physiologica. In these seven papers, August and Marie Krogh sought to refute Christian Bohr's theory that oxygen diffusion from the lungs to the circulation is not entirely passive but rather facilitated by a specific cellular activity substitute to secretion. The subjects of the present reevaluation of this controversy are Christian Bohr, Professor and Doctor of Medicine (1855-1911), nominated three times for the Nobel Prize; August Krogh, Doctor of Philosophy (1874-1949), Christian Bohr's assistant and later Nobel Prize laureate (1920); and Marie Krogh, née Jørgensen, Doctor of Medicine and wife of August Krogh (1874-1943). The controversy concerned is the transport of oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream: are passive transport and diffusion capacity together sufficient to secure the oxygen supply in all circumstances or is there an additional specific (\"energy consuming\" or \"active\") mechanism responsible for the transport of oxygen from the alveoli into the bloodstream? The present discussion purports to show that the contestants' views were closer than the parties themselves and posterity recognized. Posterity has judged the dispute unilaterally from the Nobel laureate's point of view, but it is evident that August Krogh's Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery of a cellular activity (Christian Bohr's expression), represented by Krogh's discovery of capillary recruitment. Christian Bohr appears to have been correct in the narrower sense that the diffusion capacity at rest is not great enough to explain the transport during work; a special mechanism intervenes and optimizes the conditions under which diffusion acts. August Krogh, of course, was right in the wider sense that the transport mechanism itself is always entirely passive.",

Thus, we designed a hands-on activity followed by a small-group discussion on gut motility. Male awake rats were randomly submitted to insulin, control, or hypertonic protocols. Insulin and control rats were gavage fed with 5% glucose solution, whereas hypertonic-fed rats were gavage fed with 50% glucose solution. Insulin treatment was performed 30 min before a meal. All meals (1.5 ml) contained an equal mass of phenol red dye. After 10, 15, or 20 min of meal gavage, rats were euthanized. Each subset consisted of six to eight rats. Dye recovery in the stomach and proximal, middle, and distal small intestine was measured by spectrophotometry, a safe and reliable method that can be performed by minimally trained students. In a separate group of rats, we used the same protocols except that the test meal contained 99m Tc as a marker. Compared with control, the hypertonic meal delayed gastric emptying and gastrointestinal transit, whereas insulinic hypoglycemia accelerated them. The session helped engage our undergraduate students in observing and analyzing gut motor behavior. In conclusion, the fractional dye retention test can be used as a teaching tool to strengthen the understanding of basic physiopathological features of gastrointestinal motility.",

    "abstract": "The Association of American Medical Colleges has encouraged educators to investigate proper linkage of simulation experiences with medical curricula. The authors aimed to determine if student knowledge and satisfaction differ between participation in web-based and manikin simulations for learning shock physiology and treatment and to determine if a specific training sequencing had a differential effect on learning. All 40 second-year medical students participated in a randomized, counterbalanced study with two interventions: group 1 ( n = 20) participated in a web-based simulation followed by a manikin simulation and group 2 ( n = 20) participated in reverse order. Knowledge and attitudes were documented. Mixed-model ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of time ( F 1,38 = 18.6, P &lt; 0.001, η p 2 = 0.33). Group 1 scored significantly higher on quiz 2 (81.5%) than on quiz 1 (74.3%, t 19 = 3.9, P = 0.001), for an observed difference of 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 3.3, 11.0). Mean quiz scores of group 2 did not differ significantly ( quiz 1: 77.0% and quiz 2: 79.7%). There was no significant main effect of group or a group by time interaction effect. Students rated the simulations as equally effective in teaching shock physiology ( P = 0.88); however, the manikin simulation was regarded as more effective in teaching shock treatment ( P &lt; 0.001). Most students (73.7%) preferred the manikin simulation. The two simulations may be of similar efficacy for educating students on the physiology of shock; however, the data suggest improved learning when web-based simulation precedes manikin use. This finding warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "The expansion of biomedical knowledge and the pursuit of more meaningful learning have led to world-wide evidence-based innovative changes in medical education and curricula. The recent emphasis on problem-based learning (PBL) and student-centred learning environments are, however, not being implemented in Nigerian medical schools. Traditional didactic lectures thus predominate, and learning is further constrained by funding gaps, poor infrastructure, and increasing class sizes. We reviewed medical students' perceptions of their exposed learning environment to determine preferences, shortcomings, and prescriptions for improvements. The results confirm declining interest in didactic lectures and practical sessions with preferences for peer-tutored discussion classes, which were considered more interactive and interesting. This study recommends more emphasis on student-centered learning with alternatives to passive lecture formats and repetitive cookbook practical sessions. The institutionalization of student feedback processes in Nigerian medical schools is also highly recommended.",

Quantification of steady and presteady-state (transient) cardiovascular phenomena is traditionally done by differential equations, but this is time consuming and unsuitable for most undergraduate medical students. As a result, quantitative thinking about time-dependent physiological phenomena is often not extensively dealt with in an undergraduate physiological course. However, basic concepts of steady and presteady state can be explained with relative simplicity, without the introduction of differential equation, with equivalent electronic circuits (EECs). We introduced undergraduate medical students to the concept of simulating cardiovascular phenomena with EECs. EEC simulations facilitate the understanding of simple or complex time-dependent cardiovascular physiological phenomena by stressing the analogies between EECs and physiological processes. Student perceptions on using EEC to simulate, study, and understand cardiovascular phenomena were documented over a 9-yr period, and the impact of the course on the students' knowledge of selected basic facts and concepts in cardiovascular physiology was evaluated over a 3-yr period. We conclude that EECs are a valuable tool for teaching cardiovascular physiology concepts and that EECs promote active learning.",

One impetus for designing this activity was to address the needs of students who have a preference for kinesthetic learning and to help increase their understanding and engagement during lecture. This activity uses simple inexpensive materials, provides an effective model for demonstrating related pathophysiology, and helps promote active learning. The activity protocol and its implementation are described here in detail. We also report data obtained from student surveys and assessment tools to determine the effectiveness of the activity on student conceptual learning and perceptions. A brief multiple-choice pretest showed that although students had already been introduced to the relevant concepts in lecture, they had not yet mastered these concepts before performing the activity. Two postactivity assessments showed that student performance was significantly improved on the posttest compared with the pretest and that information was largely retained at the end of the course. Survey data showed that one-half of the students stated kinesthetic learning as among their learning preferences, yet nearly all students enjoyed and were engaged in this hands-on kinesthetic activity regardless of their preferences. Most students would recommend it to their peers and expressed a desire for more kinesthetic learning opportunities in the lecture curriculum.",

Curry described the effect of personality traits as the inner layer of learning, information-processing styles as the middle layer of learning, and environmental and instructional preferences as the outer layer of learning. The model that was developed elaborates on these layers by relating the personality traits central to learning to the different quadrants of brain preference, as described by Neethling's brain profile, as the inner layer of the onion. This layer is encircled by the learning styles that describe different information-processing preferences for each brain quadrant. For the middle layer, the different stages of Kolb's learning cycle are classified into the four brain quadrants associated with the different brain processing strategies within the information processing circle. Each of the stages of Kolb's learning cycle is also associated with a specific cognitive learning strategy. These two inner circles are enclosed by the circle representing the role of the environment and instruction on learning. It relates environmental factors that affect learning and distinguishes between face-to-face and technology-assisted learning. This model informs on the design of instructional interventions for physiology to encourage whole brain learning.",

    "abstract": "As part of a 3-wk intersession workshop funded by a National Science Foundation Expeditions in Computing award, 15 undergraduate students from the City University of New York 1 collaborated on a study aimed at characterizing the voltage dynamics and arrhythmogenic behavior of cardiac cells for a broad range of physiologically relevant conditions using an in silico model. The primary goal of the workshop was to cultivate student interest in computational modeling and analysis of complex systems by introducing them through lectures and laboratory activities to current research in cardiac modeling and by engaging them in a hands-on research experience. The success of the workshop lay in the exposure of the students to active researchers and experts in their fields, the use of hands-on activities to communicate important concepts, active engagement of the students in research, and explanations of the significance of results as the students generated them. The workshop content addressed how spiral waves of electrical activity are initiated in the heart and how different parameter values affect the dynamics of these reentrant waves. Spiral waves are clinically associated with tachycardia, when the waves remain stable, and with fibrillation, when the waves exhibit breakup. All in silico experiments were conducted by simulating a mathematical model of cardiac cells on graphics processing units instead of the standard central processing units of desktop computers. This approach decreased the run time for each simulation to almost real time, thereby allowing the students to quickly analyze and characterize the simulated arrhythmias. Results from these simulations, as well as some of the background and methodology taught during the workshop, is presented in this article along with the programming code and the explanations of simulation results in an effort to allow other teachers and students to perform their own demonstrations, simulations, and studies.",

It is up to teachers to structure courses and create learning opportunities that will increase the chance of student success. In an undergraduate exercise physiology course, concept maps are assigned to help students actively process and organize information into manageable and meaningful chunks and to teach them to recognize the patterns and regularities of physiology. Students are first introduced to concept mapping with a commonly relatable nonphysiology concept and are then assigned a series of maps that become more and more complex. Students map the acute response to a drop in blood pressure, the causes of the acute increase in stroke volume during cardiorespiratory exercise, and the factors contributing to an increase in maximal O(2) consumption with cardiorespiratory endurance training. In the process, students draw the integrative nature of physiology, identify causal relationships, and learn about general models and core principles of physiology.",

The reform effort in basic sciences was integrating histology and physiology into one course, increasing the two subjects' connection to clinical medicine, and applying new pedagogies and assessment methods. This study assessed the results of the reform by comparing the attitudes and academic achievements of students in the reform curriculum (n = 41) and their traditional curriculum peers (n = 182). An attitude survey was conducted to obtain students' views of their respective histology and physiology instruction. Survey items covered lectures, laboratory teaching, case analyses and small-group case discussions, assessment of students, and overall quality of the courses and instruction. A knowledge test consisting of questions from three sources was given to measure students' mastery of topics that they had learned. Results showed that reform curriculum students were rather satisfied with their course and new teaching methods in most cases. When these students' attitudes were compared with those of their traditional curriculum peers, several significant differences favoring the reform were identified regarding physiology teaching. No other significant difference was found for physiology or histology teaching. Reform curriculum students outperformed their peers on four of five subcategories of the knowledge test questions. These findings support the benefits of integration and state-of-the-art teaching methods. Our study may offer lessons to medical schools in China and other countries whose medical education is in need of change.",

    "abstract": "The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of changing a laboratory physiology course for undergraduate students from a traditional step-by-step guided structure to an inquiry-based approach. With this aim in mind, quantitative and qualitative evaluations of learning outcomes (individual subject-specific tests and group interviews) were performed for a laboratory course in cardiorespiratory exercise physiology that was conducted in one year with a traditional step-by-step guided manual (traditional course) and the next year completed with an inquiry-based structure (I-based course). The I-based course was a guided inquiry course where students had to design the experimental protocol and conduct their own study on the basis of certain predefined criteria (i.e., they should evaluate respiratory responses to submaximal and maximal exercise and provide indirect and direct measures of aerobic exercise capacity). The results indicated that the overall time spent on the experimental course as well as self-evaluated learning outcomes were similar across groups. However, students in the I-based course used more time in preparation (102 ± 5 min) than students in the traditional course (42 ± 3 min, P < 0.05), and 65 ± 5% students in the I-based course searched for additional literature before experimentation compared with only 2 ± 1% students in the traditional course. Furthermore, students in the I-based course achieved a higher (P < 0.05) average score on the quantitative test (45 ± 3%) compared with students in the traditional course (31 ± 4%). Although students were unfamiliar with cardiorespiratory exercise physiology and the experimental methods before the course, it appears that an inquiry-based approach rather than one that provides students with step-by-step instructions may benefit learning outcomes in a laboratory physiology course.",

The ability of students to concentrate diminishes 20–25 min after the start of the lecture (5). There is also a lack of active participation of students during theory lectures (10). In an effort to break the monotony of the lecture, an online blood grouping game was used to engage the students during a lecture on blood groups.Description of the ActivityThe online blood grouping game (latest English version) available freely on the Nobel Prize website was used for this activity (3, 8). After a 30-min lecture on blood grouping, 100 first-year medical students were given the opportunity to play the game in the lecture hall computer. These students are equivalent to the United States undergraduate college students. The activity consisted of blood grouping followed by transfusion of the appropriate blood to a virtual patient. A few students volunteered to play the game. The remaining students watched the game projected in the lecture hall. The spectators also helped the volunteers in doing the blood grouping and transfusion correctly. Feedback on the activity was taken at the end of the session using a questionnaire (Fig. 1).Fig. 1.Questionnaire given to the students.Download figureDownload PowerPointStudent FeedbackNinety-five students completed and returned the feedback questionnarie; 97% of the students felt that the game helped in understanding the basics of blood grouping, and 95% felt that it improved their understanding of blood grouping. For 89%, the game helped in reviewing their knowledge on blood grouping; 98% recommended this activity for future batches, and 99% wanted such activities for other topics. For 91%, this activity was a relief during the lecture, and 99% felt it was fun. A compilation of student feedback is shown in Fig. 2. Students were also given the opportunity to write their own comments about the activity. Forty students (42%) gave their own comments in the questionnaire. Some of the comments were “Feeling good,” “Fantastic!!!,” “Entertaining!,” “Excellent!!!,” “Amazing and innovative idea,” “Loved it!!,” “SUPERBBB!!!,” “It was an excellent way to keep interest going,” and “It was gr8 fun to play. Learnt a lot.” There were no negative comments.Fig. 2.Compilation of student feedback.Download figureDownload PowerPointDiscussionThe feedback and comments of the students were encouraging. This game can be easily used to supplement theory lectures on blood grouping to help students in understanding the basics of blood grouping. Puzzles and card games have been developed and used effectively by educators to supplement lecture materials (1, 9). The blood grouping game could also be used as a virtual experiment before a blood group practical. The game helped students in enhancing their understanding of blood grouping and gave an opportunity for students to review their existing knowledge. Games have been used by educators to help students to review information provided previously during lectures (2, 6, 11, 12). Students were able to put their knowledge into practical use in a simulated clinical setting while playing the blood grouping game. Games have been shown to provide a fun-filled environment for students to apply the information that they have acquired from lectures (4). The results of the student feedback show that they want such activities for future batches and for other topics. The activity was fun and a relief from the routine lecture for most of the students. Activities like games are useful in breaking the monotony of didactic lectures and also to get active participation of students during the lecture. Such activities are interesting for students and can be used to get their attention during lecture.LimitationsThe game was played on a single computer available in the lecture hall. Hence, only a few student volunteers were able to play the game. However, the remaining students watched the game and helped the volunteers to correct their mistakes while playing the game. Feedback about the activity was obtained using a simple questionnaire. This offered only limited choices for the students to rate the activity. A five-level Likert scale could be used in the future for assessing the effectiveness of the activity. Student assessment for evaluating improvement in understanding of the subject or improvement in examination performance was not done. Such assessments could be done for future classes comparing one group exposed to lecture alone and the other group exposed to lecture and the blood grouping game.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: A.B. conception and design of research; A.B. performed experiments; A.B. analyzed data; A.B. interpreted results of experiments; A.B. prepared figures; A.B. drafted manuscript; A.B. edited and revised manuscript; A.B. approved final version of manuscript.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe author thanks the first-year medical students of the 2013 class for participating in this activity.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "The force-frequency relationship has intrigued researchers since its discovery by Bowditch in 1871. Many attempts have been made to construct mathematical descriptions of this phenomenon, beginning with the simple formulation of Koch-Wesser and Blinks in 1963 to the most sophisticated ones of today. This property of cardiac muscle is amplified by β-adrenergic stimulation, and, in a coordinated way, the neurohumoral state alters both frequency (acting on the sinoatrial node) as well as force generation (modifying ventricular myocytes). This synchronized tuning is needed to meet new metabolic demands. Cardiac modelers have already linked mechanical and electrical activity in their formulations and showed how those activities feedback on each other. However, now it is necessary to include neurological control to have a complete description of heart performance, especially when changes in frequency are involved. Study of arrhythmias (or antiarrhythmic drugs) based on mathematical models should incorporate this effect to make useful predictions or point out potential pharmaceutical targets.",

    "abstract": "Concept mapping and retrieval practice are both educational methods that have separately been reported to provide significant benefits for learning in diverse settings. Concept mapping involves diagramming a hierarchical representation of relationships between distinct pieces of information, whereas retrieval practice involves retrieving information that was previously coded into memory. The relative benefits of these two methods have never been tested against each other in a classroom setting. Our study was designed to investigate whether or not concept mapping or retrieval practice produced a significant learning benefit in an undergraduate physiology course as measured by exam performance and, if so, was the benefit of one method significantly greater than the other. We found that there was a trend toward increased exam scores for the retrieval practice group compared with both the control group and concept mapping group, and that trend achieved statistical significance for one of the four module exams in the course. We also found that women performed statistically better than men on the module exam that contained a substantial amount of material relating to female reproductive physiology.",

    "abstract": "The educators have underlined the importance of lecture attendance for decades. Nowadays, students have ample online educational sources, which began a debate on the necessity of in-class lectures. In the present study, we investigated the influence of lecture attendance on the exam success. To this aim, we adopted a novel approach and matched second-year medicine students' answers in three interim exams with the lectures related to those questions. Thereby, we were able to evaluate if attending lectures increases the chance of giving a correct answer to the exam question generated from the attended lecture. Furthermore, we examined students who had never taken the course before (first-time takers) and students who had failed and repeated the course (repeat takers) separately, since repeat takers may have attended a lecture previously. We found that first-time takers attended more lectures and gained higher total scores than repeat takers. Lecture-matched correct answers were significantly higher for attended lectures than for skipped lectures in all interim exams. Moreover, the correlation analyses revealed that the number of correct answers increases by lecture attendance in both first-time and repeat takers. These results indicate that in-class lectures still should be considered as an essential part of the medical physiology education, even in the internet era.",

Therefore, it is unsurprising that many people would not only wish to attain these powers, but also to learn about scientific accessibility to these powers. Popular culture characters such as superheroes can provide a unique platform for the communication of difficult scientific concepts. In the classroom, these characters can be used to communicate learning objectives to students in an interesting, fun, and accessible manner by taking advantage of student familiarity with the characters. Hawkeye, a member of the Avengers, is one such superhero who can be utilized by educators. His powers can be attributed in part to his advanced eyesight, which has physiological aspects in common with many birds of prey. Hence, Hawkeye can instigate discussion on the physiology of the human eye, while also allowing for comparison with other species, such as birds of prey, and reflection on advancements related to genetic engineering and wearable technologies. In addition, in my experience, Hawkeye has proven to be a highly suitable popular culture character for use in scientific communication and outreach.",

Research has demonstrated that active learning and learning in which students cognitively engage with the material in a multitude of ways result in better understanding and retention. The aim of the present study was to determine which of three pedagogical techniques led to improvement in learning and retention in undergraduate college students. Subjects partook in one of three different types of pedagogical engagement: hands-on learning with a model, observing someone else manipulate the model, and traditional lecture-based presentation. Students were then asked to take an online quiz that tested their knowledge of the new material, both immediately after learning the material and 2 wk later. Students who engaged in direct manipulation of the model scored higher on the assessment immediately after learning the material compared with the other two groups. However, there were no differences among the three groups when assessed after a 2-wk retention interval. Thus active learning techniques that involve direct interaction with the material can lead to learning benefits; however, how these techniques benefit long-term retention of the information is equivocal.",

    "abstract": "Peer instruction has been used extensively in lecture courses; however, there is little evidence of its use in laboratory courses. The purpose of the present study was to describe the implementation of the peer instruction method in a physiology laboratory course in China. Second-year medical students attended a 6-wk physiology laboratory course in the fall semester of the 2016-2017 school year. In the six new physiology laboratory classes, peer instruction strategies were used to substitute for the traditional short, didactic lectures. The effects of peer instruction were measured by in-class quizzes and confidence levels. The students' evaluations of peer instruction were measured by a Likert scale questionnaire. Peer instruction significantly improved the mean score on quizzes (0.53 ± 0.50 vs. 0.68 ± 0.47, P < 0.001) and confidence levels (2.36 ± 0.66 vs. 2.80 ± 0.45, P < 0.001). Furthermore, for individual incorrect answers, 39.07% changed to correct answers after peer instruction, whereas, for correct answers, 6.61% were changed to an incorrect response. Overall, significantly more students changed their answers from incorrect to correct than from correct to incorrect [χ2: 333.11; degrees of freedom (df): 1; P < 0.001]. Therefore, the positive effects of peer instruction were higher than the negative effects (χ2: 244.55; df: 1; P < 0.001). Moreover, student evaluations of peer instruction were highly positive. In conclusion, the implementation of peer instruction to the physiology laboratory course is an effective strategy to enhance students' performance on in-class quizzes and confidence levels. In addition, the attitude of students toward peer instruction was favorable.",

The pass rates of physiology service modules have steadily declined over the years. While a system is in place to identify “at-risk” students, it is only activated after the first semester. As a result, it is only from the second semester of their first year studies onward that at-risk students can be formally assisted. The challenge is thus to devise an appropriate strategy to identify struggling students earlier in the semester. Using questionnaires, students were asked about attendance, financing of their studies, and relevance of physiology. After the first class test, failing students were invited to complete a second questionnaire. In addition, demographic data were also collected and analyzed. Correlation analyses were undertaken of performance indicators based on the demographical data collected. The 2011 class comprised mainly sport science students (57%). The pass rate of sport science students was lower than the pass rates of other students (42% vs. 70%, P &lt; 0.001). Most students were positive about physiology and recognized its relevance. Key issues identified were problems understanding concepts and terminology, poor study environment and skills, and lack of matriculation biology. The results of the first class test and final module marks correlated well. It is clear from this study that student performance in the first class test is a valuable tool to identify struggling students and that appropriate testing should be held as early as possible.",

Medical students at one academic medical center initiated an educational outreach program, called PULSE, that targets secondary students to foster their interest in healthcare and medicine. High school student participants are engaged in a semester-long course that relies on interactive lectures, problem-based learning sessions, mentoring relationships with medical students, and opportunities for shadowing healthcare providers. To date, the curriculum has been offered for 7 consecutive years. To determine the impact that participation in the curriculum has had on college/career choices and to identify areas for improvement, an electronic questionnaire was sent to former participants. Based on a 32% response rate, 81% of former participants indicated that participation in the course influenced their decision to pursue a medical/science-related career. More than half (67%) of respondents indicated intent to pursue a MD/PhD or other postgraduate degree. Based on responses obtained, additional opportunities to incorporate laboratory-based research and simulation sessions should be explored. In addition, a more formalized mentoring component has been added to the course to enhance communication between medical students and mentees. Health/medicine-related educational outreach programs targeting high school students may serve as a pipeline to introduce or reinforce career opportunities in healthcare and related sciences.",

The game challenged students to think about course vocabulary in novel ways and to use their collective knowledge to get their classmates to guess the terms. Comparison of pretest/posttest/delayed posttest data revealed that students achieved statistically significant learning gains for each unit after playing the game, and a survey of student perceptions demonstrated that the game was helpful for learning vocabulary as well as fun to play.

We used a quasiexperimental pretest/posttest nonequivalent group design to compare the test performances of second-year medical students (n = 311) taught by conventional didactic methods (traditional group) with those involved in a case-based problem-solving learning approach facilitated with mobile phones as web-based \"clickers\" (experimental group). Using their cell phones, students answered the same questions about the key physiological concepts three times. A pretest to determine their baseline knowledge was followed by two followup tests after 1 wk and 2 mo, respectively. The experimental group scored a mean of 93.2% correct items after 1 wk and 84.8% correct items after 2 mo [95% confidence intervals: (89.4, 97.0) and (79.4, 90.3), respectively]. Compared with their colleagues in the traditional group who scored 33.3% [95% confidence interval: (18.9, 47.8)] and 38.5% [95% confidence interval: (23.6, 53.4)] correct items, respectively, this was a significant increase of ∼50% (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, for the experimental group, Cohen's effect size (d) values of d = 1.67 (1-wk posttest) and d = 1.38 (2-mo posttest) suggested a very high practical significance. In contrast, in the traditional group, Cohen's d values of d = 0.04 (1-wk posttest) and d = 0.15 (2-mo posttest) assumed a very low practical significance.",

Within a practical session, teams of two or three students (1 subject and 1 or 2 investigators) performed one of three different trials: 1) inactive, in which subjects ingested a glucose solution (75 g in 300 ml of water) and rested in the seated position until the end of the trial; 2) prior activity, in which the subject performed 15 min of walking before glucose ingestion and a subsequent resting phase; and 3) postactivity, in which the subject ingested glucose solution, walked (15 min), and rested afterwards. Glucose levels were drawn before trials (fasting value), immediately after glucose ingestion (0 min), and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min thereafter. Students analyzed glucose values and worked on 12 tasks. Students evaluated the usefulness of the experiment; 54.2% of students found the experiment useful to enable them to gain a further understanding of the learning objectives and to clarify items, and 44.1% indicated that the experiment was necessary to enable them to understand the learning objectives. For 6.8% the experiment was not necessary but helpful to check what they had learned, and 3.4% found that the experiment was not necessary. The present article shows the great value of experiments within practical courses to help students gain knowledge of energy metabolism. Using an active learning strategy, students outworked complex physiological tasks and improved beneficial communication and interaction between students with different skill sets and problem-solving strategies.",

Given the demand for online learning in the health sciences, it is important to evaluate the efficacy of online and in-class teaching methods, especially as they are combined to form hybrid courses. The purpose of this study was to compare two hybrid physiology sections in which one section was offered mostly in-class (85% in-class), and the other section was offered mostly online (85% online). The two sections in 2 yr (year 1 and year 2) were compared in terms of knowledge of physiology measured in exam scores and pretest-posttest improvement, and in measures of student satisfaction with teaching. In year 1, there were some differences on individual exam scores between the two sections, but no significant differences in mean exam scores or in pretest-posttest improvements. However, in terms of student satisfaction, the mostly in-class students in year 1 rated the instructor significantly higher than did the mostly online students. Comparisons between in-class and online students in the year 2 cohort yielded data that showed that mean exam scores were not statistically different, but pre-post changes were significantly greater in the mostly online section; student satisfaction among mostly online students also improved significantly. Education researchers must investigate effective combinations of in-class and online methods for student learning outcomes, while maintaining the flexibility and convenience that online methods provide.",

Students were provided with prereading assignments (faculty developed PowerPoint slides containing diagrams with incomplete labeling/flowcharts with missing steps) pertaining to the DSL topic 1 wk before the scheduled small-group DSL presentations. During DSL presentation sessions, which were facilitated by teachers, a few students individually presented learning objectives in the specified topic. Apart from that, students discussed answers for the questions in the prereading assignment. Students were also given an opportunity to use technology to support DSL, by way of involving them in Pecha Kucha (PK) talks. The impact of the modified DSL method was determined by requesting students to respond to a validated questionnaire. Frequency analysis of the responses revealed that >60% of students were positive about the modified DSL sessions improving their DSL, presentation, collaborative learning, and information retrieving skills. Students agreed that PK talks helped them to learn how to organize content (65%), present concise information (65.8%), and apply creativity (72.5%). Even though small in number, there were comments that the prereading assignments were useful for learning. The present study revealed that, even though students actively participated in modified DSL sessions, their perceptions on satisfaction and usefulness of the same toward achievement of various skills were not encouraging. The study generated significant results, which implies that undergraduate medical students should be oriented on the relevance of active learning strategies in their future studies.",

After attending a presentation by the first author on the FC, a faculty member of a medical school in Mexico arranged for a 3-day workshop for 13 faculty members. The goal of the workshop was to train faculty to use the FC strategy in their classrooms to increase student engagement in learning. The workshop was in the FC style, where the participants would assume the role of students. Pre- and posttraining surveys were administered to examine participants' current teaching practices and to evaluate their perceptions of the FC. The participants overwhelmingly reported the need to change their lecture-based teaching, as it was not engaging students. Their large class size, lack of technology, training, and uncertainty of the effectiveness of new teaching methods had hindered participants from changing their teaching technique. The on-site training not only allowed the entire department to work closely and discuss the new teaching approach, but also reinforced the idea of changing their teaching strategy and embracing FC teaching method. After the workshop, participants reported being determined to use the FC strategy in their classrooms and felt more prepared to do so. The post-survey results indicated that participants valued the FC training in the flipped style and wanted more of the hands-on activities. In conclusion, the 3-day faculty workshop on the FC was successful, since every participant was motivated to use this teaching method.",

    "abstract": "Today most education institutions around the world have adopted the philosophy of outcome-based education. The emphasis in outcome-based education is achievement of outcomes; hence the curriculum should be designed in a way that it includes the components targeted specifically at achieving these outcomes. A discipline-based approach results in fragmentation of learning and lack of clinical applicability. Integrated teaching could be a solution to achieve required outcomes in a holistic way. Hence, the aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate an integrated teaching module. Temporal coordination of the basic sciences, along with correlation of learned topics to clinical settings, was done in the first year of the undergraduate medical program. The module was evaluated by obtaining qualitative and quantitative feedback from students. Student assessment was conducted with a test that had case vignettes and multiple-choice questions. In addition, students' change in learning approaches and self-directed learning readiness were collected. Students' perception regarding the educational environment was also obtained. Analysis of the data showed positive feedback from the students regarding the integrated teaching. Students' average score in the test was 86%. There was a significant increase in the scores for the deep approach and self-directed learning readiness in the posttest compared with the pretest. Moreover, students were found to be satisfied with the educational environment. Evaluation of integrated teaching revealed that it was well accepted by the students. Moreover, it facilitated the achievement of the students' outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Frogs are routinely used in physiology teaching laboratories to demonstrate important physiological processes. There have been recent directives that promote the use of the anesthetic MS-222 (tricaine methanesulfonate), rather than lowering body temperature with a cold water bath to prepare reptiles and amphibians for physiological experiments or euthanasia. Indeed, the most recent edition of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals proclaims that chilling in water is not an appropriate method and advocates for the usage of MS-222 or other anesthetics. However, prominent researchers have responded to this position by highlighting evidence that cooling ectothermic vertebrates is, in fact, an effective and appropriate method. Furthermore, MS-222 is a known voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker, and this anesthetic's impact on the physiology of excitable tissues suggests that its use might be incompatible with experiments on nerve and muscle tissues. In the present study, I examined the effects of MS-222 at a concentration of 1.5 g/l on nerve, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle physiology of frogs. I found that immersion of frogs in this anesthetic blocked basic nerve and muscle physiology, making the frogs unsuitable for laboratory experiments. Applying MS-222 directly to the sciatic nerve dramatically blocked normal excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle preparations, and direct application to the heart caused the organs to stop contracting. Based on these results, I conclude that MS-222 at the concentration studied may be incompatible with physiological preparations that rely on electrically excitable tissues for their normal function. Physiology educators who must use MS-222 with frogs should empirically determine an appropriate dosage and recovery time before using the anesthetic in the teaching laboratory.",

However, evaluation of these events’ effectiveness is difficult and somewhat rare. This study’s purpose was to better understand how effective an established physiology-based outreach program was in generating interest in STEM careers, while simultaneously providing information that can be used to increase the effectiveness of future events. We partnered with a private school located in Omaha, Nebraska, where 64–80 students participated in 3 h of physiology-based activities presented by volunteers from the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The event included a brief presentation of the eye, sensory, heart, and lung systems, followed by hands-on demonstrations and activities. Each session concluded with 15 min of questions and answers (Q&amp;A), where students were encouraged to engage the volunteers in inquiries about what they just learned, career-related questions, or any topic of their choosing. Each Q&amp;A session was audio recorded and evaluated using thematic analysis to identify patterns in the Q&amp;A data. Two major themes of questions were identified: 1) scientific content (animal circulatory systems and how organs are affected by disease or stimulus); and 2) career-related content, including typical day-to-day activities of a scientist and the volunteers’ satisfaction with a scientific career. We conclude that hands-on physiology-based learning opportunities are effective in generating short-term interest in STEM content and careers. The results of this study will also facilitate informed modification of event content to better suit student’s interests.",

The purpose of this laboratory activity was to introduce the concept of HRV to our students, while having them address a novel question of whether two yogic breathing techniques, namely alternate nostril breathing (ANB) and standard deep breathing (DB), impact the SD of instantaneous heart rate (SDHR), a measure of HRV. Fifty-five undergraduates enrolled in a physiology course designed for nonscience majors were tasked with analyzing HR and SDHR from electrocardiograms recorded during normal breathing, DB, and ANB. A repeated-measures ANOVA showed that HR was significantly, albeit slightly, elevated from normal (74.5 ± 13.4 beats/min; means ± SD) during DB (76.5 ± 11.2 beats/min), but not during ANB (75.7 ± 10.1 beats/min). Analysis of SDHR showed significant differences between conditions (normal: 5.5 ± 2.1, DB: 8.6 ± 3.0, ANB: 7.8 ± 2.8 beats/min). The instructors further analyzed the same data set using more robust measures of HRV (SD of sequential N-N intervals, root mean square of successive differences, and high-frequency domain of HRV) to determine whether SDHR during a 2-min epoch is a sufficient measure for HRV in the undergraduate course setting. Statistical analysis for these measures showed a near identical pattern of magnitude and significance among the groups as SDHR. Our students developed a greater appreciation for the effects of breathing patterns on HRV and HR, using the simple measure of SDHR.",

    "abstract": "Preload has been variously defined, but if there is to be a direct relationship with activity of the Frank-Starling mechanism in its action to increase the force and extent of contraction, preload must directly reflect myocardial stretch. The Frank-Starling mechanism is activated during any stretch of a cardiac chamber beyond its resting size, which is present immediately before contraction. Every left ventricle has an intrinsic and limited range of possible volumes at end diastole. There is a curvilinear relationship between left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and, at maximal or near maximal LVEDV, there will be a high LVEDP. Within the possible range, the LVEDV will be determined by the extent of filling, any change in LVEDV will result in changed activity of the Frank-Starling mechanism, and change in LVEDV might, therefore, be considered to represent change in preload. On the other hand, it is the difference between the current and the maximal possible LVEDV (or the preload reserve) that may be of the most clinical relevance. There is a reciprocal relationship between preload and preload reserve, with minor or absent LV preload reserve indicating that there will be either minimal or no increase in stroke volume following intravenous fluid administration. As left atrial pressure can remain within the normal range when the LVEDP is elevated, it is LVEDP, and not left atrial pressure, that provides the most reliable guide to preload reserve in an individual at a specific period in time.",

Given this constraint, recent efforts in the physiology teaching community, and in particular the Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG), have promoted using core concepts to help students master key physiological principles. This report summarizes the experiences of four faculty members who teach physiology using the core concepts in various educational environments and identifies several common strengths and challenges they have encountered thus far. Strengths of using the core concepts include the transfer of knowledge to solve unknown problems and providing a framework to build a course. Challenges include applying them in a teach-taught course and balancing time spent on content and the core concepts. This is the first report to document the use of the physiology core concepts in a course, and the authors encourage additional faculty to not only adopt the core concepts for their own use, but share their approaches and experiences with the entire teaching community.",

    "abstract": "Large classes taught with didactic lectures and assessed with multiple-choice tests are commonly reported to promote lower order (LO) thinking and a surface approach (SA) to learning. Using a case study design, we hypothesized that incorporating instructional scaffolding of core physiology principles and assessing students exclusively with long-answer written tests would encourage higher order (HO) thinking and promote a deep approach (DA) to learning in a two-course physiology sequence (Phys I and II), despite their large size. Test questions were categorized as LO or HO according to the Blooming Biology Tool, and students’ LO and HO performance was determined for each of six tests across the two courses. The validated Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire survey tool was administered at the beginning and end of each course to measure student approach to learning. HO performance was maintained across Phys I (72.9 ± 19.4 vs. 74.8 ± 20.7%, P = 0.37) and significantly improved across Phys II (69.9 ± 18.4 vs. 79.4 ± 14.8%, P &lt; 0.001). Unexpectedly, students’ LO performance declined from the beginning to end of Phys I (78.5 ± 20.6 vs. 69.4 ± 17.9%, P &lt; 0.001) and Phys II (80.5 ± 19.6 vs. 72.2 ± 24.3%, P &lt; 0.001). Students’ approach to learning did not change throughout Phys I or II, but at each time point students preferred a DA over a SA. Taken together, these results indicate that an intentionally designed large lecture class can support a DA to learning and suggests that this teaching and assessment structure may be particularly well suited to promote HO thinking, albeit possibly at the expense of LO thinking.",

    "abstract": "One of the most effective ways of engaging students of physiology and medicine is through laboratory demonstrations and case studies that combine 1) the use of equipment, 2) problem solving, 3) visual representations, and 4) manipulation and interpretation of data. Depending on the measurements made and the type of test, laboratory demonstrations have the added benefit of being able to show multiple organ system integration. Many research techniques can also serve as effective demonstrations of integrative human physiology. The \"Duffin\" hyperoxic rebreathing test is often used in research settings as a test of central respiratory chemosensitivity and cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2. We aimed to demonstrate the utility of the hyperoxic rebreathing test for both respiratory and cerebrovascular responses to increases in CO2 and illustrate the integration of the respiratory and cerebrovascular systems. In the present article, methods such as spirometry, respiratory gas analysis, and transcranial Doppler ultrasound are described, and raw data traces can be adopted for discussion in a tutorial setting. If educators have these instruments available, instructions on how to carry out the test are provided so students can collect their own data. In either case, data analysis and quantification are discussed, including principles of linear regression, calculation of slope, the coefficient of determination (R(2)), and differences between plotting absolute versus normalized data. Using the hyperoxic rebreathing test as a demonstration of the complex interaction and integration between the respiratory and cerebrovascular systems provides senior undergraduate, graduate, and medical students with an advanced understanding of the integrative nature of human physiology.",

Lecture content can be reinforced through practical learning experiences in clinical environments. In this study, we report a new approach using clinical simulation within a Human Pathophysiology course to enable undergraduate science students to see \"pathophysiology in action\" in a clinical setting. Students role played health professionals, and, in these roles, they were able to interact with each other and the manikin \"patient,\" take a medical history, perform a physical examination and consider relevant treatments.

Here, we report that students who performed a more comprehensive out-of-class exam debrief after the first exam significantly improve their exam performance compared with students that did not conduct the exam debrief. We also identify the most common mistakes that students make on exams and the most frequent self-selected strategies to improve their learning. By having students focus on missed questions coupled with addressing deficiencies in their test preparation strategies and behaviors, they likely engage in more self-regulated learning to better prepare for exams and avoid repeating past mistakes.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses the chalk talk’s potential as an active learning method. Although chalk talks are a form of interactive lecture, they have received little attention in the medical education literature compared with other active learning methods such as team-based learning and simulation. One of the authors (C. K. L. Phoon) has used chalk talks to teach congenital heart defects to first- and third-year NYU medical students for many years. His chalk talks have consistently earned among the highest teaching scores, and students have noted their strengths of being more interesting, clear, and tangible than didactic lectures. Using the teacher and student perspectives, we examine the chalk talk’s strengths and weaknesses compared with common passive and active learning methods. Chalk talks create a real-time, shared space that facilitates the active learning goals of helping students build, test, and revise mental models (conceptual frameworks). The limited amount of information that can be presented and the ability to solicit and arrange students’ ideas on the board lead to the cocreation of valuable conceptual frameworks. Chalk talks require less restructuring of teaching sessions than other active learning methods and are best suited to topics that hinge on understanding of concepts. We advocate for the chalk talk to be reexamined as a promising educational tool given its strengths and the successes that other active learning methods have shown. Furthermore, we provide guidance to help educators deliver chalk talks and discuss future studies that would advance understanding of this powerful teaching tool.",

This transition posed a challenge to postgraduate students and faculty moderators, especially for participant-centric group discussion, wherein face-to-face interaction contributes significantly to active learner engagement. To bridge the gap between live group discussion (GD) and virtual GD in the conventional format (VGD), we implemented an innovative yet feasible multistep approach of conducting structured virtual group discussion (sVGD). It involved priming of students during the preparatory phase and incorporation of the Tuckman model of group dynamics, which consists of sequential substages of forming, storming, norming, and performing into the virtual format. Unsupervised synchronous and asynchronous, as well as supervised synchronous interactions within and in between the minigroups in a structured way, led to active engagement of students with one another and the moderator, despite the constraints imposed by the virtual format. After establishing the feasibility of the approach during the first GD (sVGD-1), sVGD-2 was conducted, further refining the approach, and feedback was obtained from the postgraduate students. Pre-GD feedback revealed that the live session was preferred over virtual for the conduct of GD, whereas both live GD and sVGD were perceived to be more effective than VGD in the post-GD feedback. Such pedagogical innovations may also help to address the challenges posed in traditional teaching across the undergraduate and postgraduate courses in medical education and beyond during such unforeseeable circumstances.",

Student use of the online laboratory classes varied, with those spending more time performing better on examinations.

    "abstract": "In multiple studies \"structure/function\" has been identified as an important core concept in biology and physiology. Teachers expect their students to be able to use this concept in making sense of physiology. However, it is unclear exactly what physiologists are referring to when they use the term \"structure/function.\" Here I first offer examples of four different ways in which I have used the term in the classroom. Then, I propose a conceptual framework that is an explicit statement of the \"structure/function\" core concept that can be used by teachers and their students as they attempt to master physiology. Determining whether this conceptual framework is completely accurate and whether it will prove useful in the classroom will require feedback from physiology teachers who attempt to use it in their classroom with their students.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has changed the way most people live and work, including the way in which students undertake study. To protect students during the pandemic, most schools in China adopted a study-at-home model. Under these circumstances, the pathophysiology teaching team at Tongji University considered how to reform teaching methods to minimize the impact of the pandemic on students’ curriculum studies. This article describes our teaching reforms in detail, notably a combination of online education resources, online discussion courses, and a WeChat study group. We compared the effects of the reformed and traditional teaching approaches, including student performance and student evaluation of the reformed teaching methods. Analysis showed that although students were generally worried about the impact of the pandemic on their curriculum studies, their overall performance was not affected by the reformed teaching methods. Of interest, compared with traditional teaching, the proportion of students with higher final test scores (≥90 points) actually increased. The revised teaching methods promoted the learning of some students externally and internally and enhanced their enthusiasm for medical study and their academic performance. These approaches could be applied as a reference for future course arrangements after the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Consequent to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, pedagogic changes were introduced in postgraduate courses in Physiology, where face-to-face teaching was replaced with synchronous virtual mode for leader-centered (seminar, symposium) and participant-centered (journal club, group discussion) academic activities. We hypothesized that the effectiveness of virtual and face-to-face modes as perceived by postgraduate students in terms of facilitating their overall learning may differ across the spectrum of leader-centered and participant-centered activities. To assess the same, we designed and administered a comprehensive, structured, and validated feedback questionnaire. Postgraduate students ( n = 29) rated virtual sessions significantly more convenient, but less attentive and comprehensible, and reported better audiovisual experience during face-to-face sessions. Students rated flexibility to attend, self-paced learning, ability to revise, lookup for information in real time, and accessibility to distant expertise as important features of virtual sessions and instant feedback, eye-to-eye contact, and ability to interact in the group for face-to-face sessions. Virtual and face-to-face sessions were perceived as equally effective in facilitating their overall learning for the conduct of leader-centered seminars and symposia. However, face-to-face sessions were considered more effective for the conduct of participant-centered group discussions and journal clubs. During the pandemic, students perceive the synchronous virtual mode as an equally effective alternative for the conduct of leader-centered academic activities, but face-to-face teaching is still preferred for the conduct of participant-centered academic activities.",

    "abstract": "Lectures constitute a basic component of physiology instruction in scientific and healthcare curricula. Technological progress has allowed a switch from face to face to video lectures, yet there is no evidence of video efficacy in physiology. Because videos increase the cognitive load during a learning task, identifying tools that decrease students' cognitive load during video lectures is critical. Segmenting videos with pauses and inducing joint attention with eye movement modeling examples (EMME) could reduce the cognitive load and improve second-year medical students' learning in physiology video lectures. Second-year medical students were randomized into four groups [EMME + pauses (EMME + P), EMME without pause`s (EMME-NoP), pauses only (NoEMME + P), and no EMME and no pause (NoEMME-NoP)], took pretest quizzes, watched a renal physiology video lecture, and answered a cognitive load questionnaire and posttest quizzes on the Moodle learning management system. Student prior knowledge was assessed by a pretest, and learning gains were assessed by the difference between posttest and pretest scores. One hundred ninety-five students completed the experiment. Pauses improved learning gains (P < 0.01) but not EMME (P = 0.11). Student prior knowledge has several interactions with other variables: low-prior knowledge students obtained better learning gains (P < 0.001) and high-prior knowledge students had lower learning gains with EMME (P < 0.05). Our study shows the potential role of tools designed to reduce students' cognitive load during a renal physiology video lecture and the critical need for empirical validation of pedagogical solutions that are adapted to the specificities of physiology lectures.",

    "abstract": "The online flipped classroom (OFC) has emerged as a new teaching method in universities worldwide, which combines asynchronous and synchronous online learning. OFC differs from the traditional flipped classroom as it does not involve face-to-face interaction between teachers and students. Instead, the class meeting is conducted online, and it is focused on active and collaborative learning (e.g., discussion rather than lecturing). To evaluate the effectiveness of the Physiology OFC, we compared it with online live teaching (OLT) offered in the same school and semester. We analyzed the exam scores of the Physiology course as well as the scores for other courses offered in the same semester and after the Physiology course. We categorized the top 27% of the exam takers as high-achieving students and the bottom 27% as low-achieving students. Our analysis found no statistically significant difference between OFC and OLT in terms of overall exam scores for all students. However, high-achieving students in OFC scored higher on the total exam score and short answer questions, but the score of case study questions (CSQs) of low-achieving students was lower. Furthermore, students in OFC scored higher in Medical Immunology and courses dominated by logical thinking such as Pharmacology and Diagnostics than students in OLT. In conclusion, our findings suggest that OFC can achieve the same teaching effectiveness as OLT, with a more positive impact on high-achieving students. The positive impact extends beyond the Physiology course to other courses where logical thinking is critical. However, the lower performance of low-achieving students in CSQs highlights the need for further research to determine the reasons for their lower performance and potential strategies to improve their learning outcomes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY An online flipped classroom approach achieved the same teaching effect as online live teaching but had a more positive impact on high-achieving students. The positive impact was not only in Physiology but also in subsequent courses where logical thinking prevailed. However, for low-achieving students, the effect of online live teaching was better.",

    "abstract": "Physiology is a critical subject that bridges basic and clinical medicine. The reform of physiology education is crucial to improving the quality of teaching and supporting student learning; however, there is a lack of comprehensive data documenting the current state of physiology education in medical programs in China. This study conducted an online survey among experienced teachers from the top 100 medical schools in the Chinese mainland in 2022. A total of 89 valid questionnaires were included in this study. In 57.3% of the surveyed medical schools, 70% of the physiology teachers have a Ph.D. degree, while the number of faculty members with a medical background has tended to decrease in 53.9% of the surveyed medical schools. Of the 89 medical schools, 62 have implemented physiology course integration, with 69.4% of the respondents believing that curriculum integration could enhance students' knowledge acquisition and application. The lecture hours per term are 50-70 and 71-90 in 49.4% and 42.7% of the 89 medical schools, respectively. The ratio of course duration of lecture to laboratory was 2:1 in 47.2% of the surveyed medical schools, while the ratio was between 1:1 and 2:1 in 47.2% of the surveyed medical schools, and only 5.6% of medical schools opted for a 1:1 course arrangement. For teaching methods, about 60% of medical schools used problem-based learning, case-based learning, and task-based learning (PBL/CBL/TBL) for clinical medicine students only, and 25.4% of medical schools applied PBL/CBL/TBL to all students. This study is conducive to promoting dialogue and communication among physiology teachers, administrators, and researchers.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study conducted a nationwide survey of the top 100 medical schools in the Chinese mainland in 2022 to provide first-hand data on the current situation and changes in physiology education and teaching in the Chinese mainland with focuses on the faculty composition, curriculum integration, teaching methods, and assessment modes, which is a microcosm of the reform and development of the medical education in the Chinese mainland, hoping to improve the quality of preclinical medical education.",

Our objectives were to reduce the number of formal lecture hours and enhance student enthusiasm by using more multimedia materials and creating opportunities for interactive learning. On-line course materials, consisting of administrative documents, lecture notes, animations, digital movies, practice tests, and grade reports, were placed on a departmental computer with an Internet connection. Students used Web browsers to access on-line materials from a variety of computing platforms on campus, at home, and at remote sites. To assess use of the materials and their effectiveness, we analyzed 1) log files from the server, and 2) the results of a written course evaluation completed by all students. Lecture notes and practice tests were the most-used documents. The students' evaluations indicated that computer use in class made the lecture material more interesting, while the on-line documents helped reinforce lecture materials and the textbook. We conclude that the effectiveness of on-line materials depends on several different factors, including 1) the number of instructors that provide materials; 2) the quantity of other materials handed out; 3) the degree to which computer use is demonstrated in class and integrated into lectures; and 4) the ease with which students can access the materials. Finally, we propose that additional implementation of Internet-based resources beyond what we have described would further enhance a physiology course for first-year medical students.",

An integrated view of metabolism is essential for understanding how the whole organism functions, including activities of students' daily life, such as eating, dieting, and physical exercise. In fact, the media constantly exert pressure on young people, stimulating students to undergo countless diet and exercise programs. Additionally, diabetes mellitus and obesity, which are diseases with close ties to metabolism, have been increasing among adolescents.In Brazil, the education system is organized in 12 grades. Until the 9th grade (∼14–15 years old), physics, chemistry, and biology are taught as one discipline, called \"sciences.\" From 10th to 12th grade (∼17–18 years old), physics, chemistry, and biology are taught as separated disciplines. \"Metabolism\" is traditionally taught in the 10th grade. Although the role and the general structure of macromolecules are taught in the 10th grade, 8th grade deals for the first time with these subjects.To assess students' knowledge of the integration of human metabolism, we have presented questionnaires to be answered by students at the beginning of their first year at one of the largest and most prestigious Brazilian universities, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The first questionnaire (Q1) contained two objective questions: 1) What happens to the overall ATP production in an individual fed a low carbohydrate diet? 2) What happens to the overall ATP production in an individual undergoing prolonged (many days of) fasting?The students had the choices of answering \"I do not know\" or that ATP production \"remains the same,\" \"increases,\" or \"decreases.\" In addition, after their answers for each question were selected, three lines were available for the students to briefly explain their answers. Students who did select an option but did not explain their answers were excluded from the sample.Figure 1A summarizes the pattern of answers obtained from Q1. From the 304 students who answered the questionnaire, 175 came from biomedical-, 55 from technology-, and 74 from humanities-related courses. Although there was some diversity among the answers given by the students in each group, the pattern was found to be very similar (not shown). The proportion of students who presented correct answers to the questions was remarkably small, and a great proportion of them chose to answer \"I do not know\" or did not explain their answers. These proportions indicate that a significant number of students do not know how that metabolism is regulated in relatively common situations of their daily lives (diets, for instance). However, even more important is the fact that ∼50% of the students presented very similar answers (which we considered the \"misconception\"), according to which ATP production falls dramatically during either a \"low-carbohydrate diet\" or \"fasting.\" The explanations given by all students to the answers scored as the \"misconception\" were related to the fact that carbohydrates are the only source of glucose and that glucose is the only fuel available for ATP production by the cells. A small proportion of the students presented other \"wrong\" explanations for their answers.As a control, Q1 was presented to 154 students who had just finished the biochemistry course in the Faculty of Medicine. Sixty percent of them presented correct answers to the questions, and the proportion of misconception was only ∼15% (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the high proportions of the misconception found among undergraduate students was not a consequence of Q2 structure.The fact that Q1 dealt with deprivation situations (low-carbohydrate diet and fasting) could induce the students to answer that ATP production decreases. If this were true, any question dealing with deprivation situations would result in an answer pattern similar to that obtained for Q1. To this hypothesis, undergraduate students were asked to answer the following question:What happens to the overall ATP production in an individual fed a diet containing low levels of calcium?This question is similar to the first question of Q1, except for the substitution of the word \"carbohydrate\" for the word \"calcium\" (an ion not directly related to ATP production). The answer pattern was quite different from that obtained for Q1, since the answers were randomly distributed among the four options (χ2 = 3.49, 3 degrees of freedom, P = 0.32). Thus a question containing a deprivation situation per se does not induce students to answer that ATP production decreases.In an attempt to investigate whether recalling daily situations related to energy-yielding metabolism could change the students' answer pattern, we presented a slightly modified version of Q1, which will be referred to as Q2, to a second sample of undergraduate students. Q2 contained, before the original questions, the following question, to which the students were asked to write down an answer:A low-carbohydrate diet associated with extensive exercise usually leads to weight loss. Which molecule is decreasing in amount in the body to account for the weight loss?Most of the students (71.8%) identified lipids, and few of them (12.7%) identified carbohydrates, as the molecules being consumed and responsible for weight loss. The remaining students presented other answers or chose to answer \"I do not know\" (Fig. 2A). No student identified more than one molecule as being responsible for weight loss. Q2 also contained the question:What is/are that/those molecule(s) being used for?Almost all the students (94%) answered that the molecule consumed during weight loss was used for energy production. However, when the same students answered Q1, only a small number of them answered that other molecules besides glucose could be used as fuels during a low-carbohydrate diet (17.6%) or fasting (13.6%). Such proportions were nearly identical to those found among students who answered only Q1 (compare Fig. 2, inset, with Fig. 1A). In fact, the proportion of students who acknowledged the use of other fuel molecules besides glucose was much smaller than those who identified lipids as responsible for weight loss (71.8%). The majority of the students still presented answers scored as misconception (57.1 and 68.2% to diet or fasting, respectively). This set of results indicates the presence of two distinct conceptions in the same student: one, more correct (\"lipids and proteins, besides glucose, can be used in energy production by the cells\"), which is applied by the students in a more informal situation, and the other, the misconception (\"only glucose can be used in energy production by the cells\"), which is used when a problem that requires more formal learning is presented.To confirm the existence of two contradictory conceptions concerning energy-yielding metabolism in the same student, we submitted another questionnaire (Q3) to another group of undergraduate students. First, the students answered Q1, and, as expected, the result was similar to that obtained before (Fig. 2B, inset). Then they were asked:What molecules are used in the cells for ATP production?A greater proportion of the students (66%) was able to associate ATP production with other fuels besides glucose (Fig. 2B); approximately 32% of the students identified glucose as the only molecule involved in ATP production. This result confirms the coexistence of two contradictory conceptions in the students minds.Students' answers about the regulation of metabolism in low-carbohydrate diets and fasting seem to indicate that they identify glucose as the sole fuel molecule available for ATP production in human cells. A more explicit attempt to stimulate students to connect energy-yielding metabolism and daily experience proved that, even after identifying the loss of lipids or proteins during diet and exercise, the students presented an identical profile of misconceptions. Thus the main finding reported here is that students fail to establish a correlation between ordinary daily experience and the formal study of metabolism.We suggest that efforts should be made by textbook authors, teachers, and researchers to discuss metabolism in a more integrated way, emphasizing both catabolic and anabolic pathways involved in metabolism and discussing the multiple connections of central metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Moreover, correlation of energy-yielding metabolism pathways with daily experience (e.g., diets and growth) should be also emphasized. It is our belief that this new approach is more likely to lead to a better understanding of the complexity of the metabolic pathways and their interconnections and also to a better comprehension of daily experiences, where an understanding of human metabolism is required for adequate decisions related to health and life style.FIG. 1Students' misconception about ATP production by cells during a low-carbohydrate diet (filled bars) or fasting (grey bars).

Our experience with this exercise demonstrates that the bradycardia associated with the diving response is a robust effect that can easily be measured by students without any sophisticated measurement technology. We discuss measures that maximize the success of the exercise by reducing individual variation, designing experiments that are minimally affected by change in the response over time, collecting data in appropriate time increments, and applying the most powerful statistical analysis. Emphasis is placed on pedagogical opportunities for using this exercise to teach general principles of physiology, experimental design, and data analysis. Data collected by students, background information for instructors, a discussion of the relevance of the diving reflex to humans, suggestions for additional experiments, and thought questions with sample answers are included.",

    "abstract": "Employment opportunities in the future will require higher skills and an understanding of mathematics and science. As a result of the growing number of careers that require solid science and mathematics training, the methods of science education are undergoing major reform. To adequately equip students for technologically advanced positions, new teaching methods must be developed that prepare tomorrow's workforce for the challenges of the 21st century. One such method is the use of models. By actively building and manipulating concrete models that represent scientific concepts, students are involved in the most basic level of Piaget's learning scheme: the sensorimotor stage. Models are useful in reaching all students at the foundational levels of learning, and further learning experiences are rapidly moved through higher learning levels. This success ensures greater comprehension and understanding compared with the traditional methods of rote memorization. We developed an exercise for the construction of an inexpensive, easy-to-build model demonstrating neural pathways and reflex arcs. Our exercise also includes many supplemental teaching tools. The exercise is designed to fulfill the need of sound physiological teaching materials for high school students.",

In the latter experiment, sweat recruitment patterns were recorded initially on the lower extremities, followed by successive appearances on thigh and abdomen and with final occurrence on the upper extremities and face. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such recruitment patterns during exercise. Results of actual student participation, with organized group discussions, convince us that laboratory teaching remains the premiere mechanism for teaching and learning organ-system physiology.",

Various approaches can facilitate interdisciplinary interactions, but we submit that there is a critical need for a new educational paradigm for the way that we train biomedical engineers, life scientists, and mathematicians. We cannot continue to train graduate students in isolation within single disciplines, nor can we ask any one individual to learn all the essentials of biology, engineering, and mathematics. We must transform how students are trained and incorporate how real-world research and development are done-in diverse, interdisciplinary teams. Our fundamental vision is to create an innovative paradigm for graduate research and training that yields a new generation of biomedical engineers, life scientists, and mathematicians that is more diverse and that embraces and actively pursues a truly interdisciplinary, team-based approach to research based on a known benefit and mutual respect. In this paper, we describe our attempt to accomplish this via focused training in biomechanics, biomedical optics, mathematics, mechanobiology, and physiology. The overall approach is applicable, however, to most areas of biomedical research.",

Technology certainly offers a variety of ways to provide active learning experiences. In some instances, technological approaches can be used to address the same educational objectives as traditional laboratories, while in others these objectives may be partially met by use of technology.

In this paper, we present a conceptual model that explores the role of mass media as community gatekeepers of new scientific findings. This model frames the benefits for undergraduate science students to learn about media genres so that they can learn to communicate science more effectively to nonprofessional audiences. Informed by this Media Role model, we then detail a novel writing task for undergraduate physiology students, the Opinion Editorial (Op-Ed), and an accompanying Peer Review. The Op-Ed genre was directly taught to the students by a professional journalist. As an assessment task, students presented a recent, highly technical paper as an Op-Ed. This was assessed by both faculty members and peers using a detailed assessment rubric. Most students were able to replicate the features of Op-Eds and attained high grades on their writing tasks. Survey data from final-year physiology students (n = 230) were collected before and after the implementation of the Op-Ed/Peer Review. These indicated that most students were aware of the importance of scientists to effectively communicate their knowledge to nonprofessional audiences, that the Op-Ed writing task was challenging, and that they believed that their ability to write to nonprofessional audiences was improved after explicit teaching and feedback.",

Scientists, defined as research faculty members, clinicians, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and medical students, and professional staff, participate through conventional volunteer recruitment and program announcements as well as outreach partnership efforts with other Vanderbilt centers. These experts present 30- to 45-min long, grade-appropriate content sessions from the CSO IVC studio or their own laboratory. Teachers register for sessions via an on-line application process. After the session, teachers, students, and experts are requested to complete an anonymous on-line evaluation that addresses both technical- and content-associated issues. Results from 2003 to the present indicated a favorable assessment for a promising program. Results showed that 69% of students ( n = 335) and 88% of teachers ( n = 111) felt that IVC improved access to scientists, whereas 97% of students ( n = 382) and teachers ( n = 126) and 100% of scientists ( n = 23) indicated that they would participate in future videoconferences. Students and teachers considered that the Virtual Scientist program was effective [76% ( n = 381) and 89% ( n = 127), respectively]. In addition, experts supported IVC as effective in teaching [87% ( n = 23)].

The subject is very quantitative and contains a number of concepts that some students have trouble with, including physical principles such as pressure, flow, volume, resistance, elasticity, and compliance. Apparently, present-day students find the subject more difficult than students of 20 years ago. A possible reason for this is that the teaching of elementary physics in high school and college is now given less emphasis, whereas other topics, such as molecular biology, receive a great deal of attention. Another factor may be that many of us grew up building radios and other such devices, whereas modern students tend to plug in an electronic unit with little idea of its function. Some examples of misconceptions of present-day students who have taken our course are given. To help the weaker students, we now include a primer at the beginning of our handout for the course that covers simple physical principles. Examples of some of the most difficult concepts for students are given.",

This article describes the second phase of this study of the subsequent year's cohort. A case study approach was used to investigate how groups of students used the criteria to complete their complex concept maps. Students' opinions about the assessment task and newly constructed rubric were sampled. Opinions across groups were correlated to academic achievements in the course. Two groups of four students volunteered to be videorecorded during a 4-h workshop, during which they completed their maps. The mapping task was not generally favored by students. However, those students who did favor the task achieved higher academic grades. Most students favored the newly constructed assessment rubric, commenting that it was easy to understand, fair, and appropriate, but reported that extra guidance from tutors and other resources were required. Coded videorecordings of the two observation groups revealed complex interactions around the three criteria of content, logic and understanding, and presentation. Two broad patterns of working were identified. One group distributed their efforts more evenly across the criteria, whereas the other group completed their maps by addressing the criteria in stages. These findings clearly indicate the academic challenges and social complexity in how students work in groups to complete complex concept maps in physiology.",

The environment is safe, supportive, and provides opportunities to help students deal with nonacademic as well as academic factors that impact their learning. Creation of such an environment requires the establishment of a supportive learning community. For a variety of reasons, establishing such a learning community of first-year medical students can be challenging. This communication presents one approach to meeting this challenge in a medical school Human Physiology course. Steps were taken at the beginning of the course to create the community, and activities designed to reinforce these efforts were incorporated into the course as it progressed. Two pilot studies were conducted to test the hypothesis that providing students with a participatory music experience may help to promote a holistic learning environment by helping them restore a sense of balance to their emotional well-being as well as reinforce a sense of community in the classroom. Student response to these activities indicated that these efforts provided emotional support during stressful periods during the quarter, helped promote a feeling of safety within the environment, and reenergized the class during long class sessions. This project illustrates that each instructor, within the confines of his/her own classroom, can make a significant contribution to achieving a holistic learning envrionment for his/her students.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder of upper airway obstruction during sleep. The effects of intermittent upper airway obstruction include alveolar hypoventilation, altered arterial blood gases and acid-base status, and stimulation of the arterial chemoreceptors, which leads to frequent arousals. These arousals disturb sleep architecture and cause hypersomnolence. Chronic intermittent alveolar and systemic arterial hypoxia-hypercapnia can cause pulmonary and systemic hypertension, with effects on the right and left ventricles, and even the renal system. The pathophysiology of OSA can therefore be used to review and integrate many topics in pulmonary and cardiovascular physiology in the context of problem-based learning, a guided discussion, or a formal lecture. The discussion begins with a case scenario, followed by a definition of the disorder, the common symptoms and signs of OSA, and a description of an apneic event. These are related to the physiology of the upper airway in OSA, normal alterations in the respiratory system during sleep, the effects of apnea on gas exchange and arterial blood gases, and the cardiovascular consequences of alterations in alveolar and systemic arterial Po 2 and Pco 2 . The treatment of OSA, particularly how the use of continuous positive airway pressure relates to the pathophysiology of the disorder, is discussed briefly.",

Depending on the outcome of the SGCs, we planned to develop it further. We designed this study to compare student perceptions on newly introduced SGCs with traditional tutorials (TTs). Student perceptions were assessed using a mixed qualitative and quantitative method. Students recognized and appreciated some favorable features of the SGC, such as the opportunity for discussion, quality of the knowledge, active participation, improvement of presentation ability, and increased breadth of knowledge. However, the majority of students preferred the TT over the SGC despite the highlighted benefits of the SGC. Students appreciated the focused learning for examinations, written preparation, and more tutor involvement in the TT. Students requested a hybrid of the TT and SGC by incorporating mandatory written answers to the SGC with greater contributions from faculty members. Assessment methods that were not aligned with the SGC and ingrained passive didactic teaching-learning methods by students and faculty members had a negative effect on the implementation of SGCs. Cultural and economical factors also contributed adversely. In the second step of this Plan-Do-Check-Act process, we are planning to introduce new formative assessment to assess higher-order cognitive skills and a compulsory tutor training program. Some favorable components from the TT will be incorporated to the SGC.",

This skill is crucial for success within ill-structured domains such as biology, physiology, and medicine, where many concepts are simultaneously required for understanding a complex problem, yet the problem consists of patterns or combinations of concepts that are not consistently used or needed across all examples. To succeed within ill-structured domains, a student must possess a certain level of cognitive flexibility: rigid thought processes and prepackaged informational retrieval schemes relying on rote memorization will not suffice. In this study, we assessed the cognitive flexibility of undergraduate physiology students using a validated instrument entitled Student's Approaches to Learning (SAL). The SAL evaluates how deeply and in what way information is processed, as well as the investment of time and mental energy that a student is willing to expend by measuring constructs such as elaboration and memorization. Our results indicate that students who rely primarily on memorization when learning new information have a smaller knowledge base about physiological concepts, as measured by a prior knowledge assessment and unit exams. However, students who rely primarily on elaboration when learning new information have a more well-developed knowledge base about physiological concepts, which is displayed by higher scores on a prior knowledge assessment and increased performance on unit exams. Thus students with increased elaboration skills possibly possess a higher level of cognitive flexibility and are more likely to succeed within ill-structured domains.",

In 1804, after completing senior high school, Purkinje joined the Piarist monk order, but, after a 3-yr novitiate, he gave up the religious calling \"to deal more freely with science.\" In 1818, he earned a Medical Doctor degree from Prague University by defending a dissertation on intraocular phenomena observed in oneself. In 1823, Purkinje became a Physiology and Pathology professor at the Prussian Medical University in Breslau, where he innovated the traditional teaching methods of physiology. Purkinje's contributions to physiology were manifold: accurate descriptions of various visual phenomena (e.g., Purkinje-Sanson images, Purkinje phenomenon), discovery of the terminal network of the cardiac conduction system (Purkinje fibers), identification of cerebellar neuronal bodies (Purkinje cells), formulation of the vertigo law (Purkinje's law), discovery of criteria to classify human fingerprints, etc. In 1850, Purkinje accepted and held until his death the Physiology chair at Prague Medical Faculty. During this period, he succeeded in introducing the Czech idiom (in addition to long-established German and Latin) as a Medical Faculty teaching language. Additionally, as a zealous Czech patriot, he actively contributed to the naissance and consolidation of a national Czech identity conscience.

    "abstract": "Medical education reform is underway, but the optimal course for change has yet to be seen. While planning for the redesign of a renal physiology course at the Duke School of Medicine, the authors used a Q-sort survey to assess students' attitudes and learning preferences to inform curricular change. The authors invited first-year medical students at the Duke School of Medicine to take a Q-sort survey on the first day of renal physiology. Students prioritized statements related to their understanding of renal physiology, learning preferences, preferred course characteristics, perceived clinical relevance of renal physiology, and interest in nephrology as a career. By-person factor analysis was performed using the centroid method. Three dominant factors were strongly defined by learning preferences: “readers” prefer using notes, a textbook, and avoid lectures; “social-auditory learners” prefer attending lectures, interactivity, and working with peers; and “visual learners” prefer studying images, diagrams, and viewing materials online. A smaller, fourth factor represented a small group of students with a strong predisposition against renal physiology and nephrology. In conclusion, the Q-sort survey identified and then described in detail the dominant viewpoints of our students. Learning style preferences better classified first-year students rather than any of the other domains. A more individualized curriculum would simultaneously cater to the different types of learners in the classroom.",

To illustrate this principle, we constructed a device that recreates the conditions of an ECG reading using a battery to simulate the electrical vector of the heart and three voltmeters for the main electrocardiographic leads. Requiring minimal construction with low cost, this device provides hands-on practice that enables students to rediscover the principles of the Einthoven triangle, namely, that the direction of the cardiac dipole can be predicted from the deflections in any two leads and that lead I + lead III = lead II independent of the position of heart's electrical vector. We built a total of 6 devices for classes of 30 students and tested them in the first-year Human Physiology course at the University of California-Davis School of Medicine. Combined with traditional demonstrations with ECG machines, this equipment demonstrated its ability to help medical students obtain a solid foundation of the basic principles of electrocardiography.",

    "abstract": "An important part of training the next generation of physicians is ensuring that they are exposed to the integral role that research plays in improving medical treatment. However, medical students often do not have sufficient time to be trained to carry out any projects in biomedical and clinical research. Many medical students also fail to understand and grasp translational research as an important concept today. In addition, since medical training is often an international affair whereby a medical student/resident/fellow will likely train in many different countries during his/her early training years, it is important to provide a learning environment whereby a young medical student experiences the unique challenges and value of an international educational experience. This article describes a program that bridges the gap between the basic and clinical research concepts in a unique international educational experience. After completing two semester curricula at Alfaisal University in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, six medical students undertook a summer program at St. Boniface Hospital Research Centre, in Winnipeg, MB, Canada. The program lasted for 2 mo and addressed advanced training in basic science research topics in medicine such as cell isolation, functional assessment, and molecular techniques of analysis and manipulation as well as sessions on the conduct of clinical research trials, ethics, and intellectual property management. Programs such as these are essential to provide a base from which medical students can decide if research is an attractive career choice for them during their clinical practice in subsequent years. An innovative international summer research course for medical students is necessary to cater to the needs of the medical students in the 21st century.",

Many physiological mechanisms explain how structures and their properties interact at one level of organization to produce emergent functions at a higher level of organization. Current physiology principles, such as structure-function relations, selectively neglect mechanisms by not mentioning this term explicitly. We explored how students characterized mechanisms and functions to shed light on how students make sense of these terms. Students characterized mechanisms as 1) processes that occur at levels of organization lower than that of functions; and 2) as detailed events with many steps involved. We also found that students produced more variability in how they characterized functions compared with mechanisms: students characterized functions in relation to multiple levels of organization and multiple definitions. We interpret these results as evidence that students see mechanisms as holding a more narrow definition than used in the biological sciences, and that students struggle to coordinate and distinguish mechanisms from functions due to cognitive processes germane to learning in many domains. We offer the instructional suggestion that we scaffold student learning by affording students opportunities to relate and also distinguish between these terms so central to understanding physiology.",

Students had difficulty distinguishing osmolarity from tonicity and determining tonicity based on the solution's composition. The most useful activities were questions requiring simultaneous consideration of both osmolarity and tonicity. Problems that require calculating osmotic concentration and the volumes of body fluid compartments after administration or loss of various solutions emphasize the significance of osmolarity and tonicity in the context of systemic homeostasis and clinical medicine. We hope that our approach to teaching osmolarity and tonicity will prove useful to physiology lecturers who are looking for new ways of introducing this complicated topic to their health professions students.",

Sixty-three second-year medical students were randomly assigned to one of three groups (living tissue laboratory, virtual laboratory, and blended group). The students conducted the practical activity, and then they were given a postlaboratory quiz and an attitude survey. The blended group euthanized fewer animals and spent less time to finish the animal experiment than the living tissue group did. In the postlaboratory quiz, students who performed the virtual laboratory alone got significantly lower scores than students in the other two groups, and the blended group did not get better scores than the living tissue group. The attitude surveys showed that the virtual laboratory group had a lower perceived value of the science research and activity in which they participated than the other two groups did. Here, 77.8% of all students chose the blended style as the ideal teaching method for experiments. Our findings led us to believe that isolated use of the virtual laboratory in China is not the best practice: the virtual laboratory serves as an effective preparation tool, and the blended laboratories may become the best laboratory teaching practice, provided that the software design for the virtual laboratory is further improved.",

Determining the impact of active learning on student engagement and higher order skill (HOS) proficiency was the primary aim of this study. Following Institutional Review Board approval, two cohort groups of first-year medical students were enrolled. The first cohort ( n = 54) included students before curriculum reform in the legacy curriculum (LC). The second cohort ( n = 73) included students completing studies in the renewed curriculum (RC). Near the end of the first year of medical school, both cohorts completed a validated survey of student engagement, and a proctored problem-based assessment of HOS proficiency [Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+)]. Results indicated RC students perceived greater levels of engagement than LC (39.5+5.8 vs. 33.3+5.6), and greater reliance on HOS, including analysis, synthesis, and application. However, there were no significant differences between cohorts in proficiency of HOS when assessed by the CLA+ (LC = 1,878 ± 161 vs. RC = 1,900 ± 157). Additionally, poor correlation between engagement and HOS for both LC and RC indicated more engaged students do not necessarily possess greater HOS proficiency. Ceiling effect may explain results as medical students enter medical school as highly skilled learners with potentially little room for improvement. It will be informative to continue to track engagement and HOS of both cohort groups as they continue their medical studies.",

    "abstract": "Recently, medical students' scientific thinking skills have been identified as an important issue in medical education. Scientific thinking cannot be imparted in conventional lectures, but rather requires actively involving students. We modified a practical course in physiology. A study was designed to test whether the new course fosters scientific thinking without impairing the transfer of physiological knowledge. The study group consisted of 226 first-year medical students at the Medical Faculty Mannheim of Heidelberg University. Written consent to participate in the study was obtained from all participants. The group was then randomly divided into two groups (traditional vs. modified course). The subject of both courses was a laboratory experiment in skeletal muscle physiology. In the traditional course, the students addressed topics already presented in lectures. In the modified course, students dealt with the same topics as in the traditional course, but the experiment was expanded to include one issue not taught before. When working on this issue, the students were instructed in scientific thinking. All participants filled out a questionnaire with 15 multiple-choice questions addressing the physiological subject matter and four open-ended questions addressing the criteria of scientific methodology. Physiological knowledge in both groups did not differ [F(1) = 2.08, P = 0.15]. Scores in scientific thinking in the modified course were higher (mean = 4.20, SD = 1.89) than in the traditional course (mean = 2.04, SD = 1.91) with F(1) = 70.69, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.24 (large effect). Our study demonstrates that small adjustments to courses in medical education can promote scientific thinking without impairing knowledge transfer.",

    "abstract": "Learning the basic competencies of critical thinking are very important in the education of any young scientist, and teachers must be prepared to help students develop a valuable set of analytic tools. In my experience, this is best achieved by encouraging students to study areas with little scientific consensus, such as the control mechanisms of the exercise ventilatory response, as it can allow greater objectivity when evaluating evidence, while also giving students the freedom to think independently and problem solve. In this article, I discuss teaching strategies by which physiology, biomedical science, and sport science students can simultaneously develop their understanding of respiratory control mechanisms and learn to critically analyze evidence thoroughly. This can be best achieved by utilizing both teacher-led and student-led learning environments, the latter of which encourages the development of learner autonomy and independent problem solving. In this article, I also aim to demonstrate a systematic approach of critical assessment that students can be taught, adapt, and apply independently. Among other things, this strategy involves: 1) defining the precise phenomenon in question; 2) understanding what investigations must demonstrate to explain the phenomenon and its underlying mechanisms; 3) evaluating the explanations/mechanisms of the phenomenon and the evidence for them; and 4) forming strategies to produce strong evidence, if none exists.",

Following Institutional Review Board approval, 56 first-year medical students, registered at the same medical school but attending class at three different campus centers, were enrolled in the study. All participants were completing a medical physiology course that utilized the same learning objectives but relied on different faculty incorporating diverse methodologies (percentage of class devoted to active learning strategies), course format (6-wk block vs. 17-wk semester), and student attendance. Students completed a validated survey of student engagement (SSE), a proctored online problem-based assessment of higher order skill proficiency [Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+); http://cae.org ], and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Physiology subject exam. In this limited sample, results indicate no significant differences between campus sites for any of the variables assessed. Levels of engagement were lower than expected compared with published values for graduate students. Higher order skill proficiency assessed by CLA+ was significantly higher than values reported for college seniors nationally. Surprisingly, SSE offered no prediction of performance on CLA+ or NBME, as there were no significant correlations between variables. These data indicate that, although first-year medical students may not perceive themselves as highly engaged, they are adept in using higher order skills and excel in meeting course learning objectives, regardless of learning environment.",

The American Physiological Society supports outreach initiatives through programs such as the Physiology Understanding (PhUn) Week. Building on these activities, it was desired to create and assess an immersive and engaging Outreach Program in a disadvantaged K-12 student population. Three distinct modules were created on cardiovascular physiology, respiratory physiology, and oral health. All resources for these modules underwent peer review and publication, allowing other professors to easily execute their own outreach programming. The outreach modules were presented to 288 students in 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th grade classes. Implementation of the modules resulted in significant increases in student content knowledge, ranging from 32 to 57% improvement ( P < 0.001, dependent t-test), with an average increase of 46%. K-12 science teachers reported that the program was at an appropriate educational level, increased students' enthusiasm for science, and increased students' exposure to science careers. Additionally, the presenters of the Outreach Program were perceived to be enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and proficient at interacting with the students. On open-response survey items, the science teachers indicated a high level of satisfaction with the program and an enthusiasm for continued collaborations. These results indicate the importance of organized and interactive science activities for the success of a new Outreach Program.",

However, little is known about the role of laboratory practical classes in the conceptual learning of physiology. Therefore, the main aims of this study were to identify some of the threshold concepts in physiology and to explore the role of our laboratory practical program in helping students to tackle these concepts. An online questionnaire gathered opinions from students on the value of the laboratory classes in helping them to learn. Interviews with students and with lecturers were performed to ascertain which concepts students find particularly difficult, why they find these concepts difficult, and what their opinions are on the role of the laboratory practical classes in helping students to grasp difficult concepts. A number of threshold concepts in physiology were identified, and some possible reasons underlying the difficulties were explored. Overall, the majority of respondents found that the laboratory practical program helped them to learn physiology. While the laboratory classes were found to promote conceptual learning in a number of ways, a prominent finding was that the laboratory classes help students to grasp the theory because they allow students to visually see the physiological events, they bring the theory to life, and they allow students to experience some applications of the theory. The study also highlighted areas for further development in relation to the promotion of conceptual learning within the teaching laboratory.",

    "abstract": "The population diversity of New Zealand is due to the unique fusion of indigenous peoples of Polynesian origin (Māori), western European colonization (Pākehā), and more recent (20th century) immigration from the Pacific region (Pasifika). However, disparities in tertiary education indicate that Māori and Pasifika students are more likely to drop out during their first year of study and are less likely to complete their qualification than their Pākehā peers. Higher levels of course engagement may increase first-year grades, elevate academic performance, and encourage persistence between the first and second years of study. Therefore, a Student Course Engagement Questionnaire was used to quantify engagement in a compulsory first-year undergraduate Human Anatomy and Physiology course in a New Zealand university. A data mining technique was used to assign students into a low-engagement/low-achievement cluster, and a high-engagement/high-achievement cluster. The skills, emotional, and participation-interaction components of engagement were lower in Pasifika students: these students' academic grade was lower than those of both Māori and Pākehā students. The strongest predictors of cluster membership were skills engagement and emotional engagement, suggesting that these components outweighed other aspects of course engagement. Māori and Pasifika students were overrepresented in the low-engagement/low-achievement cluster, and underrepresented in the high-engagement/high-achievement cluster. We suggest that embedding study skills within course delivery, and constantly emphasizing their importance, would likely increase student course engagement. Also, we report that both Māori and Pasifika students remain more disengaged than their Pākehā peers.",

Seventy-one percent of surveyed students (out of 139 participants) stated that they interacted with social media in general more than 12 times per week. However, 98% had previously used internet platforms to source physiology information, with 89.2% doing so at least once per week during term.

Significantly, 94% of students indicated that they would first search for answers online if they did not understand something in physiology rather than contacting their instructor in person or by e-mail. However, only 31% of students “fact-checked” physiology information obtained from online sources, by using textbooks, papers, and/or instructors. Our study has revealed that most preclinical medical students utilize social media extensively to study physiology. However, the absence of academic and ethical oversight, paired with students’ lack of critical appraisal of possibly inaccurate information, does raise concerns about the overall utility of social media as part of physiology education.",

This work aimed to determine if presenting classic papers during didactic lectures improves the learning of physiology among undergraduate students. Twenty-two students of health information technology were randomly divided into the following two groups: 1) didactic lecture only (control group) and 2) didactic lecture plus paper presentation breaks (DLPP group). In the control group, main topics of gastrointestinal and endocrine physiology were taught using only the didactic lecture technique. In the DLPP group, some topics were presented by the didactic lecture method (similar to the control group) and some topics were taught by the DLPP technique (first, concepts were covered briefly in a didactic format and then reinforced with presentation of a related classic paper). The combination of didactic lecture and paper breaks significantly improved learning so that students in the DLPP group showed higher scores on related topics compared with those in the control group (P < 0.001). Comparison of the scores of topics taught by only the didactic lecture and those using both the didactic lecture and paper breaks showed significant improvement only in the DLPP group (P < 0.001). Data obtained from the final exam showed that in the DLPP group, the mean score of the topics taught by the combination of didactic lecture and paper breaks was significantly higher than those taught by only didactic lecture (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the combination of paper presentation breaks and didactic lectures improves the learning of physiology.",

Thirty percent of first-year medical school students in 2012 attended a community college. Students attend at different times in high school, their first 2 yr of college, and postbaccalaureate. The community college pathway is particularly important for traditionally underrepresented groups. Premedical students who first attend community college are more likely to practice in underserved communities (2). For many students, community colleges have significant advantages over 4-yr institutions. Pragmatically, they are local, affordable, and flexible, which accommodates students' work and family commitments. Academically, community colleges offer teaching faculty, smaller class sizes, and accessible learning support systems. Community colleges are fertile ground for universities and medical schools to recruit diverse students and support faculty. Community college students and faculty face several challenges (6, 8). There are limited interactions between 2- and 4-yr institutions, and the ease of transfer processes varies. In addition, faculty who study and work to improve the physiology education experience often encounter obstacles. Here, we describe barriers and detail existing resources and opportunities useful in navigating challenges. We invite physiology educators from 2- and 4-yr institutions to engage in sharing resources and facilitating physiology education improvement across institutions. Given the need for STEM majors and health care professionals, 4-yr colleges and universities will continue to benefit from students who take introductory biology, physiology, and anatomy and physiology courses at community colleges.",

A survey instrument was developed and distributed through SurveyMonkey to American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Biological Sciences section members of 132 PharmD programs. Survey items focused on soliciting qualitative and quantitative information on the delivery of physiology curricular contents and faculty perceptions of physiology education. A total of 114 programs responded to the survey, resulting in a response rate of 86%. Out of 114 schools/colleges, 61 programs (54%) offered standalone physiology courses, and 53 programs (46%) offered physiology integrated with other courses. When integrated, the average contact hours for physiology contents were significantly reduced compared with standalone courses (30 vs. 84 h, P < 0.0001). Survey respondents identified diverse strategies in the delivery and assessment of physiology contents. Eighty percent of the responding faculty (n = 204) agree/strongly agree that physiology is underemphasized in PharmD curriculum. Moreover, 67% of the respondents agree/strongly agree that physiology should be taught as a standalone foundational course. A wide variation in the depth and breadth of physiology course offerings in US PharmD programs remains. The reduction of physiology contents is evident when physiology is taught as a component of integrated courses. Given current trends that favor integrated curricula, these data suggest that additional collaboration among basic and clinical science faculty is required to ensure that physiology contents are balanced and not underemphasized in a PharmD curriculum.",

This is a nonequivalent group quasi-experimental study approved by the institutional ethics committee. TskBL was conducted for seven topics among first-year medical students of Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore for three academic years. Participants were divided into a TskBL group and a control group. Both groups attended the theory classes in physiology, practical sessions, and clinical examinations concerning the tasks. After this, the TskBL group underwent TskBL, and the control group underwent tutorials. Pretest and posttest assessments were conducted by using a multiple choice question (MCQ) test and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs).The mean TskBL scores for MCQ (exception: hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and OSCE (exception: anemia and hypertension) were significantly higher than the tutorial group. Pretest and posttest scores revealed significantly higher MCQ and OSCE scores for TskBL (exception: MCQ score for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The tutorial group did not show a significant improvement in test scores for all the tasks. The TskBL strategy could be used for topics that are likely to be encountered by the students during clinical attachments. Small group teaching can include TskBL in preference to tutorials to provide early clinical exposure in medical schools.",

Despite this, many students struggle to transfer the principles governing homeostasis to concrete examples. Precourse assessments conducted on 72 undergraduate biology students enrolled in an introductory systems physiology course at the University of Belgrade during the February-May semester of 2021 revealed that students had a vague, fragmentary understanding of homeostasis and its related concepts that was often conflated with topics touched on during their previous coursework. We formalized and implemented an approach to teaching homeostasis that focused heavily on consistent reinforcement of physiological reflex patterns throughout the course. To that end, we employed a variety of activities aimed at getting students to view organ system integration holistically. After the semester, postcourse assessment demonstrated that students were better able to provide concrete examples of organ system contributions to homeostasis and were more adept at applying basic principles to novel physiological scenarios. Comparison of final grades with previous semesters revealed that students outperformed their peers who had taken the course previously. In this article, we summarize the findings of pre- and postcourse assessments, describe the general approach we took to teaching homeostasis as well as the specific techniques used in the classroom, and compare student performance with previous semesters.",

Despite this, the concept of flipped classrooms for medical students is still in its infancy in our country. We conducted an experimental randomized crossover study to find if a flipped teaching model improves learning for first-year medical undergraduate students. Students' perceptions of this novel method were also obtained and analyzed. In the first period (first part of the study), one group of students underwent the flipped model teaching (flipped teaching group), and the second group (traditional teaching group) was taught by the conventional method. A crossover was done with a second topic in the second period. A written test was conducted at the end of each period. Student feedback was also obtained. There was no statistically significant difference in students' performance on comparing traditional and flipped teaching methods. Reasons for this could be the level of the learner, prior exposure to active learning strategies, learner readiness/motivation for active learning, and timing of the study. Out of the participants, 80% of students preferred the flipped model classroom teaching, especially the interactive discussion, and expressed their desire for more frequent similar learning activities. We conclude that there was no difference in marks obtained by students in the two groups, yet they preferred the flipped classroom method, which indicates that it is feasible to adopt this method in the Indian medical undergraduate classroom.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We conducted a study to find if flipped teaching model improves the learning of medical undergraduate students and assess students' perceptions.

    "abstract": "Physiology teaching as an essential part of medical education faces tremendous criticism regarding curriculum design, methods of implementation, and application of knowledge in clinical practice. In the traditional method of medical education, physiology is taught in the first year and involves little interdisciplinary interaction. The Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Pokhara, Nepal (affiliated with the Kathmandu Univ.) started in 1994 and adopted an integrated curriculum drawn along the lines of the student-centered, problem-based, integrated, community-based, elective-oriented, and systematic (SPICES) medical curriculum. Here, physiology is taught for the first 2 yr of the 4.5-yr Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery course. Methodology adopted is as follows. For a particular topic, objectives are clearly defined and priority content areas are identified. An overview is given in a didactic lecture class to the entire batch of 100 students. Tutorial classes are conducted thereafter with smaller groups of students (25/batch) divided further into five subgroups of five students each. In these sessions, a problem is presented to the students as a focus for learning or as an example of what has just been taught. Each problem was accompanied with relevant questions to streamline the students' thought processes. A tutor is present throughout the session not as an instructor but as a facilitator of the learning process. A questionnaire sought students' opinion on the usefulness of this approach, relevance of the combination of problem-based learning (PBL) sessions and didactic lectures in understanding a particular topic and relating clinical conditions to basic mechanisms, and improvement of performance on the university final examination. The majority of the students opined that the combination of didactic lectures and PBL sessions was definitely beneficial regarding all the above-mentioned aspects of learning. The university results corroborated their opinion. Thus it may be considered that a judicious mixture of didactic lectures and PBL sessions is beneficial as a teaching module of physiology in medical schools.",

The student teams work to develop skills associated with experimental design, data analysis, written and oral communication, science literacy, and critical thinking. The laboratory curriculum is a research-based model that offers the advantage of students asking open-ended questions by use of a variety of techniques. For the students and instructor alike, this presents an exciting and challenging approach for learning physiology and basic biological principles. Another advantage of this laboratory model is that it is flexible and adaptable; the central theme can be any that the instructor chooses, and the goals and techniques developed are based on student and instructor needs and interests. Students who have completed this model at Loyola College in Maryland have become equipped with the skills essential for any area of the biological sciences and, most importantly, showed elevated excitement and commitment to learning.",

    "abstract": "Ballistocardiography is an old, noninvasive technique used to record the movements of the body synchronous with the heartbeat due to left ventricular pump activity. Despite the fact that this technique to measure cardiac output has been superseded by more advanced and precise techniques, it is useful for teaching cardiac cycle physiology in an undergraduate practical course because of its noninvasive application in humans, clear physiological and physiopathological analysis, and practical approach to considering cardiac output issues. In the present report, a simple, low cost, easy-to-build ballistocardiography system is implemented together with a theoretical and practical session that includes Newton’s laws, cardiac output, cardiac pump activity, anatomy and physiology of the vessel circulation, vectorial composition, and signal transduction, which makes cardiovascular physiology easy to understand and focuses on the study of cardiac output otherwise seen only with the help of computer simulation or echocardiography. The proposed system is able to record body displacement or force as ballistocardiography traces and its changes caused by different physiological factors. The ballistocardiography session was included in our medical physiology course six years ago with very high acceptance and approval rates from the students.",

In this article, the process of matching O 2 transport from air to its ultimate consumption in the contracting cell is utilized to integrate the workings of the cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle systems. Specifically, the physiology of exercise and the maximal oxygen consumption (V˙o 2 max ) achieved through the precise linking of these three muscle systems are utilized to highlight the complexity and importance of this integration. Smooth muscle plays a vital “middleman” role in the distribution of blood-borne O 2 to the appropriate area of demand. Cardiac muscle instigates the convective movement of this O 2 , whereas skeletal muscle acts as the recipient and ultimate consumer of O 2 in the synthesis of ATP and performance of work. In combination, these muscle systems facilitate the remarkable 15- to 30-fold increase in metabolic rate from rest to maximal effort in endurance-type exercise.",

    "abstract": "Interactive learning has been proven instrumental for the understanding of complex systems where the interaction of interdependent components is hard to envision. Due to the mechanical properties and mutual coupling of the lung and thorax, respiratory mechanics represent such a complex system, yet their understanding is essential for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various respiratory disorders. Here, we present a new mechanical model that allows for the simulation of respiratory pressure and volume changes in different ventilation modes. A bellow reflecting the “lung” is positioned within the inverted glass cylinder of a bell spirometer, which is sealed by a water lock and reflects the “thorax.” A counterweight attached to springs representing the elastic properties of the chest wall lifts the glass cylinder, thus creating negative “pleural” pressure inside the cylinder and inflating the bellow. Lung volume changes as well as pleural and intrapulmonary pressures are monitored during simulations of spontaneous ventilation, forced expiration, and mechanical ventilation, allowing for construction of respiratory pressure-volume curves. The mechanical model allows for simulation of respiratory pressure changes during different ventilation modes. Individual relaxation curves constructed for the lung and thorax reflect the basic physiological characteristics of the respiratory system. In self-assessment, 232 medical students passing the physiology laboratory course rated that interactive teaching at the simulation model increased their understanding of respiratory mechanics by 70% despite extensive prior didactic teaching. Hence, the newly developed simulation model fosters students' comprehension of complex mechanical interactions and may advance the understanding of respiratory physiology.",

However, the concepts that are under the literal meaning of these words can lead to misconceptions about the actual nervous organization. Some clear-cut examples indicate that no element shows \"autonomy\" in an integrated body. Nor are they solely \"passive\" or generated \"without mental elaboration.\" In addition, to be \"not consciously controlled\" is not a unique attribute of these components. Another term that could be proposed is \"homeostatic nervous system\" for providing conditions to the execution of behaviors and maintenance of the internal milieu within normal ranges. But, not all homeostatic conditions are under the direct influence of these groups of neurons, and some situations clearly impose different ranges for some variables that are adaptative (or hazardous) in the tentative of successfully coping with challenging situations. Finally, the name \"nervous system for visceral control\" emerges as another possibility. Unfortunately, it is not only \"viscera\" that represent end targets for this specific innervation. Therefore, it is commented that no quite adequate term for the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and gastrointestinal divisions has already been coined. The basic condition for a new term is that it should clearly imply the whole integrated and collaborative functions that the components have in an indivisible organism, including the neuroendocrine, immunological, and respiratory systems. Until that, we can call these parts simply by their own names and avoid terms that are more \"convenient\" than appropriate.",

LBNP is most often used to simulate gravitational stress, but it has also been used to simulate hemorrhage, alter preload, and manipulate baroreceptors. During experimentation, the consequences of LBNP and the reflex increases in heart rate and blood pressure can be manipulated and observed in a well-controlled manner, thus making LBNP an important research tool. Numerous laboratories have developed LBNP devices for use in research settings, and a few devices are commercially available. However, it is often difficult for new users to find adequately described design plans. Furthermore, many available plans require sophisticated and expensive materials and/or technical support. Therefore, we have created an affordable design plan for a LBNP chamber. The purpose of this article was to share our design template with others. In particular, we hope that this information will be of use in academic and research settings.

Five core laboratory skills were selected for the course entitled Human Biology, a large, first-year class of students, most of whom were enrolled in Bachelor of Pharmacy and Human Movement Studies. Here, we report details for the 365 students enrolled primarily in Pharmacy and Human Movement Studies bachelor degree programs in semester 1 of 2006. We designed a specific strategy to assess five core laboratory skills: 1) accurate and precise use of a micropipette, 2) calculation of dilutions and preparation of diluted samples of saline, 3) accurate representation of data using a graph, 4) use of a light microscope, and 5) acquisition of digital data by measuring the latent period for the Achilles reflex. Graduate tutors were trained to teach and assess each student on each skill. The development of competency was tracked for all students across all five skills. Most students demonstrated proficiency on their first attempt. The development of proficiency across the core skills depended on both the skill and degree program. In semester 2 of 2006, 854 students mostly enrolled in the Bachelor of Science degree program and were similarly taught and assessed on the same five core skills. This approach was an effective teaching and assessment strategy that, when applied beyond first year, should increase the level of laboratory skills across undergraduate programs in physiology.",

Participants ( n = 601) consisted of students enrolled in kinesiology-based allied health education programs. Multivariate ANOVA was used to compare group differences in enrollment decision making. “Personal influence,” “career opportunity,” and “physical self-efficacy” were all significantly stronger enrollment influences among African-American students than among Caucasian students, and “social influence,” “experiential opportunity,” “academic preparation,” and “physical self-efficacy” were all perceived as significantly greater barriers compared with Caucasian students.

However, a greater problem is the development of misconceptions that may be difficult to change (7). For example, one common misconception is that action potentials pass directly across chemical synapses (8). Difficulties may be compounded by explanations using voltage-time graphs, since students are not necessarily familiar with oscilloscope or computer-based representations of neural signals. Several different approaches have been used to overcome such misconceptions and provide simple explanations of complex physiological processes. These range from using groups of students acting out concepts (14) to the use of a “travelling flame” analogy for nerve conduction (11). E-learning using animations provides an additional method for overcoming physiology misconceptions (4, 6). Internet-based instruction in the health professions may be similar to traditional instruction in effectiveness (3), but it is important to clarify when to use e-learning and how to use it effectively (2). Thus, an online self-directed e-learning module was developed, using best-practice approaches (1), to engage students and help them overcome some common neurophysiology misconceptions. The essential features of the module were: the use of well-designed (9) and simple (low cognitive load) (12, 13) animations intended to promote good learning outcomes (5) and the use of multiple-choice questions linked with the animations to provide immediate feedback.METHODSStudents in a second-year undergraduate physiology class (n = 146) were able to freely access the module during the neurophysiology component as a supplement to other instructional modes. All students had received basic neurophysiology lectures during first-year classes. Students taking part in the study gave informed consent, and the study was conducted according to institutional human ethics guidelines.A trial version of a locally developed application “Enact Education” (EnactEd) was used to develop the e-learning module. The animations were developed using Adobe Flash software. The module was designed in serial fashion with an introductory page (including a menu) followed by the animation template (demonstrating “resting potential”). This was followed by seven animations based on the same template. After observing an animation, the student then attempted a related multiple-choice question. A correct answer took the student to the next animation, whereas an incorrect answer gave the student a choice of revisiting the animation or moving to the next animation.Synaptic and action potentials were shown as graded color changes instead of voltage-time displays. A color bar was provided that matched the color against the potential. Action potentials were represented as red dots (peak potentials), excitatory synaptic potentials were represented as graded blue-green colors, and inhibitory synaptic potentials were represented graded deep blue colors. A neuronal interaction produced the appropriate color. Observation of color changes was facilitated by the slow animation speed (each animation lasted ∼20 s). Each animation used the same template: three neurons, one motor neuron, and three muscle fibers (two of which were innervated by the motor neuron; Fig. 1). The animations covered “effective excitatory input,” “ineffective excitatory input,” “inhibitory input,” “spatial summation of excitatory inputs,” “spatial summation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs,” “temporal summation,” and “spatial summation of several inputs.”Fig. 1.Template arrangement of neurons and muscle cells for the seven animations. Effective excitatory input animation is shown half way through the sequence (neuron D has been activated and an action potential initiated). Note the decrement of the graded potential. Voltage changes in the neurons and muscle cells were color coded by reference to the color bar. The labels (apart from neuron designation) could be switched on or off.Download figureDownload PowerPointTo assess relevant prior knowledge, a pretest, which consisted of eight multiple-choice questions, was administered without warning in semester week 7. The questions consisted of one correct answer and two distractors based on experience gained by the author over previous years. Students were then informed about the online module and were encouraged to freely access it. A small group of students (from the pretest group, n = 15) who used the module completed a posttest in week 13 without warning (same questions as for the pretest) and provided detailed feedback in terms of module usability and learning support using a 5-point Likert scale (where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). Ten of these students provided written comments, and the following framework was provided for this feedback: “Use three adjectives to describe your overall reaction on usability,” “Describe the aspect of the module activity that you like the most,” “Describe the aspect of the module activity that you like the least,” “What will be the most important factors influencing your use of the module activity?,” “Suggestions for improvement,” and “Describe overall reaction to the module activity.” In addition, an end-of-semester course evaluation included questions relating to the number of times that the module had been accessed and whether the module was a useful learning aid (5-point Likert scale, where 1 = not very useful and 5 = very useful).RESULTSThe pretest was taken by 51% of the class (n = 74). Only distractors attracting 30% or more of student answers were included in the analysis. The misconceptions derived from the latter analysis (followed by the percentages of students choosing them) were as follows: “synaptic potentials do not reduce in amplitude as they spread” (57%), “the action potential passes directly from one neuron to the next” (40%), “action potentials are similar in amplitude to synaptic potentials” (39%), “excitatory synaptic potentials generally exceed 0 mV” (35%), and “some parts of the neuron (compared with the whole of the neuron) have a resting membrane potential of about −70 mV” (33%).Due to time constraints and the voluntary nature of the activity, only 15 students who had used the module completed both the posttest and survey questions. These students averaged seven correct responses of eight total responses for the posttest. However, 4 of 15 students (27%) gave an incorrect answer for question 4 (misconception: “synaptic potentials do not reduce in amplitude as they spread”). The survey results from these students indicated that “the activity was interesting” (mean ± SD: 4.2 ± 0.9), “the screen display was easy to understand” (4.2 ± 0.7), “interactive feedback helped me learn” (4.1 ± 0.7), “the use of animations was appropriate” (4.1 ± 0.9), “the activity supports my learning” (4.0 ± 0.8), “the activity helped me to understand course content” (3.9 ± 0.8), and “navigation was clear and simple” (3.7 ± 0.8).Ten of the fifteen students provided written comments regarding the module. The “usability” comments fell into two main positive groups: ease of use (15 comments) and engagement (12 comments). Students liked the animations and visual nature of the module (11 comments), e.g., “Animations for concepts that are confusing–helpful in physiology.” The activity was rated as “very good” (8 comments). Use of the module was linked to how well it covered the concepts (7 comments). There were no negative comments; however, suggestions were made for content increase (10 comments), improvements in the stability of the module (e.g., eliminating error messages, 8 comments), increasing the speed of the animations (2 comments), and improving the visibility of the action potentials (1 comment).The end-of-semester survey was completed by 62% of the class (n = 90). Within the class, 29% had not accessed the module, 31% used it once or twice (average: 1.5 times), and 40% used it more than twice (average: 4 times). In answer to the question “The online module was a useful learning aid,” those students who accessed it once or twice had an average satisfaction level of 3 (±1.2), whereas those who accessed it more than twice had a satisfaction level of 4 (±0.8).DISCUSSIONThe pretest data demonstrated the existence of neurophysiology misconceptions among undergraduate physiology students with the highest level of misconception related to uniformity of the resting membrane potential, the amplitude and decrement of synaptic potentials, synaptic transmission, and action potential amplitude. The results were concerning since the students had exposure to neurophysiology basics in previous studies. Misconceptions have been identified in previous studies of neurophysiology learning, e.g., Silverthorn (10) found that student understanding of membrane potential was superficial even after neurophysiology training and Montagna et al. (8) found that students had serious misconceptions about synaptic transmission. Importantly, once such misconceptions are formed, it can be difficult for students to correct them (7); hence, it is important to test different methods to deal with this problem.The module was successful in engaging a significant proportion of the students, even though it was a voluntary activity with no associated formative assessment. The positive responses to presentation and learning support indicate the effectiveness of the methods used. Detailed survey and written responses supported module effectiveness in terms of the animations, learning support, feedback, and interactivity. Additional support was provided by the large group survey, where students who had used the module more than twice (40% of those responding) had a degree of satisfaction similar to that determined from the more detailed small-group analysis. Although the student responses were positive, the major misconception determined from the pretest (“synaptic potentials do not reduce in amplitude as they spread”) was still evident to some extent in the small group of students who provided detailed feedback on the module. This may be related to difficulty in graphically demonstrating “fading” of color with distance when representing the graded responses in the animations. Although there is evidence that engagement relates to learning, the data in this study alone are not sufficient to establish that the module was an effective learning tool. An earlier study by the author (6) found evidence that spinal reflex animations contributed to student learning, but further work is required to establish the learning efficacy of the current online module.The module provided an adjunct to more traditional methods of instruction; however, it should be emphasized that the module only engaged a proportion of the students, with 60% not accessing it or only accessing it once or twice (with an average neutral response). For these students, it is not clear whether lack of access or engagement was related to the voluntary nature of the activity (with no associated formative assessment) or whether this type of online support is only appropriate for students with particular learning approaches.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: R.G.G. conception and design of research; R.G.G. performed experiments; R.G.G. analyzed data; R.G.G. interpreted results of experiments; R.G.G. prepared figures; R.G.G. drafted manuscript; R.G.G. edited and revised manuscript; R.G.G. approved final version of manuscript.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe author thanks Dr. Peter Rich, Dr. Bruce Byrne, and Patricia McLaughlin for helpful comments.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "Students are naturally curious and inquisitive with powerful intrinsic motives to probe, learn, and understand their world. Accordingly, class activities must capitalize on this inherently energetic and curious nature so that learning becomes a lifelong activity where students take initiative for learning, are skilled in learning, and want to learn new things. This report describes a student-centered class activity, the “flipped exam,” designed to achieve this goal. The flipped exam was a collaborative, group effort, and learning was interactive. It included a significant proportion (∼30–35%) of material not covered in class. This required students to actively search for content and context, dynamically making connections between what they knew and what they learned, grappling with complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, and finally discovering answers to important questions. Accordingly, the need or desire to know was the catalyst for meaningful learning. Student assessment was determined by behavioral noncognitive parameters that were based on the observation of the student and the student's work as well as cognitive parameters (i.e., the student's score on the examination). It is our view that the flipped exam provided a student-centered activity in which students discovered, because of the need to know and opportunities for discussion, the important concepts and principles we wanted them to learn.",

    "abstract": "The Finapres finger cuff recording system provides continuous calculations of beat-to-beat variations in cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance, heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP). This system is unique in that it allows experimental subjects to immediately, continuously, and noninvasively visualize changes in CO at rest and during exercise. This study provides evidence that using the Finapres system improves undergraduate student engagement, understanding, and learning of how the cardiovascular system responds to exercise. Second-year science students undertaking a physiology practical class in 2009 ( n = 243) and 2010 ( n = 263) used the Finapres system to record CO, BP, and HR during graded exercise on a cycle ergometer. Student experiences with the Finapres was evaluated with a survey (a 5-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree). This indicated that students appreciated the immediacy of the recordings (88% of students agreed or strongly agreed, average for 2009 and 2010), gained an understanding of how to record physiological data (84%), enjoyed the practical (81%), and would recommend the Finapres to other students (81%). To determine if the practical enhanced student learning of cardiovascular physiology, identical tests were given to the students at the beginning (pretest) and end (posttest) of the class. There was a significant improvement from the pretest to the posttest (4% in 2009 and 20% in 2010). In summary, the ability of the Finapres to continuously display CO, BP, and HR during experimental protocols provides students with immediate feedback and improves their understanding of cardiovascular physiology.",

The high numbers of graduates each year, coupled with the low number of graduate positions working in sports, has led to a high level of competition between students. To stand out from the crowd, sport science students may undertake an internship placement as part of their course, designed to enhance theoretical, practical, and soft skills in an applied setting. In the present article, we highlight some of the positives and negatives of sport science internships and ways in which they can be implemented and facilitated. Suggestions have also been provided to make students more aware of the reality of working in professional sports, which includes awareness of the potential for long and unsociable hours of work.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that practicing temporally spaced retrieval of previously learned information via formal assessments increases student retention of the information. Our objective was to determine the impact of online homework administered as a first retrieval practice 1 or 5 days after introduction of physiology topics on long-term information retention. Students in two undergraduate courses, Anatomy and Physiology (ASCI 240) and Animal Physiological Systems (ASCI 340), were presented with information on a specific physiological system during each weekly laboratory and then completed an online homework assignment either 1 or 5 days later. Information retention was assessed via an in-class quiz the following week and by a comprehensive final exam at semester's end (4-13 wk later). Performance on homework assignments was generally similar between groups for both courses. Information retention at 1 wk did not differ due to timing of homework in either course. In both courses, however, students who received homework 5 days after class performed better on final exam questions relevant to that week's topic compared with their day 1 counterparts. These findings indicate that the longer period between introducing physiology information in class and assigning the first retrieval practice was more beneficial to long-term information retention than the shorter period, despite seemingly equivalent benefits in the shorter term. Since information is typically forgotten over time, we speculate that the longer interval necessitates greater retrieval effort in much the same way as built-in desirable difficulties, thus allowing for stronger conceptual connections and deeper comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Fractal physiology demonstrated growing interest over the last decades among physiologists, neuroscientists, and clinicians. Many physiological systems coordinate themselves for reducing variability and maintain a steady state. When recorded over time, the output signal exhibits small fluctuations around a stable value. It is becoming increasingly clear that these fluctuations, in most free-running healthy systems, are not simply due to uncorrelated random errors and possess interesting properties, one of which is the property of fractal dynamics. Fractal dynamics model temporal processes in which similar patterns occur across multiple timescales of measurement. Smaller copies of a pattern are nested within larger copies of the pattern, a property termed scale invariance. It is an intriguing process that may deserve attention for implementing curricular development for students to reconsider homeostasis. Teaching fractal dynamics needs to make calculating resources available for students. The present paper offers a calculating resource that uses a basic formula and is executable in a simple spreadsheet. The spreadsheet allows computing detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), the most frequently used method in the literature to quantify the fractal-scaling index of a physiological time series. DFA has been nicely described by the group at Harvard that designed it; the authors made the C language source available. Going further, it is suggested here that a guide to build DFA step by step in a spreadsheet has many advantages for teaching fractal physiology and beyond: 1) it promotes the DIY (do-it-yourself) in students and highlights scaling concepts; and 2) it makes DFA available for people not familiarized with executing code in C language.",

    "abstract": "In the field of medical education, it is possible to consider that the acquisition of professional competences can gain new contours when considering the use of active methodologies. It is important to analyze the perception of the students about the use of them in medical courses, as well as to reflect on their challenges and potentials. In the present study, a semistructured questionnaire of student perception was applied immediately after the execution of different types of active methodologies in the discipline of physiology in two medical courses. The results suggest a highly positive evaluation of the use of active methodologies by the student body of the two institutions. The students evaluated positively the application of the method (94.6%) and the perception about the learning (84.1%). On the other hand, when questioned about the substitution of the traditional expository method by the active methodologies, there was a tendency to the centrality of the answers, with 84.0% of the responses concentrated at positions 2, 3, and 4 on a scale of 1 (minimum) to 5 (maximum) on the Likert scale. There were no statistically significant differences when comparing variables of age, sex, and previous graduation. Although there was no consensus regarding the full replacement of traditional for active methodologies, one can conclude that the students' perception about the introduction of said methodologies in the teaching of physiology in medical courses is positive, regardless of the subgroups evaluated. These results encourage the insertion of these and other methodologies into medical courses.",

    "abstract": "Microbial physiology is a basic course taught throughout biomedical science disciplines. Students study the structure, growth, and metabolism of microorganisms and often find it difficult to learn the information, usually because they fail to see the wider applications. The current microbiology laboratory series describes how to transform a \"cookbook\" undergraduate laboratory to an inquiry-based one by incorporating problem-based learning. The students use a food poisoning case study that develops over a series of seven experiments and take on the role of the microbiology technician who is responsible for coming up with the answer and submitting a report to a clinician. The case provides coherence to the sessions, and the students are given the opportunity to learn about, and practice, common techniques they would encounter in a clinical microbiology laboratory. Those include the aseptic method, cultivation of bacteria, quantification of bacteria in culture, isolation of pure culture, morphological observation by light microscopy, Gram staining, the use of selective and differential media, and the effectiveness of a variety of antimicrobials and antibiotics. This laboratory series has been designed so that it can be implemented in any setting, using simple materials and inexpensive, nonspecialized equipment. The experiments are carried out in small groups, and a facilitator may tutor up to two groups of 10 students at a time. The current method has been successfully implemented for the past 2 yr, and the students demonstrated greater motivation in learning and understanding.",

This study aimed to determine factors influencing the NLE1 score (NLE1S). The NLE1S, academic achievement, and class attendance were obtained officially. Other factors, including study habits, were obtained via a questionnaire, with 81.97% (241/294) being returned. Students were divided into four groups according to the central passing score and Z-score of the NLE1S, including the fail (&lt;52%; n = 13), low-pass (52 to &lt;70%; n = 121), high-pass (70 to &lt;80%; n = 89), and excellent (≥80%; n = 18) groups. Men had higher NLE1S ( P &lt; 0.001) and comprehensive examination scores ( P &lt; 0.001) than women. Students with high motivation to study medicine had higher NLE1S. Daily preparation time (h/day) was lower, but stress was higher, in the fail group. In the excellent group, internet for academic use and achievement of study targets were higher; internet for nonacademic use, instance of absence, and stress were lower; and check-in time was earlier. The NLE1S had strong positive correlations with the comprehensive examination score and academic achievement during preclinical studies. By setting the NLE1S as a dependent variable in multivariate regression analyses, models of significant interactions were observed by setting behavioral factors, the comprehensive examination score, and academic achievement during a regular class as independent variables. Thus exhibiting good study habits and showing good academic performance throughout preclinical studies should be encouraged among students to achieve a good NLE1S.",

These simulators serve to teach basic science concepts, advanced clinical skills, as well as empathy and student confidence. This study aimed to understand the students' perception of the integration of high-fidelity simulation exercises into the teaching of human physiology. Research groups were made up of both osteopathic and podiatric medical students. Data were obtained using a Likert-scale survey. Results indicated that students believed the simulation experiences were beneficial to further understanding of physiological concepts, as well as seeing these concepts in a clinical setting. Variations were noted between podiatric and osteopathic medical students' perception on how the experiences helped them develop clinical and personal confidence, and if the experience helped illustrate correlations between laboratory values and accompanying physiology. Results illustrated no differences in perception between the sexes. Although all students agreed that the experience helped with the understanding of physiology, podiatric medical students did not necessarily find value in the simulation for their development as future clinicians. We predict that differences in perception are largely based on the different curriculums of the students questioned. The present study indicated that incorporation of simulation experiences in the first year of medical school enhanced learning basic science physiology concepts and promoted the development of self-confidence as future clinicians. Incorporating simulation into the didactic coursework should be promoted in other medical schools' curricula.",

In contrast, our research, which has focused on kinesiology students learning kinesiology information that is generally familiar to them, has consistently demonstrated that testing-based strategies produce greater recall both immediately and after a delay. In an attempt to understand the discrepancies in the literature, the purpose of the present study was to determine if the time-related advantages of a testing-based learning strategy vary with one's familiarity with the to-be-learned information. Participants used both read-only and testing-based strategies to repeatedly study three different sets of information: 1) previously studied human muscle information (familiar information), 2) a mix of previously studied and previously unstudied human muscle information (mixed information), and 3) previously unstudied muscle information that is unique to sharks (unfamiliar information). Learning was evaluated via free recall assessments administered immediately after studying and again after a 1-wk delay and a 3-wk delay. Across those three assessments, the read-only strategy resulted in mean scores of 29.26 ± 1.43, 15.17 ± 1.29, and 5.33 ± 0.77 for the familiar, mixed, and unfamiliar information, respectively, whereas the testing-based strategy produced scores of 34.57 ± 1.58, 16.90 ± 1.31, and 8.33 ± 0.95, respectively. The results indicate that the testing-based strategy produced greater recall immediately and up through the 3-wk delay regardless of the participants' level of familiarity with the muscle information.",

Numerous studies have recommended not only depth in a teacher's subject area but also a breadth of professional development grounded in constructivist principles, allowing for successful student-centered and inquiry-based instruction. Few programs, however, have addressed the integration of the scientific research laboratory into the science classroom as a viable approach to professional development. Additionally, while occasional laboratory training programs have emerged in recent years, many lack a component for translating acquired skills into reformed classroom instruction. Given the rapid development and demand for knowledgeable employees and an informed population from the biotech and medical industries in recent years, it would appear to be particularly advantageous for the physiology and broader science education communities to consider this issue. The goal of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a laboratory-based professional development program focused on the integration of reformed teaching principles into the classrooms of secondary teachers. This was measured through the program's ability to instill in its participants elevated academic success while gaining fulfillment in the classroom. The findings demonstrated a significant improvement in the use of student-centered instruction and other reformed methods by program participants as well as improved self-efficacy, confidence, and job satisfaction. Also revealed was a reluctance to refashion established classroom protocols. The combination of these outcomes allowed for construction of an experiential framework for professional development in applied science education that supports an atmosphere of reformed teaching in the classroom.",

Data were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The likelihood for change after peer instruction increased when the confidence on an individual answer was low ( P &lt; 0.01), when the answer was incorrect ( P &lt; 0.01), and when group members had different responses ( P &lt; 0.01). The likelihood for correctness after peer instruction increased when the confidence in group answers was high ( P &lt; 0.01), when the individual answer was correct ( P &lt; 0.01), and when at least one of the group members had the correct response ( P &lt; 0.01). After peer discussion, more changes were from incorrect to correct responses than vice versa (72% vs. 28%, P &lt; 0.01). Changes to correct answers occurred after discussion with peers having both the correct individual response (76% of times) and also the incorrect individual answer (24% of times). In conclusion, the benefits of peer instruction are due to students having correct answers generally prevail in discussions. Also, students who all have incorrect answers can get the correct answer through debate and discussion.",

A separate cohort of research trainees was given uncompensated data files on which they performed their own compensation, calculated the antibody staining index, designed a sequential gating strategy, and quantified rare immune cell subsets. Student engagement, confidence, and perceptions of flow cytometry were assessed using a survey. Competency against the learning outcomes was assessed by asking students to undertake tasks that required understanding of flow cytometry dot plot data and gating sequences. The active, collaborative approach allowed students to achieve learning outcomes not previously possible with traditional teaching formats, for example, having students design their own gating strategy, without forgoing essential outcomes such as the interpretation of dot plots. In undergraduate students, favorable perceptions of flow cytometry as a field and as a potential career choice were correlated with student confidence but not the ability to perform flow cytometry data analysis. We demonstrate that this new pedagogical approach to teaching flow cytometry is beneficial for student understanding and interpretation of complex concepts. It should be considered as a useful new method for incorporating complex data analysis tasks such as flow cytometry into curricula.",

While its role in patient evaluation is well known, its utility during preclinical courses such as anatomy and physiology is becoming increasingly recognized. The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility/utility of integrating ultrasound-based sessions into conventional undergraduate medical school programs of physiology of the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular reflexes and to evaluate student perceptions of an ultrasound-based didactic session. Second-year medical students enrolled in the University of Padova attended a didactic session during which basic concepts regarding ultrasound instrumentation, image production, and spatial orientation were presented. Five anatomic sectors (the heart, aorta, neck vessels, inferior vena cava, and femoral veins) were then examined on a volunteer. Student perceptions of the images that were projected, the usefulness of the presentation, and the reproducibility of the experience were assessed at the end of the lecture with an anonymous questionnaire consisting of positive and negative items that were rated using a 5-point Likert scale and with two questions. One hundred eleven students attended the lecture; 99% of them found it very interesting, and none considered it boring or a waste of time. More than 96% thought it helped them to gain a better comprehension of the subject and would recommend it to a colleague. In conclusion, as ultrasound has been found to be a valuable resource for the teaching of physiology of the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular reflexes, efforts should be made to integrate ultrasound sessions into the traditional human physiology curriculum.",

Therefore, to promote a habit of gaining indepth knowledge of basic sciences in medical undergraduates along with honing of their communication and analytical skills, we introduced this more interactive way of learning. The present study was performed on 99 first-semester medical students. After conventional didactic lectures, students were asked to prepare small conceptual questions on the topic. They were divided into two teams, which were made to ask questions to each other. If a team failed to answer, the student who questioned was supposed to answer to the satisfaction of the other team's student. Data were then obtained by getting feedback from the students on a 10-item questionnaire, and statistical evaluation was done using MS Excel and SPSS. To draft questions, students went through the whole system comprehensively and made questions from every possible aspect of the topic. Some of the questions (30%) were of recall type, but most judged higher cognitive domains. Student feedback revealed that they were satisfied, motivated to read more, and were confident of applying this learning and communication skills in future clinical practice. Students also expressed their desire to implement this activity as a regular feature of the curriculum. The activity resulted in an increase in student perceptions of their knowledge on the topic as well as communicative and analytical skills. This may eventually lead to better learning.",

Lecture attenders mostly missed lectures to complete assessments during the same week (68%), whereas nonattenders were more likely to miss lectures due to outside commitments or preference for study from books or recorded lectures (P < 0.001). Recordings were used to replace missed lectures (64%), rather than for revision, and were viewed mostly alone (96%) in one sitting (65%). Only 22% of respondents agreed that some lectures could be replaced by recordings, but 59% agreed with having some videoconference lectures from experts on another campus. Overall, this cohort showed a clear preference for live lectures over recordings, with limited support for synchronous videoconference lectures.",

There are limited performance assessments, but high-fidelity patient simulations (HFPS) may be a feasible platform. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether a group's CT process could be observed over a series of HFPS. An instrument [Critical Thinking Skills Rating Instrument CTSRI)] was designed with the IDEAS framework. Fifteen groups of students participated in three HFPS that consisted of a basic knowledge quiz and introduction, HFPS session, and debriefing. HFPS were video recorded, and two raters reviewed and scored all HFPS encounters with the CTSRI independently. Interrater analysis suggested good reliability. There was a correlation between basic knowledge scores and three of the six observations on the CTSRI providing support for construct validity. The median CT ratings significantly increased for all observations between the groups' first and last simulation. However, there were still large percentages of video ratings that indicated students needed substantial prompting during the HFPS. The data from this pilot study suggest that it is feasible to observe CT skills in HFPS using the CTSRI. Based on the findings from this study, we strongly recommend that first-year medical students be competent in basic knowledge of the relevant physiology of the HFPS before participating, to minimize the risk of a poor learning experience.",

Taking into account both the variety of learning preferences among students and the benefits of student autonomy, the authors hypothesized that adding digital chalk-talk videos to lecture notes and live lectures would improve student knowledge, course satisfaction, and engagement. The authors measured performance on the renal physiology exam before (the traditional curriculum) and for 2 yr after implementation of the new curriculum. During the traditional and subsequent years, students took a Q-sort survey before and after the Renal Physiology course. Satisfaction was assessed based on ranked statements in the Q sort, as well as through qualitative analysis of student commentary. Compared with the traditional curriculum, mean scores on the renal physiology final exam were higher after implementation of the new curriculum: 65.3 vs. 74.4 ( P < 0.001) with year 1 and 65.3 vs. 79.4 ( P < 0.001) in the second year. After the new curriculum, students were more likely to agree with the statement, \"I wish other courses were taught like this one.\" Qualitative analysis revealed how the video-based curriculum improved student engagement and satisfaction. Adding digital chalk-talk videos to a traditional Renal Physiology course that included active learning led to improved exam performance and high levels of student satisfaction. Other preclinical courses in medical school may benefit from such an intervention.",

    "abstract": "One of the most iconic images in biology is the cross-striated appearance of a skeletal muscle fiber. The repeating band pattern shows that all of the sarcomeres are the same length. All of the A bands are the same length and are located in the middle of the sarcomeres. Furthermore, all of the myofibrils are transversely aligned across the muscle fiber. It has been known for 300 yr that skeletal muscle is striated, but only in the last 40 yr has a molecular understanding of the striations emerged. In the 1950s it was discovered that the extraction of myosin from myofibrils abolished the A bands, and the myofibrils were no longer striated. With the further extraction of actin, only the Z disks remained. Strangely, the sarcomere length did not change, and these \"ghost\" myofibrils still exhibited elastic behavior. The breakthrough came in the 1970s with the discovery of the gigantic protein titin. Titin, an elastic protein ~1 µm in length, runs from the Z disk to the middle of the A band and ensures that each sarcomere is the same length. Titin anchors the A band in the middle of the sarcomere and may determine thick-filament length and thus A-band length. In the 1970s it was proposed that the intermediate filament desmin, which surrounds the Z disks, connects adjacent myofibrils, resulting in the striated appearance of a skeletal muscle fiber.",

    "abstract": "An understanding of human embryology is essential for students to better understand the subjects of human anatomy and physiology. However, human embryology is a challenging subject for many, since they must learn how anatomic structures and physiological processes develop over a period of time. Embryology texts typically use static, two-dimensional images to illustrate the dynamic three-dimensional developmental processes, making it difficult for a student to understand spatial relationships and sequential steps. To help students conceptualize these series of complex dynamic developmental events that occur over time, two of the authors and a graphic artist developed six web-based cardiovascular embryology animations and housed them on an Indiana University website. This research study examines knowledge gains and user satisfaction of students, faculty, and laypeople around the world who accessed these six website animations. Data collection spanned 6 yr, and pretest/posttest assessments (ranging from 4 to 7 multiple-choice questions each) were used to determine immediate knowledge gains of cardiovascular embryology. The total number of completed pretest/posttest assessments ranged from 555 to 1,449 per animation. The number of correct posttest scores was significantly improved over matched pretest scores (confidence interval range 1.3-3.2, depending on the animation, P < 0.001), suggesting the animations are useful for embryology learning (at least in the short term). Demographic and user satisfaction information was gathered with an anonymous survey at the end of each animation. Survey data from all animations indicated participants found the animations easy to use and very effective for their learning. This research highlights the positive impacts of web-based animations on learning complicated events of cardiovascular embryology.",

Thus pharmacy schools are not only searching for effective means to increase enrollment of qualified candidates, but are also focusing on the development of programs to improve academic performance and retention of enrolled students. To address the needs of struggling first-year pharmacy students enrolled in an Integrated Biological Sciences (BSI) course, an academic performance enrichment program (APEP) was developed. The program was designed to improve academic success by engaging low-performing students with the aims of improving their time management skills, study skills, metacognition, and understanding of BSI course material. The APEP consisted of structured tutoring sessions twice per week, which were required for all students with a course grade ≤73.5% at any point during the semester. To assess program effectiveness, performance improvement on BSI exams by the APEP students were compared with that of non-APEP students in the same class and to those in the previous 3 yr. Student perceptions of the program were also evaluated via an online survey. The APEP was deemed effective in that a greater percentage of students were able to improve their exam scores and to a greater extent by attending the APEP sessions compared with non-APEP students in the same class and with low-performing students in previous years when the APEP did not exist. Furthermore, APEP students believed the program was effective in meeting its aims. In conclusion, the APEP was effective in improving academic performance of low-performing students in BSI.",

Prematriculation introduction of strategies to improve anatomy learning may help prepare students for a rigorous DPT program and improve anatomy learning efficiency. The present study describes a 2-day anatomy workshop offered to incoming students before a DPT program was initiated. Knowledge acquired during both days of the workshop resulted in statistically significant improvements in anatomy postquiz scores for each corresponding prequiz (P < 0.001 for lower and upper limb quizzes). Workshop participants survey responses demonstrated that anatomy confidence and PBL preparedness increased at distinct intervals following the workshop and was significantly higher than controls after the first semester (P < 0.01 for anatomy confidence and PBL preparedness). Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated statistically significant relationships between semester anatomy practical scores and workshop participation (P = 0.03 for practical 1 and P = 0.049 for practical 2) and undergraduate grade point average (P < 0.001 for practical 1 and P = 0.03 for practical 2). First-year DPT students reported the anatomy workshop to be a valuable experience for learning strategies to improve anatomy self-efficacy. An introductory anatomy workshop is an effective strategy to improve self-directed anatomy learning efficiency before the start of a rigorous DPT program.",

These perceived limitations can be mitigated by the introduction of structured oral examination (SOE). There is little evidence of the implementation of SOE in physiology laboratory courses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of SOE in laboratory-based learning sessions. Second-year medical students ( n = 114) attended a 16-wk physiology laboratory course. They were initially assessed by TOE in the middle of the academic term. The students’ perspectives on this assessment were measured by a modified three-point Likert-type scale questionnaire. Following this, faculty members prepared topics for SOE; nine topics were included from each laboratory course. The correct answers and scoring criteria were discussed among the faculty before the SOE event. One week after the last laboratory course, SOE was carried out for each student. As with the TOE process, student feedback was collected via a modified three-point Likert-type scale questionnaire. The mean laboratory homework score from the first four and last four laboratory courses was also calculated. Paper exams were also conducted after TOE and SOE. The results show that SOE is more acceptable to students than TOE. Significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05) were observed in terms of uniformity of questions asked, syllabus coverage, and anxiety levels. In addition, SOE improved students’ performance in the laboratory course explored here. We contend that SOE shows promise as an effective assessment tool in laboratory-based physiology learning sessions.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesized that the intellectual development of students, i.e., their beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning, affects their intrinsic motivation and class performance. Specifically, we hypothesized that students with low intellectual development (i.e., the naive beliefs that knowledge is simple, absolute, and certain) have low intrinsic motivation and low class performance, whereas students with high intellectual development (i.e., more sophisticated beliefs that knowledge is complex, tentative, and evolving) have high intrinsic motivation and class performance. To test this hypothesis, we administered the Learning Context Questionnaire to measure intellectual development. In addition, we administered the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory to assess our students' intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, we performed regression analyses between intellectual development with both intrinsic motivation and class performance. The results document a positive relationship among intellectual development, intrinsic motivation, and class performance for female students only. In sharp contrast, there was a negative relationship between intellectual development, intrinsic motivation, and class performance for male students. The slope comparisons documented significant differences in the slopes relating intellectual development, intrinsic motivation, and class performance between female and male students. Thus, female students with more sophisticated beliefs that knowledge is personally constructed, complex, and evolving had higher intrinsic motivation and class performance. In contrast, male students with the naive beliefs that the structure of knowledge is simple, absolute, and certain had higher levels of intrinsic motivation and class performance. The results suggest that sex influences intellectual development, which has an effect on intrinsic motivation for learning a specific topic.",

PowerPoint has now almost entirely replaced chalkboard or whiteboard teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This study investigated whether undergraduate biology students preferred to have lectures delivered by PowerPoint or written on the board as well as the reasons behind their preference. Two upper-division physiology courses were surveyed over a period of 7 yr. A total of 1,905 students (86.7%) indicated they preferred lectures delivered by \"writing on the board\" compared to 291 students (13.3%) who preferred PowerPoint. Common themes drawn from explanations reported by students in favor of writing on the board included: 1) more appropriate pace, 2) facilitation of note taking, and 3) greater alertness and attention. Common themes in favor of PowerPoint included 1) increased convenience, 2) focus on listening, and 3) more accurate and readable notes. Based on the students' very strong preference for writing on the board and the themes supporting that preference, we recommend that instructors incorporate elements of the writing on the board delivery style into whatever teaching modality is used. If instructors plan to use PowerPoint, the presentation should be paced, constructed, and delivered to provide the benefits of lectures written on the board. The advantages of writing on the board can be also incorporated into instruction intended to occur outside the classroom, such as animated narrated videos as part of the flipped classroom approach.",

While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students. Furthermore, the program was an opportunity to keep the students active in science while working from their homes during the pandemic.",

We evaluated two PD models-research experiences for teachers and online PD-for their comparative impacts on middle and high school teachers' understanding of, preparedness to use, and actual use of proven STEM teaching methods and STEM career information. The programs were unique in their focus on equipping teachers with a pedagogical \"tool kit\" that supports ongoing changes in teaching and assessment methods, STEM content, use of technology, and working with diverse students. Findings indicate that both program models increased teachers' preparedness to use and their frequency of use of the targeted STEM teaching methods. Teachers who had summer research experiences gained additional benefits.",

The study was aimed at exploring the scope of guided reflective narratives on early clinical exposure, for first-year medical students, in promoting empathy. Strengths and limitations of the process of reflective narratives were also explored. First-year medical students ( n = 150) were exposed to guided reflective narrative writing following each of the three “early clinical exposure” sessions integrated into a physiology curriculum. A feedback on the entire program was obtained through a semistructured questionnaire. The contents of the reflective narratives and feedback on the program were analyzed. Students empathized with the situation and needs of patients and caregivers and could relate to responsibilities and challenges faced by members of health care team. They realized the importance of cooperation from patients and caregivers and work efficiency, communication, behavior, and teamwork from members of healthcare and thereby emerged with the idea of the coordinated effort in patient care. Students opined that reflective narratives made them reflect and empathize with people and situations. Too many narrative writing sessions and hesitation to share their thoughts were some of the suggested limitations. The process led to emergence of a working model for guided reflections to promote empathy. Guided reflective narratives made students reflect and relate to people and situations. While promoting empathy, the reflections also gave them an idea of holistic approach to patient-centered care. Inferences led to a conceptual model for guided reflections to promote empathy among medical students.",

While conducting an observational cohort study on the relationship of attendance to performance and wellness, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown changed the ability of students to attend class. Matriculating medical students were recruited to participate at the beginning of their first year in August 2019. In-person attendance was collected prospectively until the lockdown began in March 2020. This was then correlated with performance on course final examinations and responses to two separate incidences of a survey on stress, burnout, social isolation, and loneliness. The first survey was deployed January through February 2020 (pre-COVID) and the second June 2020 (during COVID lockdown). Attendance declined across the year (76.0%–25.0%). There was a small positive correlation of attendance to performance in module 1 ( r = 0.235, P = 0.035) with none in the remaining two modules ( P = 0.870, P = 0.410). The high attenders at the time of the lockdown had no decline in their performance when attendance was no longer possible. Attendance negatively correlated with stress and loneliness but not with the remainder of the wellness metrics. There was no significant change in any of the wellness metrics between the pre-COVID and during COVID time points. While the data support the conclusion that attendance is not required to maintain performance in this population, these data suggest a small protective effect against stress and loneliness.",

This study evaluated the question of whether students benefit or are harmed when they change their initial answers on multiple choice questions in the context of physiology and biology courses. Previously marked examinations were reviewed for eraser marks that indicated answer changes, and the impact of these changes on exam grades was tabulated. In addition, faculty and students were surveyed for their opinions about changing answers. A plurality of faculty (36%) reported a belief that answer changes usually harm student grades, whereas a slim majority of students (51%) believed that answer changing helped their scores (χ 2 = 60.52, P &lt; 0.0001). Empirically, across two exams, students changed their answer from an incorrect answer to a correct one 2.8 times (SD 2.2) compared with 1.0 time (SD 1.4) changing in the negative direction. Therefore, on average, students benefited ( V = 123.5, P &lt; 0.0001) from answer changing. Furthermore, comparing across two exams in the same course, some students were consistently more likely to change their answers than others (adjusted R 2 = 0.23, P &lt; 0.0001), but the impact of changing answers on the first exam provided no prediction of how much a student would benefit from answer changing on the second exam (adjusted R 2 = −0.004, P = 0.42). These data support the argument that students should be advised to review and revise responses to exam questions before submitting them.",

It is characterized by the interplay between peer teachers and learners who are at a similar academic level. Although it has been shown that peer teachers benefit from participating in PAL, little is known about their perception of motivation and rewards. Here we designed a questionnaire and measured the perception of intrinsic motivation and rewards of peer teachers from three different PAL programs. Overall, peer teachers were highly intrinsically motivated. The reward category Supporting Others was appreciated the most, followed by the reward categories Self-Improvement, Feedback, and Financial. The perception of rewards reflected the features of the three PAL programs. For example, the item “learning the teaching matter themselves” was most valued by peer teachers who were enrolled in a PAL program that deployed their peer teachers primarily to convey knowledge. In contrast, “actively shaping the teaching situation” was appreciated most by peer teachers of the PAL program that enables their peer teachers to conceive their teaching sessions independently. These findings go toward recommendations of the implementation and further development of PAL programs. If PAL programs clearly define their features and aims, they could specifically attract (and select) peer teachers and meet their needs as well as expectations, providing opportunities to gain knowledge and teaching experience. Ultimately, these PAL programs could better support the learners.",

In this study, we investigated undergraduate bioethics students' support of and comfort when learning three controversial bioethics topics: gene editing, abortion, and physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Furthermore, student identity has been shown to influence how students perceive and learn about controversial topics at the intersection of science and society. So, we explored how students' religious affiliation, gender, or political affiliation was associated with their support of and comfort when learning about gene editing, abortion, and PAS. We found that most students entered bioethics with moderated viewpoints on controversial topics but that there were differences in students' tendency to support each topic based on their gender, religion, and political affiliation. We also saw differences in student comfort levels based on identity: women reported lower comfort than men when learning about gene editing, religious students were less comfortable than nonreligious students when learning about abortion and PAS, and nonliberal students were less comfortable than liberal students when learning about abortion. Students cited that the controversy surrounding these topics and a personal hesitancy to discuss them caused discomfort. These findings indicate that identity impacts comfort and support in a way similar to that previously shown in the public. Thus, it may be important for instructors to consider student identity when teaching bioethics topics to maximize student comfort, ultimately encouraging thoughtful consideration and engagement with these topics.",

Trigger films (TFs) are brief (3-10 min) clips that have been used in the West to provoke debate, promote reflection, and assist trainees in dealing with ethical dilemmas. The aim of this study was to determine whether TFs can be used to teach professionalism and ethics to undergraduate medical and nursing students as an innovative and interesting tool and to see whether this results in any changes in knowledge. A 2-h module supported by an introductory PowerPoint presentation and using four TFs on the four pillars of ethics (beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice) was developed and piloted in the foundation course for the new cohort of medical and nursing students. Quantitative, open-ended feedback was taken from learners after module delivery, and knowledge was assessed with a retrospective pre-post questionnaire. The majority of students found TFs an innovative and interesting tool to teach medical ethics.

Each LecturePlus lasted ∼1 h and was conducted with 12-18 students. A LecturePlus session comprised of a lecture followed by small-group problem-solving exercises. The exercises were clinical cases with open-ended short-answer questions. Students were divided into groups of three (triads) for these exercises. A faculty tutor assisted the small groups as needed. Closure was achieved through a discussion moderated by the tutor. Learning outcomes were assessed via the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject scores and compared with those of the preceding academic year. An additional multiple-choice question (MCQ) test was administered before and after the clerkship. The MCQ test showed improvement in knowledge application (P < 0.001, partial eta squared = 0.42).

    "abstract": "Medical graduates are expected to apply scientific principles and explain the processes underlying common and important diseases. Evidence shows that integrated medical curricula, which deliver biomedical science within the context of clinical cases, facilitate student learning in preparation for practice. However, research has also shown that the student's perception of their knowledge can be lower in integrated compared to traditional courses. Thus the development of teaching methods to support both integrated learning and build student confidence in clinical reasoning is a priority. In this study, we describe the use of an audience response system to support active learning in large classes. Sessions, delivered by medical faculty from both academic and clinical backgrounds, were designed to build on the knowledge of the respiratory system in both health and disease through the interpretation of clinical cases. Results showed that student engagement was high throughout the session and students strongly agreed that the application of knowledge to real-life cases was a better way to understand clinical reasoning. Qualitative free text comments revealed that students liked the link between theory and practice and the active, integrated method of learning. In summary, this study describes a relatively simple but highly effective way of delivering integrated medical science teaching, in this case respiratory medicine, to improve student confidence in clinical reasoning. This educational approach was applied within the early years of the curriculum in preparation for teaching within a hospital setting, but the format could be applied across many different settings.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The development of teaching methods that support integrated learning and build student confidence is a priority.

The objective of this study was to evaluate student and faculty satisfaction regarding the construct and delivery of an aligned and integrated curriculum that involved the use of linker clinical cases. We aimed at evaluating the perceptions and performance of students when paper cases were supplemented with a simulated patient (SP) video. This interventional study was conducted by inviting 250 medical students from the first professional phase from the 2020-2021 batch. Integrated modules were prepared for two clinical conditions: myocardial infarction (MI) and nephrotic syndrome (NS). The topic NS was taught with a paper-based case while the topic MI was supplemented with an SP video. Feedback from students and faculty was collected using a newly developed and validated questionnaire and focused group discussions. The students performed significantly better in the assessment conducted after the topic MI compared to NS. The majority of the students (80%) expressed a preference for the video to understand the clinical relevance when compared to the paper case. Overall, the students (83-87%) expressed satisfaction with integrated teaching sessions using clinical cases. Using linker clinical cases in an aligned and integrated preclinical curriculum allowed students to interrelate the subjects and apply them to clinical contexts. The SP videos prepared from an authentic setting facilitated learner engagement with a better understanding of the clinical relevance of the basic sciences.NOTE & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we have introduced linker cases to teach clinical correlation of basic sciences for integrated modules in the competency-based undergraduate medical curriculum.

The term homeostasis is most commonly used to describe how the internal environment of mammalian systems maintains relative constancy. The descriptor \"the internal environment of the organism is actively regulated by the responses of cells, tissues, and organs through feedback systems\" was unpacked by a team of three Australian Physiology educators into 5 themes and 18 subthemes arranged in a hierarchy. Using a five-point Likert scale, the unpacked concept was rated by 24 physiology educators from 24 Australian Universities for level of importance and level of difficulty for students. Survey data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to compare between and within concept themes and subthemes. There were no differences in main themes for level of importance, with all ratings between essential or important. Theme 1: the organism has regulatory mechanisms to maintain a relatively stable internal environment, a process known as homeostasis was almost unanimously rated as essential. Difficulty ratings for unpacked concept themes averaged between slightly difficult and moderately difficult. The Australian team concurred with published literature that there are inconsistencies in the way the critical components of homeostatic systems are represented and interpreted. We aimed to simplify the components of the concept so that undergraduates would be able to easily identify the language used and build on their knowledge.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The homeostasis core concept of physiology was defined and unpacked by an Australian team with the goal of constructing a resource that will improve learning and teaching of this core physiology concept in an Australian Higher Education context.",

Early K-12 science classes often teach students about the foundational discoveries of the field, which have been predominately made, or at least published, by White men. This homogeneity can leave underrepresented individuals in STEMM feeling isolated, and underrepresented K-12 students may feel as though they cannot enter STEMM fields. This study aimed to examine these feelings of inclusivity in STEMM through an interactive workshop that asked middle schoolers to identify scientists from images of individuals with various racial and gender identities. We found that a plurality of students had a positive experience discussing diversity in science and recognizing underrepresented individuals as scientists.",

Computer-assisted education can now use the resources of the World Wide Web to convey the important characteristics of events as elemental as the physical properties of osmotically active particles in the cell and as complex as the nerve action potential or the integrative behavior of the intact organism. We have designed laboratory exercises that introduce first-year medical students to membrane and action potentials, as well as the more complex example of integrative physiology, using the dynamic properties of computer simulations. Two specific examples are presented. The first presents the physical laws that apply to osmotic, chemical, and electrical gradients, leading to the development of the concept of membrane potentials; this module concludes with the simulation of the ability of the sodium-potassium pump to establish chemical gradients and maintain cell volume. The second module simulates the action potential according to the Hodgkin-Huxley model, illustrating the concepts of threshold, inactivation, refractory period, and accommodation. Students can access these resources during the scheduled laboratories or on their own time via our Web site on the Internet (http./(/)phys-main.umsmed.edu) by using the World Wide Web protocol. Accurate version control is possible because one valid, but easily edited, copy of the labs exists at the Web site. A common graphical interface is possible through the use of the Hypertext mark-up language. Platform independence is possible through the logical and arithmetic calculations inherent to graphical browsers and the Javascript computer language. The initial success of this program indicates that medical education can be very effective both by the use of accurate simulations and by the existence of a universally accessible Internet resource.",

It reduced the number of errors that students made in predicting the responses of the cardiovascular system to a perturbation. Also, students who worked in groups had significantly greater improvement than did control students. Using CIRCSIM also significantly reduces the number of relationship errors that the students make.

The slope of the difficulty-to-discrimination relationship was significantly higher in 1992 than in previous years.

A high prevalence of obesity has recently been described at La Réunion Island, a French department in the Indian Ocean. Anthropometry is generally considered as the single most easily obtainable, inexpensive, and noninvasive method that reflects body composition. At the University of La Réunion, a laboratory course involving students was designed to teach anthropometric measurements for the determination of body composition. Using skin fold thickness equations, students determined the fat and total muscular masses of their body composition. The influences of sex and their physical activity or inactivity on these different parameters were compared and interpreted at the end of the course. Positive and significant correlations were established between the students' body mass indexes values and their fat mass percentages and between their fat-free and muscular masses as well. A higher fat mass percentage was found in sedentary students compared with more active ones. Therefore, this laboratory makes the students practice and understand the use of classical techniques to evaluate the body composition of a person. It also alerts them to the correlation between a sedentary attitude and higher body fat content. This laboratory course constitutes an active introduction to a following lesson on more recent and actual techniques used to evaluate body composition.",

Twelve students participated in a monitored lunch and had their blood extracted for analysis 1) before lunch, 2) 30 min after lunch, and 3) 3 h after lunch. The subjects were divided in two groups. One group had a hyperglicidic meal [pasta plus orange juice: 80% carbohydrate, 10% protein, and 10% lipid (estimated values)] and the other group had a hyperlipidic meal (calabresi pizza plus diet soda: 36% carbohydrate, 18% protein, and 46% lipid). Individual quantities of food were based on body mass index, age, and sex. The blood parameters analyzed were glucose, triglycerides (TG), and urea. Glucose remained constant in the three measurements in both groups. The TG concentration in the pasta group was constant before and after lunch but increased significantly during the evening. In the pizza group, TG increased after lunch and remained constant in the evening. Levels of urea increased only in the evening, specially in the pizza group. These results were used for the final biochemistry exam. With the maximum score set as 10, the average score was 6.0 +/- 2.4 (n = 102). We considered this activity a unique way of evaluating important issues on metabolism, because students had several hours to work on the final exam (with free access to a bibliography). It was also a good didactic experience (problem-based learning like) for the subject students, because they had to work in all phases of the experiment (idealization, realization, and analysis) and participated actively in the elaboration and correction of the exam.",

This may be noticed in the following equation: (1) This notion is true for a perfect elastic body. Because the lungs do not present perfect elastic behavior, the relationship among ΔV, compliance, and ΔP is not linear along all the vital capacity range, as showed by Eq. 1.When the respiratory system is subjected to ΔP, time is needed until ΔV occurs, and the time necessary to inflate 63% of its volume is called the time constant (τ) (3). It describes the monoexponencial behavior of the time profile of the simplest model of respiratory system: the single-compartment linear model, which incorporates, in series, two lumped elements–one single compartment of elastance served by a pathway of resistance (2). The one-compartment linear model cannot describe the variations of resistance and elastance associated with the frequency of ventilation, tidal volume, and mean lung volume. These complex mechanical behaviors of the lung reflect many physical properties of the system, including viscoelastic properties, “series” and “parallel” inhomogeneities in the distribution of ventilation, nonlinearities, and plastic behavior. Therefore, to better describe and quantify the respiratory system mechanical profile, more complex models are needed, and, when the respiratory system exhibits parallel inequalities of resistance and compliance, the overall mechanical behavior of the lung cannot be described by a single τ value.One way to calculate τ is to multiply the resistance (R) by the compliance of the respiratory system, according to following equation: (2) The concept of this variable is applied to expiration, because it allows the anticipation of the necessary expiratory time to exhale enough air until the static equilibrium volume of the respiratory system is reached. It means that the greater the value of τ, be it due to resistance and/or compliance, the greater will be the time necessary to reach the static equilibrium volume. This concept is extremely important for the understanding of the mechanical consequences of different diseases related to the respiratory system, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and asthma, as well as a possible cause for ventilation inequality. Below, you will find a quite simple description of the analog two-compartment model arranged “in parallel,” composed by two alveolar units that may have their constant value altered by resistance and compliance manipulation of each unit. This model also allows us to understand the relationship among τ, respiratory rate (RR), auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and dynamic hyperinflation.To build a lung model with two alveolar units, three plastic tubes of the same diameter and length, a plastic piece in Y format (three-way hose connector), two artificial rubber lungs, gauze, a rubber band, and a self-inflating bag for manual mechanical ventilation are necessary. The material necessary and instructions to make the analogical model are shown in Fig. 1.First, it is necessary to demonstrate the model and stress that the two alveolar units have the same τ value. It happens because 1) as the tubes have the same length and diameter, the resistance to the air flow is similar; and 2) the compliance of the artificial lungs is similar too, because the balloons are built with the same material and have the same volume.After the demonstration, the first step of the experiment consists of insufflating the system with a RR of 10 cycles/min, using the inflating bag, and observing that both alveolar units inflate at the same moment because they have the same τ. Afterward, the RR is increased to 20 cycles/min to show that, when the constant value is equal for both units, even with higher RR, the artificial lungs also inflate and deflate in the same time. At the moment τ is equal to both units, both in the low and high RR, both contribute to the total compliance of the system.The second step is to introduce gauze into the tube that feeds one of the artificial lungs. Thus the resistance (and, consequently, the τ of that unit) is greater. Then, inflate the system with 10 cycles/min and observe that, at a low RR, the alveolar units inflate and deflate in different time intervals. In this case, both units still contribute to the compliance of the total system. It occurs because there is enough time for the diseased unit (with greater resistance) to respond. The next step is to increase RR to 20 cycles/min and observe that the diseased unit does not respond to the pressure changes because the τ of that unit is very high. As a result, the lung is less compliant. Besides, with a high RR, there is not time enough for complete exhalation, which results in dynamic hyperinflation and a decrease of total lung compliance. Because by the end of the expiration the lung volume is greater than predicted, that is, lungs do not deflate completely, the alveolar pressure continues to be positive by the end of the exhalation, thus resulting in auto-PEEP.Next, take the gauze from the tube and involve one of the artificial lungs with the rubber band to decrease the compliance of this lung. Repeat the steps described above and compare the compliance with τ. After this demonstration, the gauze should be inserted into one of the tubes, and the artificial lung should be involved in the same side with the rubber band. Repeat the steps described above and compare the compliance and the resisance with τ. The last step of the experiment consists of increasing the resistance of one of the alveolar units and decreasing the compliance of the contralateral artificial lung. Repeat the steps described above and compare the compliance with τ.In summary, we present a simple, low-cost, interesting lung model that permits the understanding of the respiratory system’s τ concept and its relationship with RR, auto-PEEP, and dynamic hyperinflation.

    "abstract": "As the traditional cardiovascular control laboratory has disappeared from the first-year medical school curriculum, we have recognized the need to develop another “hands-on” experience as a vehicle for wide-ranging discussions of cardiovascular control mechanisms. Using an echocardiograph, an automatic blood pressure cuff, and a reclining bicycle, we developed protocols to illustrate the changes in cardiac and vascular function that occur with changes in posture, venous return, and graded exercise. We use medical student volunteers and a professional echocardiographer to generate and acquire data, respectively. In small-group sessions, we developed an interactive approach to discuss the data and to make a large number of calculations from a limited number of measurements. The sequence of cardiac events and cardiac structure in vivo were illustrated with the volunteers lying down, standing, and then with their legs raised passively above the heart to increase venous return. Volunteers were then asked to peddle the bicycle to achieve steady-state heart rates of 110 and 150 beats/min. Data were collected in all these states, and calculations were performed and used as the basis of a small-group discussion to illustrate physiological principles. Information related to a surprisingly large number of cardiovascular control mechanisms was derived, and its relevance to cardiovascular dysfunction was explored. This communication describes our experience in developing a new cardiovascular control laboratory to reinforce didactic material presented in lectures and small-group sessions.",

A hand-held model of a striated muscle sarcomere made from common items has thus been made by us to enhance students' understanding of the sliding filament mechanism as well as their appreciation of the spatial arrangements of the thick and thin filaments. The model proves to be quite efficacious in dispelling some alternative conceptions held by students exposed previously only to two-dimensional textbook illustrations and computer graphic displays. More importantly, after being taught by this hand-held device, electronmicrographic features of the A and I bands, H zone, and Z disk can be easily correlated by the students to the positions of the thick and thin elements relatively sliding past one another. The transverse expansion of the sarcomere and the constancy of its volume upon contraction are also demonstrable by the model.",

    "abstract": "Successful learning of many aspects in physiology depends on a meaningful understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts. Two conceptual diagnostic questions measured student understanding of the chemical equilibrium underlying calcium and phosphate homeostasis. One question assessed the ability to predict the change in phosphate concentration when calcium ions were added to a saturated calcium phosphate solution. Fifty-two percent of the students correctly predicted that the phosphate concentration would decrease in accord with the common ion effect. Forty-two percent of the students predicted that the phosphate concentration would not change. Written explanations showed that most students failed to evoke the idea of competing chemical equilibria. A second question assessed the predicted change in calcium concentration after solid calcium phosphate was added to a saturated solution. Only 11% of the students correctly predicted no change in calcium concentration; 86% of the students predicted an increase, and many based their prediction on a mistaken application of Le Chatelier's principle to heterogeneous equilibria. These results indicate that many students possess misconceptions about chemical equilibrium that may hamper understanding of the processes of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Instructors can help students gain greater understanding of these physiochemical phenomena by adopting strategies that enable students achieve more accurate conceptions of chemical equilibria.",

These approaches have, however, not been investigated during laboratory exercises. In the present study, we compared the impact of solving quizzes individually and in groups with conventional teaching on the immediate learning during a laboratory exercise. We implemented two quizzes in a mandatory 4-h laboratory exercise on baroreflex physiology. A total of 155 second-year medical students were randomized to solve quizzes individually (intervention group I, n = 57), in groups of three to four students (intervention group II, n = 56), or not to perform any quizzes (control; intervention group III, n = 42). After the laboratory exercise, all students completed an individual test, which encompassed two recall questions, two intermediate questions, and two integrated questions. The integrated questions were of moderate and advanced difficulty, respectively. Finally, students completed an evaluation form. Intervention group I reached the highest total test scores and proved best at answering the integrated question of advanced difficulty. Moreover, there was an overall difference between groups for student evaluations of the quality of the teaching, which was highest for intervention group II. In conclusion, solving quizzes individually during a laboratory exercise may enhance learning, whereas solving quizzes in groups is associated with higher student satisfaction.",

To improve the effectiveness and timeliness of student evaluations of faculty in the physiology course, we investigated whether evaluations submitted during the course differed from those submitted after completion of the course. A secure web-based system was developed to collect student evaluations that included numerical rankings (1-5) of faculty performance and a section for comments. The grades that students received in the course were added to the data, which were sorted according to the time of submission of the evaluations and analyzed by Pearson's correlation and Student's t-test. Only 26% of students elected to submit evaluations before completion of the course, and the average faculty ratings of these evaluations were highly correlated [r(14) = 0.91] with the evaluations submitted after completion of the course. Faculty evaluations were also significantly correlated with the previous year [r(14) = 0.88]. Concurrent evaluators provided more comments that were statistically longer and subjectively scored as more \"substantive.\" Students who submitted their evaluations during the course and who included comments had significantly higher final grades in the course. In conclusion, the numeric ratings that faculty received were not influenced by the timing of student evaluations. However, students who submitted early evaluations tended to be more engaged as evidenced by their more substantive comments and their better performance on exams. The consistency of faculty evaluations from year to year and concurrent versus at the end of the course suggest that faculty tend not to make significant adjustments to student evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Web-based hypermedia learning environments are widely used in modern education and seem particularly well suited for interdisciplinary learning. Previous work has identified guidance through these complex environments as a crucial problem of their acceptance and efficiency. We reasoned that map-based navigation might provide straightforward and effortless orientation. To achieve this, we developed a clickable and user-oriented concept map-based navigation plugin. This tool is implemented as an extension of Moodle, a widely used learning management system. It visualizes inner and interdisciplinary relations between learning objects and is generated dynamically depending on user set parameters and interactions. This plugin leaves the choice of navigation type to the user and supports direct guidance. Previously developed and evaluated face-to-face interdisciplinary learning materials bridging physiology and physics courses of a medical curriculum were integrated as learning objects, the relations of which were defined by metadata. Learning objects included text pages, self-assessments, videos, animations, and simulations. In a field study, we analyzed the effects of this learning environment on physiology and physics knowledge as well as the transfer ability of third-term medical students. Data were generated from pre- and posttest questionnaires and from tracking student navigation. Use of the hypermedia environment resulted in a significant increase of knowledge and transfer capability. Furthermore, the efficiency of learning was enhanced. We conclude that hypermedia environments based on Moodle and enriched by concept map-based navigation tools can significantly support interdisciplinary learning. Implementation of adaptivity may further strengthen this approach.",

The results showed that 108 students (85%) believed that their absence from different academic activities could affect their performance. Students perceived lectures as the most valuable academic activity (90.7%), whereas seminars presented by students were perceived as the least important activity (18.5%). There was a significant correlation between lectures attendance and their performance in examinations (P = 0.008). Ninety percent of the students thought that teacher involvement in tutorials was essential and that lectures were useful to understand certain topics.

Semistructured interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and a formal thematic analysis was applied. A total of 16 in-depth interviews were conducted, with 8 female and 8 male participants. Thematic analysis revealed four major interacting themes that we propose to converge to account for nonparticipation in quizzes: 1) inadequate feedback, 2) curriculum organization and student mistrust, 3) time constraints, and 4) fear of judgment. We propose seven practice points to improve the effectiveness of formative assessment quizzes of medical knowledge.",

However, due to various limitations, small-group student presentations in the classroom may not reach their full potential for student learning. To address challenges with presentations in the classroom, we redesigned the assignment by having students present and discuss online using VoiceThread, a cloud-based presentation and discussion tool. First-year students pursuing a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree were assigned into small groups to present physiology content and to discuss that content online. This assignment was similar to traditional student classroom presentations, with the exception that the entire assignment was conducted online. The primary purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the impact of the online format on the discussion quality. Another purpose of the study was to examine students’ perceptions of using VoiceThread for presenting and learning, as well as the online interactions between the presenter and audience. Students posted a higher number of questions and comments than required by the assignment. The questions from students were also higher level questions, and the answers to these questions were more thorough compared with what we had previously observed in classroom presentations. The survey results showed that students preferred using VoiceThread for presenting, learning from other presentations, and discussing presentation content over performing this process in the classroom. Preliminary findings suggested that having dental students make presentations and hold discussions online might help address the challenges of student presentations in the classroom.",

We integrated an IPE exercise into a graduate-level human physiology course at our health sciences center that enrolled physician assistant (PA), physical therapy (PT), and graduate studies students. Our activity adopted and targeted the four Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) competency domains of values/ethics (VE), roles/responsibilities, interprofessional communication, and teams and teamwork (TT). Effectiveness of the training exercise was determined via pre- and postsurveys, which assessed student self-perceptions of IPEC competency domains, as well as student reflections and evaluations of the exercise itself. We noted a significant improvement in each of the targeted IPEC subcompetencies among all of the students, and within both PT and PA groups when analyzed separately. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the number of previous IPE experiences and presurvey IPEC VE and TT subcompetency ratings. Our discoveries provide an example of broad acquisition of IPE learning within the context of a physiology curriculum. Perhaps more importantly, our findings indicate that a history of IPE training sets the stage for future IPE learning, reflecting a potential for IPE to transform basic physiological principles into team-based practice and improvement in patient outcomes.",

The goal was to evaluate whether the number of options (possible answers) per question influenced the effectiveness of this assessment. Three exams (each with three versions) were given to each of two sections during an academic quarter. All versions were equally long, with 30 questions: 10 questions with 3 options, 10 questions with 4, and 10 questions with 5 (always one correct answer plus distractors). Each question appeared in all three versions of an exam, with a different number of options in each version (three, four, or five). Discrimination (point biserial and upper-lower discrimination indexes) and difficulty were evaluated for each question. There was a small increase in difficulty (a lower average score on a question) when more options were provided. The upper-lower discrimination index indicated a small improvement in assessment of student learning with more options, although the point biserial did not. The total length of a question (number of words) was associated with a small increase in discrimination and difficulty, independent of the number of options. Quantitative questions were more likely to show an increase in discrimination with more options than nonquantitative questions, but this effect was very small. Therefore, for these testing conditions, there appears to be little advantage in providing more than three options per multiple-choice question, and there are disadvantages, such as needing more time for an exam.",

    "abstract": "Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBL on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map, and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology, were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning, analytic, and problem-solving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures.",

Ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis is used to remove abnormal liquid; however, it requires technical expertise. In veterinary medical education, the opportunity to teach this procedure to save lives during emergencies is rare; therefore, simulators are recommended for this practice. The present study aimed to create a model that can be made \"at home\" at low cost for ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis training and to gather feedback about this model through questionnaires given to the participants. Eighteen professionals and thirty-six students were introduced to the simulator in pairs. After the simulation training session, participants filled out the questionnaire. Participants considered the model strong in the following areas: visualization of the pericardium, the heart, fluid in the pericardium, and fluid decrease during fictitious pericardiocentesis and its realism. They considered the model weak or moderate in the following areas: visualization of the surrounding tissues, difficulty of pericardial puncture, and visualization of the catheter. The professionals classified the realism of the experimental heart as moderate, whereas the undergraduate students classified it as strong. All participants believed that the experimental model could be useful in preparing for a future real situation. This model fulfills the need for a practical, realistic, and cost-effective model for ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis training.",

    "abstract": "This laboratory activity is designed to teach students how to measure forearm muscle blood flow (FBF) to describe the mechanisms of peripheral blood flow thermal regulation in healthy subjects. The cold pressor test (CPT) is the clinical procedure used in the experiment to induce arterial vasoconstriction. Strain-gauge plethysmography is applied on the patient's forearm to noninvasive monitor vasoconstriction effects on local blood perfusion and physiological parameters such as blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Patients with an altered peripheral vascular resistance (e.g., in hypertension) have different responses to the CPT from healthy subjects. To date, experimental evidence remains unexplained, as we do not know if the BP and HR increase is caused by a decrease in flow rate or an increase in peripheral vascular resistance during the test. To clarify this situation, we have to quantify the parameter we assume is being conditioned by the regulatory physiological intervention, i.e., peripheral vascular resistance. Peripheral vascular resistance quantification can be calculated as the ratio between muscle flow and mean arterial pressure. Students will learn how to apply the instrumental procedure to collect and analyze data before, during, and after the CPT and to describe the physiological responses of the peripheral vascular system to external stressors. They will also learn how to distinguish healthy from pathological responses on the basis of how sympathetic nervous system reactions influence the biomechanics of peripheral vessels.",

    "abstract": "The membrane potential, arising from uneven distribution of ions across cell membranes containing selectively permeable ion channels, is of fundamental importance to cell signaling. The necessity of maintaining the membrane potential may be appreciated by expressing Ohm's law as current = voltage/resistance and recognizing that no current flows when voltage = 0, i.e., transmembrane voltage gradients, created by uneven transmembrane ion concentrations, are an absolute requirement for the generation of currents that precipitate the action and synaptic potentials that consume >80% of the brain's energy budget and underlie the electrical activity that defines brain function. The concept of the equilibrium potential is vital to understanding the origins of the membrane potential. The equilibrium potential defines a potential at which there is no net transmembrane ion flux, where the work created by the concentration gradient is balanced by the transmembrane voltage difference, and derives from a relationship describing the work done by the diffusion of ions down a concentration gradient. The Nernst equation predicts the equilibrium potential and, as such, is fundamental to understanding the interplay between transmembrane ion concentrations and equilibrium potentials. Logarithmic transformation of the ratio of internal and external ion concentrations lies at the heart of the Nernst equation, but most undergraduate neuroscience students have little understanding of the logarithmic function. To compound this, no current undergraduate neuroscience textbooks describe the effect of logarithmic transformation in appreciable detail, leaving the majority of students with little insight into how ion concentrations determine, or how ion perturbations alter, the membrane potential.",

Do you need collaborators to help with ideas for educational research or to expand your research populations? The American Physiological Society (APS) Teaching Section has developed a biennial Institute on Teaching and Learning (ITL) through the APS Conference Program to address these issues. The first institute was held in June 2014, and the second institute was held in June 2016. A Physiology Education Community of Practice (PECOP) was created to help connect the institute participants and other physiology educators and to share evidence-based teaching in physiology at all education levels. The 2018 APS ITL will be the next meeting to learn best practices, to share ideas with colleagues, and to find collaborators in improving the teaching of physiology for students. The meeting will include workshops modeling best practices, plenary talks about hot new issues in physiology and science education, and poster sessions and informal meals to discuss interests with colleagues. Even if one's primary responsibility is bench research or administration, the training from the institute will improve efficiency and effectiveness when teaching. The two prior ITLs (2014 and 2016) were highly evaluated by educators of both undergraduate and professional students who spent a week together emphasizing improvement in their teaching. This paper reports the outcomes of the 2016 ITL and encourages participation in the upcoming ITL in Madison, WI, June 18-22, 2018.

    "abstract": "The basis for understanding neurophysiology is understanding ion movement across cell membranes. Students in introductory courses recognize ion concentration gradients as a driving force for ion movement but struggle to simultaneously account for electrical charge gradients. We developed a 17-multiple-choice item assessment of students' understanding of electrochemical gradients and resistance in neurophysiology, the Electrochemical Gradients Assessment Device (EGAD). We investigated the internal evidence validity of the assessment by analyzing item characteristic curves of score probability and student ability for each question, and a Wright map of student scores and ability. We used linear mixed-effect regression to test student performance and ability. Our assessment discriminated students with average ability (weighted likelihood estimate: -2 to 1.5 Θ); however, it was not as effective at discriminating students at the highest ability (weighted likelihood estimate: >2 Θ). We determined the assessment could capture changes in both assessment scores (model r2 = 0.51, P < 0.001, n = 444) and ability estimates (model r2 = 0.47, P < 0.001, n = 444) after a simulation-based laboratory and course instruction for 222 students. Differential item function analysis determined that each item on the assessment performed equitably for all students, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, or economic status. Overall, we found that men scored higher (r2 = 0.51, P = 0.014, n = 444) and had higher ability scores (P = 0.003) on the EGAD assessment. Caucasian students of both genders were positively correlated with score (r2 = 0.51, P < 0.001, n = 444) and ability (r2 = 0.47, P < 0.001, n = 444). Based on the evidence gathered through our analyses, the scores obtained from the EGAD can distinguish between levels of content knowledge on neurophysiology principles for students in introductory physiology courses.",

Innovative technology-based modalities are being evaluated to complement limited hospital rotations. We determined the effectiveness of clinical skills-related audiovisual (AV) aids embedded in electronic-problem-based learning (PBL) sessions, in terms of students' feedback and formative Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) grades. This mixed-method study was conducted during the Cardiovascular System module in year 3 of the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery program. The AV aids, mainly consisting of abnormal chest auscultation sounds, were linked to the cases for the intervention group. The control group received only a description of clinical signs. Sessions were conducted using an intranet platform. At the end of the module, feedback was obtained from intervention group students and faculty using a self-administered questionnaire. The learning was compared between intervention and control groups through an OSCE. Finally, focus group interviews were conducted to explore factors underlying deviation from the expected results. Out of 110 intervention group students, 86 (78%) responded. The students appreciated the inclusion of AV aids, as suggested by a high average satisfaction score of 4.2 (SD 0.8). They agreed that, apart from being appropriate and relevant, the aids improved the learning environment and engagement in the process. The tutors also gave a similar feedback. However, no difference in the OSCE scores was found between control and intervention groups. The study indicates that inclusion of AV aids improved students' engagement and classroom environment in electronic-PBL sessions, but did not improve diagnostic abilities based on the learned clinical skills.",

Recognizing this, government and industry representatives, along with students and their families, are encouraging universities and colleges to focus more on developing transferable skills to maximize employability of their graduates. In response, academic institutions and professional organizations have begun to develop lists of transferable professional skills that they expect students to have acquired on graduation. At the 2018 Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG) meeting, participants stated that there was a need to define a list of professional skills for undergraduates completing a physiology major. To this end, a professional skills committee was established. Initially members of the committee worked together to develop a draft list of skills. An iterative process of refining the list was then undertaken through presentations/small-group discussions at appropriate international meetings and via an online survey. Over 60 physiology educators, the majority of whom teach in undergraduate programs, provided input. The final list (presented here) consists of 13 skills grouped in four broad categories: think critically, communicate effectively, behave in a socially and scientifically responsible manner, and demonstrate laboratory proficiency. It is anticipated that the list will be used for curriculum mapping and to guide the development of new physiology courses and major programs. The professional skills committee now plans to develop rubrics and tools that will allow for the assessment of these skills.",

    "abstract": "A concept of major importance in human electrophysiology studies is the process by which activation of an excitable cell results in a rapid rise and fall of the electrical membrane potential, the so-called action potential. Hodgkin and Huxley proposed a model to explain the ionic mechanisms underlying the formation of action potentials. However, this model is unsuitably complex for teaching purposes. In addition, the Hodgkin and Huxley approach describes the shape of the action potential only in terms of ionic currents, i.e., it is unable to explain the electrical significance of the action potential or describe the electrical field arising from this source using basic concepts of electromagnetic theory. The goal of the present report was to propose a new model to describe the electrical behaviour of the action potential in terms of elementary electrical sources (in particular, dipoles). The efficacy of this model was tested through a closed-book written exam. The proposed model increased the ability of students to appreciate the distributed character of the action potential and also to recognize that this source spreads out along the fiber as function of space. In addition, the new approach allowed students to realize that the amplitude and sign of the extracellular electrical potential arising from the action potential are determined by the spatial derivative of this intracellular source. The proposed model, which incorporates intuitive graphical representations, has improved students' understanding of the electrical potentials generated by bioelectrical sources and has heightened their interest in bioelectricity.",

Exercise science faculty members developed a course related to exercise as a therapeutic tool and options available for weight loss. The purpose of the present study was to investigate student views of weight management and obesity, which can be a difficult task using traditional methods such as Likert scale surveys. To investigate student views relative to the course content, Q methodology, which is a mixed-method research approach, was used at the beginning and end of the course. Students completed a Q sort, ranking 44 statements related to obesity in accordance to their own points of view. The pretest/posttest design enabled an opportunity to determine if course goals were accomplished and if student perceptions related to obesity were transformed. Factor analysis of precourse sorts revealed that students possessed a naïve singular view of weight-related concepts. Analysis of sorts at course completion resulted in a two-factor solution revealing changes in perspective; some students took on a health professional type of view, whereas others demonstrated antifat views. In conclusion, the findings revealed key variables that should be addressed in curricula involving therapeutic obesity interventions. An improved curriculum based on these results should better encourage students to develop a broad comprehension of multifactorial causes and treatment for weight management and obesity. Implementing the use of Q methodology may serve as a valuable asset to measure and evaluate subjectivity of obesity discrimination. Antifat attitudes among exercise science students may influence future clients' potential achievements.",

In both semesters, HA and LA means for all inputs were different (all P < 0.001). Nineteen students moved from the HA1 group into the LA2 group, whereas 68 students moved from the LA1 group into the HA2 group. The overall order of importance of inputs that determined group membership was different in semester 1 compared with semester 2; in addition, the within-cluster order of importance in LA groups was different compared with HA groups. This method of analysis may 1) identify students who need extra instruction, 2) identify which assessment is more effective in discriminating between HA and LA students, and 3) provide quantitative evidence to track student achievement.",

    "abstract": "In biology and physiology courses, students face many difficulties when learning to explain mechanisms, a topic that is demanding due to the immense complexity and abstract nature of molecular and cellular mechanisms. To overcome these difficulties, we asked the following question: how does an instructor transform their understanding of biological mechanisms and other difficult-to-learn topics so that students can comprehend them? To address this question, we first reviewed a model of the components used by biologists to explain molecular and cellular mechanisms: the MACH model, with the components of methods (M), analogies (A), context (C), and how (H). Next, instructional materials were developed and the teaching activities were piloted with a physical MACH model. Students who used the MACH model to guide their explanations of mechanisms exhibited both improvements and some new difficulties. Third, a series of design-based research cycles was applied to bring the activities with an improved physical MACH model into biology and biochemistry courses. Finally, a useful rubric was developed to address prevalent student difficulties. Here, we present, for physiology and biology instructors, the knowledge and resources for explaining molecular and cellular mechanisms in undergraduate courses with an instructional design process aimed at realizing pedagogical content knowledge for teaching. Our four-stage process could be adapted to advance instruction with a range of models in the life sciences.",

    "abstract": "Learning about statistics is a lot like learning about science: the learning is more meaningful if you can actively explore. This eleventh installment of Explorations in Statistics explores statistical facets of reproducibility. If we obtain an experimental result that is scientifically meaningful and statistically unusual, we would like to know that our result reflects a general biological phenomenon that another researcher could reproduce if (s)he repeated our experiment. But more often than not, we may learn this researcher cannot replicate our result. The National Institutes of Health and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology have created training modules and outlined strategies to help improve the reproducibility of research. These particular approaches are necessary, but they are not sufficient. The principles of hypothesis testing and estimation are inherent to the notion of reproducibility in science. If we want to improve the reproducibility of our research, then we need to rethink how we apply fundamental concepts of statistics to our science.",

The aim of this study was to obtain medical students' perceptions toward effectiveness of integrated clinical skills sessions by using different simulation adjuncts and to know the challenges/obstacles encountered toward the implementation of such sessions. A study was conducted to obtain anonymous feedback from male (n = 156) and female (n = 179) medical students in years 2 and 3 during the 2014-2015 academic sessions at Alfaisal University about their perceptions of the effectiveness of integrated clinical skills sessions, uses of simulation adjuncts, and obstacles encountered toward the effective implementation of such sessions. The response rate was 93.4. Factor analysis showed data being valid and reliable. Cronbach's α-values for effectiveness of sessions, use of simulation adjunct, and obstacles encountered were 0.97, 0.95, and 0.95, respectively. We conclude that students perceived positively the effectiveness of integrated clinical skills sessions as well as the use of simulation adjuncts, especially SPs. They suggested overcoming the obstacles and limitations of simulation. They highly valued the role of the facilitators in achieving effective sessions.",

Survey data (n = 375) were collected from the medical students from one of the largest medical schools in Southern China during the spring semester of 2020. First, exploratory factor analysis demonstrated that there were three latent factors behind online teaching strategies, including teacher-led instructional strategies, supervised and monitored learning strategies, and self-directed learning strategies. Instructional activities under teacher supervision and monitoring received the highest rating while teacher-led strategies received the lowest ratings. Second, the popularity of the three online instructional strategies we have identified was positively associated with students' perceived effectiveness of online teaching and their self-reported academic performance. Third, analysis of the quantified answers to the open-ended question reported a positive association between the perceived difficulty level of the courses and students' preference of teacher-led strategies. It also manifested a positive correlation between perceived effectiveness level of the online teaching and the use of self-directed learning strategies before their online lectures.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a strong driver for moving more teaching and learning activities online. Border restrictions have had a severe impact on international students either hoping to enroll in courses offered in Australia or continue with such courses if they are already enrolled. The online learning experience is likely different between students onshore and offshore. This study took a unique opportunity to investigate any such differences in students' attitudes toward remote learning, necessitated by the pandemic, by comparing two cohorts of students, Australia versus China based. An anonymous survey using the Likert Scale and open-ended questions was available for student feedback on subject delivery. The students based in Australia expressed a preference for remote learning due to the convenience of attendance and availability of the video recordings. However, students in China had a strong preference for face-to-face sessions, with the lack of prior experience in an English-speaking learning environment and hesitance to speak with the lecturers and engage in the learning activities possible reasons for this. In quizzes, students in Australia performed better than those in China regardless of local or international student status. This difference may be due to the Australian-based students' prior experience of English-speaking environments and open-book quizzes. In conclusion, remote learning in a familiar language and learning environment is accepted by students, whereas if the teaching is delivered in a second language using unfamiliar teaching methods, remote learning will require additional scaffolding to enhance their learning experience.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cardiac conduction system (CCS) is a multifaceted continuum of electrically distinct, interconnected constructs within the myocardial mass. The key components are the sinus node (SAN), the atrioventricular node (AVN), the His bundle (HB), and the Purkinje fiber network (PF), the latter serendipitously discovered by Jan Evangelista Purkinje in 1839 in the sheep ventricle. In 1893, Wilhelm His, Jr. described a ventricular muscular tract conveying SAN-generated action potentials from the AVN (discovered by Sunao Tawara and Karl Albert Aschoff in 1906) to the PF. In 1906, Keith and Flack completed these explorations by localizing the SAN, the primum movens of CCS, which functions as a biologic oscillator emitting cadenced impulses that travel via the Bachmann bundle to the atrial myocytes and, via internodal pathways, to the AVN. Here these impulses are briefly delayed, enabling atrial systole before continuing via the AVN and the high-speed His-Purkinje conduction axis to signal ventricular contraction. The CCS canonical discoverers (Keith and Flack, Aschoff and Tawara, His, and Purkinje), historical controversies, fundamental notions of anatomy, physiology, and pathology, and therapeutic interventions pertaining to the CCS are the main themes of this review. Any scientist mentioned or unmentioned in this report who contributed directly or indirectly, with correct or inaccurate hypotheses, to the characterization of the CCS deserves our deepest gratitude for the long and painstaking hours spent microscopically scrutinizing heart specimens from multiple mammalian species, including humans.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This report presents the first comprehensive summary of the factors enabling the discovery of the cardiac conduction system (CCS). Biographical highlights and achievements of the CCS canonical discoverers, hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying sinus node (SAN) automaticity, use of eponyms to denominate a discovery, famous controversies, possible reproachable behavior (e.g., intellectual support for eugenics in post-World War I Germany) by two of the discoverers, and examples of historical mentor-pupil relationships are discussed.",

Physiology unites multiple disciplines to explain the mechanisms whereby a risk factor is associated with disease. Race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Minority Stress Theory attempts to explain the association of identity variables in sex and gender minority (SGM) and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) populations with CVD. However, instruction on how to effectively incorporate the ways that social determinants of health are linked to disease outcomes in marginalized populations, such as the SGM and BIPOC communities, is needed. We investigated the efficacy of teaching Minority Stress Theory concepts in a single lecture in an upper-level cardiovascular pathophysiology course (N=44 students). To test students' understanding of minority-related disease, we used both subjective and objective measures to evaluate student understanding before and after the lecture. Student self-assessment of understanding of health disparity physiological mechanisms and lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to reduce health disparities in SGM communities increased post-intervention. We observed similar results of self-assessment of understanding of health disparity physiological mechanisms and appropriate lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions to reduce health disparities regarding the BIPOC community. Our findings suggest that integrating social determinants of health into pathophysiology courses may result in a more inclusive-minded scientific and medical workforce.",

Student and marker performances are then subject to end-of-session board of examiner handling and analysis. This occurs annually and is the basis for evaluating students, but also the wider learning and teaching efficiency of an academic institution. However, this scrutiny may not be standardized, and may differ between institutions and between different study programs and boards of examiners inside the same institution, as well as between sessions. This article aims to suggest a framework for this scrutiny, with provided examples, recommendations and suggested practices to establish an approach that quantitatively and with statistical methods analyses performance of both students and markers in a standardized, unified and transparent manner and that may be employed across subjects and disciplines. The basis for this is accepted and rigorous suitable statistical methods that enable a comparison whereby performance of the student and the associated marking of the student's coursework and examinations in any given course are compared to the same student's performance in comparator courses, which thus establishes if student or marking performance is comparable to the norm established by and for that student. This measures accuracy, reliability and consistency of the marking process. The benefit of this is that it identifies strengths and weaknesses in assessment and examination practice, provides evidence to inform decision-making, tracks progress over time, and establishes institutional standards that thereby provide accountability. This establishes good practice to the process of assessment and examination.",

During lectures and both theoretical and practical sessions, the students read, analyse, and discuss the fundamentals of Randle cycle. They focus on how metabolism is regulated in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver at a molecular level under various metabolic conditions. Subsequently, students perform one of four different trials: 1) overnight fast followed by ingestion of jelly sandwiches and lemonade ad libitum; 2) overnight fast followed by ingestion of a chocolate bar and a soda; 3) overnight fast followed by ingestion of carrots and 4) light fast and aerobic exercise for 2 hours, while monitoring glucose- and fatty acid levels. The data from these trials clearly show that glucose levels are kept constant around 5 mM while fatty acid levels raise to 300-700 mM, after an overnight fast. Upon carbohydrate intake, glucose levels increase whereas fatty acid levels are reduced. In response to aerobic exercise, the glucose level is kept constant at 5 mM, while fatty acids levels increase over time. Collectively, the data clearly recapitulates the essence of Randle cycle. The exercise shows the great pedagogical value of experiments within practical courses to help students gain knowledge of energy metabolism and regulation of biochemical pathways. In an active learning environment, students successfully tackled physiological assignments, enhancing constructive communication and collaboration among peers.",

Gen Z individuals display unique characteristics in terms of thinking, personality, lifestyle, and learning preferences compared to preceding generations, necessitating adaptations in teaching methodologies within nursing schools. This study explores the effectiveness of the Jigsaw Technique (JST) in engaging first-year undergraduate nursing students in learning process. Four topics (modules): Cardiovascular system (Module 1), Respiratory system (Module 2), Endocrine system (Module 3) and Central nervous system (Module 4) were selected. Module 1 and 2 were taught by JST to Group I (Jigsaw group) and by conventional didactic lectures to Group II (Lecture group). The groups alternated teaching methods for the remaining modules. Scores in pre, post and retention tests were higher in Group I than in Group II. The results were statistically highly significant (p=0.000) for modules 1,2 and 4 and not significant (p=0.411) for module 3. Analysis of student feedback revealed that 63% of students liked JST. 71% responded that this is an interesting way of learning the topic, helped them in improving their communication skills and improved interaction with their peers. 77% found that JST helped them understand the topic easily. 69% want this technique should be used for teaching other physiological concepts and for other undergraduate subjects as well. The study concludes that using and integrating this student-centric teaching method into Gen Z nursing education holds promise for building a foundation of robust knowledge and developing essential personality skills crucial for future nursing professionals.",

Due to the volume of content delivered across multiple courses, student cognitive abilities can be affected, leading to lower student performance. In physiology and related biological sciences, educators have turned to delivering content using virtual teaching technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, simulations, and other immersive platforms. At the University of South Australia, Articulate Storyline, Unity-based simulations, and immersive software platforms have been implemented across the entire Laboratory Medicine program to assist students in learning lecture and laboratory content. The impact of these individual interventions is outlined in this manuscript. In addition, the final year 2024 cohort is the first group who have used simulations throughout their degree. Evidence of the benefits and impact of the scaffolded implementation of simulations and immersive software was obtained through a Likert-style questionnaire. The deployment of simulations and immersive software across the degree has significantly enhanced student learning, and engagement with the content effectively bridging the gap between understanding lecture and laboratory content of students in the Laboratory Medicine program. We suggest that a similar approach could readily be embedded within individual courses as well as across science programs to provide the same benefits to student learning.",

Three physiology instructors collaborated on Zoom to create six DramaZoom videos (Dramatization via Zoom) focused on hormone signaling with negative feedback in different contexts. In these DramaZoom videos, each instructor personalizes a different part of an organ system or a physiological process which allows the visualization of complex concepts in endocrinology. DramaZoom videos utilize theater, personification, and humor to represent physiological processes in a fun and creative way that facilitates students to learn and remember the content. Our goal was to introduce DramaZoom videos as an original teaching tool, and present evidence of its efficacy on student learning. We analyzed the impact of DramaZoom videos on students' knowledge acquisition at three distinct levels (1st-year Medical Students, 3 rd -4 th year Undergraduate Science Students, and 1st-year Undergraduate Nursing students) and investigated whether the mode of delivery of the DramaZoom videos (face-to-face during regular classroom teaching, or asynchronous in a virtual classroom) affected student learning. Our data show that knowledge in all three student groups improved significantly after viewing DramaZoom videos independently of the mode of delivery. In conclusion, our data indicates that DramaZoom videos combined with memory activation due to the pre-test are an effective tool to instruct this cohort of students regardless of the level and delivery mode.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the implementation of alternative grading (AG) strategies in an upper-division Kinesiology and Functional Human Anatomy course. Traditional point-based grading systems can negatively impact student mental health, decrease intrinsic motivation, and hinder learning. To address these issues, a proficiency-based grading approach was adopted, emphasizing clearly defined standards, growth-oriented feedback, progress-indicating marks, and penalty-free reassessment opportunities. Course assessments included weekly write-ups, movement analyses, and practical examinations, with flexible submission timelines and revision opportunities. Student feedback through micro-assessment revealed reduced stress levels, improved time management across courses, and deeper engagement with course material. While implementation challenges existed, particularly around the initial faculty workload, the approach demonstrated significant learning gains while supporting student wellbeing. Our experience suggests that alternative grading strategies can maintain academic rigor while creating a more supportive and effective learning environment in science education.",

    "abstract": "The Homeostasis Concept Inventory (HCI) is a validated instrument for measuring students' knowledge of homeostasis. It is comprised of 20 multiple-choice questions covering key components of the previously validated Homeostasis Conceptual Framework (HCF). In this paper we present the first multi-institutional study of the impact of physiology instruction on students' HCI performance. Five cohorts of physiology or anatomy &amp; physiology (A&amp;P) students at four academic institutions took the HCI both at the start of their academic term (pre-test) and at the end of their term (post-test). Statistically significant but relatively modest improvements in overall scores were seen from pre-test to post-test. Among the 20 questions, eight questions had incorrect choices identified as “attractive distractors” on the pre-test, meaning that they were chosen at higher-than-random frequencies. From pre-test to post-test, there were only modest declines in selections of incorrect answers generally and of attractive distractors in particular. Three attractive distractors that all target one specific misconception -- that homeostatic mechanisms are active only when a regulated variable is not at its setpoint -- remained persistently attractive except for students of one instructor who directly addressed that misconception in lecture. These data are sobering in that they show a limited impact of instruction on HCI performance. However, these data also include encouraging evidence that instructional targeting of a specific misconception may help students overcome that misconception.",

AI-generated writing is almost indistinguishable from human-derived work. Instructors must rely on intuition/experience and, recently, assistance from online AI detectors to distinguish between student- and AI-written material. Here, we tested the veracity of AI detectors for writing samples from a fact-heavy, lower-division undergraduate anatomy and physiology course. Student participants (n=190) completed three parts: a hand-written essay answering a prompt on the structure/function of the plasma membrane, creating an AI-generated answer to the same prompt, and a survey seeking participants' views on the quality of each essay as well as general AI use. Randomly selected (n=50) participant-written and AI-generated essays were blindly uploaded onto four AI detectors; a separate and unique group of randomly selected essays (n=48) was provided to human raters (n=9) for classification assessment. For the majority of essays, human raters and the best-performing AI detectors (n=3) similarly identified their correct origin (84-95 and 93-98%, respectively) (p&gt;0.05). Approximately, 1.3 and 5.0 % of essays were detected as false-positives (human writing incorrectly labeled as AI) by AI detectors and human raters, respectively. Surveys generally indicated that students viewed the AI-generated work as better than their own (p&lt;0.01). Using AI detectors in aggregate reduced the likelihood of detecting a false-positive to ~0%, and was tested using human rater-labeled false-positives. Taken together, our findings show that AI detectors, when used together, become a powerful tool to inform instructors.",

This experiential learning activity explored the physiological and emotional responses to exercise with additional mass. Further, this experience sought to address weight bias among EXSS students by promoting a deeper understanding of the difficulties faced by individuals with excess body weight during exercise. Twelve students enrolled in an Exercise for Special Populations course participated in treadmill walking and cycling exercise with and without 15% additional body mass. During exercise, the effect of additional mass on cardiometabolic (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, VO 2 , caloric expenditure) and psychological (e.g., perceived exertion, affective response) measures were evaluated. Before the experiential activity, students engaged in a lecture reviewing preparticipation screening, body composition assessment, and exercise testing procedures. Students reported significant differences in physiological and affective responses to exercise between the two modalities, with treadmill walking with additional mass showing increased exertion. Interestingly, student predictions of psychological responses to walking with additional mass were less negative than their actual experiences, highlighting the difficulty of exercising with additional body mass. Post-activity feedback indicated that students felt highly confident in administering exercise tests and reported enhanced awareness of the challenges faced by overweight individuals. These observations support that incorporating practical activities involving altered body weight can improve practical skills and foster greater empathy towards overweight populations, enhancing student preparedness for careers in allied health fields.",

Data from an anonymous survey revealed that over 50% of students employed AI tools, primarily for idea generation and initial drafting, instead of using these tools as a source of text they would use in the assignments without editing or attribution. Reasons for use showed differences between native English speakers, their non-native speaking classmates, and their classmates attending the PRC campus. Across the cohorts, there was a measured engagement with AI tools when preparing assignments. Notably, all cohorts declared a greater willingness to use such tools if institutional licenses were made available. Most students believed that they would use AI in their future professional roles and that their institutions should be providing guidance on the proper use of AI tools. At the Australian campus, sanctioning the use of AI in preparing the class assignment was not associated with any change in the average assignment marks from those gained by a cohort from the previous year where no sanction was in place. At the same time, there was a significant improvement in the average mark for the PRC students, which was associated with the same sanction.",

    "abstract": "Student-instructor relationships play a crucial role in academic engagement and success, yet large lecture courses often limit direct interaction. This study investigated whether a brief, early-semester meeting with the instructor could enhance student engagement and academic performance. Students ( n T = 423) in a large introductory physiology course were offered a five-minute, one-on-one meeting with the instructor, with a majority of students ( n M = 323) completing the meeting. Students ( n R = 336) completed a mid-semester survey assessed engagement behaviors and self-reported letter grades at midterm. Students who completed the survey and participated in the meeting ( n RM = 285) reported higher letter grades at midterm compared to those who did not (Table 2, p = 0.02). These findings correlated with a moderate effect size (Cramér’s V = 0.18). Similarly, an analysis of actual midterm grades between students who completed the meeting and those who did not revealed a moderate to strong effect size (Cramér’s V = 0.33). While meeting participation did not significantly impact question-asking behavior during class, students reported feeling more comfortable seeking help in-person, during class, and via email. Thematic analysis revealed two major themes: Student Motivation and Intentions for Engaging with the Professor and Relationship-Building and Perceptions of the Professor. Many students initially attended for extrinsic reasons (e.g., extra credit) but later expressed increased comfort with the instructor, reinforcing their willingness to engage in class. These findings suggest that structured, low-stakes interactions may improve student-instructor relationships, even in large lecture courses. Future research should explore the long-term impact of such meetings on student success and retention.",

    "abstract": "Reflective writing is widely used in health sciences education, but overreliance on GenAI could undermine the reflective writing process. To explore this concern, students in three undergraduate courses with reflective writing assignments and policies permitting GenAI use were asked to retrospectively and anonymously self-report their GenAI-related behaviors and attitudes. Only 33% of respondents (n=310) reported ever using GenAI on a reflective writing assignment. Among GenAI users, 81% reported that usage was motivated by learning, efficiency, and/or (to a significantly lesser extent) grades. 86% of users reported benefits to learning, efficiency, and/or grades, but 10% reported that learning was hindered by using GenAI. Most GenAI-users (83%) believed their usage of GenAI was ethical and only 4% regretted their use. Notably, 19% of users and 38% of non-users wished they had used GenAI more. Overall, only four assignments (representing 1.3% of respondents and 0.3% of submissions) were reportedly “mostly written by GenAI”. Instead, most students reported using GenAI selectively and in ways that were supportive rather than substitutive of their own reflective process. This finding inspires optimism that reflective writing assignments have retained their pedagogical value in the early GenAI era, and that most students are well-intentioned in their usage of GenAI. Heterogeneity in self-reported student behavior, motivations, and perceptions of GenAI’s benefits and harms highlights the need for further research into factors influencing GenAI adoption and usage. Understanding and responding to this diversity will be crucial for developing inclusive and equitable strategies to help maximize GenAI's benefits while minimizing its harms.",

This includes development of GenAI literacy, prompt engineering as related to physiology and research, and critical thinking skills. In this paper, we suggest an innovative, two-pronged approach that scaffolds the use of GenAI in a third year physiology and pharmacology course. First, we propose an integrating centralized support for GenAI within a course through asynchronous means, demonstrating how GenAI can be used as a tool. Second, we provide a step-by-step guide, with a concrete example of using GenAI for developing a novel experimental question, a hypothesis, legitimate methodology and analysis, and critical evaluation of GenAI outputs.

Core concept teaching and its potential benefits have been well described. The use of core concepts can help to right size content for students, allowing them to build a framework of knowledge and then transfer their understanding to new contexts as they are encountered. However, the implementation of core concept teaching within undergraduate medical education is less thoroughly described. Some unique aspects of teaching basic sciences in medical education may include integrated curricula where many disciplines are presented simultaneously, models that depart from the sequence of topics as they would traditionally be presented in a physiology course, and team teaching. We chose to implement core concept teaching in the pre-clerkship physiology curriculum at our institution to better facilitate students' conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and ability to transfer their knowledge. In doing so, we have highlighted our approaches to navigating some of the aforementioned challenges that physiology educators may face as they adapt core concept teaching to medical school curricula.",

    "abstract": "Tuning fork tests, particularly the Rinne and Weber tests, are fundamental in assessing hearing loss. However, medical students often struggle with key auditory physiology concepts, such as the auditory masking effect and sound lateralization. This study evaluated a simulation-based teaching method to enhance first-year medical students’ understanding of these concepts. A prospective educational intervention was conducted with 123 first-year MBBS students using a pre-test and post-test design with a validated questionnaire. During laboratory sessions, students performed tuning fork tests on peers while instructors demonstrated a novel method to simulate unilateral conductive deafness by closing the external auditory meatus with a finger. Students replicated this method before completing post-test evaluations. Pre-test data showed that 66.66% of students were uncertain or disagreed with their understanding of the auditory masking effect, and 60.16% were unsure about sound lateralization. Post-test results demonstrated significant improvement: 79.67% strongly agreed they understood the auditory masking effect, and 91.05% strongly agreed they comprehended sound lateralization (p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, student engagement increased, with 96.74% reporting they enjoyed the session compared to 26.01% before the intervention. This study demonstrates that a simple, reproducible simulation-based approach enhances medical students’ understanding of auditory physiology concepts. By actively experiencing a simulated unilateral conduction defect, students gain deeper conceptual insight and greater confidence in performing tuning fork tests. This innovative method holds promise for broader adoption in medical education.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a short ion flow activity that can be completed within one lab or lecture session. The activity is focused on the core concept of flow down gradients and is geared towards undergraduates. No previous knowledge of equilibrium potentials or membrane potentials is required. Students are guided through a set of questions that build in complexity. First, the K + gradient across the membrane is considered. Simple questions are posed that allow students to build a foundation of basic facts regarding ion flow. Next, students work with the Nernst equation to investigate equilibrium potentials. In this part of the activity, students are presented with several sets of conditions in which the K + gradient is made more or less steep and they are asked to calculate the effect on the equilibrium potential. Students then write a description of the relationship between the magnitude of the gradient and the equilibrium potential. This is preparation for moving on to use a Nernst/Goldman simulator that allows manipulating the K + , Na + and/or Cl - gradients, as well as temperature and permeability. Lastly, students answer questions that prompt them to summarize their knowledge regarding equilibrium potentials, membrane voltages, and the effect of temperature on the membrane voltage. By the end of the activity, students should be able to compare and contrast the Nernst and Goldman equations.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a growing concern among young adults, including college students, due to rates of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and limited disease awareness. Despite the risk, few studies have examined the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions among this population. To determine whether a pharmacy student-led educational session improves knowledge, retention, and motivation for behavior change related to type 2 diabetes prevention among undergraduate students. A group of third-year pharmacy students conducted 30-minute interactive educational sessions on a college campus in North Carolina. The sessions covered risk factors, prevention strategies, and healthy behaviors using slides, interactive questions, and video clips. Participants completed a presurvey, immediate postsurvey, and a 2- to 3-month follow-up survey assessing knowledge and self-reported behaviors. A paired t test and ANOVA with post hoc analysis evaluated changes in knowledge over time. Sixty-four students completed both the pre- and postsurveys. Knowledge scores significantly improved from pre- to postsurvey (7.0 ± 1.6 to 9.7 ± 1.4; P < 0.001). Of the 17 students completing the follow-up survey, knowledge remained significantly higher than baseline (pre: 6.4 ± 1.27; post: 8.7 ± 1.31; follow-up: 9.9 ± 2.28; P < 0.001). Participants reported increased motivation to adopt healthier behaviors, such as physical activity, improved nutrition using the Plate Method, and adequate sleep. An interactive, pharmacy student-led educational session significantly improved college students' knowledge and motivation to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

To address this, we recently implemented a leading-question teaching strategy in our undergraduate health science courses. This approach aimed to enhance students’ understanding by building on foundational knowledge from previous biology, anatomy and physiology courses and connecting it to commonly used terms, real-life experiences, and practical concerns. During class, discussions were guided by leading questions, with the instructor facilitating the conversation and providing justifications. The results showed that students found the combination of leading questions, whole-class discussion, and instructor guidance helpful in fostering meaningful learning. They expressed satisfaction with this teaching method. Additionally, the key concepts and explanations developed jointly by the students and instructor were beneficial for all students, including those who are typically more reserved.",

We evaluated the effectiveness of a new format for assessing practical skills: Competency Evaluation using Randomized Testing (CERT). CERT is a structured assessment format that uses random variants within each station. Simulating a clinical setting, CERT is designed to be authentic, learner-centered, and competency-oriented. We conducted a controlled trial of CERT among final-year medical students in a clinical clerkship. There were 33 medical students in the intervention (CERT) group and 33 in the control group. The CERT sessions included six stations each using variations to protect the integrity of exam content. Each of the six stations had four variants which were randomly assigned to students. Scores were adjusted based on the difficulty level of each variant. The primary outcome measure was performance on a standardized post-test. Learning scores were higher in the intervention group (mean National Board of Medical Examiners [NBME] adjusted scores: 72.9 vs 61.1 in control group; p &lt; 0.001). Students who entered the session later did not have higher scores compared to those who finished earlier. Scores from the new format correlated with NBME marks. The new format was rated highly by medical students. CERT, a structured assessment using randomized variations in stations, is a feasible and potentially valid format for evaluating clinical competence. By using random variations, CERT protects the integrity of assessment, allows flexible scheduling, and facilitates assessment of a large number of candidates.",

    "abstract": "One primary challenge in basic health program courses like biophysics is engaging students who struggle to connect initial concepts with future professional practice, leading to a lack of commitment to learning biophysics. Many classes also fail to develop skills and abilities essential for healthcare professionals, such as teamwork, communication, critical thinking, conflict resolution, and delegation. Educational games can be used to encourage students' commitment to knowledge construction and test their mental models to foster an active learning environment. An educational game based on the worldwide popular “Escape Room” model was developed, wherein teams collaborate to uncover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks within a set timeframe to achieve a specific goal - escape the room by discovering a password related to biophysics themes. To work on biophysics topics, such as acid-base balance, bioelectrogenesis, fluid compartments (composition and osmolarity), fluid dynamics, and membrane transport, the scenario was designed with elements relevant to daily professional practice, such as laboratory equipment, reagent flasks, stethoscopes, and saline solutions. Students participated in groups, answering class-related questions and solving puzzles and riddles to “escape” the room. The assessment of student performance involved observing their discussions and knowledge construction during the activity. At the activity's conclusion, students completed a satisfaction survey, providing feedback to refine future editions. The utilization of the “Escape Room” format provided an immersive and enjoyable learning experience, enhancing student motivation and participation. Thus, we demonstrate that old habits of teaching and learning, as expository classes, are not so hard to break.",

    "abstract": "Frogs serve as valuable model organisms for studying physiological responses of nerve, skeletal muscle, and the heart in undergraduate biology labs. Induced hypothermia prior to pithing is the traditional method of euthanasia, but some veterinary guidelines discourage this practice and recommend chemical anesthesia instead. However, the most commonly used anesthetic, MS-222, may negatively interfere with physiology experiments. We sought an alternative anesthetic and tested the hypothesis that eugenol anesthesia is compatible with classroom nerve and muscle experiments on frogs. Bullfrogs were euthanized after eugenol anesthesia or chilling. Additional groups of frogs were soaked in eugenol for extended durations of 30, 60, or 90 minutes beyond reflex loss. The sciatic nerve was stimulated while gastrocnemius force was measured using an isometric force transducer. The threshold voltage eliciting a muscle contraction and the peak isometric twitch force were recorded at 15-minute intervals for 2 hours. Eugenol reliably induced loss of reflexes in approximately 20 to 35 minutes. While eugenol increased the threshold voltage required for a muscle contraction and decreased force production, neuromuscular preparations maintained the ability to respond adequately to electrical stimulation, supporting eugenol‘s viability as an alternative anesthetic for classroom experiments. To further characterize the anesthetic‘s effects, isolated sciatic nerves were soaked in eugenol solutions and evaluated for compound action potential amplitude and action potential threshold voltage. Eugenol reduced maximum compound action potential amplitude and increased the action potential threshold voltage, with inhibitory effects dependent on the duration of exposure and reversible upon soaking in Ringer's solution.",

This was a 2-year project that also included the goal to provide opportunities for mentored service-learning for graduate and undergraduate students. Two undergraduate students and one graduate student assisted during year one, with two additional undergraduates joining in year two. During the first year, the faculty led seven health education seminars focused on the components of the American Heart Association (AHA) Life‘s Simple 7 TM . An eighth seminar on the importance of sleep was added in year two, aligning with the AHA‘s transition to Life‘s Essential 8 TM . Seminar attendees received cardiometabolic health-related educational materials and giveaway items. The health screenings included evaluations of blood pressure, body composition, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1C, as well as assessment of physical activity, diet, and sleep via questionnaires. As the students facilitated the health screenings under faculty supervision, they gained competencies including participant communication, anthropometric measurement, vital sign assessment, body composition analysis, and survey administration.

    "abstract": "Preclinical education has traditionally focused on didactic lectures, often overlooking student engagement and clinical correlations. To address this issue, active learning methods have been introduced, though their adoption is still in its early stages. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of incorporating case-based teaching with flipped classroom methods and compare it to interactive lectures in undergraduate physiology education. A quasi-experimental study was conducted at XYZ Medical College from June to October 2023. A sample of 94 first-year medical students was divided into two groups: one with case-based teaching using the flipped classroom approach and the other with interactive lectures, each containing an equal number of high, average, and low achievers. The flipped classroom group engaged with pre-class reading materials and in-class discussions using the jigsaw method, while the other group participated in interactive lectures. Each group completed three sessions. Pretests and posttests were administered, and a modified “Student Course Evaluation Questionnaire” was used to collect student feedback. Posttest scores significantly improved in both groups, with the flipped classroom group showing better performance in sessions one [F(1,91) = 5.343, p = 0.023] and three [F(1,91) = 5.322, p = 0.023], regardless of gender. This group also reported greater satisfaction with workload, course organization, learning resources, and teaching methods (p&lt;0.05, d=0.5−1).Integrating the flipped classroom with case-based teaching in preclinical education can significantly enhance students' active learning. This research offers valuable insights for curriculum development and instructional practices in medical education.",

Manipulatives are a means of providing an interactive learning experience that increases understanding and content retention. In this study, we updated our previous in-person, paper-based nephron manipulative into a digital, interactive PowerPoint format while also integrating clinical applications. Twenty-first-year medical students completed a premanipulative quiz (pretest) and then participated in the manipulative intervention, where they electronically dragged and positioned electrolytes/molecules onto corresponding transporters within each PowerPoint slide depicting specific nephron segments. Participants completed a postmanipulative quiz (posttest) and participated in a faculty-based discussion in that same session. A long-term knowledge assessment quiz (long-term test) was administered 9 mo later in their second year of medical school. A nonintervention group, consisting of 26 second-year medical students who did not participate in the nephron manipulative as first-year students, provided a comparison for the natural learning progression without the manipulative intervention. A statistically significant improvement was observed from pretest to posttest (P = 0.0093), confirming that the manipulative intervention produced a meaningful improvement in student learning in the short term. When comparing learning outcomes by question subject, Pharmacology questions showed a higher average gain (+0.13) compared to Physiology (+0.07), with less knowledge decay over time (-0.03 vs. -0.09).

The instructional model is organized around four core modules: mastering terminology, identifying acid sources, exploring regulatory mechanisms, and understanding acid-base disorders. Notably, the approach introduces a specific sequence for concept delivery, supported by interactive in-class activities such as multiple-choice questions, open-ended prompts, pattern recognition tasks, physiological reflex analysis, and the construction of concept maps. This format encourages students to link molecular mechanisms with systemic outcomes and fosters the application of knowledge to clinical and everyday life scenarios.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This teaching strategy not only enhances understanding of acid-base regulation but also exemplifies how system-based integration, interactive learning, and scaffolded concept development can transform the delivery of complex physiological content.

    "abstract": "Biomedical Science is a popular multivocational degree that exposes students to body systems knowledge and scientific research skills, preparing them for work or further study in biomedical research and industry or health professions. With a diverse range of graduate outcomes, biomedical students report feeling uncertain about their career prospects. To date, there are limited data on the employment outcomes of Australian Biomedical Science graduates. We recently reported on the use of the professional networking LinkedIn platform to track employment outcomes and enhance career awareness for Physiology Major graduates. The LinkedIn Alumni Function (LAF) extends the capability to track graduate outcomes with high-level insights on what they do and what they are skilled at. The LAF was used in this study to track Bachelor of Biomedical Science alumni, who graduated between 2016 and 2024, from 38 Australian universities (n = 18,413). Alumni from the research-intensive Group of Eight (Go8) Australian universities were compared with those of other universities to assess any difference in the employment outcomes of their graduates. Biomedical Science alumni were mostly employed in the research sector (20%), followed by education (16%) and healthcare services (15%). A greater proportion of alumni from Go8 universities work in the research and education sectors, while relatively more non-Go8 graduates have a profession in healthcare services. Research, communication, and teamwork were the top three promoted skills by Biomedical Science alumni. Data obtained through the LAF could boost course promotion and curriculum design by providing clear indications of career pathways and skill sets to maximize graduate employability.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to report on Biomedical Science graduate employment outcomes, using the novel LinkedIn Alumni Function. The data show that one-fifth of Biomedical Science alumni pursued a career in the research sector, followed by 16% in education and 15% in healthcare services. Research, communication, and teamwork are the top skills publicized by Biomedical Science alumni in professional networking.",

    "abstract": "Blood pressure regulation keeps us alive, yet its underlying mechanisms often remain abstract for students. Heart rate, stroke volume, vascular resistance, and compliance interact continuously to shape arterial pressure, but in many classrooms, these variables feel disconnected from observable outcomes. To bridge this gap, we developed a simple, low-cost analog model that allows learners to manipulate key cardiovascular parameters and immediately observe the results. The model consists of a hand-operated bicycle pump (heart), 60-mL syringe (compliance chamber), adjustable clamp (vascular resistance), manometer (arterial pressure), and transparent flow reservoir. Together, these components externalize normally hidden variables, allowing students to explore how changes in cardiac output, resistance, and compliance alter pressure waveforms and flow dynamics in real time. The flow reservoir provides intuitive visual feedback: high compliance produces steady, laminar bubble flow, whereas low compliance generates phasic, turbulent flow. The model was implemented in large-group classroom demonstrations and small-group laboratory sessions. Across settings, students reported increased understanding and engagement, while instructors observed enhanced mechanistic reasoning and conceptual clarity. The model is affordable and reusable and requires no animal use, making it adaptable for a wide range of educational environments. By making the invisible visible, this model transforms cardiovascular physiology from abstract theory into an interactive, accessible learning experience.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This simple, hands-on model lets students take control of the cardiovascular system, adjusting heart rate, stroke volume, resistance, and compliance, and immediately see how pressure and flow respond. Built from inexpensive materials, it transforms abstract hemodynamic principles into visible, interactive outcomes. By making the invisible visible, this model sparks curiosity, promotes mechanistic reasoning, and brings cardiovascular physiology to life in classrooms and labs.",

However, it is unclear what drives instructor decisions to use this practice. We conducted exploratory interviews with 21 college science instructors from a research-intensive institution; some invite students to VANQ and some do not. We probed the perceived costs and benefits associated with VANQ and participants' reasoning for why they implement or avoid the practice in their science courses. We found that instructors perceive that VANQ builds students' skills and knowledge and that students benefit from learning to speak out in front of large groups. However, participants acknowledged that the practice could take away time from content delivery and potentially damage the instructor-student relationship. Instructors reported implementing VANQ for the purpose of maximizing student learning and avoided VANQ to prevent an inequitable classroom environment. This study is the first to examine instructor opinions of and motivations for implementing VANQ.",

To address this gap, we present an easy and cost-effective practical class using the emerging invertebrate model organism, Lumbriculus variegatus, as an additional in vivo model for education. This practical class enables students to observe the effects of pharmacologically active compounds on the stereotypical behaviours of body reversal and helical swimming in L. variegatus through tactile stimulation. During this class, students will conduct drug dilution calculations, administer test compounds, and conduct an in vivo behavioural experiment. Results from this class demonstrate drug effects in vivo and enable students to observe reversible or irreversible behavioural effects, depending on the compound tested. This class demonstrates L. variegatus as a model for hands-on in vivo teaching, providing students with critical laboratory experience without the need for vertebrate or higher-order mammal models. Furthermore, the approach outlined here is scalable and an adaptable teaching methodology that enhances student engagement with in vivo teaching without costly equipment or complex animal husbandry.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more integrated into the field of healthcare, medical students need to learn the foundational AI literacy. Yet, traditional, descriptive teaching methods of AI topics are often ineffective in engaging the learners. This article introduces a new application of cinema to teaching AI concepts in medical education. With meticulously chosen movie clips from “Enthiran (Tamil)/Robot (Hindi)/Robo (Telugu)” movie, the students were introduced to the primary differences between Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). This method triggered encouraging responses of students, with learners indicating greater conceptual clarity and heightened interest. Film as an emotive and visual medium not only makes difficult concepts easy to understand but also encourages curiosity, ethical consideration, and higher-order thought. This pedagogic intervention demonstrates how narrative-based learning can make abstract AI systems more relatable and clinically relevant for future physicians. Beyond technical content, the method can offer opportunities to cultivate critical engagement with ethical and practical dimensions of AI in healthcare. Integrating film into AI instruction could bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical application, offering a compelling pathway to enrich medical education in a rapidly evolving digital age.",

Despite this intent, systematic and structured research training for first-year medical students remains limited in implementation. This study investigated the perceived learning outcomes, challenges, and potential solutions experienced by first-year undergraduate medical students in the physiology department, who participated in a research activity aligned with the CBME framework. A cross-sectional, observational, qualitative study was conducted among undergraduate medical students in their first year of the 2023–2024 academic year. Following a sensitisation session on research methodology, students engaged in a group research activity. One hundred twenty-three students voluntarily submitted written feedback in response to three open-ended questions about their learning experiences, identified gaps, and suggested improvements. Two coders independently performed a thematic analysis of the reactions, with themes and categories finalised collaboratively. The analysis identified four central themes that reflected the learning outcomes: development of teamwork skills, improvement of research and problem-solving skills, personal development and flexibility, and intellectual and academic growth. Students gained an understanding of research methods and teamwork; challenges included formulating questions and managing time effectively. Solutions involved stronger mentorship, more precise guidance, and better group coordination. In conclusion, integrating early research training into the medical curriculum from the first year of the medical program improved students' research competencies and team-building skills. Institutional support and structured mentorship can further optimise these learning experiences.",

    "abstract": "The chick embryo ventricular cardiomyocyte model provides students easy access to experiments involving fundamental features of cardiac cell physiology and pharmacology. Using standard physiology teaching laboratories and basic cell culture equipment, spontaneously beating colonies of electrically-connected cardiomyocytes can be obtained by the students themselves. Students learn, aseptic techniques and cell culture alongside experiments illustrating, at the simplest level of experimentation, how beating rate can be altered physiologically or pharmacologically. In the typical course of the type of experiments presented here, students first observe, the effect of temperature (beating rates decline to a third going from 37 °C to room temperature; eg. to 40 from 130 beats per minute) and media change (beating rates increase up to 50%) before moving on to the pharmacological characterisation of various receptors in these cells. Most obviously, in the cardiac cell context, this involves drugs acting on β-adrenoceptor subtypes. Students can obtain predictable dose-dependent increases in beating rates (up to maximal 100% increases in beating rate; from ~100 to 200 beats per minute typically) with the addition of stimulatory β-adrenoceptor agonists (eg. isoproterenol) but also observe dose-dependent decreases in beating rate withβ3-adrenoceptor agonists (reducing beating rate by up to a third). Consequently, “classical” log dose-response curves can be obtained in the “real world” enhancing student understanding of fundamental mechanisms of drug action. While these experiments focus on physiological and pharmacological techniques, the model can be extended to encompass biochemical or molecular biological studies in terms of intracellular signaling systems activated and protein expression patterns.",

He classified body fibers into membranous and carneous types, locating the active force of contraction within the structure of the muscle itself.

This study aimed to determine student perceptions of a classroom assignment designed to develop proficiency in using ChatGPT for these strategies. Methods: First-semester Doctor of Pharmacy students in a foundational sciences course completed an assignment using ChatGPT for active recall. The assignment involved generating quizzes from lecture notes on protein structure and apoptosis, verifying ChatGPT's answers, and engaging in further inquiry. Students completed a Qualtrics survey assessing their perceptions. Results: Nearly 60% of students had no prior ChatGPT experience, and only 21% had used it for previous quizzing purposes. Most (96%) found the instructions for the assignment clear, and 89% reported ChatGPT was easy to use. The majority believed ChatGPT quizzes were as effective as instructor-provided quizzes. All students agreed that verifying ChatGPT's answers with lecture notes was a valuable learning experience. Open-ended responses highlighted the ease of generating additional questions and exploring concepts at higher cognitive levels, though some noted challenges with crafting precise prompts and verifying answers. Conclusion: While many students were new to ChatGPT, the structured assignment improved their comfort with and understanding of the platform’s capabilities and limitations when used for active recall and critical inquiry. The integration of AI tools, when guided and purposeful, can enrich traditional learning methods and support student engagement and deeper understanding of biological concepts in pharmacy education.",

This study examines the students` perceptions and the effectiveness of an AR-based learning sequence on pre- and post-student drawings of renal physiology. Three cohorts in their first year of undergraduate biomedical education (experimental groups) were enrolled and compared to 3 cohorts (controls) that performed a regular teacher-centered activity, following parallel content at the same time. The experimental groups performed an activity using the smartphone/tablet application that included a teacher and student guide. We used a pre- and post-activity assessments, that involved asking the students to draw an integrative diagram that represents the main functions of the kidney from a macroscopic and microscopic point of view. Drawings were analyzed with Kozma and Russell’s levels of representation to evaluate learning progressions. In experimental groups, most of the students maintained their level of representation by comparing the pre- and post-activity assessment (54%). However, 42% of the participants advanced towards higher levels of complexity. Scores on the final physiology test showed a significant increase in the experimental groups versus controls. Regarding perception, 95% of the students believed that AR technology enhanced their understanding of kidney physiology, and 73% reported a better comprehension of glomerular filtration. Furthermore, 90% of the students recommended AR as a valuable complement to traditional teaching.

    "abstract": "Diffusion is a critical component of the Physiology Core Concept of flow down gradients and is fundamental to understand how ions, gases, or signaling molecules travel short distances in the body. When asked about diffusion, students often reason successfully using the \"things move from areas of high to low concentration\" heuristic but struggle to understand that random motion underlies this movement. We investigated the different knowledge resources students use when reasoning about diffusion across different contexts. Additionally, we determined if item context impacted the resources students activated and how consistent students were in their reasoning. We gave students a pair of questions from three contexts (plant, animal, nonliving) that asked them to predict and explain where a molecule of gas would be located before and after equilibrium. Using the resources framework, we identified 14 common knowledge resources and six different patterns in resource activation. \"High to low\" and related resources were used in 73% of responses. Only 23% of responses included at least one \"random motion\" resource and the vast majority of these responses described random particle motion starting only after equilibrium is reached. Item context did not significantly impact the resources students used. Students were also mostly consistent in their reasoning, with 76% using similar resources across the two items. These findings indicate that \"high to low\" and related resources have a high cueing priority for many students, and that instructors should help students unpack random motion as the mechanism underlying diffusion instead of leaving it \"black-boxed.\"",

While human-generated MCQs benefit from pedagogical insight, creating high-quality items is time-intensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), tools like DeepSeek R1 offer potential for automated MCQ generation, though their educational validity remains uncertain. With this background, this study compared the psychometric quality of Physiology MCQs generated by faculty and an AI chatbot. Methods: A total of 200 MCQs were developed following the standard syllabus and question design guidelines - 100 by Physiology faculty and 100 by the AI chatbot DeepSeek R1. Fifty questions from each group were randomly selected and administered to undergraduate medical students in 2 hours. Item analysis was conducted post-assessment using difficulty index (DIFI), discrimination index (DI), and non-functional distractors (NFDs). Statistical comparisons were made using t-tests or non-parametric equivalents, with significance at p &lt;0.05. Results: Chatbot-generated MCQs had a significantly higher DIFI (0.64 ± 0.22) than faculty MCQs (0.47 ± 0.19, p &lt;.0001). No significant difference in DI was found between the groups (p = .17). Faculty MCQs had significantly fewer NFDs (median 0) compared to chatbot MCQs (median 1, p = .0063). Conclusion: AI-generated MCQs demonstrated comparable discrimination ability but were generally easier and contained more ineffective distractors. While chatbots show promise in MCQ generation, further refinement is needed to improve distractor quality and item difficulty. AI can complement but not yet replace human expertise in assessment design.",

The high demand for health professionals is seen with courses in Anatomy &amp; Physiology (A&amp;P), which often have high enrollments, high diversity, and require active pedagogies, hands-on learning, diverse study techniques, and interactions with instructors and peers. In Spring 2020, however, COVID-19 caused major disruptions to everyday life around the world, forcing significant changes to academic curricula and how students were taught. Institutions were forced into all online instruction, thus eliminating hands-on experiences, altering student learning, and hindering student-student and student-instructor interactions. Now that universities are back to in-person classes, there is a great opportunity to evaluate the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on student performance and learning. It is important to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 because it can inform on how to improve pedagogies going forward, while also helping to prepare for when the next pandemic occurs. To identify and analyze the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on student performance and learning, this study compared student performances in A&amp;P labs before and after COVID-19. For A&amp;P I, practical scores and overall grades declined following the pandemic, not returning to pre-pandemic levels until Fall ’23 (4-5 semesters). For A&amp;P II, practical scores and overall grades declined the first semester following the pandemic but returned to pre-pandemic levels in Spring ’22 (1 semester).

Identifying a method to help reduce academic stress could be critical to positively impact student health and wellbeing. One of the emerging methods of stress reduction in current research is the use of virtual reality (VR) with biofeedback, which is a process that allows the user to gain conscious control of otherwise unnoticed bodily functions to change autonomic nervous system control. This research aimed to investigate whether VR biofeedback could help students manage stress in an academic setting. The authors monitored the heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and self-reported stress levels in 22 health science students while they used a VR headset to complete an immersive activity that guided users in diaphragmatic breathing within a calming virtual environment. While there were no significant changes in heart rate variability (HRV) or mean arterial pressure after the VR session, participants self-reported decreased stress levels. The participants also positively evaluated the experience with the VR headset and noted that the session was calming and engaging. Future research could use a similar process to evaluate participants directly before they take an exam or complete another stressful task and assess the effect of using biofeedback on academic performance.",

    "abstract": "Two essentials to the process of developing critical thinking skills in human physiology students are, 1) explanation of the evolutionary adaptiveness of anatomical and physiological components - i.e., utilizing their “adaptive logic” to impart comprehension of their rational functioning and, 2) linking of physiological actions and responses within a process through conveyance of their causal relationships (1). Philosophers have for centuries argued that this latter element is essential to our predictive abilities within complex systems. The essential nature of causality is tied to the fact that all logically valid predictions rely on an understanding of the link between cause and effect determined by prior observations. Fundamentally, predictions are a form of inductive reasoning wherein expectations about unobserved things are based upon those which are observed. In the case of physiology, prior studies provide the evidence of physical, chemical or biological causes linking all steps within any mechanistic physiological sequence. We suggest that emphasis on causality and how it is packaged within our teaching is a critical foundation for all effective teaching, including the established educational initiatives intending to improve critical thinking skills in physiology (i.e., active learning, computer-based education, flipped classrooms, problem-based learning, and a focus on core concepts). In essence, complex physiological sequences should be initially explained as a series of simple triads (stimulus → causal link → effect). Doing so limits the load placed on working (short-term) memory, enhancing the storage of long-term memory and the formation of essential cognitive architecture required for critical thinking.",

    "abstract": "Migraine affects women at various life stages, with its frequency and severity influenced by fluctuations in ovarian hormones. The pathophysiology of migraine involves activation of the trigeminovascular system, brainstem regions, and diencephalic nuclei, with neurotransmitters and neuropeptides like serotonin(5-HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), noradrenaline, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) playing key roles in maintenance of pain. Estrogen modulates these pathways and has a significant impact on migraine pathophysiology in females. Menstrual migraines, linked to estrogen withdrawal and prostaglandin release, can be managed with short-term prophylactic therapies such as selective serotonin agonists, initiated a few days before the expected onset of menstruation, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or triptans for breakthrough headaches. During pregnancy, migraines often subside due to stable hormone levels, while perimenopause can exacerbate symptoms. Breastfeeding may improve migraine symptoms temporarily. Hormone replacement therapy can reduce migraine frequency in women during perimenopausal period. A tailored, individualized approach is essential for effective management of migraines in women.",

    "abstract": "Certainty-based marking (CBM) requires students to indicate their certainty levels alongside their answers. CBM has been shown to enhance self-assessment and metacognitive awareness. This study aimed to explore the implementation of CBM in multiple-choice assessments in physiology. The CBM assessment tool was developed with an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant, Claude 3.5, with prompts focused on functional rather than technical requirements. The assessment consisted of 15 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), which were administered as a pretest and posttest during a small group teaching session to first-year medical students. Following the assessment, students completed a survey to evaluate their perceptions regarding the format, knowledge-gap identification, and overall acceptability. Answers from 195 students were analyzed, and significant improvements were observed in performance measures and certainty indices from the pretest to the posttest. Most students (80.9%) found the certainty scale beneficial, and 78.3% changed their answers after reflecting on their certainty. CBM demonstrated metacognitive benefits, with 86.4 % of students better recognizing their knowledge gaps and 85.8 % feeling more aware of their learning progress. About 73 % of students preferred the CBM format and expressed greater engagement (82.8 %) than traditional MCQs. CBM implemented through a web-based platform functioned as an assessment tool and an instructional intervention that enhances students' metacognitive awareness and self-monitoring skills in physiology education. Our study focused on a single physiology topic and showed improvements in knowledge retention and certainty calibration. However, further longitudinal studies across multiple topics are needed to determine whether students maintain these self-assessment skills over time.",

Rain Classroom facilitates communication between students and teachers via smartphones or computers; however, its effective application to JiTT methodologies has yet to be evaluated. Two groups were compared: the JiTT group ( n = 63, academic year 2024), assisted by the software plug-in Rain Classroom, and the traditional classroom (TC) group, ( n = 70, academic year 2023), which received traditional lecture-based instruction. Cohorts from consecutive years showed no baseline differences, with equivalence testing confirming comparability. Students in the JiTT group achieved significantly higher final examination scores than in the TC group [77.21points (SD 9.27) versus 71.97 points (SD 11.69), (degree of freedom = 131), p = 0.006]. A moderate positive correlation was observed between final examination scores and in-class quiz performance among the JiTT participants (Spearman correlation R = 0.42, p &lt; 0.001). Satisfaction scores, assessed per a five-point Likert scale, were significantly higher for JiTT than TC [mean 25.73 (SD 3.17) versus mean 22.79 (SD 3.84), p &lt; 0.001]. While students generally expressed positive attitudes toward the JiTT approach, some reported heightened academic stress. Qualitative analysis identified five major stressors. Overall, JiTT assisted by Rain Classroom significantly improved histology learning outcomes and student satisfaction in Chinese nursing education, although stress mitigation strategies are warranted for sustainable implementation.",

This study presents a laboratory activity employing Drosophila melanogaster as a model for neurological disease, leveraging its historical utility in genetic and physiological research. As invertebrates, D. melanogaster are not subject to the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in the United Kingdom, making them suitable for large class teaching. The activity aims to enhance students' molecular skills and understanding of genotype-phenotype linkages through hands-on experiments. Students conduct DNA extraction, PCR, and restriction digestion, followed by behavioural assays to assess motor function. Results demonstrate consistent molecular outcomes and significant differences in climbing ability between wild-type and mutant flies, mirroring human multiple neurological disease symptoms. The practical encourages inquiry-based learning, allowing students to design multi-stage experiments and analyse complex data. This comprehensive approach not only reinforces theoretical knowledge but also provides valuable insights into human disease mechanisms using invertebrate models. The methodology can be adapted for various educational levels and expanded to include more advanced techniques such as qPCR, fostering a deeper understanding of molecular biology and neurophysiology.",

I emphasize explicit presentation of the relation between the activity of the contractile machine in the myocytes to pump dynamics, pressure-volume relations, and cardiac output regulation, with matching oxygen supply to tissue demands serving as a focal point. Important ideas here are 1) the concept that regulation is at the cellular level of regulation; 2) that force and shortening properties of the cells are ultimately dependent on the number of cross bridges reacting with the thin filament and on the rate of cross-bridge cycling; 3) that the concepts of preload, aferload, and contractility originated in studies of muscle mechanics; 4) that there is a reserve of force-generating cross bridges, i.e., the myofilaments are not fully activated by Ca2+ in the basal state, and that force-generating cross bridges can themselves activate the thin filament; and 5) that length dependence of myofilament Ca2+ activation is important in the cellular basis of Starling's law of the heart. The elaboration of these processes serves to elucidate how these mechanisms play a role in coupling tissue oxygen demands to supply.",

The laboratory is designed to illustrate basic pharmacological and physiological concepts learned in the classroom. The specific learning objectives covered in this lab include maintenance of anesthesia, basic surgical technique including cannulation of blood vessels, understanding the measurement and significance of basic physiological parameters, premortem examination of in situ heart and lungs, direct cardiac massage and induction of ventricular fibrillation, understanding the fundamentals of the baroreceptor reflex, and cardiovascular responses to various pharmacological agents. Pharmacologic agents used include epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, atropine, prazosin, propranolol, acetylcholine, nitroprusside, and angiotensin II. The laboratory demonstration has proven effective in reinforcing the fundamental principles of cardiovascular physiology and autonomic pharmacology. By the completion of this experiment, students are expected to be able to: 1) describe the basics of maintenance of anesthesia in a live animal; 2) describe basic surgical technique; 3) observe the procedure for proper cannulation of blood vessels; 4) describe the proper method of controlling hemorrhage from a bleeding source; 5) describe the measurement and recording of four physiological parameters: mean arterial pressure from a pressure transducer, heart rate from an ECG, hindquarters resistance from Doppler measurement of femoral arterial blood flow, and cardiac contractility by calculating dP/dt from left ventricular pressure measured with a Millar transducer; 6) perform a premortem exam of the heart and lungs and appreciate the in situ cardiothoracic anatomy of the living animal; 7) assist in the induction of ventricular fibrillation and perform direct cardiac massage; 8) characterize the autonomic responses activated by the baroreceptor reflex; 9) describe the effects of the adrenergic agonists epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol on cardiovascular parameters and construct a dose response curve for each agent; 10) describe the effects of the adrenergic antagonists propranolol and prazosin on cardiovascular parameters and explain how they affect cardiovascular responses to adrenergic agonists; 11) describe the difference between endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation using acetylcholine, nitroprusside, and atropine; 12) observe the pressor response of angiotensin II and describe why this response is not blocked by pretreatment with prazosin; and 13) participate in the collection and analysis of experimental data and the presentation of results.",

Computers enable multimedia content but lack the capability of the user to personalize the content. Therefore, we investigated TK3 eBooks as a potential solution to incorporate the benefits of both paper and computer technology. The objective of our study was to assess the utility of TK3 eBooks in the context of authoring and distributing dermatology course content for use by second-year medical students at the University of Utah School of Medicine during the spring of 2004. We incorporated all dermatology course content into TK3 eBook format. TK3 eBooks enable students to personalize information through tools such as “notebook,” “hiliter,” “stickies,” mark pages, and keyword search. Students were given the course content in both paper and eBook formats. At the conclusion of the dermatology course, students completed a questionnaire designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the eBooks compared with paper. Students perceived eBooks as an effective way to distribute course content and as a study tool. However, students preferred paper over eBooks to take notes during lecture. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that eBooks provide a convenient method for authoring, distributing, and using course content but that students preferred paper to take notes during lecture.",

    "abstract": "Physiology as a discipline is uniquely positioned to engage undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research in response to the 2006–2011 National Science Foundation Strategic Plan call for innovative transformational research, which emphasizes multidisciplinary projects. To prepare undergraduates for careers that cross disciplinary boundaries, students need to practice interdisciplinary communication in academic programs that connect students in diverse disciplines. This report surveys policy documents relevant to this emphasis on interdisciplinary training and suggests a changing role for physiology courses in bioscience and engineering programs. A role for a physiology course is increasingly recommended for engineering programs, but the study of physiology from an engineering perspective might differ from the study of physiology as a basic science. Indeed, physiology laboratory courses provide an arena where biomedical engineering and bioscience students can apply knowledge from both fields while cooperating in multidisciplinary teams under specified technical constraints. Because different problem-solving approaches are used by students of engineering and bioscience, instructional innovations are needed to break down stereotypes between the disciplines and create an educational environment where interdisciplinary teamwork is used to bridge differences.",

    "abstract": "The collection of primary data in laboratory classes enhances undergraduate practical and critical thinking skills. The present article describes the use of a lecture program, running in parallel with a series of linked practical classes, that emphasizes classical or standard concepts in exercise physiology. The academic and practical program ran under the title of a particular year II module named Sports Performance: Physiology and Assessment, and results are presented over a 3-yr period (2004-2006), based on an undergraduate population of 31 men and 34 women. The module compared laboratory-based indexes of endurance (e.g., ventilatory threshold and exercise economy) and high-intensity exercise (e.g., anaerobic power), respectively, with measures of human performance (based on 20-m shuttle run tests). The specific experimental protocols reinforced the lecture content to improve student understanding of the physiological and metabolic responses (and later adaptations) to exercise. In the present study, the strongest relationship with endurance performance was the treadmill velocity at maximal aerobic power (r = +0.88, P < 0.01, n = 51); in contrast, the strongest relationship with high-intensity exercise performance was the mean power output (in W/kg) measured during a 30-s all-out cycle ergometer sprint (r = +0.80, P < 0.01, n = 48). In class student data analysis improved undergraduate indepth or critical thinking during seminars and enhanced computer and data presentation skills. The endurance-based laboratories are particularly useful for examining the underlying scientific principles that determine aerobic performance but could equally well be adapted to investigate other topics, e.g., differences in the exercise response between men and women.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory mechanics is a difficult topic for instructors and students alike. Existing respiratory mechanics models are limited in their abilities to demonstrate any effects of rib cage movement on alveolar and intrapleural pressures. We developed a model that can be used in both large and small classroom settings. This model contains digital pressure displays and computer integration for real-time demonstration of pressure changes that correspond to the different phases of breathing. Moving the simulated diaphragm and rib cage causes a volume change that results in pressure changes visible on the digital sensors and computer display. Device testing confirmed the model's ability to accurately demonstrate pressure changes in proportion to physiological values. Classroom testing in 427 surveyed students showed improved understanding of respiratory concepts (P < 0.05). We conclude that our respiratory mechanics model is a valuable instructional tool and provide detailed instructions for those who would like to create their own.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes constitutes an increasingly prevalent disease, dramatically associated with an enhanced mortality risk in the developed world. A high prevalence of diabetes has recently been described at Réunion Island, a French department located in the Indian Ocean. At the University of La Réunion, a laboratory course involving students was designed to teach them blood glucose measurements and to examine the influence of food intake on their glycemic response. Using glucose meters, test strips, lancet devices, and sterile lancets, students determined their basal and postprandial glycemia. After plotting the variation over time of their glycemia, students calculated their glycemic response to a meal as the area under the curve. First, students observed that their glycemia had increased rapidly after food intake to values of &lt;1.4 g/l and then decreased to normal values, proving the existence of a physiological regulatory system for glycemia. Using impedance balances, students then determined their body mass index and fat mass percentages. Positive and significant correlations were established between students' fat mass percentages and the glycemic response to the meal. A higher postprandial response was indeed noticed for students having higher fat percentages. Therefore, this laboratory allows students to observe the regulation of glycemia. It also alerts them to the correlation between higher body fat content and a higher glycemic response, which can be related to diabetic disorders. This laboratory constitutes an active illustration of their plenary lesson in endocrinology and particularly for the session dealing with glucose regulation.",

Consequently, it may be thought that more “traditional” types of assessment based around essay writing skills for science undergraduates may be of decreasing value and relevance to contemporary students. This article describes a study in which the process of feedback on, and associated redrafting of, an essay was closely supervised to improve essay writing skills and subsequent exam performance. The results of this study show that students can significantly improve their learning and academic performance, as assessed by final examination mark, by a process that more closely mimics a “real-world” situation of review and redrafting. Additionally, the data show that students benefit from feedback only when this is used appropriately by the student. The article also discusses the continuing importance and relevance of essay writing skills so that writing, and acting upon feedback to do with that writing, remains an integral part of the process of learning.",

    "abstract": "Even students that obtain a high grade in neurophysiology often carry away a serious misconception concerning the final result of the complex set of events that follows the arrival of an action potential at the presynaptic terminal. The misconception consists in considering that “at a synapse, information is passed on from one neuron to the next” is equivalent to (and often expressed explicitly as) “the action potential passes from one neuron to the next.” More than half of four groups of students who were asked to comment on an excerpt from a recent physiology textbook that openly stated the misconception had no clear objection to the text presented. We propose that the first culprit in generating this misconception is the term “synaptic transmission,” which promotes the notion of transferring something or passing something along (implicitly unchanged). To avoid establishing this misconception, the first simple suggestion is to use words like “synaptic integration” rather than “synaptic transmission” right from the start. More generally, it would be important to focus on the function of synaptic events rather than on rote listing of all the numerous steps that are known to occur, which are so complex as to saturate the mind of the student.",

A class of 54 students doing the respiratory system course in the second year of the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery program in my university was randomized to two groups to receive one of two types of lectures, “typical” lectures ( n = 28, 18 women and 10 men) or “constructivist” lectures ( n = 26, 19 women and 7 men), on the same topic: the regulation of respiration. Student pretest scores in the two groups were comparable ( P &gt; 0.1). Students that received the constructivist lectures did much better in the posttest conducted immediately after the lectures (6.8 ± 3.4 for constructivist lectures vs. 4.2 ± 2.3 for typical lectures, means ± SD, P = 0.004). Although both types of lectures were well received, students that received the constructivist lectures appeared to have been more satisfied with their learning experience. However, on a posttest conducted 4 mo later, scores obtained by students in the two groups were not any different (6.9 ± 3 for constructivist lectures vs. 6.9 ± 3.7 for typical lectures, P = 0.94). This study adds to the increasing body of evidence that there is a case for the use of interactive lectures that make the construction of knowledge and understanding explicit, easy, and enjoyable to learners.",

These approaches can enhance the learning experience for physiology, medical, and mathematics students and simultaneously act to stimulate mathematical/physiological/clinical interdisciplinary research. While physiology education incorporates mathematics, via equations and formulas, it does not typically provide a foundation for interdisciplinary research linking mathematics and physiology. Here, we provide insights and ideas derived from interdisciplinary seminars involving mathematicians and physiologists that have been conducted over the last decade. The approaches described here can be used as templates for giving physiology and medical students insights into how sophisticated tools from mathematics can be applied and how the disciplines of mathematics and physiology can be integrated in research, thereby fostering a foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration. These templates are equally applicable to linking mathematical methods with other life and health sciences in the educational process.",

A conventional setup for recording contractile activity of isolated smooth muscle preparations was used based on the events elegantly described by Somlyo and Somlyo in the 1960s. They showed that, in response to a given stimulus, smooth muscle cells may contract, recruiting electromechanical or pharmacomechanical coupling by mechanisms that involve, or not, changes in transmembrane potential, respectively. By means of contractions and relaxations of a ring-like preparation from the rat mesenteric artery, it is possible to observe the functional consequences of handling K(+) concentration in the extracellular compartment and the effects caused by opening K(+) channels in that preparation, which are significant when the cell membrane establishes an electrical potential difference between intra- and extracellular compartments (driven mainly by K(+) permeability under resting conditions). The effects observed by students fit well with values predicted by Nernst and Goldman-Hodgin-Katz equations, and we demonstrated that the activity is able to improve students' comprehension regarding basic principles of bioelectricity.",

The basis of this study was the expectation that if students were oriented to SOLO taxonomy, it would provide them an opportunity to understand some of the factors that teachers consider while grading descriptive responses and possibly develop strategies to improve scores. We first sampled the perceptions of 68 second-year undergraduate medical students doing the Respiratory System course regarding the usefulness of explicit discussion of SOLO taxonomy. Subsequently, in a distinct cohort of 20 second-year medical students doing the Central Nervous System course, we sought to determine whether explicit illustration of SOLO taxonomy combined with some advice on better answering descriptive test questions (to an experimental group) resulted in better student scores in a continuous assessment test compared with providing advice for better answering test questions but without any reference to SOLO taxonomy (the control group). Student ratings of the clarity of the presentation on SOLO taxonomy appeared satisfactory to the authors, as was student understanding of our presentation. The majority of participants indicated that knowledge of SOLO taxonomy would help them study and prepare better answers for questions of the descriptive type. Although scores in the experimental and control group were comparable, this experience nonetheless provided us with the motivation to orient students to SOLO taxonomy early on in the medical program and further research factors that affect students' development of strategies based on knowledge of SOLO taxonomy.",

He initially served with Base Hospital No. 5, a unit made up of Harvard clinicians, before moving forward to the front lines to serve at a casualty clearing station run by the British. During his time there, he performed research on wounded soldiers to understand the nature and causes of traumatic shock. Subsequently, Cannon performed animal experimentation on the causes of traumatic shock in the London laboratory of Dr. William Bayliss before being assigned to the AEF Central Medical Laboratory in Dijon, France, where he continued his experimental studies. During this time, he also developed and taught a curriculum on resuscitation of wounded soldiers to medical providers. Although primarily a researcher and teacher, Cannon also performed clinical duties throughout the war, serving with distinction under fire. After the war, Cannon wrote a monograph entitled Traumatic Shock (New York: Appleton, 1923), which encapsulated the knowledge that had been gained during the war, both from direct observation of wounded soldiers, as well as laboratory experimentation on the causes and treatment of traumatic shock. In his monograph, Cannon elucidates a number of principles concerning hemorrhagic shock that were later forgotten, only to be \"rediscovered\" during the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. This paper summarizes Cannon's wartime experiences and the knowledge gained concerning traumatic shock during World War I, with a comparison of current combat casualty care practices and knowledge to that which Cannon and his colleagues understood a century ago.",

Developing new pedagogical strategies, such as problem-based learning (PBL), is extremely important to stimulate and encourage medical and biomedical students to learn thyroid physiology and identify the signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction. The present study aimed to create a new pedagogical approach to build deep knowledge about hypo-/hyperthyroidism by proposing a hands-on activity based on a detective case, using alternative materials in place of laboratory animals. After receiving a description of a criminal story involving changes in thyroid hormone economy, students collected data from clues, such as body weight, mesenteric vascularization, visceral fat, heart and thyroid size, heart rate, and thyroid-stimulating hormone serum concentration to solve the case. Nevertheless, there was one missing clue for each panel of data. Four different materials were proposed to perform the same practical lesson. Animals, pictures, small stuffed toy rats, and illustrations were all effective to promote learning, and the detective case context was considered by students as inviting and stimulating. The activity can be easily performed independently of the institution's purchasing power. The practical lesson stimulated the scientific method of data collection and organization, discussion, and review of thyroid hormone actions to solve the case. Hence, this activity provides a new strategy and alternative materials to teach without animal euthanization.",

First, we designed seven teaching modules that highlight cutting-edge research in Drosophila genetics, metabolism, physiology, and behavior. We then implemented these exercises in a public outreach event that included both children and adults. Quantitative evaluation of participant feedback suggests that these exercises 1) teach principles of animal biology, 2) help laypeople better understand why researchers study fruit flies, and 3) are effective over a wide range of age groups. Overall, this work provides a blueprint for how to use Drosophila as a vehicle for increasing public awareness and appreciation of basic research on genetically tractable insects in particular and invertebrates in general.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have demonstrated a superiority of active learning forms compared with traditional lecture. However, there is still debate as to what degree structuring is necessary with regard to high exam outcomes. Seventy-five students from a premedical school were randomly attributed to an active lecture group, a cooperative group, or a collaborative learning group. The active lecture group received lectures with questions to resolve at the end of the lecture. At the same time, the cooperative group and the collaborative group had to work on a problem and prepare presentations for their answers. The collaborative group worked in a mostly self-directed manner; the cooperative group had to follow a time schedule. For the additional work of preparing the poster presentation, the collaborative and cooperative groups were allowed 50% more working time. In part 1, all groups worked on the citric acid cycle, and in part 2, all groups worked on molecular genetics. Collaborative groups had to work on tasks and prepare presentations for their answers. At the end of each part, all three groups were subjected to the same exam. Additionally, in the collaborative and cooperative groups, the presentations were marked. All evaluations were performed by two independent examiners. Exam results of the active lecture groups were highest. Results of the cooperative group were nonsignificantly lower than the active lecture group and significantly higher than the collaborative group. The presentation quality was nonsignificantly higher in the collaborative group compared with the cooperative group. This study shows that active lecturing produced the highest exam results, which significantly differed from collaborative learning results. The additional elaboration in the cooperative and collaborative learning setting yielded the high presentation quality but apparently could not contribute further to exam scores. Cooperative learning seems to be a good compromise if high exam and presentation scores are expected.",

To complement these lectures, online resources are commonly used. The audio files of heart sounds are available as free downloads on the internet from websites of stethoscope manufacturers such as Thinklabs (http://www.thinklabsmedical.com/sound-library.html) and Littmann (http://solutions.3mindia.co.in/wps/portal/3M/en_IN/Littmann/stethoscope/education/heart-lung-sounds/). The auscultation assistant website of the University of California-Los Angeles (http://www.wilkes.med.ucla.edu/inex.htm) is also an excellent resource for abnormal heart and lung sounds. Heart sounds can also be demonstrated during practical sessions (1). It is, however, interesting for students to see the recording and playback of heart sounds during lecture. Described below is a simple electronic stethoscope that can be used for performing such recordings. It is a modified version of the stethoscope microphone described in a YouTube video available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqjxOapIKbE. This electronic stethoscope will be useful for departments that do not have phonocardiographs, electronic stethoscopes, echocardiography, or ready internet access.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials required.The following materials are required to create the electronic stethoscope (Fig. 1):Fig. 1.A: stethoscope chest piece. B: medical grade tube. C: condenser microphone of the computer microphone. D: condenser microphone. E: stereo plug.Download figureDownload PowerPoint1. An ordinary stethoscope.2. Medical grade tubing.3. A condenser microphone with a 3.5-mm stereo plug.4. A laptop (Microsoft XP/Mac OS or later) with Thinklabs phonocardiography software.Construction.Remove the stem of the stethoscope chest piece (Microtone, India) from the tubing. Attach a medical grade tube of 5 cm length and 6-mm inner diameter to the stem of the chest piece. Insert a condenser microphone on the other end of the tube. This end may have to be heated to facilitate the proper fixing of the microphone. The microphone is then connected to a 3.5-mm stereo plug. Computer microphones already connected to a stereo plug can also be used. The electronic stethoscope is now ready for use.Recording of sounds.The diaphragm of the electronic stethoscope is placed over the mitral area, and the stereo plug of the electronic stethoscope is connected to the microphone input of a laptop installed with Thinklabs phonocardiography software. Sounds are recorded using this software. The software can be freely downloaded from the Thinklabs electronic stethoscope website (http://www.thinklabsmedical.com/software-download.html).It is safer to use a laptop disconnected from the main power supply (floating) and running on battery. More details about the safety precautions can be accessed here: http://www.thinklabsmedical.com/safety/. During recording, the sound waves can be seen on the waveform track of the software (Fig. 2). The microphone input volume may be adjusted to clearly visualize the waveform.Fig. 2.Heart sounds [first heart sound (S1)] recorded using the electronic stethoscope and Thinklabs phonocardiography software.Download figureDownload PowerPointAfter being recorded, the sounds can be played back. Recorded sounds are better heard with headphones. Sounds can be amplified after the selection of an area of interest. Additional functions, such as filtering of the heart sounds, display of the frequency spectrum of the heart sounds, and changing the tempo of the recorded sounds, can also be performed. The software also provides an option to label the heart sounds (Fig. 2). The recorded sounds can be saved in the software format for easy access or can be exported to .wav or .mp3 sound formats. The following link provides more details regarding the use of the phonocardiography software: http://www.thinklabsmedical.com/support-and-manuals/26-electronic-stethoscope/support/74-stethoscope-software-user-manual.html.This electronic stethoscope can also be used for recording Korotkoff sounds (Fig. 3). For this, the diaphragm of the stethoscope is kept over the brachial artery while the blood pressure cuff is inflated and deflated.Fig. 3.Korotkoff sounds recorded using the electronic stethoscope and Thinklabs phonocardiography software.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe making of the electronic stethoscope and the recording of heart sounds and Korotkoff sounds can be seen as a YouTube video at the following link: http://youtu.be/T5UytMyPeSM.RESULTSUse of the electronic stethoscope.Recording and playback of heart sounds with the above electronic stethoscope was demonstrated to 60 undergraduate medical students during a lecture on heart sounds. The recording of Korotkoff sounds and heart sounds was also demonstrated in a laboratory session for students undergoing the M.Tech clinical engineering course.1 In both cases, the students were keenly interested in the recordings.The making of this stethoscope was also given as an assignment to M. Tech clinical engineering students, who were able to construct this quite easily.DISCUSSIONThis electronic stethoscope is simple to construct. It is versatile in that it can be used to record heart sounds and Korotkoff sounds as well as other sounds such as lung sounds and sounds from the joints. This electronic stethoscope is useful for familiarizing the students with the nature of Korotkoff sounds before practical sessions on the recording of blood pressure.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: A.B. conception and design of research; A.B. performed experiments; A.B. analyzed data; A.B. interpreted results of experiments; A.B. prepared figures; A.B. drafted manuscript; A.B. edited and revised manuscript; A.B. approved final version of manuscript.FOOTNOTES1The heart sounds and Korotkoff sounds recorded with this electronic stethoscope are available as Supplemental Material at the Advances in Physiological Education website.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe author thanks Dr. Vinay Timothy Oommen (Department of Physiology, Christian Medical College) for reviewing and editing the manuscript.

    "abstract": "A complete course of respiratory physiology suitable for first-year medical and graduate students has been placed on the Web for our own students and for other educational institutions. There are several reasons for doing this. The first is that the modern-day student uses a variety of options for acquiring knowledge. These include attending lectures, reading texts, iPod downloads, and surfing the internet. This Web-based course is another option that may be preferable for some students. A second reason is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for some medical schools to find faculty members who are willing and able to teach the principles of respiratory physiology. This is a potentially serious problem because a sound knowledge of respiratory physiology will always be necessary for the intelligent practice of medicine. Schools with limited faculty may find it useful to use these Web-based lectures followed by a discussion session with students. Another reason is that some schools have moved away from systematic lectures to case-based discussions, with the possibility that students will not be exposed to some of the principles of respiratory physiology. The hope is that this comprehensive course of lectures will help students to assimilate this important material as the medical school curriculum continues to expand at a rapid rate.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the potential of a self-designed Facebook page on Neuroscience, to supplement in-class teaching as a mode of blended learning. Posts were split into multiple choice questions (MCQs), general interest articles, neuroscience-related external links and resources, and lecture notes and PowerPoint presentations. The study was divided into three distinct phases: before, during, and after the Neuroscience block. Student responses were evaluated via a self-developed questionnaire. Grades achieved by students undertaking the block in 2015 and 2014 were recorded, as were the grades achieved by the same cohort in concurrent blocks in the same year of study. Results showed that ~80% of students reported that use of the page enhanced their overall subject knowledge and exam preparation. Highest page activity occurred during the Neuroscience block. Peak activity occurred directly before summative assessments, with MCQ posts having the highest impact. The cohort of students with access to the Facebook page achieved better grades in the block compared with the previous cohort, despite similar average performance in other subjects. We demonstrate the utility of Facebook as a powerful tool for undergraduate education, supplementing in-class teaching, and assisting in exam preparation, potentially increasing average student performance.",

    "abstract": "Research underscores the importance of retrieval-based practice and application of knowledge for meaningful learning. However, the didactic lecture format continues to persist in traditional university physiology courses. A strategy called whiteboarding, where students use handheld dry erase boards and work in small groups to actively retrieve, discuss, and apply concepts presented in the lecture, has the potential to address challenges associated with actively engaging students in science courses for greater learning. The purpose of this study was to empirically examine the potential benefits of whiteboarding for increasing students' understanding of animal physiology concepts. Student performance on physiology questions assessing concepts taught using lecture only vs. concepts taught using lecture and whiteboarding were compared within the term that whiteboarding was used, as well as across whiteboard and lecture-only terms taught by the same instructor. Results showed that when whiteboarding was incorporated in the course, student performance on items that assessed concepts corresponding to the whiteboarding activities were significantly higher compared with performance on items that assessed concepts taught through lecture only. These patterns in student performance were found within and across terms. Taken together, findings point to whiteboarding as an effective tool that can be integrated in traditional lecture courses to promote students' understanding of physiology.",

    "abstract": "The ability to clearly disseminate scientific knowledge is a skill that is necessary for any undergraduate student within the sciences. Traditionally, this is accomplished through the instruction of scientific presentation or writing with a focus on peer-to-peer communication at the expense of teaching communication aimed at a nonscientific audience. One of the ramifications of focusing on peer-to-peer communication has presented itself as an apprehension toward scientific knowledge within the general populace. This apprehension can be seen in a variety of venues, including the traditional media, popular culture, and education, which generally paint scientists as aloof and with an inability to discuss scientific issues to anyone other than other scientists. This paper describes a curriculum designed to teach Introduction to Anatomy and Physiology students the tools necessary for communicating complex concepts that were covered during the semester using approachable language. Students were assessed on their word usage in associated writing activities, the student's ability to reduce complexity of their statements, and performance in an informal scientific presentation to a lay audience. Results showed that this pedagogical approach has increased students' ability to reduce the complexity of their language in both a written and oral format. This, in turn, led to evaluators reporting greater levels of understanding of the topic presented following the presentation.",

Since community pharmacists are one of the most accessible healthcare providers, this is an opportunity for pharmacists to also engage in this initiative. This study aimed to assess pharmacy student perceptions and knowledge on exercise to determine whether they are adequately prepared to counsel patients on exercise prescription. Third and fourth year pharmacy students were surveyed to test their basic knowledge of exercise prescription. Results show that 93.5% of students agreed or strongly agreed that it is important for pharmacists to counsel patients about exercise. The mean (SD) score for the 11 basic knowledge quiz questions on exercise prescription was 28.9% (SD 16.8), with no significant difference between third and fourth year pharmacy students. While students deemed exercise counseling as important, students proved deficient in exercise prescription knowledge. Schools of pharmacy may consider increasing curricular content to be congruent with this initiative.",

    "abstract": "Evidence shows that biomedical knowledge is more effectively taught within the medical curriculum by teaching in context, to facilitate learning transfer. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of combining high-technology simulation and physiology teaching on medical student learning and experience. First-year medical students received respiratory physiology teaching in the form of lectures, problem-based learning, and practical sessions. These students were then given the opportunity to apply their knowledge and problem solve using respiratory-related clinical case scenarios in simulated patients. Student understanding was assessed using a short quiz performed immediately before and after the session. Results revealed that the session significantly improved the mean score on tests (6.97 ± 0.29 vs. 8.22 ± 0.19, P < 0.001). Student evaluation was collected in focus groups, and recurring concepts were extracted from the data. Students reported that the sessions helped to bridge the gap between theory and practice, which aided their learning. In addition, this teaching methodology (simulation) was reportedly patient centered and added to the realism of the simulated scenario, with students stating that this teaching improved their confidence with managing real patients and clinical uncertainty. Simulation has been used extensively to teach clinical skills; however, research regarding its potential for teaching biomedical science within a clinical context is limited. Our study shows that combining high-technology simulation and physiology teaching contributed to an immediate improvement in medical student knowledge and enhanced their ability to make connections between theoretical knowledge and the world of practice.",

The educational interventions were part of the undergraduate clinical medical education curriculum and have two parts: 1) an asynchronous session [online self-learning module (SLM)], and 2) a synchronous session using case-based collaborative learning delivered either mostly face to face, as determined by the instructor ( approach A) or mostly virtual, as determined by the student ( approach B). Both approaches were delivered in the curriculum as planned to 27 students in approach A (26% attending virtually) and 31 students in approach B (90% attending virtually). Approach B required more planning time. Approach A students (26 of 27) agreed that the SLM was valuable as an educational tool. The performance in the summative assessment was similar ( P = 0.49) in both approaches [means (SD): 33.2 points (SD 10.6) approach A vs. 33.2 points (SD 10.1) approach B]. Students reported a similar increase in confidence ( P = 0.33) with setting lifestyle change goals. The two educational approaches presented here address three of the new LM competencies using active collaborative learning. Both approaches are feasible for synchronous delivery to students located at local and distant sites, either face to face or virtual. The increase in the proportion of students attending virtually did not decrease the measured outcomes of learning and perceptions of confidence.",

The analysis used the students’ responses to the yearly institutional questionnaire on the quality of teaching and to a specific questionnaire applied to evaluate the tutorial sessions of 2018–19. Both were anonymous, and the response rate was above 50%. A comparison was also made between the continuous assessment during the tutorial sessions, expressed as a final cumulative score, and the results of an obligatory multiple-choice final test. The students considered the introduced pedagogical changes useful in their different components, such as identification of core concepts, construction of mini-maps, and their inclusion in final global maps. The better performance of the tutors, signaled by the students in 2018–19, was probably due to the preparatory pedagogical sessions.",

    "abstract": "We developed an alternative approach to teach diabetes mellitus in our practical classes, replacing laboratory animals. We used custom rats made of cloth, which have a ventral zipper that allows stuffing with glass marbles to reach different weights. Three mock rats per group were placed into metabolic cages with real food and water and with test tubes containing artificial urine, simulating a sample collection of 24 h. For each cage, we also provided other test tubes with artificial blood and urine, simulating different levels of hyperglycemia. The artificial “diabetic” urine contained different amounts of anhydrous glucose and acetone to simulate two different levels of glycosuria and ketonuria. The simulated urine of a nondiabetic rat was prepared without the addition of glucose or acetone. An Accu-Chek system is used to analyze glycemia, and glycosuria and ketonuria intensity were analyzed by means of a Urocolor bioassay. In the laboratory classroom, students were told that they would receive three rats to find out which one has type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. To do so, they had to weigh the animals, quantify the water and food ingestion, and analyze the artificial blood and urine for glycemia, glycosuria, and ketonuria. Only at the end of class did we reveal that the urine and blood were artificial. Students were instructed to plot the data in a table, discuss the results within their group, and write an individual report. We have already used this practical class with 300 students, without a single student refusing to participate.",

A structured questionnaire containing 16 item statements, 8 items on an Osgood's 5-point semantic differential scale and 8 items on a Likert's 5-point scale, was used. Options were assigned scores of 1-5 according to weightage. For Osgood's semantic differential scale items, a χ(2)-test was done to analyze student attitudes toward the subject. For Likert scale items, mean score and SD were calculated to analyze student opinions of the OSPE. Item validity was assessed by item analysis, and reliability was assessed by calculating Crohnbach's α. The subject as a whole was interesting to 82% of the students (n = 135). The theory was interesting to 75% of the students (n = 132) but complex to 42% (n = 118). The practical was interesting to 93% of the students (n = 134); 76% of the students (n = 104) felt that the practical was simple, whereas 4% felt it was complex. The OSPE was interesting to 79% of the students (n = 131); 57% of the students (n = 116) felt it was simple, whereas 24% found it complex. Components of the subject, intricateness, and student interests were strongly associated. Students chose options on a higher weight scale, favoring the OSPE. Items were found to be valid and reliable. In conclusion, the subject of physiology was interesting but not simple to understand. Student interests varied with the components of the subject, and the components of the subject had varied intricateness. Students were in favor of the OSPE for assessment. The questionnaire used for the study was valid and reliable.",

This educational innovation was carried out with a total of 38 students (fourth year of degree in Biology) in the area of physiology (Advances in Reproduction course) at University of Córdoba in Córdoba, Spain. The design of the project's application methodology consisted of establishing a way in which problems would be tackled in the practical classes. For this purpose, the different tasks were set up so that students could relate them to the concepts learned in the theory classes. On the first day of class, the project was presented to the students. Groups of two to three students worked in the laboratory and set up an outline of the protocol of the practical work that they had done. This outline was performed individually and sent to the lecturers through a learning management system (Moodle). The teachers gave feedback and assessed student submissions. Upon finishing the course, students completed a survey. The project-based learning method promotes practical self-learning on the part of students. This methodology demonstrated to us that it stimulates a critical and self-critical capacity in students, both individually and in groups, and that writing didactic practical material helped students to enhance their theory knowledge. The experiment was a success in view of the scores obtained upon finishing the subject.",

Of 288 enrolled students, 205 consented to sign the attendance register, and 139 to undertake the online survey. Lecture attendance was higher (41%) before the midsemester exam than afterwards (24%), P &lt; 0.001, due to higher attendance by the nursing than nonnursing students. Students who attended ≥50% of lectures consistently got higher academic outcomes than those that attended &lt;50%, e.g., examinations, 11 percent points higher. Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation coefficients for students from both the sign-in and survey showed that there were positive associations between lecture attendance and academic outcomes, which were mainly weak for nursing students ( P ≤ 0.05), with no association for nonnursing students. From the survey, most students who attended lectures did so because they considered they learned more by attending lectures, whereas not liking the lecture time was the most common reason for not attending lectures. In conclusion, even though students have access to lecture recordings, lecture attendance is still a determinant of academic outcomes for some students of pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "The present study explored the nature and frequency of physiology naïve beliefs by investigating novices' understanding of the respiratory system. Previous studies have shown considerable misconceptions related to physiology but focused mostly on specific physiological processes of normal respiration. Little is known about novices' broader understanding of breathing in a clinical context. Our study hypothesized that naïve beliefs could hamper participants' ability to understand the interrelatedness of respiratory structures and functions related to breathing during a clinical complication. The study entailed both quantitative and qualitative foci. A two-tier test was designed and administered to 211 first-year medical students. Participants were asked to choose the correct answer out of a set of four options and to substantiate their choices. Questions were purposefully left open to elicit a wide range of responses. Statistical analysis (SPSS) was done to evaluate the frequency of naïve beliefs. Thematic analysis was used to determine themes within the raw data. The majority of participants selected incorrect answers in the multiple-choice question part of the questionnaire. Results from the thematic analysis yielded a considerable range of naïve beliefs about gas exchange, foundational physics, airflow, anatomic structures, and breathing pathways. An awareness of the existence of such naive beliefs in respiratory physiology will allow educators to address them in their teaching and thereby prevent naïve beliefs transforming into misconceptions.",

The Nernst equation is one example of this, used to predict the potential difference created by the transmembrane ion gradient resulting from uneven ion distribution within cellular compartments and the interstitial space. This relationship remains of fundamental importance to the understanding of electrical signaling in the brain, which relies on current flow across cell membranes. We describe four distinct occasions when the Nernst equation was ingeniously applied in experimental design to illuminate diverse cellular functions, from the dependence of the action potential on Na+ influx to K+ buffering in astrocytes.

A postprogram survey was developed to assess program outcomes and explore ways of improving the program to stimulate URM and disadvantaged students' interest in research and health-related careers. This is a report of those postprogram survey findings. Using a survey research design, an online survey was emailed to participants (n = 88). Data were collected for 6 weeks beginning March 2020. There were 37 multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding education, career choices, and program experiences. Responses were downloaded to statistical software for analyses. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Major themes were identified for qualitative data. Responses were received from 44.3% (n = 39) of former SURP participants. Overall, 59% stated that the SURP influenced their career goals. When asked about mentor-mentee relationships, 69.3% responded that their interactions were excellent or good; 61.5% maintained contact with their mentor after the SURP.

In this report, a novel teaching methodology, \"real-life scenario (RLS) blended teaching,\" is described and its effectiveness in facilitating inquisitive learning in undergraduate medical students is evaluated. This mixed-method study was conducted among three groups (group 1, n = 83; group 2, n = 85; and group 3; n = 79) of undergraduate medical students (18-20 yr) in the neurology and behavioral sciences module. RLS was presented to students in the form of demonstrations, role-plays, videos, and group activities. Group 1 students underwent traditional teaching-learning sessions. Group 2 students underwent RLS blended sessions and were provided with multiple miniassignments in a vignette format. Group 3 students received RLS blended sessions, multiple miniassignments, peer discussions, multiple formative assessments, and facilitator feedback sessions.

Conversely, this paper presents a strategy for combining the teaching and learning of introductory animal and plant biology using the core concepts of biology and physiology as tools for integrative learning. The paper outlines the positioning of organismal biology within a two-semester introductory biology course, the topical organization of an integrated organismal biology module around shared physiological functions, the use of core concepts to facilitate the combined learning of the biology of animals and plants, and some instructional practices that can support core concepts as learning tools for organismal biology. Examples of how core concepts serve to integrate the organismal biology of animals and plants are described and explained. The goal of this approach is to show introductory students that the mastery of core concepts can help them integrate their understanding of organismal biology. More broadly, students acquire skills in using core concepts as learning tools in biology that should enable them to better assimilate more advanced concepts and to achieve a more unified study of the biological sciences as they progress through the curriculum.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This paper is 1) a personal view on why the teaching of introductory animal and plant biology ought to be more integrated and how an integrated module for introductory organismal biology can be designed, and 2) a practical guide to instructors on how core concepts can be used as learning tools to promote the integrated learning of introductory organismal biology.",

The Western IDeA Region comprises seven states: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, and Wyoming. Beginning in 2017, these states developed an interstate 'super-network'-the Regional Alliance of INBRE Networks (RAIN). RAIN's four initiatives are (i) holding regular INBRE program director/principal investigator (PD/PI) communication and strategy sessions, (ii) sharing research Core Facilities and programs, (iii) developing interstate undergraduate student research exchanges, and (iv) promoting interstate research collaborations. The seven INBRE PD/PIs meet monthly, usually virtually, to share administrative best practices, help each other problem-solve, and support one another's competitive renewals. Sharing IDeA-built Core Facilities and programs offers unique and/or faster services for researchers, without states needing to duplicate core capabilities. This substantially reduced costs. In 2019, ID-, MT-, and NM-INBREs estimated that sharing their existing Core Facilities and services saved $27.6 million over the course of one 5-year funding cycle. Each undergraduate summer research program is open to other RAIN-state students, with 29 student participants thus far. Faculty interdisciplinary research is promoted by a Collaboration Studio and special funding. To date, RAIN support has led to 18 scientific presentations and 12 peer-reviewed publications and generated $1,400,000 in new NIH grants. RAIN is a model for other programs to share best practices, enhance interdisciplinary collaborations, limit redundant infrastructure, and share research/mentoring expertise.",

    "abstract": "Competitions outside the medical curriculum provide a platform for medical students to acquire advanced knowledge in specific medical subjects. The Indonesian Medical Physiology Olympiad (IMPhO) is the first and the largest competition in the field of physiology at the national level in Indonesia. It was held for the first time in 2017 and has been an annual physiology competition since then. This competition offers several challenges in different forms, including writing tests and oral rounds, to assess both individual and team capabilities in analyzing and comprehensively understanding human physiology. Consequently, the participants in this competition must have an in-depth understanding of human physiology concepts and develop a winning strategy to become a successful team. This article outlines the preparation strategies employed by the participants of IMPhO in 2022 and how they can be adopted to promote effective study skills for medical students. We conducted a semistructured interview with participants and their accompanying lecturers to explore their strategies for the competition. We highlighted several important strategies, including utilizing resource materials effectively, fostering teamwork, providing mentorship, and emphasizing the role of lecturers as team supervisors. These competition-based learning strategies also can be adopted to promote effective study skills in formal curricula for medical students.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article outlines several important strategies to become a successful team in a physiology competition. These strategies include utilizing resource materials effectively, seeking mentorship, and recognizing the role of lecturers as team supervisors to improve their understanding of human physiology concepts. Furthermore, fostering teamwork and understanding how the competition is structured are crucial for achieving success as a team. These approaches can also be adapted to improve effective study techniques for medical students.",

    "abstract": "Rather than an anatomy-centered study of the nutrition functions of the body (circulation, respiration, food digestion and intestinal absorption of nutrients) - as found in undergraduate physiology textbooks - a more integrative, mechanistic approach to teaching human physiology at undergraduate level in science faculties is presented. Starting from the cell's needs for nutrients and oxygen, this proposal highlights the way in which each organ or apparatus ensures cell function. Then the fundamental physiological concepts of structure-function relationships and matter gradients can be constructed by considering the physicochemical mechanisms involved. The diversity of devices found in circulatory, ventilatory and digestive systems is then examined through the prism of the mechanisms used to maintain gradients in nutrient concentration or gas partial pressure through exchange surfaces. Finally, the systems controlling nutrition functions are studied in fluctuating physiological contexts, such as during physical exercise or fasting. The presented pedagogical approach emphasizes the integration of functions on an organism-wide scale, and focuses teaching on basic mechanisms rather than on the description of structures, while ensuring the transferability of physiological concepts. This pedagogical approach seems particularly relevant for the training of undergraduate students intending to teach biology at secondary education.",

Memes are technological tools widely used in social media that can be used in classrooms to make concepts more visual and humorous. Learning endocrine physiology at university can be challenging, especially the endocrine physiology of the female reproductive system, which involves cyclic changes of female sex hormones and gonadotropic hormones and complex regulation through feedback loops. Thus, we propose using memes as an educational tool for teaching female gonad physiology. In the paper, we provide memes to aid the understanding and stimulate the discussion of every aspect of the endocrine physiology of the female reproductive system.",

    "abstract": "Background: Physiology-related majors often have high academic rigor which may increase undergraduate students’ perceptions of stress and negatively impact mental health and wellbeing. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to explore perceived stress in undergraduate Exercise Physiology (EXPH) students to guide the development of future mental wellness interventions. Methods: EXPH students enrolled in an Advanced Exercise Physiology course were invited to complete the Perceived Academic Stress scale and Cohen’s Perceived Stress Scale at the start of the Fall 2023 semester and after the first unit exam, as well as participate in a semi-structured interview exploring stress and related factors. Results: The Perceived Stress scale scores increased (pre 15.6 ± 7.0 vs. post 18.8 ± 6.1, p&lt;0.00001) over time; however, the Perceived Academic Stress scale scores did not change (pre 52.3 ± 10.2 vs. post 52.2 ± 10.5, p=0.95). Ten students were interviewed and all reported medium to high levels of academic and “life” stress. Major sources of stress included program expectations, coursework load, family pressures, financial stress, and life balance. Most students reported good coping skills and stress management strategies such as exercising, time management, planning, and self-care. Conclusion: This study highlights the significant levels of both general and academic stress experienced by undergraduate physiology students, with program expectations and the integration of academic and personal stressors emerging as key contributors. The results informed several proposed strategies to support students’ overall well-being and academic performance.",

    "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming educational practices, particularly in assessment. While AI may support the students in idea generation and summarization of source materials, it also introduces challenges related to content validity, academic integrity, and the development of critical thinking skills. Educators need strategies to navigate these complexities and maintain rigorous, ethical assessments that promote higher-order cognitive skills. This manuscript provides practical guidance for educators on designing take-home assessments (e.g. research-based assignments) in the AI era. This guidance was developed through a collaborative, consensus-driven process involving a consortium of three educators with diverse academic backgrounds, career stages, and perspectives on AI in education. Members, holding experience in higher education across the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Australia, and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, brought varied insights into AI's role in education. The team engaged in an iterative process of refining recommendations through bi-weekly virtual meetings and offline discussions. Four key recommendations are presented: (1) Co-developing AI literacy among students and educators, (2) designing assessments that prioritize process over output, (3) validating learning through AI-free assessments, and (4) preparing students for AI-enhanced workplaces by developing AI communication skills and promoting human-AI collaboration. These strategies emphasize ethical AI use, personalized feedback, and creativity. By adopting these approaches, educators can balance the benefits and risks of AI in assessments, fostering authentic learning while preparing students for the challenges of an AI-driven world.",

Here, we provide a flexible, dry-lab data-analysis activity that eliminates the need for direct blood sampling and instead focuses on teaching analytical skills and theoretical knowledge. This article presents a dry-lab/classroom-ready dataset and teaching approach that allows students to analyze the endocrine regulation of metabolism following the consumption of foods predominantly composed of fat, protein, or carbohydrates. By examining real data on blood glucose and insulin responses, students gain a deeper understanding of how macronutrient intake influences metabolic pathways. Methods &amp; Data: A pilot set of data (originally collected with appropriate ethical approval) is provided, showing blood glucose and insulin levels from 15 participants randomly assigned to consume a food primarily composed of either fat, protein, or carbohydrates. This dataset is intended for in-class data analysis, where students predict and interpret changes in blood glucose and insulin using statistical tests. Results: Postprandial glucose and insulin levels increased most dramatically after carbohydrate intake, whereas protein and fat intake produced more modest with minimal insulin changes. These findings align with expected endocrine responses and provide a rich dataset for student exploration of metabolic regulation. Conclusions: Shifting from direct laboratory work to data-driven classroom analysis offers an accessible way to teach endocrine metabolism. By using real-world data, students can practice experimental design skills, interpret statistical findings, and better understand how diet influences blood glucose and insulin levels.",

This article identifies three main causes underlying the confusion: 1) inconsistent interpretations of mathematically defined terms, 2) a gap between physiologic and material science terminology, and 3) a lack of illustration of the interrelationships among these terms. To address these problems, we divide these terms into three groups: terms measuring how easily a structure can be deformed, terms measuring the stiffness of a structure (i.e., how resistant a structure is to deformation), and other terms. Through clarifying the terms in groups and introducing two fundamental terms in material science (Young's modulus and bulk modulus) that are often missing in physiology education, the problems above are resolved and a relatively complete picture of the mechanical property-related terms is provided. This article serves as a critical resource for physiology educators, researchers, and clinicians and a robust foundation for improved teaching, research, and clinical applications of tissue mechanics.",

In this study, we investigate the impact of a co-curricular undergraduate lab skills program, the Practical Skills Passport (PSP), on student lab confidence. PSP tasks were designed based on informal student feedback and refined via pilot testing by postgraduates with no wet lab experience. Sessions were delivered weekly during the 2021-22 and 2022-23 academic years. Impact was evaluated using a survey of students who had attended at least one PSP session. Students at various stages of study on Neuroscience and Biology undergraduate programs attended the PSP. Survey respondents indicated that they felt their confidence in their lab skills improved following PSP attendance. Survey respondents rated the PSP positively overall and expressed interest in attending again. Attendance at the PSP peaked in the first few weeks of semester 1 in each year and declined thereafter, indicating that students are more interested in lab skills practice after returning from the summer break. Fewer students attended in 2022-23 compared to 2021-22, probably reflecting the return to all in-person learning as COVID-19 restrictions lifted. In general, ‘core’ lab tasks were more popular in 2021-22, and specialized tasks more popular in 2022-23.",

    "abstract": "To address the ambiguity regarding learning style preferences as predictors of academic success, this study examines the relationship between learning style preferences, gender, lecture attendance, and academic performance among undergraduate dental students. Learning style preferences using the VARK questionnaire were assessed in 326 undergraduate dental students. Their gender, attendance, and academic scores were recorded to analyze correlations. The results showed that 58% of students preferred a multimodal learning style, with kinesthetic being the most common unimodal preference (23.6%). A significant correlation was found between lecture attendance and academic performance (p &lt; 0.001), as 69.2% of students scoring below 50% were irregular attendees. However, some high-achieving (scores ≥70%) students were also irregular attendees, suggesting that self-directed study strategies may compensate for missed lectures. No significant association was observed between gender and lecture attendance or academic performance, reinforcing prior findings that multiple factors beyond gender influence academic success. Additionally, no significant correlation was found between assessed learning styles and academic performance, challenging the effectiveness of learning style-based instruction. A significant discrepancy between students assessed and perceived learning styles (p &lt; 0.05) indicated that students may not accurately identify their learning preferences, relying instead on perceived preferences during independent study. Given these findings, adapting teaching strictly to assessed learning styles may be an inefficient use of resources. Instead, fostering active learning environments and emphasizing evidence-based study strategies may be more beneficial. These findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on learning styles and highlight the importance of research-driven educational practices in health professional education.",

Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted using an online, self-administered questionnaire which was designed specifically for this study and has not been previously validated to evaluate the prevalence, types, and practices of online resource usage to study Physiology. All second-year medical students who had recently completed the second MBBS examination in 2024 were recruited. Results: Out of 185 students who responded, 77.8% used recommended textbooks as the preferred choice to study physiology. On the other hand, 100% reported use of online resources. Most students (n=171) used smartphones for internet access. ChatGPT was the preferred online tool for 71.9% (n=133), while 76.2% (n=141) used YouTube to watch online video clips to understand Physiology concepts. Notably, 54.05% (n=100) used YouTube videos at random, while 16.7% used Ninja Nerd and 16.2% used Khan Academy. A total of 52% (n=96) utilized video materials on most days while 81% of students first searched online for answers before consulting their lecturers. Most students (76.6%) mentioned that videos are easy to understand. Over half (54.57%) strongly agreed or agreed with ‘fact-checking’ using recommended textbooks, articles, or lecture materials provided by the Physiology Department. Conclusion: Most students prefer online resources like ChatGPT and YouTube for learning Physiology, showing a shift towards digital tools. Although many students fact-check content, clear guidance on selecting reliable online materials is necessary, given their widespread usage.",

It has been postulated that students with a growth mindset, who believe they can improve their abilities through dedication, effort, and learning may have deeper intentions when learning, thereby enabling a deeper understanding. However, the relationship between students’ mindset and their learning intentions remains unexplored. Using a mixed-method study we examined the relationship between mindset, learning intentions and academic performance in second-year biomedical science students ( n consent = 256). Through inductive and deductive thematic analysis of open-ended questions, we determined students’ mindsets and learning intentions. Qualitative themes were then quantified to determine theme-response frequencies. Statistical analysis was then conducted to assess the relationship between mindsets, learning intentions and academic performance. Nearly two-thirds of students held a growth mindset about their bioscience ability. Growth mindset students reported a greater number of deep learning intentions and achieved higher academic performance compared to fixed mindset students. Targeted interventions to further support growth-oriented beliefs and address fixed or mixed mindsets may facilitate positive changes in students’ learning intentions.",

    "abstract": "Video games have been used more frequently in educational settings in recent years. Research investigating the efficacy of games with an educational focus are predominantly utilised in primary and secondary school settings, but educational games with sufficient complexity could have utility in tertiary-education. Minecraft Education Edition (MEE) is an immersive, three-dimensional game where players/students have freedom to use and manipulate a variety of blocks, akin to “virtual Lego”. The open world and creative nature of MEE fosters collaborative play, and the freedom to build structures, switches, and other mechanisms allows educators to create functional and interactive models of physiological systems. This paper describes how MEE was used to teach skeletal muscle and cardiac physiology to second-year university students through creation of custom-made interactive worlds. Exploration of the virtual skeletal muscle and heart were run as an on-campus activity. In the first teaching activity, a virtual 3D interactive model was created in MEE where students activated distinct processes of skeletal muscle excitation, EC coupling, and contraction. In the second teaching activity, a 3D interactive model of the heart was created in MEE where students controlled each part of the cardiac cycle. Both activities were followed by a custom-made “escape room” style quiz, followed by an in-class discussion aimed to highlight any limitations of the models. This paper explores how these virtual models were created, providing a detailed description of the learning activities, and discusses the benefits, limitations, and relevant educations theories of using Minecraft Education Edition in physiology teaching.",

    "abstract": "Medical education has undergone major reforms with integrated and flipped curricula aiming to enhance active learning and clinical relevance. However, these models often assume a uniform learner profile, potentially disadvantaging nontraditional medical students (NTMS) who bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and challenges. This paper explores who NTMS are, how curricular design impacts their learning, and what targeted strategies support their success. Reviewing current literature, we highlight the importance of flexible pacing, mentorship, recognition of varied strengths, and pipeline initiatives tailored to NTMS. Examples from physiology education illustrate how integration and active learning can be structured inclusively. We also present institutional models providing practical accommodations and representation for NTMS. Together, these insights offer a framework for medical schools to foster equity and inclusion, ensuring diverse learners thrive and contribute fully to the healthcare workforce.",

    "abstract": "Despite legal protections under the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, Indian medical curricula lack trans-affirmative competencies—skills essential for providing respectful, evidence-based care to transgender and gender-diverse individuals. This pilot curriculum development study aimed to longitudinally embed trans-affirmative competencies into the first-year physiology curriculum across theory, practical, ethics, and early clinical exposure (ECE) sessions. Conducted at a public medical school in Delhi, the study involved 170 first-year MBBS students over 11 months (August 2023–June 2024). Using Kern‘s Six-Step Approach to curriculum development, we adapted and aligned 16 trans-affirmative competencies with the five roles of the Indian Medical Graduate: Clinician, Leader, Professional, Communicator, and Lifelong Learner. These were delivered across 1,005 minutes (16 hours 45 minutes), primarily during ethics (48%) and ECE (36%) sessions. Health humanities tools—such as trigger films, Theatre of the Oppressed, lived experiences sessions, thinking ethics, storytelling and poetry—were used to foster empathy and engage learners with complex socioethical issues. Feedback from all 11 facilitators (100% response rate) indicated unanimous support for the appropriateness and effectiveness of the competencies. Student feedback (92.3% response rate, n=157) showed 69.0% found the addition relevant to learning, and 80.6% deemed it essential for future practice. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating trans-affirmative competencies without disrupting core curricula. It provides a replicable model for incorporating gender-inclusive medical education and highlights the transformative potential of humanities-based pedagogy in fostering inclusive, rights-based healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Objective To present a holistic approach to teaching physiology and bioscience by embedding self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies into course design, to address persistent learning challenges faced by students in health-related disciplines. Background Health science students often report difficulty with bioscience and physiology subjects due to their conceptual complexity and volume of content. These difficulties are frequently accompanied by low self-efficacy and poor study skills. This paper proposes a meta-curriculum that integrates evidence-based SRL strategies with physiology content to improve student engagement and learning outcomes. Design The approach embeds SRL strategies into a learning cycle framework aligned with the phases of forethought, performance, and self-reflection. Strategies are explicitly taught within the discipline context, allowing students to develop and apply them progressively throughout the course. Methods Each phase of the cycle is aligned with content delivery and reinforced through explicit instruction, instructor modelling, and guided practice. Cognitive, metacognitive, and resource management strategies are introduced and applied within the context of the discipline. Results Students engaging with this integrated approach are better equipped to manage their learning, select effective strategies, and develop self-efficacy. The approach is particularly beneficial for students who may not actively seek learning support. Conclusions Integrating SRL within physiology instruction can enhance both academic performance and learner confidence. A meta-curriculum structured around self-regulated learning offers a transferable model for improving learning outcomes across bioscience and health education contexts.",

With the World Health Organization identifying climate change as the single biggest health threat facing humanity, health professionals must be prepared for the impacts of a changing climate, biodiversity loss, and pollution. There is an expectation that they will also need to practice sustainable and climate-resilient healthcare. Following limited beneficial outcomes in a first attempt to include PH content in an introductory Physiology subject for health sciences and medicine pathway students at an Australian university, we utilized an educational research design theory and design-based research methodology to develop, implement, and evaluate the integration of PH into a Physiology subject. Key stakeholders (students and tutors) provided ongoing feedback at regular points before, during, and at the end of the 12-week semester. Based on the findings, we offer evidence-based recommendations for integrating PH into an existing subject that avoids overloading an already busy curriculum. Recommendations include providing a clear definition of PH at the start of the semester, embedding a weekly ‘fact’ in lecture slides, engaging learners in discussions during tutorials, linking PH concepts during hands-on practical laboratories, and establishing a dedicated PH learning objective for the subject.",

    "abstract": "The effects of the 1938 fascist anti-Semitic laws on the development of Physiology in Italy are discussed, focusing on the replacement of five full professors of Human Physiology expelled from the Universities of Bologna, Milan, Turin, Genoa and Palermo. The academic community immediately took action to fill the vacant positions, in the spirit of business as usual. Replacements were made via either transfer of tenured professors or appointment of chair competition winners as tenure-track professors. Previous universities of the substitutes (Pavia, Siena, Messina, Parma) were also indirectly involved. Replacement proposals formulated by each university were approved by Giuseppe Bottai, minister of National Education. Overall, about half of the 17 physiology chairs present in Italy were involved with a significant and sudden generational change. Based upon biographical and scientific profiles of the expelled professors and their replacements, analysis is carried out on the ensuing qualitative effects on research activity. For the Italian physiology community, the impact was positive, or at least not negative in some cases, with the formation of important schools of research. In any case, the moral evaluation can only be negative on the tacit acceptance of expulsions for racial reasons, considered as ordinary administration or even as an opportunity for a more rapid career. Seen from this perspective, those distant events offer an occasion of reflection and a lesson still valid for all of us today.",

Hence there is a critical need for potential innovative solutions to enhance students’ understanding of physiological concepts. Therefore, this study aimed (a) to evaluate the gain in knowledge and retention with computer assisted simulation (CAS) vs traditional (TT) teaching learning strategies in first year medical and paramedical students, and (b) to obtain students’ and faculty feedback about strengths and limitations of both strategies. Medical and paramedical students, with prior theoretical knowledge, were separately randomized into CAS or TT groups after consenting. Knowledge gain and retention were assessed using multiple-choice questionnaires before, immediately after, and 15 days post-exposure. Faculty and students feedback on the strengths and limitations of the teaching-learning strategies was collected. Results showed similar knowledge gain in both CAS and TT groups for medical students (CAS: 16.76 ± 3.69, TT: 15.94 ± 3.75, p &lt; 0.001), with significantly better retention in CAS (16.10 ± 3.40) compared to TT (13.38 ± 3.21, p &lt; 0.001). For paramedical students, knowledge gain was comparable, but retention was reduced in CAS (9.60 ± 2.23) compared to TT (10.35 ± 1.76, p &lt; 0.05). Students appreciated the use of CAS program and suggested a blended learning module. In conclusion, integrating a blended learning module (CAS and TT) into the undergraduate curriculum can be an effective alternative to enhance knowledge gain and retention.",

To understand how the Lt platform was used by students and whether it enhanced their learning experience in physiology, we conducted a survey and questionnaire. We focused on students’ access to Lt activities and examined any gender differences in the utilization of, and attitudes towards, these activities in a ‘Fundamentals of Medicine’ module for first-year medical students (n=65). The study revealed a strong student preference for asynchronously delivered lecture material over in-person didactic lectures, primarily due to the flexibility it offered. However, online Lt labs were less favoured due to a perceived lack of engagement. Supplementary online materials, such as videos, did not significantly enhance the learning experience. Students positively evaluated both synchronous and asynchronous online assessments and proposed their integration with online pre-recorded lectures. Notably, the usefulness score for synchronous assessment using the online response system Socrative was higher in males compared to females (8.8±1.9 vs. 7.5±2.2, p=0.006). Whilst most students acknowledged the time investment required for Lt activities, some recognized their value in reinforcing challenging concepts. Overall, our findings suggest that a balanced approach, leveraging both online and in-person methods, can optimize the learning experience in physiology education. This approach accommodates different learning preferences and needs, ultimately enhancing student engagement and comprehension.",

This study evaluated a three-component intervention to enhance student learning that consisted of instruction about the advantages of retrieval and distributed practices, encouragement of independent application of these methods, and the use of pop quizzes to facilitate retrieval and foster distributed studying. Student exam scores were compared in two sections of a university sports nutrition course that differed in only one experimentally relevant way: one received the three-component intervention (DD Strategy Group) whereas the other did not (Control Group). During the DD Strategy Group’s first class meeting, the instructor gave the students a 30-minute tutorial in which he introduced retrieval and distributed practices and then summarized the evidence demonstrating the learning advantages of each. The DD Strategy Group also completed 10 pop retrieval quizzes during the semester, each of which consisted of 3-5 short answer questions and took roughly 10 min to complete. A MANOVA with follow up t-tests revealed that the DD Strategy Group outscored the Control Group on course Exam 1 ( t 45 = 2.50, P = 0.02, d = 0.8), Exam 2 ( t 45 = 3.35, P &lt; 0.001, d = 1.0), Exam 3 ( t 45 = 4.38, P &lt; 0.001, d = 1.3), and Exam 4 ( t 45 = 4.33, P &lt; 0.001, d = 1.3).

Furthermore, many existing programs have limited platform cross-compatibility, with few compatible with the most ubiquitous and accessible device in a typical classroom, the mobile phone. In addition to advances in large language model-assisted programming, there has been a boom in the popularity of HTML5/JavaScript-based videogame development software targeted towards non-programmers. Consequently, there are now tools available that have significantly lowered the barrier to entry with regard to instructors taking creative control over the production of interactive content suitable for their own specific classroom needs. By focusing on the HTML5/JavaScript framework, these applications can be accessed on any device capable of running a browser, making them easy for students to use in the classroom and to integrate effectively into any Learning Management System. Here, we suggest that the use of such tools might prove particularly valuable for instructors of physiology and pharmacology, permitting the creation of interactive content tailored to the instructor’s own teaching style and that better meet the needs of the enrolled students. In doing so, we highlight some of the options available and provide examples of the kinds of applications instructors can produce with these methods.",

This study evaluated whether integrating CCs into FL improves medical students’ performance in a three-week cardiovascular physiology module. Methods: Third-year medical students were divided into two groups: a control group receiving standard FL (n = 85) and an experimental group receiving FL+CCs (n = 90). Performance was assessed via a formative quiz (30-35% participation rate) to identify early learning trends and a final exam. Quiz results were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, and final exam responses were analyzed with chi-square tests. Students’ perceptions were collected via questionnaires. Results: The FL+CCs group had a higher median quiz score (68.75%) than the FL group (62.50%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.14). On the final exam, the FL+CCs group had significantly more correct responses (695/900 vs. 609/850; 77.2% vs. 71.8%; p = 0.008), driven primarily by improved performance on the homeostasis questions (56.7% vs. 40%; p = 0.003). In addition, 60% of students in the FL+CCs group reported that the FL+CCs approach enhanced their understanding of cardiovascular physiology. Conclusion: Integrating CCs into FL was associated with improved medical students’ performance in cardiovascular physiology, primarily due to better performance on homeostasis CC. Studies with a broader assessment scope and extended implementation periods are needed to further evaluate educational benefits of the FL+CCs approach.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether, in comparison with naive students, experienced students who have completed an elementary physiology course 1) have a greater knowledge level of physiology and 2) perform better in an upper division physiology course. The educational setting for this study was the cardiovascular block of an advanced undergraduate level course entitled Principles of Human Physiology (PGY 412). The study employed students who had completed elementary physiology (PGY 206) at the University of Kentucky (group 1), students who had completed elementary physiology in another academic program (group 2), and naive students with no prior physiology experience (group 3). A cardiovascular pretest was presented during the opening session of the cardiovascular block in PGY 412. Respective scores for the three groups were 29.4%, 31.7%, and 24.1%, and there were no significant between-group differences. Respective scores on the same pretest items given as a posttest at the end of the cardiovascular block were 90.4%, 91.4%, and 90.4%, and, again, there were no significant between-group differences. Respective scores on other cardiovascular test items given at the end of the block were 78.9%, 78.7%, and 81.1%. Interestingly, the highest score here was achieved by the naive students (group 3), but, once again, between-group differences were not significant. In summary, on the basis of pretest/posttest examination of cardiovascular physiology between naive and experienced students, the results of this study indicate 1) that the common assumption that students entering advanced level physiology courses have a significant retention of knowledge from elementary physiology is not valid and 2) that completion of an elementary physiology course does not offer an advantage in learning advanced material.",

In the model presented, the kidneys are described as a limited space with a positive interstitial hydrostatic pressure. Traffic of water, sodium, and urea is described in levels (or horizons) of different osmolarity, governed by osmotic forces and positive interstitial pressure. In this way, actions of the countercurrent multiplier in nephron tubules and of the countercurrent exchanger in vasa recta are integrated in each horizon. We hope that this approach can help students to better accept conventional presentations in their textbooks.",

A questionnaire that determined whether students thought about body functions in a teleologic (why) or mechanistic (how) manner was administered to the following categories of students: 1) a class of high school biology students, 2) classes of students taking elementary college-level physiology courses, and 3) college students in advanced physiology courses. Overall, there was an average 61% teleologic response among the various classes, and differences between the classes were not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05). To address objective 3, one of the classes was presented the questionnaire after being given a lecture on teleology vs. mechanistic approaches to body function. The average teleological response of this class was only 12%, a value significantly lower in comparison, by a one-way analysis of variance, to any of the other groups (P less than 0.0001). These results indicate that the students have a strong tendency to think of body functions in teleological terms and that this tendency can be modified on a short-term basis by a direct discussion (by an instructor) of teleologic vs. mechanistic thinking.",

    "abstract": "Sleep exerts major effects on most fundamental homeostatic mechanisms. Current data suggest, however, that students of physiology and medicine typically receive little or no formal teaching in sleep. Because sleep takes up a significant component of our life span, it is proposed that current teaching in systems and integrative physiology is not representative if it is confined to functions describing wakefulness only. We propose that sleep can be readily integrated into various components of physiology and medical curricula simply by emphasizing how commonly taught physiological processes are importantly affected by sleep mechanisms. In our experience, this approach can be used to reinforce basic physiological principles while simultaneously introducing sleep physiology into the students' training. We find that students have a general and inherent interest in sleep and related clinical disorders, and this proves useful as an effective means to teach the material. In this paper, examples of how sleep influences motor control and the respiratory system will illustrate these points. These considerations also highlight some important gaps in traditional teaching of respiratory physiology.",

    "abstract": "68A realistic research experience is beneficial to undergraduate students, but it is often difficult for liberal arts colleges to offer this opportunity. We describe two approaches for developing and maintaining an interdisciplinary research program at small colleges. An active and continuing involvement of an individual with extensive research experience is an essential element in both. One model was developed by the faculty of Taylor University, Upland, IN and a research scientist who had retired from a major university to join the Taylor faculty as their first Research Professor. The school's Science Research Training Program was initially funded by a modest endowment provided by interested alumni and by extramural grants awarded to the Research Professor and to the institution; the program now enjoys significant funding from diverse sources. Taylor is not located near any large research university and consequently supplies all resources required for the experiments and stipends for students pursuing projects full-time during the summer. The second model was developed by the faculty at Asbury College in Wilmore, KY, working with a scientist having a full-time appointment at the University of Kentucky and a part-time appointment at the college. In this approach, Asbury faculty may place their students for a period of training, often during the summer, in a laboratory of a cooperating host faculty at the University of Kentucky or other institution. The host faculty funds the research and pays a stipend to those students who work full-time during the summer. Relationships established between faculty at the College and at the University of Kentucky have been mutually beneficial. The success of both programs is evidenced by the students' presenting their data at state and national scientific meetings, by their publishing their results in national journals, and by the undergraduate school faculty developing independent research programs.",

    "abstract": "It is generally acknowledged that an integrated approach to teaching cardiovascular system (CVS) is clinically relevant. However, very little attention has been paid with respect to student perception of teaching CVS in an integrated problem-based curriculum. A questionnaire on the feedback and perception of medical students (n = 60) to their learning experience of CVS exposed early in the problem-based integrated curriculum at the Arabian Gulf University (AGU) was used. The average percentage scores of positive student responses to items related to knowledge was 62.7%, to integration was 87.3%, and to skills was 77.1%. A significant positive correlation was observed among skills and knowledge (r = 0.408, P = 0.002), skills and integration (r = 0.506, P < 0.000), and integration and knowledge (r = 0.294, P = 0.028). The lowest individual percentage score related to knowledge items was given to the role of resource sessions in understanding difficult concepts (32.7%). Interestingly, 90.7% of the students were aware of the presence of gaps in their knowledge. On the other hand, 92.7% of students expressed their satisfaction with the study experience of CVS in the integrated problem-based approach. These results indicate that students overall achieved satisfactory learning outcome during the study of CVS in the problem-based integrated curriculum at AGU. The study also points out issues where improvement and fine tuning of the educational system can take place.",

The test was part of a contest and was answered by a sample composed of undergraduate students as well as biologists and practicing biology teachers. The majority of the responders had difficulties in recognizing the existence of gluconeogenesis and the possibility of ATP production using other fuels other than carbohydrates. Biology teachers and biologists seemed to either lack the knowledge or present the misconception regarding energy-yielding metabolism found among students. I argue that in both cases, biology teachers are likely to teach metabolism-related subjects in a manner that may contribute to the appearance of the misconception among high school students.",

In developing countries, these activities are not popular compared with developed countries. In this study, an IT-based assignment was carried out in physiology for undergraduates in Sri Lanka. We assessed certain basic IT capabilities before the assignment and found that the capability of using MS Word, e-mail, and the internet was limited to 68.3%, 62.0%, and 49.2% of students, respectively, with 40.8% of students having some other IT capabilities. We found a considerable variation in IT capabilities among the students, which depended on IT learning at schools and the geographical locations where students came from. The main source of IT knowledge for students was an introductory IT course given in the medical school with the second source being private IT learning centers. Response to the IT-based assignment was very poor. The reasons for poor participation included a lack of time due to parallel subjects, poor IT knowledge, and poor IT resource availability. However, students were willing to have optional IT-based components and were aware that IT knowledge is important for medical students as well as doctors. This study shows the importance of improving IT knowledge in students and the need of improving IT resources in medical schools. With these improvements, physiology education can be enriched with more interactive IT-based learning activities, which help students to acquire knowledge more efficiently and effectively in developing countries like Sri Lanka.",

We used this insight to design and implement a multidisciplinary undergraduate course with psychoactive drugs as the central theme. The Medical Science of Psychoactive Drugs examines the biological mechanisms underlying all major effects of psychoactive drugs, including the effects on the brain and other organs and tissues. Physiological principles, molecular mechanisms, and genetic factors involved in drug-induced therapeutic and adverse effects are emphasized. The course is open to undergraduate students at all levels and carries no prerequisites, and enrollment is limited to approximately 50 students. Major teaching modes include lecture, short homework papers on topics related to the previous class meeting, small-group discussions at several points during each class, and whole class discussions. Because of the diversity of students' knowledge of basic science, we employ a variety of methods designed to help students grasp the necessary scientific concepts. Our methods are intended to be inquiry based and highly interactive. Our goals are 1) to foster the development of an organized knowledge base about psychoactive drugs that will have practical applicability in the daily lives of the students; 2) to promote the rational application of this knowledge in thinking about current medical, social, legal, and ethical issues involving psychoactive drugs; and 3) to cultivate science literacy, critical thinking, and communication skills among students.",

    "abstract": "Many undergraduate institutions offer individual research opportunities for upper-level students in independent study courses and summer undergraduate research programs. These are necessarily limited to a small number of students. Greater numbers of students can benefit from incorporating student-directed investigative experiences into laboratories in standard courses. In human performance investigations, any single course may not offer sufficient numbers of subjects to adequately test hypotheses comparing population groups or to examine longitudinal trends. In this exercise physiology course, exercise testing was conducted in three areas: 1) techniques of body composition analysis, 2) field tests for the estimation of maximal oxygen consumption, and 3) maximal anaerobic and aerobic power. All students enrolled over a 10-yr period participated as subjects and as testers. Working in small research groups, students added their results to those from previous years, generated a variety of hypotheses (correlations between tests, subgroup differences, etc.), and tested them statistically using the complete data set of 217 subjects. They then engaged in collaborative writing and peer review to prepare formal papers on their results. The multiyear approach allowed students to situate their work within and contribute to the accumulation of a large database and to practice essential scientific skills of hypothesis formation, data collection and analysis, collaborative work, and scientific communication. In addition, due to the larger number of subjects available to analyze, students observed statistically significant differences between test groups in the multiyear database that they were unable to demonstrate when conducting analysis on a single course. Finally, the large number of subjects and statistical power offered by the use of the database provides distinct pedagogical advantages.",

    "abstract": "Student researchers in physiology courses often interact with human subjects in classroom research but may be unfamiliar with the professional ethics of experimenter-subject interactions. This communication describes experiences related to an interactive video used in exercise science and general biology courses to help students become aware of, sensitive to, and comfortable with implementing professional ethics into their own thinking and behavior as researchers before entering the laboratory. The activity consisted of a filmed exercise physiology experiment complemented with interactive question sheets followed by small- and large-group discussion and culminating with individual student reflections. Student written responses from multiple courses indicated that students were able to 1) identify and consider the ethics of experimenter-subject interactions from the movie, 2) generalize broader ideas of professional ethics from those observations, and 3) consider their observations in terms of future experiments they would be conducting personally and how they should interact with human subjects. A majority of students indicated a positive reaction to the video and identified specific aspects they appreciated. It is hoped that this report will encourage other instructors to consider the use of interactive videos in the teaching and learning of professional ethics related to their courses.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a particularly important and challenging concept for students to integrate into a memorable framework for building further knowledge and solving clinical problems. In this study, 76 first-year veterinary students and 19 veterinarians in clinical specialty training (house officers) participated in separate online exercises to evaluate the use of a computer-animated model of GFR regulation (www.aamc.org/mededportal) on learning outcome. Students were randomly allocated to study either the animated model or written materials before completion of a 10-question multiple-choice quiz. House officers completed a 35-question test before and after study of the animated model. Both groups completed a survey about the learning exercise. The ability of the model to enhance learning was demonstrated by a significant improvement (P < 0.001) in the test performance of house officers after studying the model. The model performed similarly to written materials alone in affecting the subsequent quiz performance of the students. The majority of students and house officers agreed or strongly agreed that the animated model was easy to understand, improved their knowledge and appreciation of the importance of GFR regulation, and that they would recommend the model to peers. Most students [63 of 76 students (83%)] responded that they would prefer the use of the animated model alone over the study of written materials but acknowledged that a combination of hardcopy written notes and the animated model would be ideal. A greater applicability of the model to more advanced students and an introduction in a didactic setting before individual study were suggested by the house officers. The results of this study suggest that the animated model is a useful, effective, and well-received tool for learning and creating a visual memory of the regulatory mechanisms of GFR.",

    "abstract": "Due to growing demand from students and facilitated by innovations in educational technology, institutions of higher learning are increasingly offering online courses. Subjects in the hard sciences, such as pathophysiology, have traditionally been taught in the face-to-face format, but growing demand for preclinical science courses has compelled educators to incorporate online components into their classes to promote comprehension. Learning tools such as case studies are being integrated into such courses to aid in student interaction, engagement, and critical thinking skills. Careful assessment of pedagogical techniques is essential; hence, this study aimed to evaluate and compare student perceptions of the use of case studies in face-to-face and fully online pathophysiology classes. A series of case studies was incorporated into the curriculum of a pathophysiology class for both class modes (online and face to face). At the end of the semester, students filled out a survey assessing the effectiveness of the case studies. Both groups offered positive responses about the incorporation of case studies in the curriculum of the pathophysiology class. This study supports the argument that with proper use of innovative teaching tools, such as case studies, online pathophysiology classes can foster a sense of community and interaction that is typically only seen with face-to-face classes, based on student responses. Students also indicated that regardless of class teaching modality, use of case studies facilitates student learning and comprehension as well as prepares them for their future careers in health fields.",

    "abstract": "Student test score percentages in the Physiology and Disease (PAD) course at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, a high school for students of the state of Illinois gifted in math and science, were studied over a period of 5 yr. Inquiry-based laboratory experiences in the course were slowly converted during this time from partly student centered and mostly teacher led to completely student centered beginning in fall 2008. Quarterly analysis of the effect of increased inquiry upon average weekly report submissions of 400 students over 4 yr showed a significant improvement in submission (P < 0.0002) between quarters 1 and 2 and also improvement from year to year between the academic years of 2006/2007 and 2009/2010 (P < 0.0001). A comparison of student test score percentages from 346 students in 4 major tests showed a significant increase (P = 0.0125) beginning in the academic year of 2008/2009, when the conversion of all laboratories in the course from partly student centered to completely student centered was concluded compared with scores over the 2 yr from 2006/2007 up to this point. There was also a significant difference (P < 00001) in test score percentages between the individual tests themselves over the 4 yr studied. Taking the study a step further, the 35 students registered in the two PAD classes offered in the fall 2010 semester were divided in each of their classes into student-centered and teacher-centered groups, with the former designing all their experiments and the latter following instructions from the teacher. Student score percentages on specific test questions from the four major tests that focused on transfer of student understanding were compared between these two groups. There was a significant improvement (P = 0.012) when students designed their own laboratories (student-centered group) compared with doing what the teacher asked (teacher-centered group). There was also a significant difference between these student score percentages among the individual tests (P < 0.0001). These data suggest that an increase in student-centered experiments may lead to a corresponding increase in test performance on questions involving student transfer.",

For example, in general parlance 'statistics' can mean numerical information, usually data. In contrast, one large statistics textbook defines the term 'statistic' to denote 'a characteristic of a sample, such as the average score', and the word 'parameter' to denote 'a characteristic of a population.' However, for statisticians, statistics means more than just numerical information or a characteristic of a sample. Statistics is also a discipline. It is relevant to all areas of scientific enquiry, and spans study design, data collection, developing methods of analysis and analysing data, interpreting results, and making predictions. Other words that statisticians use carefully, and very particularly, form the cornerstones of statistical reasoning, words such as probability, significance, likelihood. Why does this matter? Well, it may well explain why non-statisticians struggle with the ideas and concepts used by statisticians. The reader is confused by the terminology, not the least because the statistician uses familiar words in different ways, a jargon similar to other professional vocabularies.This necessary precision of language becomes evident when considering one of the statistical methods–the t test–commonly used by biological scientists today. It is worth noting to begin with that Student's t test did not originate in the laboratory, but in the factory. The eponymous Student used his pseudonym to conceal his real name because he worked for a brewery, and his publications had to remain anonymous. He used statistics to measure the quality of the product. In one respect, the things that biologists use in some experiments, such as cell cultures and enzymes, are quite similar to a vat of beer. However, there are also fundamental differences. One of these differences is emphasized later in a quote from Student's famous paper. Another is that the brewer wants to be sure of a uniform product. In contrast, the biologist often wants to show that an experiment has generated a change: a positive result!Student's interest lay in assessing the characteristics of a biological material (such as the raw materials used for the beer). He developed theories to allow him to use measurements of a small sample to estimate the characteristics of the larger amount, for example when he took a small sample from a sack of barley. The overall feature of the sack, such as the average starch content of the grains of barley from the sack, would be termed a 'population parameter.' His ground-breaking paper was 'The probable error of a mean' (3). In it, he writes:'it is sometimes necessary to judge of the certainty of the results from a very small sample, which itself affords the only indication of the variability. Some chemical, many biological, and most agricultural and large scale experiments belong to this class, which has hitherto been almost outside the range of statistical enquiry' (our emphasis).Student's contribution was to determine how best to make inferences about a large population on the basis of statistics computed from a small sample. He developed a test of statistical significance. As an aside, his use of probable error, which was a common expression in the early 20th century, did not refer to the probability of making an error: it was used to indicate the variability of his statistic, showing again how we should use words carefully.It's unlikely, but let's suppose he measured the starch content of each grain in a handful of barley, taken from a sack delivered to the brewery. He wishes to know how well the mean value he obtained from his handful of grains (the sample) will reflect the mean starch content of all the grains in the entire sack. He was aware that in a small sample, randomness would introduce some variation, and also that imprecision in the measurements would also play a part. His method of judging how 'certainly' a small sample can provide a measure of an entire population was later developed in the classical hypothesis testing theory of statistics.He actually didn't know the mean starch content of the entire bag of barley, one of the parameters of the population. To know that would require the measurement of each barley grain in the sack. However, the theoretical starting point of this approach is that we have a population with features that are exactly known, or that these could be determined if necessary. Let's suppose that Student knew that the grains in a sack of barley would have a particular mean starch content. He could then compare this already known value with what he might possibly obtain if he took a small sample of grains at random from the sack. He considered the difference between the known mean starch content of the sack and the mean starch content of barley grains obtained in the sample. He could then calculate the degree of certainty of obtaining such a difference. If he took another, different, sample he could calculate another value for this probability. Each probability is associated with a difference between the real mean and the mean obtained from each random sample (handful). Student's contribution was to characterize the probability distribution of these sample averages, by taking account of the uncertainty in the sample standard deviations. Most of the time we would expect the mean computed from a sample to be fairly close to the mean for the entire bag of barley (Figure 1).Fig. 1.A population is randomly sampled and the sample is measured. Student's contribution was to characterize the probability distribution of obtaining samples with any particular estimate. This distribution took account of the uncertainty in the sample standard deviations. Frequently samples would have their mean close to the population mean. One would not often find a sample with a mean that was very different from the actual mean of the whole population.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe concept of taking repeated samples, each yielding a difference between the estimated value from the sample and the true population value, is the basis of the frequentist approach to statistical reasoning.In Figure 2, we show a population of 5000 values, plotted as a distribution histogram. The mean of the population is very close to 1000. Around it are ranged some random samples, each of 250 values, drawn at random from this population. The means of these samples vary from sample to sample. The probability of finding each sample mean value (or a value further from the population average) in each of these samples can be estimated using Student's procedure. The possibilities are shown, and range from 0.82 to 0.03, in other words from close to 80%, down to less than 3%.Fig. 2.A population of barley grains summarized as a frequency distribution histogram. The values for each grain are related to the average starch content, showing that some grains have more and some less than the average starch content. Placed around the population distribution we show the distributions obtained from random samples that have been taken from the population. Notice that these samples vary more, because the effects of random variation are more obvious when there are only small numbers in the sample.Download figureDownload PowerPointWhen Student published his paper 'The probable error of a mean' he showed how to characterize the possibility of obtaining particular sample means, when repeated samples had been taken from a population with a known mean. More realistically, what he would probably be doing in the brewery would be taking samples from successive bags of what should be a uniform supply, because he wanted a uniform quality of product. If he then found a sample with a mean value that was so extreme that it was improbable, he'd be worried: has the quality of the barley changed? If the samples have mean values that are unlikely, what does this imply? The 'classical hypothesis testing model' was developed to test this concern: is the population mean the same as the standard expected?A later development of Student's t test by R. A. Fisher then allowed comparison of the means of two populations, using a similar line of reasoning, shown in Figure 3. We have drawn random samples from each of two sacks. Using the Student t test, we can judge more formally whether or not the two samples have come from a single population. This can be done by using the measurements of the samples themselves. We are able to calculate, for example, the probability that a particular difference (or something even more extreme) between the sample mean values would have been found in this experiment, if the populations from which they had been drawn had the same mean.Fig. 3.The reasoning behind the Student t test. We have two samples, randomly taken from two populations (different bags). To assess the possibility that the mean in each bag could be different, we hypothesize that these samples are in fact random samples from the SAME population (or more precisely that they are samples from populations with the same mean, which we have taken as having the same, but unknown, standard deviation): this is the null hypothesis.Download figureDownload PowerPointIf we assume that the means of the two populations are equal, and then obtain only a small probability that these samples could be possible, then we must conclude one of two things. We must conclude that either the samples do not support the null hypothesis we have made (that they were drawn from populations with the same mean), or we conclude that our sample has been a rare event. As we have pointed out above, it's more than likely that most experiments do not start with the aim of showing 'no effect', although the readers of a research report may be entitled to ask that the effects that are claimed should be proven. Student's t test, although valuable, doesn't necessarily tell us what we may really want to know. For example, it does NOT give the probability that the samples have in fact come from the same population. Each sample we take will probably have an average starch content that is different from the next. So, Student's t test doesn't give the probability that the null hypothesis IS true. Neither do we have definite evidence that it ISN'T true, nor do we hold evidence that some other alternative possibility IS true. What we do have, using this frequentist system of deduction, is a probability of how consistent our sample estimate of the mean is with an a priori chosen value for the population mean (such as the value chosen in our null hypothesis). We can say how frequently we would have seen as extreme a value for our test statistic, just by chance, if we were able to draw repeated samples, AND the a priori value chosen (null hypothesis) was in fact the true condition.The Student t test merely quantifies the 'Lack of support' for no effect. It is left to the user of the test to decide how convincing this lack might be. A further difficulty is evident in the repeated samples we show in Figure 2: one of those samples was quite improbable because the P value was 0.03 which suggests a substantial lack of support, but that's chance for you! A parody of this effect of multiple sampling, taken to extremes, can be found at http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/09/fmri-gets-slap-in-face-with-dead-fish.html.When fully applied to an experiment, the 'classical hypothesis testing model' (developed later on by Neyman and Pearson) involves up to five successive steps of reasoning, and involves a double negative. Despite this, this process remains the primary means by which biologists interpret their data, and it is the approach taken by most textbooks, and also remains the procedure expected by many journal assessors. One large textbook illustrates the several and substantial errors that even trained scientists can make when asked to interpret a result of a Student t test (2). Nevertheless the book then goes on to state 'when used intelligently the model is extremely useful, and to date has been extremely productive in generating scientific knowledge.' The dominance of these frequentist methods is quite likely to be historical chance, and there is no doubt that these procedures are those expected to be used in most biological science papers. Nevertheless, it can be unnerving to state that the first aim of the process is to describe the probability that one's data, or more extreme values, could have been obtained if in fact there had been no effect in the experiment. Most of the time this is not what most scientists want to know. The question is more commonly 'What effect is there?' or less commonly 'Can I be sure there has been no effect?' and neither of these questions are substantially addressed by the t test.There are other ways to look at data that will be addressed later in this series. Some provide useful alternatives for scientists. For example, non-parametric tests could be considered. Another possibility may be permutation tests (1). (For large samples, this type of test needs a lot of calculation, and this method only became practical with the advent of computers.) A natural extension to significance testing is estimation and, in particular, the use of confidence intervals, where a correspondence with significance testing can be made.Laboratory scientists do not often take random samples of large populations (although they often assume that their samples represent the population). They conduct experiments on a small amount of material, and get results. These results are used as their starting points, the givens, and are used to inform decisions about populations (assuming that the lab sample is a valid reflection of the population as a whole). Frequently, this requires some prior belief or knowledge about the conditions or features of a population, which can then be modified by the experimental results. This approach, based on Bayes' theorem, is attractive because it tackles the question of the probability of an effect, or no effect, or the probability of the hypothesis given the data. Using a Bayesian framework, further concepts are needed. These include likelihood, which is the probability of the data as a function of parameter values, but considers data fixed and the potential parameter values varying. Another important factor is the prior condition, and there is no consideration of repeat sampling. In conclusion, it is worth noting that Student's interpretation of his results in his 1908 paper was in a Bayesian, and not frequentist, spirit, although the approach used was one of pure significance testing.FOOTNOTESThis article is covered by a non-exclusive license between the authors and the Nutrition Society (London, UK) and is being simultaneously published in 2011 in The Journal of Physiology, Experimental Physiology, British Journal of Pharmacology, Advances in Physiology Education, Microcirculation, and Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology as part of a collaborative initiative among the societies that represent these journals.REFERENCES1.

In a physiology-based department, we had a concern that students were altering written tests and resubmitting them for higher grades; thereby compromising the integrity of our primary assessment style. Therefore, we directly quantified the prevalence of AM on written tests in 11 courses across the department. Three thousand six hundred and twenty midterms were scanned, and any midterm submitted for regrading was compared with its original for evidence of AM. Student characteristics, test details, and course information were recorded. On a department level, results show that this form of AM was rare: prevalent on 2.2% of all tests written. However, of the tests submitted for regrading, 17.4% contained AM (range: 0-26%). The majority of AM was conducted by high-achieving students, (60% of offenders earned >80%), and there was a trend toward women being more likely to commit AM (P = 0.056). While our results objectively show that this type of AM is low, we highlight that large competitive courses face significantly higher prevalence, and high-achieving students may have gone underreported in previous literature. Vigilance should be employed by all faculty who accept tests for regrading.",

    "abstract": "Cost-effective student engagement poses a challenge for instructors, especially those who may not be familiar with new technologies and mobile devices. In this workshop, participants, experienced and discussed two ways of using smartphones in physiology classes: to engage in an online learning environment for discussions, and to make physiological measurements. Participants signed up for individual Twitter accounts and learned how to tweet, retweet, message, use a URL shortener, and use hashtags. They then went on to locate articles on an assigned topic from the Twitter accounts of credible science sources ( American Journal of Physiology, The Scientist, CDC.gov, WHO.int) and applied their Twitter skills to discuss the science topic of current interest. Additionally, participants shared their knowledge about the use of smartphones as a tool for teaching; they discussed the foundations of smartphone-assisted learning and the concept of mobile-learning laboratories, which we refer to as MobLeLabs. Participants also performed an experiment that used an Axé dance video and smartphone applications to measure changes in heart rate and reaction time. Our report describes this international hands-on teaching workshop and highlights its outcomes.",

    "abstract": "A needs analysis study for curriculum reform in basic sciences was conducted at Melaka Manipal Medical College, India, by means of a formative assessment method, namely Basic Science Retention Examination (BSRE). Students participated in a BSRE, which comprised recall and clinical multiple-choice questions in six discipline areas. They also rated the clinical relevance of each question and provided responses to three open-text questions about the exam. Pass rates were determined; clinical relevance ratings and performance scores were compared between recall type and clinical questions to test students' level of clinical application of basic science knowledge. Text comments were thematically analyzed to identify recurring themes. Only one-third of students passed the BSRE (32.2%). Students performed better in recall questions compared with clinical questions in anatomy (51.0 vs. 40.2%), pathology (45.1 vs. 38.1%), pharmacology (41.8 vs. 31.7%), and biochemistry (43.5 vs. 26.9%). In physiology, students performed better in clinical questions compared with the recall type (56.2 vs. 45.8%). Students' response to BSRE was positive. The findings imply that transfer of basic science knowledge was poor, and that assessment methods should emphasize clinical application of basic science knowledge.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity patient simulation (HFPS) is expensive in money and faculty resources. There has been a recent push to increase the use of HFPS for undergraduates to teach basic science. However, it is still unclear if HFPS is superior to other cost-effective modalities for learning, and there have been limited studies comparing HFPS directly with other methods. The purpose of this study was to compare learning between three groups: 1) students who participated in a HFPS after reading material (RS); 2) students who reread material (RR) individually; and 3) students who had no intervention or reading (CON). Quizzes (10 true/false questions) were given presimulation, immediately after the simulation (post-sim 1), and 1 wk later to all groups (post-sim 2). Ninety-seven undergraduate students consented to include their data in the study. All groups scored the same on the presimulation quiz (median of 6). The RR and RS scored significantly higher than the CON group on post-sim 1 (medians 8 vs. 6). All groups performed similarly on post-sim 2. A questionnaire also showed that students had increased perceived confidence about pathophysiology. These data suggest that a single-time use of HFPS for knowledge learning for undergraduate students is not more effective than other methods. Future studies need to determine whether increasing the number of HFPS and developing social learning networks could make HFPS more effective for undergraduates. Additionally, future studies should focus on soft skill development, such as confidence, critical thinking, and teamwork/communication skills, as opposed to knowledge acquisition.",

    "abstract": "With increasing medical knowledge, procedural, and diagnostic skills to learn, it is vital for educators to make the limited amount of teaching time available to students effective and efficient. Generative retrieval is an effective and efficient learning tool, improving long-term retention through the practice of retrieval from memory. Forty medical students were randomized to learn normal cardiovascular anatomy using transthoracic echocardiography video clips in a generative retrieval (GR) or standard practice (SP) group. GR participants were required to verbally identify each unlabeled cardiovascular structure after viewing the video. After answering, participants viewed the correctly labeled video. SP participants viewed the same video clips labeled with the correct cardiovascular structure for the same amount of total time without verbally generating an answer. All participants were tested for intermediate (1-wk), late (1-mo), and long-term (6- to 9-mo) retention of cardiovascular anatomy. Additionally, a three-question survey was incorporated to assess perceptions of the learning method. There was no difference in pretest scores. The GR group demonstrated a trend toward improvement in recall at 1 wk [GR = 74.3 (SD 12.3); SP = 65.4 (SD 16.7); P = 0.10] and 1 mo [GR = 69.9 (SD15.6); SP = 64.3 (SD 15.4); P = 0.33]. At the 6- to 9-mo time point, there was a statistically significant difference in scores [GR = 74.3 (SD 9.9); SP = 65.0 (SD 14.1); P = 0.042]. At nearly every time point, learners had a statistically significantly higher perception of effectiveness, enjoyment, and satisfaction with GR. In addition to improved recall, GR is associated with increased perceptions of effectiveness, enjoyment, and satisfaction, which may lead to increased engagement, time spent studying, and improved retention.",

The results indicated that the majority of students know little about the biological basis of learning, even with prompting, and they recall having learned little about it in school. Students appear to believe that people control their own ability to learn, and some have developed personal hypotheses to describe the learning process. On written assessments, 75% of participants demonstrated a nonbiological framework for learning, and, during interviews, 67% of participants revealed misconceptions about the biological basis of learning.

    "abstract": "During underwater submersion, the body responds by conserving O 2 and prioritizing blood flow to the brain and heart. These physiological adjustments, which involve the nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems, are known as the diving response and provide an ideal example of integrative physiology. The diving reflex can be stimulated in the practical laboratory setting using breath holding and facial immersion in water. Our undergraduate physiology students complete a laboratory class in which they investigate the effects of stimulating the diving reflex on cardiovascular variables, which are recorded and calculated with a Finapres finger cuff. These variables include heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, and arterial pressures (mean, diastolic, and systolic). Components of the diving reflex are stimulated by 1) facial immersion in cold water (15°C), 2) breathing with a snorkel in cold water (15°C), 3) facial immersion in warm water (30°C), and 4) breath holding in air. Statistical analysis of the data generated for each of these four maneuvers allows the students to consider the factors that contribute to the diving response, such as the temperature of the water and the location of the sensory receptors that initiate the response. In addition to providing specific details about the equipment, protocols, and learning outcomes, this report describes how we assess this practical exercise and summarizes some common student misunderstandings of the essential physiological concepts underlying the diving response.",

    "abstract": "Studies of hepatic bile formation reported in 1958 established that it was an osmotically generated water flow. Intravenous infusion of sodium taurocholate established a high correlation between hepatic bile flow and bile acid excretion. Secretin, a hormone that stimulates bicarbonate secretion, was also found to increase hepatic bile flow. The sources of the water entering the biliary system with these two stimuli were differentiated by the use of mannitol. An increase in its excretion parallels the increase in bile flow in response to bile acids but not secretin, which led to a quantitative distinction between canalicular and ductular water flow. The finding of aquaglyceroporin-9 in the basolateral surface of the hepatocyte accounted for the rapid entry of mannitol into hepatocytes and its exclusion from water movement in the ductules where aquaporin-1 is present. Electron microscopy demonstrated that bile acids generate the formation of vesicles that contain lecithin and cholesterol after their receptor-mediated canalicular transport. Biophysical studies established that the osmotic effect of bile acids varies with their concentration and also with the proportion of mono-, di-, and trihydroxy bile acids and provides a basis for understanding their physiological effects. Because of the varying osmotic effect of bile acids, it is difficult to quantify bile acid independent flow generated by other solutes, such as glutathione, which enters the biliary system. Monohydroxy bile acids, by markedly increasing aggregation number, severely reduce water flow. Developing biomarkers for the noninvasive assessment of normal hepatic bile flow remains an elusive goal that merits further study.",

    "abstract": "In most laboratory practices for students in medical schools, a laboratory guidebook is given to the students, in which the procedures are precisely described. The students merely follow the guidebook without thinking deeply, which spoils the students and does not entice them to think creatively. Problem-based learning (PBL) could be one means for the students themselves to actively learn, find problems, and resolve them. Such a learning attitude nurtures medical students with lifelong learning as healthcare professionals. We merged PBL and laboratory practices to promote deep thinking habits and developed an integrated laboratory practice. We gave a case sheet to groups of students from several schools. The students raised hypotheses after vivid discussion, designed experimental protocols, and performed the experiments. If the results did not support or disproved the hypothesis, the students set up another hypothesis followed by experiments, lasting for 4 or 5 consecutive days. These procedures are quite similar to those of professional researchers. The main impact achieved was the fact that the students developed the experimental design by themselves, for the first time in their college lives. All students enjoyed the laboratory practice, which they had never experienced before. This is an antidote to the guidebook-navigated traditional laboratory practice, which disappoints many students. As educators in basic medical sciences stand on the edge in terms of educating the next generation, there is a need to provide a strong foundation for medical students to design and perform scientific experiments. The integrated laboratory practice may provide the solution.",

Evidence from split-brain patients, individuals with unilateral brain damage, and neuroimaging studies suggest that each hemisphere may be specialized for certain cognitive processes. One way to easily explore these hemispheric asymmetries is with the divided visual field technique, where visual stimuli are presented on either the left or right side of the visual field and task performance is compared between these two conditions; any behavioral differences between the left and right visual fields may be interpreted as evidence for functional asymmetries between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. We developed a simple software package that implements the divided visual field technique, called the Lateralizer, and introduced this experimental approach as a problem-based learning module in a lower-division research methods course. Second-year undergraduate students used the Lateralizer to experimentally challenge and explore theories of the differences between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Measured learning outcomes after active exploration with the Lateralizer, including new knowledge of brain anatomy and connectivity, were on par with those observed in an upper-division lecture course. Moreover, the project added to the students' research skill sets and seemed to foster an appreciation of the link between brain anatomy and function.",

However, in our experience, medical students often have difficulties learning the basic principles of acid-base physiology in the respiratory physiology curriculum, particularly when applying this knowledge to the analysis of arterial blood gases. Collaborative teaching strategies may enhance student performance in quizzes in undergraduate physiology courses (1, 2). In particular, the so-called peer instruction technique (3) has been reported to enhance both the transfer and retention of learned material in a time-efficient fashion (4). The Harvard professor Eric Mazur originally developed peer instruction for teaching physics to undergraduate students (3). In this teaching approach, specific questions are integrated in the conventional lecture format; in an initial \"individual phase,\" students mark down their answer and rate how confident they are about the correctness of their answer, and this is followed by a \"pair phase,\" where students are asked to convince their neighbor of their answer. After this, they may revise the answer and again rate their confidence in their second answer. This teaching approach may differ substantially from conventional group work, where students typically discuss questions in small groups and mark down their answer during the lecture. In the present study, we attempted to implement and compare conventional group work and Mazur's peer instruction technique for teaching second-year medical students to diagnose common acid-base disorders by arterial blood gas analysis.We obtained institutional approval for the present study from the Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Copenhagen, and participation was voluntary. A total of 41 second-year medical students participated in a 2-h lesson on acid-base physiology that was conducted on two separate occasions. On the first occasion (group A), students performed conventional group work (n = 22), and, on the second occasion (group B), students performed group work according to Mazur's peer instruction technique (n = 19). Before the lesson, all students reported their age, sex, and preparation time. The two groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and preparation time, with no statistically significant differences between groups (data not shown). The first part of the lesson consisted of a 45-min introduction to the basic principles of acid-base physiology and disorders taught ex cathedra by R. M. G. Berg. The mnemonic rule, \"paper cut bleeding\" (PCB; pH-CO2-base excess), developed by L. N. Toksvang, was used as a structure to the blood gas analysis. During the lesson, students received a sheet with normal ranges for all arterial acid-base variables and were introduced to a PCB-structured flow chart (Fig. 1). Afterward, M. W. Petersen conducted a 20-min session during which students solved eight different arterial blood gases (Table 1) using two different collaborative strategies: group A interpreted each gas in groups of two in 2 min and rated how confident they felt about the answer. Group B first assessed each arterial blood gas individually for 1 min (individual phase) and rated how confident they were about the answer; students then reassessed the gas in groups of two students for another minute (pair phase) and then rated how confident they were about their second answer. Reference ranges were available during the whole session, and the correct diagnosis was highlighted immediately after the students' assessment of each gas, using the PCB-based flow chart as a visual aid (Fig. 1).Fig. 1.\"Paper cut bleeding\" [pH-CO2-base excess (BE)]-structured flow chart. Students were instructed to 1) assess pH, to identify the presence of acidosis or alkalosis; 2) consider arterial Pco2 (PaCO2), to identify to what extent a respiratory component contributes; and 3) assess BE, to identify to what extent a nonrespiratory component contributes to a given acid-base disorder.Download figureDownload PowerPointTable 1.

Gases 5–12 were used in the 20-min session of collaborative activities, between the pre- and posttest. Students had access to the normal ranges as listed above; they were informed that these may vary between laboratories and departments, but, to ensure consistency, we instructed them to be rigid in their approach to these ranges when assessing the arterial blood gases during the class.All students underwent an identical test immediately before and after the 20-min session of collaborative activities. The test encompassed four arterial blood gases (Table 1). Students were to complete the test in 8 min. For each arterial blood gas, students reported how confident (from 0% to 100%) they were that their diagnosis was correct. In the analysis of the test results, one point was awarded for each correctly diagnosed acid-base disorder. SAS statistical software (version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to compare pre- to posttest scores, to analyze student performance during the 20-min session of collaborative activities, and to compare student evaluations. Data were either ordinal (test scores and evaluations) or non-normally distributed (confidence levels and self-perceived improvement), as evaluated by normality plots and Shapiro-Wilk's test for normality, and we therefore used nonparametric statistics (Wilcoxon's signed rank sum test and the Mann-Whitney U-test). All data are reported as medians with corresponding interquartile ranges.During the 20-min session of collaborative activities, 97% of the arterial gases were interpreted correctly in group A, with confidence levels of 100% (range: 95–100%). In group B, 73% of the answers were correct after the individual phase, with confidence levels of 90% (range: 60–100%, both P < 0.01 vs. group A). This increased to 91% correct answers with confidence levels of 100% (range: 90–100%) after the pair phase (both P < 0.01 vs. the individual phase), which were similar to scores and confidence levels in group A (P = 0.10 and P = 0.88, respectively).Test scores improved in both groups from the pretest to the posttest (Table 2). In group A, test scores were 2 points (range: 1–2 points) before and 4 points (range: 3–4 points) after the class, whereas group B scored 2 points (range: 1–2 points) before and 3 points (range: 3–4 points) after the class (both P < 0.0001). However, no difference was present between groups when the improvement in test scores was compared (P = 0.31). The individual confidence levels for all four arterial blood gases increased similarly in both groups (Table 2). Subsequent to the posttest, students evaluated their academic gain, the quality of the teaching, and their own effort and provided an overall assessment of the lesson. These four parameters were rated as poor, below average, average, above average, or excellent. Furthermore, students reported their self-perceived improvement in their ability to diagnose acid-base disorders (from 0% to 100%). The evaluations of the lesson were positive in both groups, and >60% of the students evaluated the overall assessment of the lesson as excellent, regardless of the teaching strategy. Similarly, more than half of the students in both groups evaluated the academic gain, quality of teaching, and their own effort as above average or excellent. None of the students in either group rated any of the four parameters as below average or poor. Group A reported that their self-perceived ability of arterial blood gas analysis had improved by 100% (range: 90–100%). The corresponding value of group B was 100% (range: 85–100%), with no difference between groups (P = 0.71).Table 2.

However, none of the former studies assessed the overall effect on learning, which was evaluated by a pre- and posttest in the present study. Notwithstanding that a practice effect may be present and thus at least, to some extent, may have confounded our findings because identical gases were used in the tests, no difference between the two collaborative teaching strategies could be detected. A larger study, in which a third intervention group where students work individually without any collaborative activities is also included, is nonetheless needed before any definitive conclusions can be made on this matter. In any event, our findings indicate that collaborative strategies are efficient for teaching students to diagnose common acid-base disorders by arterial blood gas analysis, regardless of whether conventional group work or peer instruction is used, and both approaches are associated with a high degree of student satisfaction. Collaborative teaching strategies may therefore be beneficial for conveying the complexity of arterial blood gas analysis in a time-restricted setup.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: M.W.P., L.N.T., R.R.P., and R.M.G.B. performed experiments; M.W.P. and R.M.G.B. analyzed data; M.W.P., L.N.T., R.R.P., and R.M.G.B. interpreted results of experiments; M.W.P. prepared figures; M.W.P. and R.M.G.B. drafted manuscript; M.W.P., L.N.T., R.R.P., and R.M.G.B. edited and revised manuscript; M.W.P., L.N.T., R.R.P., and R.M.G.B. approved final version of manuscript; R.M.G.B. conception and design of research.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "Skinfold assessment is valid and economical; however, it has a steep learning curve, and many programs only include one exposure to the technique. Increasing the number of exposures to skinfold assessment within an undergraduate curriculum would likely increase skill proficiency. The present study combined observational and Think Aloud methodologies to quantify procedural and cognitive characteristics of skinfold assessment. It was hypothesized that 1) increased curricular exposure to skinfold assessment would improve proficiency and 2) the combination of an observational and Think Aloud analysis would provide quantifiable areas of emphasis for instructing skinfold assessment. Seventy-five undergraduates with varied curricular exposure performed a seven-site skinfold assessment on a test subject while expressing their thoughts aloud. A trained practitioner recorded procedural observations, with transcripts generated from audio recordings to capture cognitive information. Skinfold measurements were compared with a criterion value, and bias scores were generated. Participants whose total bias fell within ±3.5% of the criterion value were proficient, with the remainder nonproficient. An independent-samples t-test was used to compare procedural and cognitive observations across experience and proficiency groups. Additional curricular exposure improved performance of skinfold assessment in areas such as the measurement of specific sites (e.g., chest, abdomen, and thigh) and procedural (e.g., landmark identification) and cognitive skills (e.g., complete site explanation). Furthermore, the Think Aloud method is a valuable tool for determining curricular strengths and weaknesses with skinfold assessment and as a pedagogical tool for individual instruction and feedback in the classroom.",

    "abstract": "Ingested or penetrating foreign bodies are common in veterinary medicine. When they are radiolucent, these objects become a diagnostic challenge, but they can be investigated sonographically. However, successful object identification depends on the skill of the sonographer. Considering that these cases appear randomly during hospital routines, it is not always possible to train all students to identify them correctly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to produce homemade simulations of radiolucent foreign bodies for veterinary student demonstrations that could be identified sonographically and to evaluate the acceptability, applicability, and usefulness of these simulations according to a visual analog scale questionnaire and subjective questions. For this purpose, object models (a pacifier nipple, a toy ball, a sock, nylon thread, and a mango seed) were designed, produced, and immersed in gelatin. To simulate wood splinters in the integumentary and musculoskeletal system, a piece of meat punctured with a toothpick and ice cream stick splinters were used. The type of phantom had a determinant effect on the visualization (chi-square = 36.528, P < 0.0001) and recognition (chi-square = 18.756, P = 0.0021) capability of the students. All of the students answered that their experience with the models could help in real situations. The student responses to the questionnaire indicated that the project was well accepted, and the participants believed that this experience could be applicable to and useful in veterinary routines.",

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of conducting an interprofessional education (IPE) experience during the renal physiology block of a graduate-level course was to provide basic science, physical therapy, and physician assistant graduate students with an opportunity to work as a team in the diagnosis, treatment, and collaborative care of a patient with acute kidney injury. The secondary purpose was to enhance the understanding of basic renal physiology principles with a patient case presentation of renal pathophysiology. The overall purpose was to assess the value of IPE integration within a basic science course by examining student perceptions and program evaluation. Graduate-level students operated in interprofessional teams while working through an acute kidney injury patient case. The following Interprofessional Education Collaborative subcompetencies were targeted: Roles/Responsibilities (RR) Behavioral Expectations (RR1, RR4) and Interprofessional Communication (CC) Behavioral Expectations (CC4). Clinical and IPE stimulus questions were discussed both within and between teams with assistance provided by faculty facilitators. Students were given a pre- and postsurvey to determine their knowledge of IPE. There were statistically significant increases from pre- to postsurvey scores for all six IPE questions for all students. Physical therapy and physician assistant students had a statistically significant increase in pre- to postsurvey scores, indicating a more favorable perception of their interprofessional competence for RR1, RR4, and CC4. No changes were noted in pre- to postsurvey scores for basic science graduate students. Incorporating planned IPE experiences into multidisciplinary health science courses represents an appropriate venue to have students learn and apply interprofessional competencies.",

    "abstract": "To better prepare physiology students for 21st century careers, we incorporated classroom-based undergraduate research experiences and service learning/community-engaged learning (SLCE) into a college-level physiology laboratory course. The interventions were incorporated over 4 yr and assessed using validated surveys of student-reported learning gains related to attitudes toward science, the scientific process, and career paths. Students reported the greatest learning gains in those years when students did novel research oriented around a common theme of water quality. The gains were greater than those of a matched cohort that participated in an apprentice-style summer undergraduate research experience. With respect to the SLCE related to youth science literacy, students provided evidence of learning related to academics, personal growth, and civic mindedness. For example, many expressed discomfort about being in a new situation, often describing the differences between themselves and the youth with whom they interacted. However, students also grew in confidence about collaborating with people who were different from them and in their role as the \"scientist.\" Limitations of the study include the quasi-experimental design and the incorporation of multiple interventions at the same time. Future studies should examine improvement in content acquisition and competency-based learning skills. Nonetheless, these results suggest that both novel research and SLCE increase student learning in the context of an undergraduate physiology laboratory course. Many of the learning gains observed with the SLCE are particularly important for physiology students, many of whom aspire to careers in health sciences, where they will be regularly working with nonscientists.",

    "abstract": "Historically, Brazilian higher education teachers' pedagogical training has not been a concern. Even today, a graduate degree is the main requirement to be a faculty member. However, a set of competencies is necessary to teach: pedagogical competency, political competency, and knowledge of specific content. Most graduate training covers only knowledge of specific content. Therefore, this work aimed to outline the profile of basic health sciences faculty members teaching in biomedical and related fields regarding their undergraduate and graduate training, as well as the initial and continued pedagogical training in Brazilian public and private higher education institutions (HEIs). An electronic questionnaire was sent to these professionals, and a total of 763 responses were analyzed (66.4% from public and 33.6% from private HEIs). Compared with private HEI faculty, faculty from public HEIs were more experienced in teaching, and more time had passed since they finished their graduate training. On the other hand, faculty from private HEIs had a more intense undergraduate teaching workload than faculty from public HEIs. Additionally, faculty from private HEIs attended more extensive and more frequent pedagogical training activities (PTAs). Both groups expressed that activities closely related to their classroom practice and recognition for good pedagogical performance were incentives for their participation in PTAs. In conclusion, differences between the faculty from public and private HEIs may be due to the characteristics of HEIs themselves. Hypothetically, private HEIs focus on teaching, which may explain why faculty from these institutions seek improvement in this area, whereas public HEIs focus on research.",

This discipline has proven challenging for students to master due to ineffective content acquisition and retention. Preliminary data obtained from a survey completed by \"low-performance\" students (those maintaining a grade average below the passing mark of 70%) at Morehouse School of Medicine reported that students lacked the ability to adequately recognize and extract important physiological concepts to successfully navigate multiple-choice assessments. It was hypothesized that a specially designed, small-group, active learning, physiology in-course enrichment program would minimize course assessment failure rates by enhancing the ability of low-performance students to effectively identify important course content, successfully perform on multiple-choice assessments, and, thereby, improve overall course performance. Using self-report surveys, study skills and test-taking deficiencies limiting successful comprehension of course material and examination performance were identified. Mini-quiz assessments and assignments in formulating multiple-choice examination questions were given to help students recognize and solidify core concepts and improve test-taking ability. Lastly, self-report surveys evaluated the effectiveness of the enrichment program on overall course performance. Results showed a marked improvement in student confidence levels with regards to approaching multiple-choice assessments, and a significant improvement in grades achieved in the physiology component of the first-year curriculum, as 100% of participants achieved a final passing grade average of ≥70%. It was concluded that students became more proficient in identifying, understanding, and applying core physiological concepts and more successful in mastering multiple-choice questions.",

    "abstract": "Working memory is critical for learning but has a limited capacity for processing new information in real time. Cognitive load theory is an evidence-based approach to education that seeks to minimize the extraneous (unnecessary) load on working memory to avoid overloading it. The “seductive details effect” postulates that extraneous load can come from instructional design materials that attract interest but are unrelated to, and impair, learning. Presentation packages, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, have built-in decorative animated “GIFs” that are designed to make presentations more visually appealing. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of such “decorative” animations on learning and working memory performance. We found that students were less able to recall content presented in the presence of a decorative but relevant animation compared with a still image. This effect was found with two different topics (human physiology and enzyme kinetics). Compared with still images, students also found it harder to remember animations themselves, and the self-reported mental workload required to remember them was higher. These results show that decorative animations are seductive details and are thus a source of extraneous cognitive load.",

    "abstract": "To reduce medication errors, medical educators must nurture the early development of rational and safe prescribing. Teaching pharmacology is challenging because it requires knowledge integration across disciplines, including physiology and pathology. Traditionally, pharmacology has been taught using lecture-based learning, which conveys consistent information but may promote passive learning. Virtual patients (VPs) have been used more recently to promote active learning, mainly in clinical years. Conversely, the use of VPs in preclinical disciplines, including pharmacology, is not well described. The objective was to investigate the potential benefits of combining traditional teaching with VPs in preclinical pharmacology teaching. All year 3 medical students (2 cohorts), enrolled in the Systematic Pharmacology I course (lectures: 3 h weekly; tutorial: 1 h weekly), were invited to participate in this naturalistic, prospective study. During tutorials, students were taught using case-based discussion and single-best-answer questions (control) in four tutorials and VPs (experimental) in the remaining six tutorials. The impact of VPs was assessed by 1) performance in written examinations, and 2) student satisfaction/perceptions, using a validated, modified questionnaire. Examination performance related to teaching in VP-based tutorials was significantly improved, compared with traditional tutorials. The level of difficulty of control and experimental assessment items was comparable, as determined by the Angoff method. Facilitation of learning was higher in VP tutorials, while a no-harm effect was noted on knowledge acquisition/maintenance, authenticity of learning, and disadvantages of learning. VPs may be effectively integrated in preclinical pharmacology teaching, with benefits on pharmacological knowledge and facilitation of learning.",

Plotting these results allows them to discuss the effect each variable has on flow. Furthermore, students enhance their appreciation of experimental errors and variability by making repeat measurements. In the follow-up teaching session, the students are encouraged to apply their experimental findings to the cardiovascular system and the control of blood flow both at rest and under conditions of altered cardiac output, such as during exercise. By tackling the topic of flow control as a core concept, it allows the students to then apply their understanding in wider physiological contexts, such as airflow in the respiratory system.",

Although this topic is taught early in medical school, acid-base disturbances have been described as challenging by postgraduate trainees. We describe the use of Twitter, an online microblogging platform, to augment education in acid-base disturbances by using polls in which the user is shown laboratory values and then asked to select the most likely etiology of the disorder. The answer and a brief explanation are then shared in a subsequent tweet. Both polling questions and answers are shared from the account for the online, mobile-optimized, nephrology teaching tool NephSIM (https://www.nephsim.com/). An anonymous survey was administered to assess attitudes toward these polls. Using Twitter as an approach to enhance teaching of acid-base disturbances was both feasible and an engaging way to teach a challenging topic for trainees and physicians. Moreover, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has demonstrated the importance of incorporating virtual learning opportunities in all levels of medical education.",

    "abstract": "Gap years have grown in popularity among students attempting to go to medical school in recent years. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), more than half of matriculated students now have taken time off between their undergraduate studies and medical school. Although many claim benefits to taking gap years, research on the impacts of these experiences on medical students is largely nonexistent. This study aimed to qualitatively analyze the gap year phenomenon and its impacts on medical students through semistructured interviews conducted at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. Through these interviews, the research team collected in-depth responses that were thematically analyzed. Analysis revealed the following major themes regarding the impacts of gap years: 1) adaptability to change and failure, 2) professional identity formation and understanding of team role, 3) understanding the \"real world,\" 4) refocusing of goals, 5) resilience and stress management, and 6) reinforcement of motivation.",

    "abstract": "The teaching-learning process must constantly overcome the barriers imposed by rapid scientific and technological advances, as well as changes in the profiles of students and access to information. This study intended to analyze the perceptions of students and professors of medical courses of the teaching-learning strategies used in physiology at different Brazilian universities as well as the factors that influence or hinder the learning of this discipline. Questionnaires were analyzed from 174 students and 16 professors of physiology from medical courses of 20 higher education institutions (public and private) in a southern Brazilian state. The teaching strategies most used by physiology teachers coincided with the classroom activities that students consider to have the greatest contribution to their learning (expository classes/lectures, tests and questionnaires, problem-based learning/clinical case studies, and demonstrative/practical classes). It was also evidenced that teachers' didactic is considered as a very influencing factor for the students during their learning process, whereas the teachers pointed out daily pedagogical practice as the most relevant factor in the development of their skills within the classroom. In addition, some factors hindering the teaching-learning process of physiology were identified by the respondents, such as large amounts of information, little time for study outside the classroom, previous knowledge, and intrinsic difficulty of the discipline. Finally, students tended to study alone and generally used teachers' slides and their own notes as study materials. The continuous assessment of the perceptions, needs, and difficulties of students and teachers plays an essential role in improving the teaching-learning process.",

This occurs at the healthcare professional level before clinical rotations with direct patient encounters. This challenge is likely even more prevalent during undergraduate training as students are years away from exposure to an actual healthcare setting. Physiology, which is arguably the foundation of clinical medicine, is a difficult subject for students of all levels to learn for various reasons, including the fact that it is conceptual and highly integrated (8). Therefore, finding avenues for undergraduate students, especially those in healthcare career tracks, to experience the clinical relevance of physiology “in action” may help student engagement, enthusiasm, and learning of physiology as well as help guide career choices.The use of high-fidelity patient simulators (HFPSs) has expanded throughout medical, nursing, and allied health professions education in the last decades. These manikins can be programmed to represent pathological states and are used to teach clinical skills as well as clinical reasoning. First, the students are typically oriented either to the manikin or prebriefed about the specific case or scenario. This is followed by the 15- to 30-min simulation itself with a subsequent debrief about the experience (9). These HFPS experiences have been shown to improve learning and retention of physiology concepts in medical students (2, 5, 6). Interestingly, the use of HFPSs has also expanded into high school, college, and graduate schools in an effort to add problem-solving and critical thinking components to science classes (9). Gordon and Oriol (4) from the Harvard Summer Preclinical Institute have shown that student reflection reveals a deep satisfaction with the experience. Participation in these classes helped to improve confidence and reinforce humanism as well as providing clarity for future career choices (4). Although the idea of incorporating HFPSs within undergraduate courses appears beneficial on multiple levels, there are limited data regarding implementation and learning outcomes of the experience.The purpose of this report is to share the data and reflections from a HFPS experience for biomedical students in our undergraduate program. The 2-h HFPS experience was part of an upper-level undergraduate course titled “Laboratory Virtual Simulations in Physiology,” which is a mixed-mode class consisting of laboratory modules and limited face-to-face lecture time. The HFPS experience was developed and facilitated by faculty members from the University Central Florida College of Medicine and School of Biomedical Sciences. The goals of this study were to determine the feasibility of the simulation activity, whether learning occurred in the activity, and whether students were engaged during the activity. A pretest and posttest were designed and given to participants to test knowledge and perceptions of teamwork and communication skills. This study was reviewed and exempted by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida, and students participated with informed consent.Design of the ActivityA total of 34 undergraduate students participated in the HFPS session, and all activities were done within the Simulation Center at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. The outline of the eight activities is shown in Fig. 1 and described as follows.Fig. 1.Schematic of the simulation activity.Download figureDownload PowerPointPretest (∼10 min).The pretest consisted of five physiology questions targeting relevant cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology concepts (see the appendix) and five team process questions selected from the TeamSTEPPS curriculum (Table 1). Students had already had previous laboratory modules related to the simulation activities including cardiovascular hemodynamics and spirometry.Table 1. Pretest and posttest scores on the five TeamSTEPPS questionsStatementPretest AveragePosttest AverageP ValueIt is appropriate to continue to assert a concern about patient safety until you are certain that it has been heard.4.33 ± 1.034.89 ± 0.32*0.008It is important for leaders to share information with team members.4.61 ± 0.984.83 ± 0.380.260Individuals who are not part of the direct medical care team should be encouraged to report changes in patient status.3.72 ± 1.234.50 ± 0.79*0.009I prefer to work with team members who ask questions about information I provide.4.33 ± 1.034.72 ± 0.570.110Poor communication is the most common cause of reported errors.4.44 ± 0.984.61 ± 0.500.381Values are students' mean averages ± SD; n = 18 students total. P values were calculated using a paired t-test.*Significance.Introduction (∼20 min).The introduction included an introduction to the faculty members and a quick briefing on the capabilities of the manikin, the physical setting of the room, and how the vital signs were displayed on a bedside monitor. At this point, the general approach to a patient as well as the logistics of the session were discussed. For each of the manikins, there were five to six students participating in the HFPS experience and five to six students observing and monitoring teamwork and communication skills. Observers were informed that they were expected to comment on teamwork dynamics during the debriefing process.Simulation case 1 (15 min).The first case was a preprogrammed acute asthma case available on the SimMan 3G (Laerdal Medical). The simulated patient had tachypnea, decreasing O2 saturation, tachycardia, and hypotension. The manikin slowly decompensated as the case continued over 10 min, and faculty members facilitated students in noting changes in the patient's condition. Through the case, faculty members prompted students about what aspects of basic physiology might be pertinent in the clinical case presented. The manikin was saved by proper treatment by faculty members in every case to avoid any issues regarding death of the “patient.” However, students were asked to come up with the basic physiology concept(s) to treat the patient.Simulation case 1 debrief (25 min).In the debriefing session, the abnormal vital signs and whether the patient had a breathing or circulation problem based on the vital signs were discussed. Next, there was a discussion on the case's relation to basic physiology concepts such as the clinical relevance of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Additionally, students were asked to predict pulmonary function tests on the patient from the case. This section ended by allowing observers to discuss their view of the communication within the participating team.Role switch.Observers and participants switch roles.Simulation case 2 (15 min).This was a hemorrhagic shock case, which was preprogrammed in the SimMan 3G. Students were presented with a patient that had tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and normalized O2 saturation. Similar to the first case, the manikin decompensated slowly over 10 min to facilitate discussion of the changing clinical condition, and every patient was saved by proper treatment. Faculty members aided by prompting students about topics such as preload, venous return, and stroke volume.Simulation case 2 debrief (25 min).During the final debriefing session, the abnormal vital signs and whether the patient had a breathing or circulation problem were again addressed. The relationship of the relevant basic physiology concepts, such as preload, stroke volume, and cardiac output, were discussed to promote understanding of the vital signs associated with hemorrhagic shock. The hemodynamic version of Ohm's law (mean arterial pressure = cardiac output × systemic vascular resistance) was applied and related to the observed hypotension and tachycardia. The activity concluded by allowing the second set of observers to discuss their views of the communication within the participating team.Posttest (10 min).A posttest identical to the pretest was given to assess the learning of medical physiology concepts and any changes to the perception of the importance of communication.Evaluation of the StudyThe pretest and posttest were intended to determine if undergraduate students could learn basic physiology concepts from the HFPS. The questions were therefore developed with the intention of relating basic physiology concepts to clinical medicine and were single best answer multiple-choice questions written with clinical vignettes (see the appendix). Eighteen of thirty-four students successfully completed both the pretest and posttest. Twelve students arrived 5–10 min late and were allowed to take only the posttest. Four students were excluded from the study because of unclear marking of answers. Figure 2 shows the significant increase in class average between the pretests (1.72 ± 0.96) and posttests (2.61 ± 1.09, n = 18, P < 0.005 by paired Student's t-test) of students who took both.Fig. 2.Class average (n = 18) on the pretest and posttest. Data were analyzed with a paired t-test. *P < 0.005.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe five teamwork and communication questions on the pretest and posttest were modified from the validated TeamSTEPPS survey (http://teamstepps.ahrq.gov/). A Likert-like scale from 1 to 5, where 1 = strong disagreement to the statement, 2 = disagreement, 3 = neutrality, 4 = agreement, or 5 = strong agreement with the statement, was used on these questions. There was a significant increase in agreement on two of the five questions (Table 1). These data suggest that students may gain an appreciation of the importance of the teamwork and communication skills presented in the statements after the simulation activities.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that, on a small scale, it is feasible to get a positive learning effect and affect the perceptions of teamwork and communication in undergraduate biomedical sciences students using HFPS.Feasibility of the activity.One difficult aspect of doing this activity at the University of Central Florida was the distance between the undergraduate campus and the medical school, which is ∼20 miles. This would be a consideration for many institutions as it is common for medical schools (and the simulation centers within them) to be at a separate location from the undergraduate campus. Twelve of the thirty-four students arrived 5–10 min late for the activity due to parking, security, and directional issues, which could have been addressed more adequately before the simulation day. However, all students were able to participate in all of the activities except for the pretest.Faculty members were more involved during the simulation activity with biomedical students than typical medical student simulation activities. For example, faculty members prompted students with more questions than a typical simulation with first-year medical students; however, this allowed for discussion of the basic science underlying the two clinical problems. Additionally, students seemed hesitant to interact with or touch the manikin, as a medical student usually does. This was not surprising as these students have no clinical training and it is most likely their first interaction with a “patient.” If provided more time, it may be beneficial to introduce further sessions in which the students need to interact physically with the manikin to improve their comfort level.Although 12 of 34 students arrived late, minor modifications, such as printed instructions on parking and clearing security issues before the simulation, could address this issue. A total of 20 min was also included in the 2-h activity for the pretests and posttests, which could be eliminated in the future. The in-person time could be used more efficiently by having the students review short online videos to introduce them to the capabilities of the manikins and appearance of the room before the simulation day. In conclusion, since all students were able to participate in the actual simulation activity and debriefing sessions, this type of activity appears to be feasible with careful attention paid to logistics such as parking and security clearance.Learning effect of the activity.There was an increase on the posttest versus the pretest as the mean went from 1.72 ± 0.96 to 2.61 ± 1.09. Cohen's d calculation was 0.87, which suggests a large learning effect. The increase in score is consistent with a HFPS activity with first-year medical students in which the pretest class average increased from 42% to ∼63% correct on the posttest (6). Although these scores may seem minimal, it should be recognized that, in both cases, students were not prompted to the content within the cases nor were they given material to prepare. Another aspect that may compound the scores is the fact that the questions were worded as clinical vignettes and represent a different style of question than undergraduate students normally answer. Regardless, the data suggest a short-term learning effect from this activity. Future studies are needed to address whether long-term retention occurs with undergraduate students after simulation activities, which has been observed in medical students (3).The validated TeamSTEPPS questions were included to gauge student perceptions about some of the key areas within the TeamSTEPPS initiative. TeamSTEPPS was instrumented in healthcare settings in response to the Institute of Medicine's To Err is Human report (7) and places priority on patient safety by working to improve communication in healthcare settings. Interestingly, 10 yr after the release of the report, there was little change in patient safety (1). Therefore, other approaches may be needed to address this, which includes potentially beginning development of communication skills at earlier stages. Since many of the students enrolled in this biomedical course plan to pursue healthcare careers in the future, this type of learning may help to provide a foundation on teamwork and communication earlier in their careers. Although there was agreement on all the statements provided, there was a significant increase in two of five statements, suggesting a firmer agreement to the statement. The fact that agreement was initially high is most likely a result of the survey design.Faculty and student perceptions of the activity.All participating faculty members agreed that the students were heavily engaged and enthusiastic in this activity. The moments of discovery as students started to link their basic physiology knowledge to what was occurring in the patient were easily appreciated by the faculty members. After the session, almost every student walked out from the experience offering many “thank you” messages and handshakes. Student comments revealed their feelings of how the activity enhanced their learning of physiology. When a student was asked to name one thing that she learned from the HFPS activity, she commented “Integrating everything we learned in physiology and applying it in the real-world setting. I was also able to get a better understanding of the concepts covered by reviewing them.” Another student stated that participation in the HFPS “provided us students a hands on approach in which we can physically perceive the aspects of the concepts or terms we were learning, and allowed for a more real world simulation, rather than one just on Powerpoint or video.” Taken together, this suggests that HFPS activities provide a mechanism to apply undergraduate physiology.Overall, it was felt that this activity was important in providing undergraduate biomedical students clinical relevance to the basic physiology that they have been learning in class. Future studies are necessary to assess longer-term learning retention. It was also an opportunity to share experiences that occur at the medical school and may provide guidance to students planning to pursue healthcare careers. With the increased need for healthcare workers because of the aging population, it is vital that we encourage and stimulate interest in undergraduate students to pursue health science careers. Activities like the one described in this article may be a mechanism to engage young learners and increase enthusiasm for pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: D.M.H., Z.J.C., J.C.C., and J.D.K. conception and design of research; D.M.H., C.B., Z.J.C., and J.D.K. performed experiments; D.M.H. analyzed data; D.M.H. and J.D.K. interpreted results of experiments; D.M.H., C.B., and J.C.C. prepared figures; D.M.H., C.B., Z.J.C., J.C.C., and J.D.K. drafted manuscript; D.M.H. edited and revised manuscript; D.M.H. approved final version of manuscript.AppendixPhysiology Questions From the Pretest and PosttestQuestion 1.Which values represent the normal heart rate and breathing rate of an adult?A.

Therefore, it appeared interesting to evaluate if a stronger correlation between attendance and grades would occur in a face-to-face \"evidence-based medicine\" course with few lectures and more time dedicated to active learning methods. Small-group work and peer learning were used to foster deep learning and to engage students in their own learning process. Most of the time, students worked in small groups solving contextualized problems and critically analyzing the quality of published medical literature. Peer learning was also developed in collaborative evaluations, and constant feedback was provided. Therefore, it was hypothesized that high attenders would develop a higher self-perception of learning and obtain higher marks than low attenders. Student self-perceptions of their capacity to apply evidence-based medicine were measured by the application of an online self-assessment survey, and objective learning was measured as the grades obtained in a final accumulative individual test. It was found that male students obtained higher grades and were more confident in their achievements than their female peers, despite male and female student attendance being similar. In addition, attendance was correlated with the perceived capacity to apply evidence-based medicine only in male students and was not correlated with academic outcome.",

    "abstract": "PowerPoint presentations (PPTs) have become routine in medical colleges because of their flexible and varied presentation capabilities. Research indicates that students prefer PPTs over the chalk-and-talk method, and there is a lot of debate over advantages and disadvantages of PPTs. However, there is no clear evidence that PPTs improve student learning/performance. Furthermore, there are a variety of learning styles with sex differences in classrooms. It is the responsibility of teacher/facilitator and student to be aware of learning style preferences to improve learning. The present study asked the following research question: do PPTs equally affect the learning of students with different learning styles in a mixed sex classroom? After we assessed students' predominant learning style according to the sensory modality that one most prefers to use when learning, a test was conducted before and after a PPT to assess student performance. The results were analyzed using Student's t-test and ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test. A z-test showed no sex differences in preferred learning styles. There was significant increase in posttest performance compared with that of the pretest in all types of learners of both sexes. There was also a nonsignificant relationship among sex, learning style, and performance after the PPT. A PPT is equally effective for students with different learning style preferences and supports mixed sex classrooms.",

    "abstract": "Rates of obesity continue to rise in the US and across the globe. Obesity is a risk factor for developing insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. For clinicians, other healthcare providers, and educators, providing patients with accurate and meaningful information about obesity, including lifestyle (diet and exercise) interventions and symptom monitoring, is challenging due to infrequent contact, methods of communication, a lack of effective patient education resources, and inefficient patient feedback methods. Evidence suggests that significantly more patients are now getting their healthcare information online from general medical websites, disease-specific network communities, and social media. Thus, harnessing the power of technologies, including personal computers and smartphones, with attention to social media may equip healthcare providers with methods to serve their patients better by addressing challenges, improving indirect patient contact, and enhancing health outcomes. This manuscript aims to provide an overview of technology with a focus on social media use in obesity education and outreach. Practical information is provided related to creating content, delivering content, and managing the social media space for the novice creator.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory practicals in life science subjects are traditionally assessed by written reports that reflect disciplinary norms for documenting experimental activities. However, the exclusive application of this assessment has the potential to engage only a narrow range of competencies. In this study, we explored how multiple modes of laboratory assessment might affect student perceptions of learned skills in a life science module. We hypothesized that while a mixture of assessments may not impact student summative performance, it might positively influence student perceptions of different skills that varied assessments allowed them to practice. This was informed by universal design for learning and teaching for understanding frameworks. In our study, in a third-year Bioscience program, written reports were complemented with group presentations and online quizzes via Moodle. Anonymous surveys evaluated whether this expanded portfolio of assessments promoted awareness of, and engagement with, a broader range of practical competencies. Aspects that influenced student preferences in assessment mode included time limitations, time investment, ability to practice new skills, links with lecture material, and experience of assessment anxiety. In particular, presentations were highlighted as promoting collaboration and communication and the quiz as an effective means of diversifying assessment schedules. A key takeaway from students was that while reports were important, an overreliance on them was detrimental. This study suggests that undergraduate life science students can benefit significantly from a holistic assessment strategy that complements reports with performance-based approaches that incorporate broader competencies and allow for greater student engagement and expression in undergraduate modules.",

Understanding how carbohydrates are stored in our cells and which tissues contain significant carbohydrate stores is crucial for health professionals, especially given the role of carbohydrate metabolism in various pathophysiological conditions. This laboratory activity uses a simple and low-cost iodine binding method to quantify glycogen in mouse skeletal muscle and liver samples. By integrating the results of this activity with literature data, students can determine overall glycogen storage in the human body.

We inserted the prompt: \"What is the cause of fatigue and pain during exercise?\" using ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4o. In both versions, ChatGPT associated muscle fatigue with glycogen depletion and \"lactic acid\" accumulation, while pain was linked to processes such as inflammation and microtrauma. We deepened the investigation with ChatGPT 3.5, implementing user feedback to question the accuracy of the information about lactate. The response was then reformulated, involving a scientific debate about the true role of lactate in physical exercise and debunking the idea that it is the primary cause of muscle fatigue and pain. We also utilized the creation of a \"well-crafted prompt\", which included persona identification and thematic characterization, resulting in much more accurate information in both the ChatGPT 3.5 and 4o models, presenting a range of information from the physiological process of lactate to its true role in physical exercise. The results indicated that the accuracy of the responses provided by ChatGPT can vary depending on the data available in its database and, more importantly, on how the question is formulated. Therefore, it is indispensable that educators guide their students in the processes of managing the AI tool to mitigate risks of misinformation.",

Public postsecondary institutions, which are obligated to serve the public interest, and professional organizations, which are meant to reflect the values and interests of their members, should monitor degrees conferred, in part, to understand the career pathways of their graduates or members. The current report describes secular trends in degrees conferred in exercise physiology in the United States since 2002-2003. Data were obtained from spreadsheets published by the National Center for Education Statistics. The number of bachelor's degrees conferred in exercise physiology plateaued starting in 2017-2018 before increasing again in 2020-2021. In 2021-2022, 31,066 bachelor's degrees were conferred in exercise physiology, representing the highest yearly total on record (1.5% of all U.S. bachelor's degrees). The increase has been driven by female graduates (2021-2022: 58.9% women). The number of male graduates started plateauing in 2016-2017. The number of master's degrees conferred has continued to increase (2021-2022: 51.6% women), and doctorate degrees have numbered between 245 and 300 per year since 2013-2014 (2021-2022: 52.2% women). Moving forward, exercise physiology organizations are encouraged to monitor secular trends in degrees conferred and include these data in large-scale graduate destination reports. The plateauing of male exercise physiology graduates over the past 6 years and the significantly lower proportion of male than female graduates averaged across all academic fields warrant continued discussion.",

In the realm of written assessment grading, traditionally viewed as a laborious and subjective process, this study sought to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of these LLMs in evaluating the achievement of learning outcomes across different cognitive domains in a scientific inquiry course on sports physiology. Human graders and three LLMs, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Gemini, were tasked with scoring submitted student assignments according to a set of rubrics aligned with various cognitive domains, namely \"Understand,\" \"Analyze,\" and \"Evaluate\" from the revised Bloom's taxonomy and \"Scientific Inquiry Competency.\" Our findings revealed that while LLMs demonstrated some level of competency, they do not yet meet the assessment standards of human graders. Specifically, interrater reliability (percentage agreement and correlation analysis) between human graders was superior as compared to between two grading rounds for each LLM, respectively. Furthermore, concordance and correlation between human and LLM graders were mostly moderate to poor in terms of overall scores and across the pre-specified cognitive domains. The results suggest a future where AI could complement human expertise in educational assessment but underscore the importance of adaptive learning by educators and continuous improvement in current AI technologies to fully realize this potential.",

STEM Mobile Outreach is a scientist-led collaborative, innovative, and reproducible experiential educational program and mobile lab developed to engage people young and old in the cardiovascular sciences, improve health literacy and awareness of heart-healthy living, and spark curiosity in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Applied hands-on interactive activities at Heartwheels! events include heart dissection, cardiovascular physiology, and mock flow loops (science), medical devices (technology), instrumentation and sensors (engineering), and calibration and validation methods and models (math). These modules are complementary to school activities and are particularly successful from an educational standpoint because they are fun, interactive, engaging, voluntary, open-ended, not graded or assessed, and can lead participants and their families to develop STEM-positive identities. Primary learning objectives include a broad understanding of cardiovascular anatomy and physiology, advanced technologies and emerging medical devices, the benefits of a heart healthy lifestyle, and to stimulate interest, to build self-confidence, and to help participants envision themselves participating in and making potentially significant contributions to STEM fields. To date, 10,284 attendees of all ages and backgrounds have participated in 47 Heartwheels! events. Excellent programmatic ratings (1-5 scale; 1=poor, 5=excellent), including 91.7% participants self-reporting that it was a fun educational experience and 93.1% reporting that they learned new things, with complimentary verbal and open-ended written feedback, demonstrate the significant impact and value that Heartwheels! and hands-on experiential educational events contribute to our diverse, resource limited, and underserved communities.",

    "abstract": "Research shows that when students use core concepts to guide their reasoning, they are able to construct more accurate, mechanistic explanations. However, there is scant research exploring student's perceptions of the usefulness of core concepts. Knowing students' perceptions could be influential in encouraging faculty to adopt core concept teaching strategies. In this study, we investigated how students perceive the usefulness of using the physiology core concepts to guide their reasoning. We collected the perceptions of undergraduate science majors who had completed Introductory Biology II, taught using a subset of physiology core concepts. Eleven student volunteers were interviewed using a semi-structured protocol, and 22 students provided end-of-semester reflections. Using a constant comparative method, we identified four emergent themes in students' perceptions: core concepts guide reasoning, core concepts support reasoning and learning across topics and disciplines, core concepts build self-efficacy in reasoning, and drawn core concept tools visualize reasoning. These findings suggest that core concepts, when used as tools to reason with, help students explain rather than memorize physiological phenomena, thus supporting deeper learning and transfer of knowledge to novel contexts. We also found that drawn scaffolding tools play a critical role in helping students organize their thinking, making abstract systems more approachable and supporting mechanistic reasoning. This study is the first qualitative analysis examining students' perceptions of the role core concepts of physiology play in their learning and reasoning processes.",

In the described exercise, students are assigned a current study and then write three two-page critiques of the article. The three critiques occur at different times in the semester, and thus the students have differing knowledge bases. The critiques are then assigned to other students for peer review using the double-blind, single-blind, or open review systems. After the submission of each peer review, the class discusses the various advantages and disadvantages of each peer review system. In addition to experiencing peer review, in using this method students also gain an appreciation for the difficulty of judging the merit of a peer's work.",

Since the curriculum was changed, student performance on step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination has significantly increased from slightly below the national average to almost one-half a standard deviation above the national mean. In the first and second years, classes for students are organized in classes or blocks that are 8 wk long, followed by 1 wk for evaluation. Initially, basic science endocrinology was taught in the fourth block of the first year with immunology and molecular biology. Student and faculty evaluations of the curriculum indicated that endocrinology did not integrate well with the rest of the material taught in that block. To address these issues, basic science endocrinology was moved into another block with neurosciences. We integrate endocrinology with neurosciences by using the hypothalamus and its role in neuroendocrinology as a springboard for endocrinology. This is accomplished by using clinical cases with clear neuroscience and endocrinology aspects such as Cushing's disease and multiple endocrine neoplastic syndrome type 1.",

Other incentives for improvement included the possibility of attracting students into endocrine research electives and the pressure to improve teaching approaches that results from the high tuition they pay. The principal approach adopted was that of whole class problem-based learning sessions (PBLS) in which the lecture period begins with a brief overview of one to three simplified cases, followed by the usual didactic lecture. At the end of the lecture, each PBL case is read in detail, with several questions posed to the students. Their answers are then used to reinforce concepts from the lecture material. This method can also provide some continuity between lectures, either by using a case in several lectures to illustrate different points, or by posing a question at the beginning of class that illustrates a point from the prior lecture. The outcome of this approach has been very successful: student evaluations of the lecture block and their attendance have significantly improved.",

    "abstract": "The cardiovascular system is a complex arrangement of hydraulic, yet living, components. The complexity of this system may make it difficult for students to see the \"forest\" instead of the \"trees.\" To better explain the dynamics of cardiovascular function and control, an analogy has been drawn to the operation of a city water supply. In cities that use a water tower, fresh water is pumped up into the tower from a river or other source. The tower serves as a pressure reservoir for providing water to homes through a largely parallel arrangement of distribution pipes. Local homeowners control their own water usage through faucets, whereas the city maintains water pressure by monitoring the level in the tower. Key analogous points with the cardiovascular system are the heart as the city pump, the aorta as the water tower, arteries as parallel distribution pipes, and arterioles as faucets. Baroreceptor reflex control is discussed as well as such features as the capacitance role of veins, the skeletal muscle pump, and the competition between locally mediated vasodilation and sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. Subjective student and peer evaluations have indicated that this analogy is effective in improving student comprehension of the cardiovascular system.",

The exercise is designed to include factors that the students are familiar with, so they can focus on the isolation of variables without being confused about the process they are investigating. However, the exercise will not turn out as the students anticipate, meaning they will be forced to reevaluate the assumptions that formed the basis of their original hypothesis.

Each option had a specific maximum mark (percentage or grade point) associated with it. Students were permitted to select any set of options to obtain their total grade for the course. From the student's perspective, the course provided a valuable learning experience and enabled them to recognize the complexities involved in the process of generating scientific information and making it useful and relevant to the public.

Based on a variety of audits, it was found that 38% of the articles published in 2001 in Nature contained some statistical \"incongruence\": a disparity between reported test statistics (t-tests, F-tests, etc.) and their corresponding P values. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) faired a little better, with 25% of the articles containing at least one incongruence. A subsequent audit of Nature Medicine for 2000 \"showed clear evidence that the authors did not even understand the meaning of P values.\"With understated regret, the Significance article notes that, although all Nature journals will eventually adopt guidelines regarding the use of statistics, \"the journal will not introduce a statistical review process.\" The approach taken by BMJ's Deputy Editor seems to reflect philosophical resignation: \"Research done at the BMJ shows that peer reviewers identify only a minority of major errors in a manuscript–so what hope is there of them identifying these minor ones?\" This seems only a short step away from saying \"Why bother? And, besides, it doesn't matter anyway.\"Well, of course it does matter. Faulty statistical analyses can result in wasted research resources and, worse still, compromise the health of research animals, human subjects, and the ultimate recipients of therapies. The American Physiological Society (APS) is therefore to be commended for taking on this issue. What precisely should be done about the matter is a greater challenge, however. In 2004, Curran-Everett and Benos leapt into the fray by providing 10 guidelines regarding statistical approaches (4) and now report that nobody appears to be heeding their advice but, at least, they didn't hear any grousing from statisticians. Of course, the fact that they didn't hear grousing doesn't mean that it doesn't exist and so I'll go on record: although I believe that their intentions are good, in some ways I fear that they have just muddled the issue further.They're just guidelines, right? So what's the problem? Let me digress for a moment. For the most part, I think statistics is poorly taught. Not that the instructors are bad, necessarily, but rather that we aim too high. Realistically, we might hope that a student who has finished a one-semester, introductory course is able to read reports and statistics cited in a newspaper more critically. With loftier goals, we try to jam in more information, and this leads to a formulaic, algorithmic approach: if the data look like this, then the analysis should be that; if the P value falls below this particular value, then you should reject the null hypothesis; if you have two groups, it's a t-test; three groups and it's ANOVA, etc. We bypass the complexities and leave students believing that, upon the completion of the semester, they are now qualified to \"do statistics.\" That's hopelessly naïve; most experiments yield data far more complex than can be handled by a semester or two of statistics.Of course, an algorithmic approach is easier to learn and teach (and grade), but it ultimately does not serve the practitioner well. Caveats notwithstanding, I fear Curran-Everett and Benos are reinforcing this perspective. Too many of these guidelines have a nearly algorithmic, dictatorial sound: \"the right thing is to do x.\" This is too easily transmuted into rules that take the form of \"if you don't do x, then it's wrong,\" followed by a citation to the guidelines. I have, on a number of occasions, had precisely this happen: a reviewer, not knowing a lot of statistics, but knowing the guidelines well, will reject a manuscript because the statistics are \"wrong.\" Well, no, they're not wrong, but they involve subtleties that the guidelines don't cover. In an attempt to clarify and simplify, the guidelines actually prove to be an annoying, if not worse, tool in the hands of the nonexpert.Despite this potential for annoyance, I must say that some of the guidelines I absolutely endorse. I can't, for example, object to guideline 1 (Consult a statistician), although I think a critical point of having a statistician involved in project and experimental design is that it can lead to simpler, clearer analyses and interpretations. (I also appreciate and agree with the notion that the statistician \"can help;\" I'm sorry that some statisticians take it upon themselves to be officious, instead.) Guideline 3 (Identify your methods, references, and software), guideline 7 (Report precise P values), and the interpretations of P values in Table 1 all sit well. [Some of these points can also be found in the elegant, less prescriptive 1988 offering by the preeminent statisticians Mosteller and Bailar (2).]From this point the waters get deep. Curran-Everett and Benos describe their guidelines as representing best practices in statistics. I cannot agree–certainly they would not receive uniform support among statisticians. That great pioneer of statistics, Fisher, would certainly appreciate guideline 7 but would abhor guideline 2 (Use a predetermined critical value). Guideline 2 reflects more the philosophical approach of Neyman and Pearson, also giants in the field, who specifically advocated the use of critical values like α. [There was mutual animosity between Fisher and the Neyman-Pearson school, as evidenced by their occasionally intemperate remarks on these issues (5, 6).] In a curious ecumenicism, however, the authors' interpretation of \"if the P value is less than α, then the experimental effect is likely to be real,\" fits nicely with the Bayesian school but is a patently incorrect interpretation of a P value from either a Neyman-Pearson or Fisherian view.Guideline 10 (Interpret each main result with a confidence interval and precise P value) repeats the error of interpretation and compounds the problem with poor advice: \"If either bound of the confidence interval is important from a scientific perspective, then the experimental effect may be large enough to be relevant.\" The \"may be\" leaves the authors an out, but the critical issue is that, if the sample is too small, then the confidence interval will be large, thus increasing the chance that one of the bounds of the confidence intervals is, apparently, \"important from a scientific perspective.\" This confusion underlies guideline 6 (Report uncertainty about scientific importance using a confidence interval) as well. Although I appreciate the technical accuracy of the definition of a confidence interval, the authors oversimplify. It is correct to say that a confidence interval characterizes uncertainty about the true value of a parameter but incorrect to say that it provides an assessment of scientific importance.Both in their advice regarding critical values and confidence intervals, Curran-Everett and Benos have overstated what these things actually provide, perhaps in favor of what they wish they would provide. The discussion of guideline 6 leads to another issue, by the way: for a data graphic, they advise using a confidence interval. Not everyone agrees; it depends in part on the intent, as noted by Andrews et al. (1).I have a minor quibble with guideline 4 (Control for multiple comparisons), whose principle I support completely. However, in 1973, Carmer and Swanson made it pretty clear that the Newman-Keuls procedure is inferior to the protected least-significant difference procedure (3). Referring to an outmoded technique again leads to the risk that such mention reflects an endorsement.We're left with guideline 5 (Report variability using the SD), which I understand raised a lot of concerns among some APS members. That's understandable: it appears to go against tradition. My concern is that it might equally go against logic. Yes, the SD does indicate variability of a single observation. But it's actually the rare instance where we want to know such a thing. Such an instance can arise when we want to develop normal ranges for some diagnostic result: it's useful to know the SD of systolic blood pressure, because then we can calculate a 95% interval and, more importantly, know when someone's blood pressure lies outside the \"normal range.\"But, in most circumstances in reporting experimental results, we want to compare means of different groups, and the immediately relevant quantity is the SE. Yes, citing the mean ± SE only gives a 68% confidence interval, but a quick trick is that the mean ± 2 × SE gives a good approximation to a 95% confidence interval. And, although it's true that the SD and SE are related, performing the mental math to convert SD to SE is nontrivial. But why not make a more useful recommendation: report, on a graph or in text, the SD or SE, depending on what information you want to convey. If you want to compare means, use SE; if you want to look at variation among a group of individuals, use SD. For other purposes, you might use something else again (1).I truly appreciate the authors' goals: to improve the quality of statistics in the journals and, of course, in the accompanying science. I also have sympathy for authors, reviewers, and editors. Who doesn't want a short, simple set of rules? Unfortunately for the nonspecialist, the field of statistics is deep, complex, and evolving. In each of the last several years, for example, the journal Statistics in Medicine has been publishing about 4,000 pages of articles focused principally on the development of new methods for analyzing data. Over the last 20 years or so, the manual for the statistical analysis component of SAS has expanded from about 1,000 pages to roughly 5,000 pages. Aspects of apparently routine methods such as regression and ANOVA are under continuous refinement, and methods employed today are often quite different from those used even a few decades ago. It is difficult to keep up.So what to do? I have two suggestions. First, I think the APS editorial board should indicate in their instructions that authors are responsible for ensuring that the statistics in articles are correct, appropriate, follow modern practices, and are well-presented and that they are subject to review. And mean it. This is effectively what the Federal Drug Administration does in drug trials and what the National Institutes of Health does in evaluating grant applications involving human subjects. The burden is on the author, of course, to ensure that there is adequate quality in the work.Second, I think we need to move away from the idea that statistics is a technical tool, like a pH meter, and recognize that it is a scientific discipline, requiring considerable training, skill, and practice. We recognize more and more the need for interdisciplinary teams to solve research problems, and so, for example, a given project might benefit from the input of a neurochemist, a muscle physiologist, an expert in ion channel function, and a proteomicist. Each contributes their own expertise, each acknowledges their own limitations, and the combined effort is a superior product. Journals do not need to provide detailed guidelines on how to conduct or report the research insofar as high standards result from the review process. So why not treat statisticians on an equal footing, both as collaborators and reviewers? All too often there is an asymmetry in the way that statistics are treated in a research project compared with, say, biochemistry, genomics, etc.Another curious asymmetry arises in how we handle data. It is curious to me that researchers might spend months collecting tissue samples, say, and then many more months performing assays on these samples, but the actual data analysis often gets short shrift. Why? Why, given the extensive resources and time it takes to collect the data, do some people expect to be able to do the analysis in an afternoon? Why would they want to?In 2000, in its endorsement of the Mathematical Association of America Guidelines for Programs and Departments in Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences, the American Statistical Association noted that \"Generic packages such as Excel are not sufficient even for the teaching of statistics, let alone for research and consulting\" ( http://www.amstat.org/Education/index.cfn?fusoradian-ASAendorsement). Numerous other articles document numerical errors, misstatements, and various weaknesses in that software. Why is there acceptance, therefore, of using mediocre analysis tools in statistics when high standards are held for the use of other tools and techniques in the sciences?I don't think it is needlessly idealistic to think that statistics can be an equal partner in the sciences. I have seen this model work countless times, and I have had the good fortune to participate in it. Despite my quibbling with the details of the suggestions by Curran-Everettt and Benos, I have complete sympathy with their efforts to improve the situation. However, rather than promulgating a handful of guidelines, I believe it will take support from APS members as a whole, and not just a few advocates, to make positive change.REFERENCES1 Andrews HP, Snee RD, Sarner MH.

    "abstract": "It is challenging for biomedical engineering programs to incorporate an indepth study of the systemic interdependence of cells, tissues, and organs into the rigorous mathematical curriculum that is the cornerstone of engineering education. To be sure, many biomedical engineering programs require their students to enroll in anatomy and physiology courses. Often, however, these courses tend to provide bulk information with only a modicum of live tissue experimentation. In the Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering Department of the University of Rhode Island, this issue is addressed to some extent by implementing an experiential physiology laboratory that addresses research in electrophysiology and biomechanics. The two-semester project-based course exposes the students to laboratory skills in dissection, instrumentation, and physiological measurements. In a novel approach to laboratory intensive learning, the course meets on six Sundays throughout the semester for an 8-h laboratory period. At the end of the course, students are required to prepare a two-page conference paper and submit the results to the Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBC) for consideration. Students then travel to the conference location to present their work. Since the inception of the course in the fall of 2003, we have collectively submitted 22 papers to the NEBC. This article will discuss the nature of the experimentation, the types of experiments performed, the goals of the course, and the metrics used to determine the success of the students and the research.",

    "abstract": "Few medical faculty members are adequately prepared for their instructional responsibilities. Our educational traditions were established before we had research-based understandings of the teaching-learning process and before brain research began informing our understandings of how humans achieve lasting learning. Yet, there are several advantages you may have. If your expertise is at one of the frontiers of human biology, your teaching can be inherently fascinating to aspiring health professionals. If your work has implications for human health, you have another potential basis for engaging future clinicians. And, thanks to Claude Bernard's influence, you likely are “process oriented,” a necessary mindset for being an effective teacher. There are also challenges you may face. Your medical students will mostly become clinicians. Unless you can help them see connections between your offerings and their future work, you may not capture and sustain their interest. To be effective, teachers, like clinicians, need to be interactive, make on-the-spot decisions, and be “emotional literate.” If you aren't comfortable with these demands, you may have work to do toward becoming a truly helpful teacher. Program changes may be needed. Might your program need to change 1) from being adversarial and controlling to being supportive and trust based or 2) from mainly dispensing information to mainly asking and inviting questions? In conclusion, making changes toward becoming a truly helpful teacher can bring benefits to your students while increasing your sense of satisfaction and fulfillment as a teacher. If you choose to change, be gentle with yourself, as you should be when expecting your students to make important changes.",

    "abstract": "Current engineering applications in the medical arena are extremely progressive. However, it is rather difficult for medical doctors and engineers to discuss issues because they do not always understand one another's jargon or ways of thinking. Ideally, medical engineers should become acquainted with medicine, and engineers should be able to understand how medical doctors think. Tohoku University in Japan has managed a number of unique reeducation programs for working engineers. Recurrent Education for the Development of Engineering Enhanced Medicine has been offered as a basic learning course since 2004, and Education through Synergetic Training for Engineering Enhanced Medicine has been offered as an advanced learning course since 2006. These programs, which were developed especially for engineers, consist of interactive, modular, and disease-based lectures (case studies) and substantial laboratory work. As a result of taking these courses, all students obtained better objective outcomes, on tests, and subjective outcomes, through student satisfaction. In this article, we report on our unique biomedical education programs for engineers and their effects on working engineers.",

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of increasing opportunities for active learning into a medical physiology course with approximately 190 students enrolled, we chose an integrated approach. This was facilitated by the availability of a patient simulator facility at the School of Nursing at the Medical College of Georgia, and an approximately 20-min simulation of acute hemorrhage on the simulators comprised the first of three components in our approach. The second component was a small-group problem-solving session that each group conducted immediately after their patient simulator session. It brought in the more complex physiological responses to acute hemorrhage using an exercise we designed using free downloadable simulation software from the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. The third component was a student worksheet exercise that was built around data collected from 12 students who volunteered to collect a 24-h urine sample and have blood pressure measured after 3 days on either high or low salt intake. The worksheet was completed independently, and the answers and student data formed the basis for a classroom lecture. The approach has met with increasingly positive reviews due to testing the first two components on second-year medical student volunteers before its implementation, keeping the first component as simple as possible, keeping the second component to <30 min, and continued revision of the third component to increase clinical context of the study questions. An integrated active learning approach can enhance student interest in integrating cardiovascular-renal physiology, particularly if faculty members are willing to revise the approach in response to student feedback.",

We designed a seminar where small groups of students worked on different neurotransmitters before contributing information to a plenary session. Student feedback suggested that when the information was largely novel, students learned considerably more. Crucially, this improvement in knowledge was seen even when they had not directly studied a particular transmitter in their work groups, suggesting a shared learning experience. Moreover, the majority of students reported that using primary research papers was easy and useful, with over half stating that they would use them in future study.",

    "abstract": "The course “Management of Fluid and Electrolyte Disorders” is an applied physiology course taught using lectures and paper-based cases. The course approaches fluid therapy from both basic science and clinical perspectives. While paper cases provide a basis for application of basic science concepts, they lack key components of genuine clinical cases that, by nature, are diverse, change over time, and respond in unique ways to therapeutic interventions. We developed a dynamic model using STELLA software that simulates normal and abnormal fluid and electrolyte balance in the dog. Students interact, not with the underlying model, but with a user interface that provides sufficient data (skin turgor, chemistry panel, etc.) for the clinical assessment of patients and an opportunity for treatment. Students administer fluids and supplements, and the model responds in “real time,” requiring regular reassessment and, potentially, adaptation of the treatment strategy. The level of success is determined by clinical outcome, including improvement, deterioration, or death. We expected that the simulated cases could be used to teach both the clinical and basic science of fluid therapy. The simulation provides exposure to a realistic clinical environment, and students tend to focus on this aspect of the simulation while, for the most part, ignoring an exploration of the underlying physiological basis for patient responses. We discuss how the instructor's expertise can provide sufficient support, feedback, and scaffolding so that students can extract maximum understanding of the basic science in the context of assessing and treating at the clinical level.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion and respiration are not independent phenomena in running mammals because locomotion and respiration both rely on cyclic movements of the ribs, sternum, and associated musculature. Thus, constraints are imposed on locomotor and respiratory function by virtue of their linkage. Specifically, locomotion imposes mechanical constraints on breathing that require the respiratory cycle to be synchronized with gait. Thus, many mammals, including humans, synchronize respiration with the movement of the limbs during locomotion. For example, quadrupeds synchronize locomotor and respiratory cycles at a 1:1 ratio (stride/breath) over a wide range of speeds. Interestingly, quadrupeds maintain an almost constant stride frequency (and therefore respiratory frequency) at different speeds. To increase speed, quadrupeds lengthen their stride. Accordingly, to increase minute ventilation, quadrupeds must increase tidal volume since respiratory rate is coupled with stride frequency. We developed a simple, inexpensive, and easy to build model to demonstrate this concept. A model was chosen because models significantly enhance student understanding. Students are drawn into discussion by the power of learning that is associated with manipulating and thinking about objects. Building and using this model strengthen the concept that locomotor-respiratory coupling provides a basis for the appropriate matching of lung ventilation to running speed and metabolic power.",

However, research on the benefits of positioning the practicals within the theory subject or developing them distinctly from the theory is largely absent. This report compared results in a physiology theory subject among three different cohorts of students: those taking the theory subject alone, those taking it concurrent with a physiology practicum subject, and those who previously took the subject when it had practicums embedded within the one subject. The path model shows that students taking both physiology theory and physiology practicum attained a significantly higher result in online tests compared with those who took the theory subject alone ( P &lt; 0.05) and that this translated to a significantly higher result in the end-of-semester examination. Similarly, students taking both physiology theory and the physiology practicum attained a significantly higher end-examination result compared with those who took the physiology subject in previous years when the practicums were embedded within the theory subject ( P &lt; 0.05). In both cases, this increase was largely attained in components that tested critical thinking and deep learning (short theory application questions and extended written questions). We conclude that students undertaking both physiology theory and the physiology practicum likely performed better in the theory subject due to better problem-solving skills and a more developed understanding of theoretical content. We suggest that consideration be given in all science curricula to the separation of theory and practicum by developing two subjects with clearly defined different learning outcomes.",

One such underserved population, Native Americans, are particularly underrepresented in STEM fields. Although recent advocacy and outreach designed toward increasing minority involvement in health care-related occupations have been mostly successful, little is known about the efficacy of outreach programs in increasing minority enthusiasm toward careers in traditional scientific professions. Furthermore, very little is known about outreach among Native American schools toward increasing involvement in STEM. We collaborated with tribal middle and high schools in South Dakota and Nebraska through a National Institutes of Health Science Education Partnership Award to hold a day-long physiology, activity-based event to increase both understanding of physiology and enthusiasm to scientific careers. We recruited volunteer biomedical scientists and trainees from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Nebraska Wesleyan University, and University of South Dakota. To evaluate the effectiveness of the day of activities, 224 of the ~275-300 participating students completed both a pre- and postevent evaluation assessment. We observed increases in both students self-perceived knowledge of physiology and enthusiasm toward scientific career opportunities after the day of outreach activities. We conclude that activity-based learning opportunities in underserved populations are effective in increasing both knowledge of science and interest in scientific careers.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between structure and function is a core concept in physiology education. Written formative assessments can provide insight into student learning of the structure and function relationship, which can then inform pedagogy. However, question order may influence student explanations. We explored how the order of questions from different cognitive levels affects student explanations. A junior level General Physiology class was randomly split in half. One-half of the students answered, \"Define the principle: form reflects function,\" followed by \"Give an example of the principle: form reflects function\" (format DX), whereas the other half answered, \"Give an example of the principle: form reflects function,\" followed by \"Define the principle: form reflects function\" (format XD). Human grading and computerized lexical analysis were used to evaluate student responses. Two percent of students in the format DX group related structure and function in their definition, whereas 48% of students related structure and function in their examples. In the format XD group, 17% related structure and function in their definition, and 26% related structure and function in their example of the principle. Overall, students performed better on the last question in the sequence, which may be evidence for conceptual priming. Computerized lexical analysis revealed that students draw on only a few levels of organization and may be used by instructors to quickly assess the levels of organization students use in their responses. Written assessment coupled with lexical analysis has the potential to reveal student understanding of core concepts in anatomy and physiology education.",

    "abstract": "Misconceptions about physiology are a major threat to accurate scientific and clinical reasoning in medical education. Awareness is often mentioned as a prerequisite to achieve conceptual understanding; however, students are frequently unaware of their incorrect understanding. We explored the multitier approach as a tool to obtain insight into students’ awareness and misconceptions regarding cardiovascular physiology. Biomedical sciences students ( N = 81) participated in a diagnostic multitier assessment on cardiovascular physiology. Each question consisted of an answer tier and an explanation tier. Both tiers were paired with confidence tiers, i.e., 5-point Likert scales, which were used as an indicator for metacognitive evaluation, i.e., awareness. The average test score was 3.07 (maximum 4.0) for the answer tier only, and reduced to 1.57 when answer and explanation tiers were combined. A weak correlation ( R 2 = 0.13, P = 0.001) between students’ confidence and their test scores was found for the combined responses. Correct combined answers were associated with an increase in confidence score of 0.27 vs. incorrect answers. Using a Bland-Altman analysis, we showed that students generally overestimated their knowledge. In total, 28.7% of all responses were classified as misconceptions, defined as incorrect answers paired with high confidence. In all, findings indicate that the multitier approach is useful to study students’ conceptual understanding and uncover misconceptions on cardiovascular physiology. Furthermore, this study supports the need for metacognitive measures in order to improve teaching and learning in medical education.",

    "abstract": "Dr. James McCune Smith, the first African-American to obtain a medical degree, has a remarkable legacy of historical proportions, yet his immense impact on society remains relatively unknown. He may be most celebrated for his effectiveness in abolitionist politics, however, his pioneering influence in medicine is equally remarkable. As examples, McCune Smith pioneered the use of medically based statistics to challenge the notion of African-American racial inferiority. He scientifically challenged the racial theories promoted in Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia (Jefferson T., 1832), and he was a harsh critic of phrenology (study of the shape and size of the cranium as a supposed indication of character and mental abilities). Furthermore, notwithstanding being denied entry to America's universities and medical societies because of his race, McCune Smith became a giving physician to orphans, an accomplished statistician, medical author, and social activist who worked to end slavery. His pioneering work debunked doubts about the ability of African-Americans to transition into free society. Specifically, he used his training in medicine and statistics to refute the arguments of slave owners and prominent thought leaders that African-Americans were inferior and that slaves were better off than free African-Americans or white urban laborers. Frederick Douglass, narrator of the Anti-Slavery Movement, cited Dr. James McCune Smith as the single most important influence on his life. Dr. McCune Smith, along with Frederick Douglass, Gerrit Smith, John Brown and other intellectual pioneers of the time, were instrumental in making the elimination of slavery possible.",

This conference and the symposium were among the most popular activities of the congress. This is important because the activities addressed important issues, including the fact that only 29% of the worlds' researchers are women, and women have difficulty progressing in a scientific career. Our report discusses why and which strategies could change this reality. We believe this symposium has not only contributed to advance and bring insights to physiological sciences, but, more importantly, it inspired and motivated physiologists to think about gender balance and the contribution and participation of women in physiological science.",

    "abstract": "College biology courses commonly use diagrams to convey information. These visual representations are embedded in course materials with the expectation that students can comprehend and learn from them. Educational research, however, suggests that many students have difficulty understanding diagrams and the conventions (e.g., labels, arrows) they contain. The present study evaluates biology students’ ability to comprehend scientific diagrams and the diagram characteristics that affect this comprehension. Participants were students in a physiology course who completed a multiple-choice test of diagram comprehension ability (DCA) (Cromley JG, Perez TC, Fitzhugh SL, Newcombe NS, Wills TW, Tanaka JC. J Exp Educ 81: 511–537, 2013). We coded the conventions used in each test diagram and used these codes to capture the diagram characteristics of conventions and complexity. Descriptive analyses examine students’ ability to understand scientific diagrams and which diagram characteristics cause the most difficulty. We also compared groups with low and high DCA scores to evaluate how students at different levels of comprehension ability are affected by diagram characteristics. Results show relatively poor DCA; the average total test score was only 69.5%. The conventions used in a diagram also affected diagram comprehension, and results show students had the most difficulty comprehending diagrams using a letter or numbering system, where arbitrary letters/numbers were used to signify objects and diagrams using cut-outs that showed cross sections and magnified interior views. Additionally, students’ comprehension was higher on diagrams with higher complexity (i.e., more types of conventions used), potentially indicating students are able to take advantage of the supports that different conventions provide. Implications for instruction are identified.",

At the University of South Australia, some undergraduate immunology students find this topic challenging. The author designed, implemented, and assessed the impact of an interactive simulation to facilitate student learning of HDN. The students were actively engaged in determining the blood grouping and Rh status of an expectant mother and father and then determining the possibility of developing HDN. The simulation was found to take only 15 min to complete yet led to a significant increase in student performance in an end of semester exam question. Student perceived understanding was found to significantly improve following the introduction of the simulation, even though the content had been covered in a formal lecture. Student feedback was highly positive of this learning approach. In conclusion, short, interactive simulations can be used effectively to enhance student learning of challenging concepts.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the description and analysis of a didactic experience involving the participation of a university and a community school, developed as part of the National Science and Technology Week, at a public university in northeastern Brazil. For this purpose, the use of learning station rotation enabled innovation in the teaching of physiology integrated with biochemistry and health education contents. The didactic approach consisted of creating a learning circuit comprising seven stations. The central theme of the stations emphasized physiology, with specific foci on biochemistry and cardiorespiratory and endocrine health. Each station provided unique activities related to the central theme, including a station concerning digital technology in physiology. The school students were divided into small groups (6 or 7 people) that rotated through the stations, with a total of 81 students visiting each station. A qualitative assessment was performed using a Likert-scale questionnaire to measure the level of satisfaction of the students. It was found that this didactic approach increased the receptivity of the students to the contents, facilitated student-teacher dialogue, and provided an excellent tool for establishing an interface between the university and the community school. Overall, 76.5% of the students rated the activity as excellent.",

Once the pandemic ensued, many faculty continued to use the method as a way to infuse elements of active learning remotely. The results of a survey taken by 600 faculty reveal how they accomplished this feat. Respondents to the survey found that the case method readily transferred to online learning. Most used a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous classrooms. Serious challenges were encountered, primarily due to the difficulty instructors had in keeping track of learner participation. Many obstacles were overcome by creative strategies such as using Google Forms. Some semblance of a normal classroom was achieved by using online conferencing tools and using small groups in synchronous breakout rooms. Cases were commonly broken into chunks and spread over several days. This worked especially well with cases that were already structured this way, including interrupted cases and problem-based learning exercises. Assessment of student performance largely followed the traditional path of exams, projects, and essays, although a third of the faculty attempted to evaluate participation. Classes conducted via an asynchronous approach were largely lecture based, with cases given to learners to complete as homework either individually or as groups. The greatest challenge in this setting was that answers to case questions were often readily available to learners on the internet. This was avoided by faculty modifying questions or creating their own.",

    "abstract": "Internationalization of the curriculum is central to the strategic direction of many modern universities and has widespread benefits for student learning. However, these clear aspirations for internationalization of the curriculum have not been widely translated into more internationalized course content and teaching methods in the classroom, particularly in scientific disciplines. This study addressed one major challenge to promoting intercultural competence among undergraduate science students: finding time to scaffold such learning within the context of content-heavy, time-poor units. Small changes to enhance global and intercultural awareness were incorporated into existing assessments and teaching activities within a second-year biomedical physiology unit. Interventions were designed to start a conversation about global and intercultural perspectives on physiology, to embed the development of global awareness into the assessment and to promote cultural exchanges through peer interactions. In student surveys, 40% of domestic and 60% of international student respondents articulated specific learning about interactions in cross-cultural groups resulting from unit activities. Many students also identified specific examples of how cultural beliefs would impact on the place of biomedical physiology within the global community. In addition, staff observed more widespread benefits for student engagement and learning. It is concluded that a significant development of intercultural awareness and a more global perspective on scientific understanding can be supported among undergraduates with relatively modest, easy to implement adaptations to course content.",

To enable cholesterol's targeted delivery to cells and tissues, it is encapsulated by different fractions of lipoproteins, complex particles containing both proteins and lipids. Maintaining cholesterol homeostasis is a highly regulated process with multiple factors acting at both molecular and tissue levels. Furthermore, to regulate the circulatory transport of cholesterol in lipoproteins, the amount of cholesterol present depends on and is controlled by cholesterol dietary intake, de novo synthesis, usage, and excretion; abnormal and/or unbalanced cholesterol levels have been shown to lead to severe outcomes, e.g., cardiovascular diseases. To investigate cholesterol transport in the circulatory system, we have previously developed a two-compartment mathematical model. Here, we show how this model can be used as a teaching tool for cholesterol homeostasis. Using the model and a hands-on approach, students can familiarize themselves with the basic components and mechanisms behind balanced cholesterol circulatory transport as well as investigate the consequences of and countermeasures to abnormal cholesterol levels. Among others, various treatments of high blood cholesterol levels can be simulated, e.g., with commonly prescribed de novo cholesterol synthesis inhibitors.",

Effective feedback can become part of the learning cycle that is not only a learning opportunity for the student but can also be used to inform the teacher and ongoing curriculum development. Feedback is considered particularly important during the first year of university and can even be viewed as a retention strategy that can help attenuate student performance anxieties and solidify perceptions of academic support. Unfortunately, the provision of individualized, timely feedback can be particularly challenging in first-year courses as they tend to be large and diverse cohort classes that pose challenges of time and logistics. Various forms of generic feedback can provide rapid and cost-effect feedback to large cohorts but may be of limited benefit to students other than signaling weaknesses in knowledge. The present study describes a method that was used to provide formative task-related feedback to a large cohort of first-year physiology and anatomy students. Based on student evaluations presented in this study, this method provided feedback in a manner that engaged students, uncovered underlying misconceptions, facilitated peer discussion, and provided opportunity for new instruction while allowing the lecturer to recognize common gaps in knowledge and inform ongoing curriculum development.",

The data analysis is based on the assumption that systemic understanding demands the perception of three system dimensions: the components forming the system at all levels of organization (its structures), the interactions and mechanisms between them (its behavior), and the function as a whole outcome (its phenomena).

    "abstract": "Mental health conditions can impact college students' academic achievements and experiences. As such, students may choose to disclose mental illnesses on medical school applications. Yet, no recent studies have investigated to what extent disclosure of a mental health condition may impact whether an applicant is accepted to medical school. We conducted an audit study to address this gap and surveyed 99 potential medical school admissions committee members from over 40 M.D.-granting schools in the United States. Participants rated a fictitious portion of a single medical school application on acceptability, competence, and likeability. They were randomly assigned to a condition: an application that explained a low semester grade-point average due to 1) a mental health condition, 2) a physical health condition, or 3) offered no explanation. After rating their respective application, all committee members were asked about when revealing a mental health condition would be beneficial and when it would be detrimental. Using ANOVAs, multinomial regression, and open coding, we found that medical school admissions committee members do not rate applications lower when a mental health condition is revealed. Committee members highlighted that revealing a mental health condition to demonstrate resiliency could be beneficial, but if the reference is vague or the condition is not being managed, it could be detrimental to a student's application. This work indicates that medical school admissions committee members do not exhibit a bias against mental health conditions and provides recommendations on how to discuss mental illness on medical school applications.",

Understanding the brain mechanisms responsible for learning and memory and the factors that influence them, such as age, environment, emotions, and motivation, can transform educational strategies by contributing to the development of programs that optimize learning. Including neuroscience education in teachers' training requires teaching them a multidisciplinary approach to science, which presents a challenge. Furthermore, the potential educational advances from the incorporation of neuroscience into teachers' training are hindered by significant obstacles such as translating research into the classroom; this includes the spread of neuromyths and the products, practices, and programs based on them.

Sixty teachers participated in the course. The synchronous meetings lasted 1.5 h/wk and addressed different themes: neuroscience and education, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, neurobiology of learning and memory, factors that interfere with learning, and pedagogical innovation. According to the teachers' perceptions, the course was fundamental for them in terms of acquiring new knowledge about neuroscience.

    "abstract": "In September of 2020, a group of dental students (DDS) and motivated faculty at the University of Western Ontario came together in response to the pandemic and established a real-time feedback model. The goal of this model was to address technical challenges following the quick transition from in-person courses to a fully online format for student learning. This initial offering formed the foundation of the Students as Partners (SaP) program to identify and address technical and curricular issues. We used an action research approach to evaluate and refine the innovation's delivery. Preliminary data from the first cycle suggested that students were unaware of the impact of their feedback and the actionable items from their feedback. Thus, for the second iteration we focused on making the entire process more transparent by using Padlet as a way to streamline posting and responding to feedback. To evaluate the refined system, we distributed surveys to student and faculty participants to obtain feedback on their awareness and satisfaction and effectiveness of the program. For students who utilized the system, the majority indicated that they were informed of changes based on their feedback. Furthermore, students reported that our innovation provided a platform for the student voice. Faculty impressions were generally positive, and the majority of faculty respondents indicated that they implemented changes to their content/curriculum based on feedback. These results demonstrate that the SaP program's real-time feedback system closed the feedback loop and facilitated real-time improvements based on actionable feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first study to design, implement, and evaluate a real-time feedback system for the purpose of modifying how an instructor teaches.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Course feedback surveys at the end of term infrequently result in beneficial change. However, student feedback should be considered to develop meaningful learning. In response to this problem, we report on a novel Students as Partners innovation to address instructional issues in real time with a virtual bulletin board application embedded in the learning management system. Students and instructors valued the system's ability to close the feedback loop and provide transparent, actionable change.",

    "abstract": "The past ∼15 years have seen increasing interest in defining disciplinary core concepts. Within the field of physiology, Michael, McFarland, Modell, and colleagues have published studies that defined physiology core concepts and have elaborated many of these as detailed conceptual frameworks. With such helpful definitions now in place, attention is turning to the related issue of how to maximize student understanding of the core concepts by linking these \"big ideas\" to concrete student-facing resources for active learning and assessment. Our practitioner-based view begins with the recognition that in many if not most undergraduate physiology courses assessment drives learning. We have therefore linked published conceptual frameworks to Test Question Templates (TQTs), whose structure promotes transparent assessments as well as the active learning needed to prepare for such assessments. We provide examples of conceptual framework-linked TQTs for the physiology core concepts of Homeostasis, Flow Down Gradients, the Cell Membrane, and Cell-Cell Communication. We argue that this deployment of TQTs has at least two distinct benefits for the teaching and learning of core concepts. First, documenting the connections between conceptual frameworks and TQTs may clarify coverage and assessment of the core concepts for both instructors and students. Second, misconceptions about core concepts may be directly targeted and dispelled via thoughtful construction, arrangement, and iteration of TQTs. We propose that the TQT framework or similar approaches may be applied fruitfully to any sufficiently articulated physiology core concept for high school, undergraduate, or graduate students.",

The Electrochemical Gradients Assessment Device (EGAD) is a 17-item test assessing students' understanding of fundamental concepts of neurophysiology, e.g., electrochemical gradients and resistance, synaptic transmission, and stimulus strength. We collected responses to the EGAD from 534 students from seven institutions nationwide, before and after instruction. We determined the relative difficulty of neurophysiology topics and noted that students did better on \"what\" questions compared to \"how\" questions, particularly those integrating concentration gradient and electric forces to predict ion movement. We also found that, even after instruction, students selected one incorrect answer, at a rate greater than random chance for nine questions. We termed these incorrect answers attractive distractors. Most attractive distractors contained terms associated with concentration gradients, equilibrium, or anthropomorphic and teleological reasoning, and incorrect answers containing multiple terms were more attractive. We used χ2 analysis and alluvial diagrams to investigate how individual students moved or did not move between answer choices on the pre- and posttest. Interestingly, students selecting the attractive distractor on the pretest were just as likely as other incorrect students to move to the correct answer on the posttest. In contrast, of students incorrect on both the pre- and posttest, students who selected the attractive distractor on the pretest were more likely to stick with this answer on the posttest than students choosing other incorrect answers. Combining the EGAD results with alluvial diagrams can inform neurophysiology instruction to address points of student confusion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Investigating students' alternative reasoning in neurophysiology, this research is the first to investigate how analyzing the most common incorrect answer can shed light on the concepts students struggle with when reasoning about neurophysiological problems, especially those dealing with both chemical and electrical driving forces to predict ion movement across cell membranes.",

    "abstract": "The core concepts of physiology, as first published in this journal in 2011, not only provide a noteworthy teaching approach but also encourage reflection on the fundamentals of physiology. Unfortunately, a fundamental flaw has crept into the core concept of flow down gradients. Fluids do not generally flow from high to low pressure, as claimed, but only because of a specific pressure difference, that is, the perfusion pressure. This is related to a problem that is widespread in physiology, from which even the core concepts are not free, namely, the description of mean arterial pressure (MAP) solely by means of Ohm's law of circulation, although this law actually describes perfusion pressure. Both pressures can be numerically approximately equal in the physiological case, but conceptually they remain different in principle. We solved this problem using the extended Bernoulli equation (a combination of Ohm's law and the simple Bernoulli equation). Thereafter, MAP depends on the following pressure components, all of which are essential for a basic understanding of circulation: perfusion, central venous, gravitational, and dynamic pressures. These pressures also have great pathophysiological and clinical importance, which we exemplify here. Toward the end of this article, we provide recommendations that should be considered in teaching, whether it is a beginner or advanced course. We address physiology teachers who are open to critical constructive improvements in their teaching, especially in hemodynamics. In particular, we encourage the authors of the flow down gradients core concept to improve and refine its \"unpacking.\"NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article addresses physiology teachers and in particular the authors of the core concept of flow down gradients. Using mean arterial pressure (MAP) as an example, we demonstrate the conceptual problems of pressure that must be considered in teaching to prevent misconceptions. Even in beginner courses, the acting pressures should be clearly distinguished (e.g., MAP vs. perfusion pressure). In advanced courses, we recommend a mathematical description of pressure (Ohm's law and Bernoulli's equation).",

However, few studies have investigated students' preference for either summative or formative evaluations, particularly in the area of preclinical medicine. The current study addresses this deficit by surveying 137 first-year graduate entry to medicine (GEM) preclinical medical students from 2 consecutive years (2018-2019 and 2019-2020), for their thoughts on the 6 summative (i.e., for a small percentage of marks), proctored and the 5 informal, formative (i.e., no marks available) continuous assessments in physiology that they encountered in semesters 1 and 2, respectively. Our survey revealed that between 75 and 90% of students felt that both evaluation formats were roughly equally useful (i.e., selecting options, \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\") both for providing feedback about their understanding of physiology and for identifying deficits in their physiology knowledge. However, although a significantly larger number of students felt that summative evaluations motivated them to study more than the formative evaluations (P = 0.006), overall, more students favored formative over summative assessments. Notably, however, GEM students from nonbiomedical backgrounds were significantly more in favor of summative assessments than those from either biomedical backgrounds (P = 0.003) or the whole GEM survey cohort (P = 0.01). The implications of these findings will be discussed, with suggestions as to how the student views outlined here might be facilitated within an academic program to maximize both student learning as well as their motivation to study and keep up with taught material.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although several studies have investigated the relative effectiveness of regular summative versus formative assessments as tools to facilitate student learning and understanding, ours is the first to explicitly solicit students' views on, and preferences for, either regular formative or summative assessment in preclinical medicine. We demonstrate that, overall, students preferred formative- to summative-type assessments, due to the immediacy of feedback, but also that summative tests incentivized them to study and keep up with material more.",

Findings show that middle school students responded positively to the program and felt as though they had a better understanding of mitochondria. Future implications for hands-on programs to involve underrepresented students in science are discussed, as well as potential considerations to adapt it for high school and undergraduate students.",

    "abstract": "Questioning is an important activity in teaching. In medical colleges, on-stage quiz competitions are appreciated by students as well as faculty as they are an engaging way to connect with the discipline. We organized the Physiology Quiz Competition to assess the concepts of functional mechanisms of various organ systems. It was an academic tool for teaching and learning for 200 first-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) course students. It was conducted in four rounds: multiple choice question-based round 1 (R1), explanatory-type round 2 (R2), rapid-fire round 3 (R3), and image-based round 4 (R4). The postquiz feedback questionnaire included 23 total questions; 10 questions used a 5-point Likert scale, another 10 questions had dichotomous options, and the remaining 3 questions were used to collect general information about all rounds. Data were collected and analyzed. The outcome of academic learning was reported by 26% of students regarding R1, 30.5% regarding R2, 18.5% regarding R3, and 25% regarding R4 round. R4 and R3 were reported by 44.5% and 23% of students and R2 and R1 by 16% of students as a source of entertainment. A total of 67% of students found the quiz to be an excellent teaching and learning method. All students endorsed the quiz as innovative and interesting. In conclusion, the Physiology Quiz Competition can be used for edutainment as an innovative teaching and learning method, especially for first-year medical students.",

The special populations were chosen because of their unique limitations and adaptations, which directly influence cardiovascular function. Basic anatomic and physiological data about the special populations are provided, and the students are challenged to analyze and assimilate information from figures, answer questions, make calculations, and plot graphs. The answers to the questions are provided in the APPENDIX. This laboratory exercise should be attempted in a group to foster discussions and interactions.

Moreover, opportunities abound for showing how each hemodynamic principle can explain one or another functional feature of the cardiovascular system or a cardiovascular pathophysiological state.

It is not easy, however, to obtain a stable intracellular recording of action potentials from the conventionally used skeletal muscle cells, because the tip of a glass microelectrode often comes out or breaks due to muscle contraction. Here, I present a much simpler recording method using a flexible polyethylene electrode with a wide orifice (approximately 1 mm) for a bullfrog heart beating on automaticity. Extracellular recordings of action potentials (electrocardiogram) can be obtained by placing an electrode on the cardiac surface, and transmembrane potentials can be obtained by rupturing the membrane with negative pressure, i.e., whole cell configuration. Once attached to the heart by suction, the polyethylene electrode does not easily come off during contraction of the heart. Perfusion of the heart via the postcaval vein offers us opportunities for observing the effects of either changing ionic compositions of solutions or applying drugs. The techniques shown here provide a simple and convenient way to perform a variety of class experiments.",

High grades were earned by students stronger in the traits of introversion (I) and judgment (J), whereas the extraverted (E) and perceptive (P) types had the lowest grades and dropped out of the course in the largest numbers. When combinations of MBTI types were compared, the highest grades were earned as follows: SJ greater than ST greater than IN greater than IJ greater than IS (S, sensing; T, thinking; N, intuitive). This ranking indicates that a sensing personality also has a strong relationship to achievement in this Human Physiology course when it is combined with judgment, thinking, or introversion.

Although physiology laboratories are a standard part of physiology courses, teachers are not always clear about the purposes of these activities. At least three categories of purpose seem important: the conceptual, the motivational, and the technical. As laboratories are being replaced in some cases by videodisc or computer simulations, it is important to see which purposes can be served by simulations and which cannot. Project-based laboratories, even more than standard laboratories, can serve the technical, motivational, and conceptual purposes for our laboratory teaching.",

Most articles focus on curriculum (i.e., what is taught), but this paper will focus on instruction (i.e., how curriculum is implemented).

Lectures are extremely efficient for delivering large amounts of information in a short period of time. A common laboratory strategy is discovery or inquiry-based learning (i.e., giving students tools, cognitive and physical, to deduce new information via investigations). A third instructional strategy is the use of cooperative learning. Proper conditions are required for each instructional strategy, and problems arise when the wrong combinations are put together. This paper will describe how a cooperative learning environment can be created in the anatomy and physiology laboratory through the use of cooperative quizzes. It will include a brief introduction to the pedagogical theory behind cooperative learning and an evaluation of the effectiveness of quizzes compared with more traditional methods.",

We hypothesized that this difficulty is rooted in a student's misunderstanding of virtual volume. This was tested by having students select from several drawings the one they thought plasma would look like after a certain volume of it has been cleared of sodium by the kidneys. About half the participating students selected plasma pictured as having a certain volume of it devoid of sodium molecules. That is, their misconception of clearance seemed to be due to a lack of understanding about virtual volume, a deficiency which is reinforced by the classic definition of clearance. To address this misconception, a demonstration was devised in which a beaker of concentrated colored water was used to represent plasma before renal clearance, a beaker of the same concentrated colored water in which the top third had been replaced by clear mineral oil was used to represent what the definition of clearance said would happen to plasma after a third of it had been cleared of sodium, and a beaker of dilute colored water was used to represent what really happens to plasma when a certain volume of it is cleared of a solute. Incorporating this demonstration into discussions of renal clearance helped students to understand this concept, as evidenced by improved scores on related questions.",

The special section of introductory biology that resulted from this workshop is designed to use laboratories and activities that either help students learn major concepts in the life sciences or model how to teach these concepts to their future K-8 students. This study describes how the active, hands-on learning opportunity for preservice teachers with its emphasis on both content and performance-based assessment was implemented in an introductory biology course for elementary education majors during the spring of 2004. During the initial offering of this course, student perceptions about what helped them to learn in the special section was compared with their nonscience major peers in the large lecture-intensive class that they would have taken. Each group of students completed early and late web-based surveys to assess their perceptions about learning during the courses. After the completion of the course, students in the special section appreciated how the relevance of science and conducting their own scientific experimentation helped them learn, enjoyed working and studying in small groups, valued diverse class time with very little lecture, were more confident in their abilities in science, and were more interested in discussing science with others. This course format is recommended for science classes for preservice teachers.",

A common refrain from graduates is that there is a need for better training in the diverse, multiple skills that they will need to succeed in obtaining a faculty position and excelling in that position once it is obtained. Our university recently developed a new neuroscience graduate program that allowed us to create a curriculum and core courses de novo and that could be tailored to provide training in diverse skills used by everyday neuroscience faculty members. The current article details our rationale, design, and implementation of this new curriculum and its two major core courses. The genesis of the new curriculum also provided an opportune time to introduce and test new teaching technology in the two neuroscience core courses. The technology incorporated included on-line WebCT course sites, computer performance system, and the Tegrity system. Herein, we elaborate on our experiences with the use of this technology in the small class graduate course setting and provide insight on student feedback on the perceived effectiveness of the technology.

A review of student answers to the case questions showed that students can use the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to make meaningful determinations of oxygen uptake and delivery. However, the fact that many students had difficulty locating the effect of carbon monoxide poisoning in the process of external respiration suggests that these students have not built a robust model of how oxygen distributes itself between the plasma and hemoglobin. This suggests that more determined emphasis on how oxygen enters the blood and how it is partitioned between hemoglobin and the plasma would help students develop more accurate mental models of how oxygen moves from the lungs to the tissues.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a novel approach to study the metabolic regulation of the respiratory system in vertebrates that suits physiology lessons for undergraduate students. It consists of an experimental demonstration of the goldfish's (Carassius auratus) adaptations to anoxia. The goldfish is one of the few vertebrates showing strong enzymatic plasticity for the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which allows it to survive long periods of severe anoxia. Therefore, we propose two simple laboratory exercises in which students are first asked to characterize the distribution of ADH isozymes in the goldfish by performing cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The second part of this laboratory lesson is the determination of liver glycogen. To further student comprehension, an interspecies comparative component is integrated, in which the same subjects are studied in an anoxia-sensitive species, the brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis). ADH in goldfish is restricted to skeletal muscles, where it catalyzes alcoholic fermentation, permitting ethanol excretion through the gills and therefore preventing lactate acidosis caused by sustained glycolysis during anoxia. Electrophoresis also reveals the occurrence of a liver isozyme in the brook charr, which ADH catalyzes in the opposite pathway, allowing the usual ethanol degradation. As for the liver glycogen assay, it shows largely superior content in the goldfish liver compared with the brook charr, providing goldfish with a sustained energy supply during anoxia. The results of this laboratory exercise clearly demonstrate several physiological strategies developed by goldfish to cope with such a crucial environmental challenge as oxygen depletion.",

By means of diffusional processes, substances can be efficiently transferred at short distances. For that reason, it is a very important mechanism of exchange between the cells comprising a plant or an animal and the surrounding compartments with which they interact as well as between the compartments themselves (such as the interstitial and capillary compartments, for example). However, diffusion is too a slow process when matter has to be transported along the large distances found in the bodies of multicellular organisms. Consequently, as organisms became larger, diffusion was no longer capable of providing for all their needs, and convective transport was made necessary.Explaining to undergraduate students why diffusion works so badly at larger distances while at the same time being a process of paramount relevance at the cellular level is not a trouble-free task (4). Although students easily grasp the notion that random processes are capable of giving rise to emergent behavior, such as the net directional movement of molecules, they frequently confound a macroscopic ballistic view of movement with a microscopic diffusive one. It appears to arise from a deep-seated misconception about random processes (2). In the present article, we describe an inexpensive and simple way to make students intuitively experience the probabilistic nature and nonorientated motion of diffusing particles. This understanding allows students to realize why diffusion works so well over short distances and becomes increasingly and rapidly less effective as the distances involved become progressively larger. We believe that this activity is in agreement with the urge for the adoption of teaching approaches that more actively involve the student in the learning process, focus on problem solving, and lead to more meaningful learning (3).The only required materials are some coins. In a classroom, the instructor has to assemble three groups of, say, five students each. The first group represents the “particles,” and the second and third groups are composed, respectively, by the “dealers” and “secretaries.” Each particle is assigned to its own dealer and secretary. To start the experiment, the students representing the particles must stand in line above the same reference mark located centrally at the front of the classroom (see Fig. 1). At the signal of the instructor, each dealer, by tossing a coin, will inform his/her respective particle to which side to move, according to a rule previously established by the instructor: for instance, heads means one step to the right and tails means one step to the left (the instructor should alert the students representing the dealers to pay attention at the process of coin flipping, so that the coin, once tossed up, should rotate several times to reduce outcome biases; this is extremely important, as the coin is to be used as a random number generator). Upon being informed about the respective outcome (left or right), each particle should walk one step in the informed direction, which is accordingly registered by the team's secretary. The demonstration finishes after 16, 25, or 36 trials, as decided by the instructor. After that, the instructor should ask the students to appreciate where each particle has finished its “random walk” and how far it is from the reference mark signaling the initial position. The students are instructed to consider each trial as an arbitrary unit of time of equal duration and each step as spanning an arbitrary unit of space with constant length. The expected average result of this demonstration should follow this equation: distance∞time(1)Fig. 1.The particles must stand in line (shown is just one “particle”) above some central mark on the classroom's floor (0). After the dealer has flipped the coin, the particle has to move one step aside. The direction of the movement depends on the outcome of the toss (for instance, heads = rightward and tails = leftward).Download figureDownload PowerPointConsequently, after 16, 25, or 36 trials, the average net displacement (distance) from the initial mark is expected to be 4, 5, or 6, respectively (the agreement between the expected and observed averages increases with the number of students playing the particles). The instructor should then ask the students why this happened, that is, why do some particles remain so close to their original positions after so many steps (time units)? It is quite possible that after all trials one or more particles may finish the demonstration at their starting position, whereas some of them may hit the wall of the room. At this time, some of the students have probably realized the nonoriented nature of this process: a unidimensional random walk. The instructor should stimulate the imagination of the students by asking them to calculate how many trials (or how long) would be necessary for a given particle to cover the distance between the starting central mark and the classroom's door or beyond.To make the experiment even clearer, the instructor should ask the students to calculate the theoretical average distances for a single trial, two trials, and three trials, which can be easily shown in a simple table (Table 1). From these results (Table 1), the students should be able to appreciate a few important features: After one trial, the ending position is always (and obviously) at a distance = 1 (taking into account the absolute magnitude of the displacement).After two trials, the average distance for a pool of many particles is distance = 1, although each particle, individually, will always end up with equal probability at either distance = 2 or distance = 0.After three trials, among eight possible outcomes, only two of them correspond to a distance = 3 (the maximum allowed); the six other possible outcomes (75% of the total) will lead to a final net displacement distance = 1.Table 1. Possible outcomes for sequences of one, two, or three trialsOne TrialTwo TrialsThree TrialsDirectionPositionDirectionPostionDirectionPositionLeft−1LeftRight0LeftLeftLeft−3Right1RightLeft0LeftLeftRight−1LeftLeft−2LeftRightLeft−1RightRight2RightLeftLeft−1LeftRightRight1RightLeftRight1RightRightLeft1RightRightRight3<d> = 1<d> = 1<d> = 1.5The mean distance is calculated by averaging, over all outcomes, the absolute value of the final distances. The average of the absolute distances <| d |>, which is easier for students to appreciate, differs slightly from the traditional measure of the net displacement of diffusing particles, more commonly expressed as the square root of the variance, <d2>1/2 (which leads to a net displacement of 4, 5, or 6 for 16, 25, or 36 trials, respectively, as previously mentioned).A graphing exercise can be performed before the actual data collection. Based on the above theory, one can propose to students to plot distance versus time as well as time versus distance, accordingly to Eq. 1. The shape of the first graph will show that even after long periods of time, a given particle only covers short distances. The second plot will show how long a particle takes to cover long distances. The comparison between theoretical and observed data helps students capture the way in which the process unfolds.After the students have fully comprehended the random walk and diffusion in one dimension, the instructor can use the same concepts to explain and extrapolate the situation to three dimensions.Internal transport systems in multicellular organisms must assure that nutrients, gases, and other vital substances move from sites of production or uptake to sites of use; furthermore, these systems have to provide for the excretion of byproducts of cell metabolism. Over short distances of hundreds of micrometers, materials can diffuse through the body in short times. For example, the time that it takes for oxygen to diffuse in water, the major constituent of living bodies, through the 5 μm of a cell is ∼0.2 ms (1). Therefore, diffusion takes place in microscopic body structures maintained along the evolutionary course: inside the cell, across the plasma, capillary, nephron, and alveoli membranes, over the synapse cleft, and over many other microscopic structures. Nevertheless, this demonstration shows that due to the probabilistic and nonoriented nature of the diffusion process, a particle can take minutes to diffuse even over the tiny distance of 1 in. As body size increases, the time it takes for materials to move from one end of the organism to the other by diffusion increases greatly. The time needed for oxygen diffusion through the body of a small animal of 6 cm is ∼7 h, through a human body of 2 m is ∼10 mo, and over the 15 m of some big animals is ∼48 yr (1)! This fact was the foremost selective pressure to the phylogenetic development of some internal transport systems by convection, like the respiratory, circulatory, and urinary systems–all convective transport systems.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors thank Nestor Caticha for helpful discussions on the central topic of this article.REFERENCES1.

The tests that these women underwent were identical to those used to test the original Mercury astronauts, with the addition of gynecological examinations. Thirteen of the nineteen women tested passed these strenuous physiological exams (for comparison, 18 of 32 men tested passed); a subset of these pilots was further tested on a series of psychological exams that were similar to or, in some instances, more demanding than those given to male Mercury candidates. Despite these promising results, further testing was halted, and the Woman in Space Program was disbanded in 1962. Although the Woman in Space Program received a great deal of publicity at the time, the story of these women was somewhat lost until they were reunited at the 1999 launch of the shuttle Columbia, commanded by Colonel Eileen Collins.",

    "abstract": "Abbreviated expressions for enzyme kinetic expressions, such as the Michaelis-Menten (M-M) equations, are based on the premise that enzyme concentrations are low compared with those of the substrate and product. When one does progress experiments, where the solute is consumed during conversion to form a series of products, the idealized conditions are violated. Here, we analyzed data of xanthine oxidase in vitro from Escribano et al. ( Biochem J 254: 829, 1988) on two conversions in series, hypoxanthine to xanthine to uric acid. Analyses were done using four models: standard irreversible M-M reactions ( model 1), Escribano et al.'s M-M forward reaction expressions with product inhibition ( model 2), fully reversible M-M equations ( model 3), and standard differential equations allowing forward and backward reactions with mass balance accounting for binding ( model 4). The results showed that the need for invoking product inhibition vanishes with more complete analyses. The reactions were not quite irreversible, so the backward reaction had a small effect. Even though the enzyme concentration was only 1–2% of the initial substrate concentrations, accounting for the fraction of solutes bound to the enzyme did influence the parameter estimates, but in this case, the M-M model overestimated Michaelis constant values by only about one-third. This article also presents the research and models in a reproducible and publicly available form.",

It was field tested during the United States of America Science and Engineering Festival held in Washington, DC, in October 2010. The basic equipment for the activity consisted of lengths of plastic tubing, a hand pump, collection containers, clamps, and simulated blood prepared by tinting water with red food coloring. Student participants were first asked to experience the effort required to pump through an unaltered tube. A presenter then applied a strong clamp that pinched each tube downstream from the pump, and students were asked to pump against the increased resistance. The students' observations were then used as the basis for discussions of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease with the presenters. Distribution of informative postcards during the 2 days of the festival indicated that at least 2,500 students completed the Healthy Heart Race activity. Our experiences to date suggest that the Healthy Heart Race activity can be accomplished effectively in the high-volume, high-distraction environment of a science fair or museum.",

    "abstract": "In electrophysiology studies, it is becoming increasingly common to explain experimental observations using both descriptive methods and quantitative approaches. However, some electrophysiological phenomena, such as the generation of extracellular potentials that results from the propagation of the excitation source along the muscle fiber, are difficult to describe and conceptualize. In addition, most traditional approaches aimed at describing extracellular potentials consist of complex mathematical machinery that gives no chance for physical interpretation. The aim of the present study is to present a new method to teach the formation of extracellular potentials around a muscle fiber from both a descriptive and quantitative perspective. The implementation of this method was tested through a written exam and a satisfaction survey. The new method enhanced the ability of students to visualize the generation of bioelectrical potentials. In addition, the new approach improved students' understanding of how changes in the fiber-to-electrode distance and in the shape of the excitation source are translated into changes in the extracellular potential. The survey results show that combining general principles of electrical fields with accurate graphic imagery gives students an intuitive, yet quantitative, feel for electrophysiological signals and enhances their motivation to continue their studies in the biomedical engineering field.",

Didactic lectures in and of themselves are insufficient, whereas a problem-based tutorial alone can be as ineffective. This study was conducted to determine if a problem-based review after didactic lectures would lead to better student performance. To compare performance, the same student group was taught three units of endocrinology (growth hormone, thyroid hormone, and diabetes). Students were divided into the following three groups: diabetes didactic lectures only, growth hormone didactic lectures plus review, and thyroid hormone didactic lectures plus review. All three topics were covered in the didactic lectures, but only growth hormone and thyroid hormone topics were covered in the review session. At the end of the course, all students were given formative assessments in the form of multiple-choice questions. A highly significant increase (P < 0.000) in the percentage of correct responses on the questions covering growth hormone (mean: 0.838, SD: 0.158) and thyroid hormone (mean: 0.686, SD: 0.232) compared with diabetes (mean: 0.478, SD: 0.259) was observed. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence that the combination of didactic lectures and an active review session leads to an improvement in student performance.",

    "abstract": "The ability to critically evaluate and use evidence from one's own work or from primary literature is invaluable to any researcher. These skills include the ability to identify strengths and weakness of primary literature, to gauge the impact of research findings on a field, to identify gaps in a field that require more research, and to contextualize findings within a field. This study developed a model to examine undergraduate science students' abilities to critically evaluate and use evidence through an analysis of laboratory reports from control and experimental groups in nonresearch-aligned and research-aligned inquiry-based laboratory classes, respectively, and contrasted these with published scientific research articles. The reports analyzed (n = 42) showed that students used evidence in a variety of ways, most often referring to literature indirectly, and least commonly highlighting limitations of literature. There were significant positive correlations between grade awarded and the use of references, evidence, and length, but there were no significant differences between control and experimental groups, so data were pooled. The use of evidence in scientific research articles (n = 7) was similar to student reports except that expert authors were more likely to refer to their own results and cite more references. Analysis showed that students, by the completion of the second year of their undergraduate degree, had expertise approaching that of published authors. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to provide valuable broad-scale undergraduate research experiences to all students in a cohort, giving them exposure to the methods and communication processes of research as well as an opportunity to hone their critical evaluation skills.",

The study was initiated in the 2004–2005 academic year and continues to the present. The study shows that gaining initial institutional support for undergraduate research was assisted by providing salary support for faculty involved in undergraduate research. Once research was ongoing, each institution evolved their own unique plan for the use of support from the ND INBRE. Undergraduate student researchers have prepared, presented, and defended their research results on 188 unique posters since initiation of the program, with many posters being presented at more than one meeting. PUI faculty have authored 35 peer-reviewed manuscripts. Evaluation has shown that over 95% of the undergraduate students performing research matriculated with their bachelor’s degree. Career choices of 77.2% of these graduates was determined, and 37% pursued a career in the health professions. Of the students not pursuing a post-baccalaureate degree, 81.2% chose careers directly linked to science. The study reinforces the concept that undergraduate research can be performed directly on the PUI campus and be of value in preparing the next generation of health professionals in research, service, and teaching.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate chest ultrasound usefulness in teaching respiratory system physiology, students' perception of chest ultrasound integration into a traditional lecture in human physiology, and short-term concept retention. A lecture about respiratory physiology was integrated with ultrasound and delivered to third-year medical students. It included basic concepts of ultrasound imaging and the physiology of four anatomic sectors of the body of a male volunteer, shown with a portable ultrasound device (pleural sliding, diaphragmatic movement, inferior vena cava diameter variations, cardiac movements). Students' perceptions of the integrated lecture were assessed, and attendance recorded. After 4 mo, four multiple-choice questions about respiratory physiology were administered during the normal human physiology examinations, and the results of students who attended the lesson and those of who did not were compared. One hundred thirty-four students attended the lecture. Most of them showed encouragement for the study of the subject and considered the ultrasound integrated lecture more interesting than a traditional one and pertinent to the syllabus. Exposed students achieved a better score at the examination and committed less errors than did nonexposed students. The chest ultrasound integrated lecture was appreciated by students. A possible association between the exposure to the lecture and short-term concept retention is shown by better performances of the exposed cohort at the examination. A systematic introduction of ultrasound into physiology traditional teaching will be promoted by the Ultrasound-Based Medical Education movement.",

The objective of this study was to assess a novel mnemonic-based approach to teaching medical students to proficiently read a lateral film using a prospective pilot study. A clinical faculty radiologist taught two groups of second-year medical students to read a lateral chest X-ray. One group learned a novel mnemonic-based method (MUM), and the other cohort performed directed web-based self-study (STMM). Each cohort was given a pre- and postassessment, and their performance was analyzed. A total of n = 29 students participated with n = 14 being taught the mnemonic method.

This paper aims to establish 1) if ILCs would effectively promote physiology learning; 2) if effectiveness would be found in both previously academically high-performing and low-performing students; and 3) the acceptability of ILCs to Thai medical students as a novel learning method. Two hundred seventy-eight second-year medical students were recruited to this study. We conducted three ILC sessions, which followed corresponding lectures. We carried out multiple-choice pre- and post-ILC assessments of knowledge and compared by repeated-measures ANOVA and unpaired t-test. Subgroup analysis was performed to compare high-performance (HighP) and low-performance (LowP) students. After the ILCs, participants self-rated their knowledge and satisfaction. Post-ILC test scores increased significantly compared with pre-ILC test scores in all three sessions. Mean scores of each post-ILC test increased significantly from pre-ILC test in both LowP and HighP groups. More students self-reported a \"very high\" and \"high\" level of knowledge after ILCs. Most students agreed that ILCs provided more discussion opportunity, motivated their learning, and made lessons more enjoyable. As an adjunct to lectures, ILCs can enhance knowledge in medical students, regardless of previous academic performance. Students perceived ILC as useful and acceptable. This study supports the active learning methods in physiology education, regardless of cultural context.",

In humans, muscle metaboreflex activation can be isolated via postexercise ischemia (PEI), which increases sympathetic nerve activity and partially maintains the exercise-induced increase in arterial blood pressure. Here, we describe a practical laboratory class using PEI as a simple and useful technique to teach cardiovascular physiology. In an undergraduate exercise physiology class ( n = 47), a traditional 4-h lecture was conducted discussing the neural control mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation during exercise. Thereafter, eight students (4 men and 4 women) were selected to participate as a volunteer of a practical laboratory class. Each participant performed 90 s of isometric handgrip exercise at 40% of maximal voluntary contraction, followed by 3 min of PEI. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured by digital monitors at rest and during isometric handgrip, PEI, and recovery. In addition, blood samples were collected from the tip of the exercising finger for blood lactate analyses. After the laboratory class, a survey was given to determine the perceptions of the students. The findings demonstrate that this laboratory class has proved to be highly popular with students, who self-reported a significant improvement in their understanding of several aspects of cardiovascular regulation during exercise.",

There is strong evidence that using LM increases patient's quality of life and decreases health care cost (1, 3–5, 11). Despite the evidence, recent studies report that physicians are not making LM a standard of care (3, 10), in part due to lack of knowledge and skills in this area (3, 6). However, participation in local, national, and international workshops offering guides for integrating LM into the health profession curriculum suggests that medical schools are willing to introduce LM into their curriculum, both in preclinical years to teach normal physiology and in clinical years to teach how to change these behaviors to improve health. Our team conducted two Lifestyle Medicine Education workshops at the 2018 Annual Conference for Medical Student Education of the Society for Teachers in Family Medicine and the Annual Conference of the International Association for the Medical Science Educators, respectively. Since this is a relatively new movement, there is limited access to educators with expertise in the field of LM education (2, 6, 9). To bridge this gap, a physician with a PhD in Nutrition and a psychologist with a PhD in Counseling and Educational Psychology, both with extensive expertise in using LM with patients, created a clinical active learning curriculum based on national LM competencies, for use by both unexperienced and seasoned educators to teach medical students, residents, and physicians. This provided the much needed component of physician modeling, which we had previously identified (7) as essential for students building skills in a topic recently integrated in management guidelines. The component of the LM curriculum presented here focuses on taking a comprehensive lifestyle history, articulating the lifestyle profile, and setting lifestyle behavior change goals. The goal of this study is to determine if the intervention was feasible and engaging, and if it was associated with students' perception of, and actual, learning. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Central Florida.Our intervention presents LM as global, whole patient care. We used a comprehensive approach that targets simultaneous change in multiple behaviors and deployed it using active learning methodologies. We suggest that this approach represents the new recommended guidelines (6), and this is the gap we are addressing.METHODSDescription of the educational interventions.The educational learning outcomes for this resource were to conduct a comprehensive lifestyle history; summarize and interpret the lifestyle information into a concise lifestyle profile; compare the lifestyle profile to evidence-based recommendations to prevent/manage chronic diseases; identify target areas for lifestyle intervention; and establish SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timely with short- and long-term follow-up) lifestyle change goals. As a prerequisite, students should have basic medical interviewing skills. All of the learning outcomes were accomplished in two sessions (see Fig. 1). First, students had asynchronous access to a self-learning module that introduced the basic concepts and provided opportunities for skill practice using a virtual case of a patient in need of lifestyle changes (appendix a).Fig. 1.Schematic of the sessions.Download figureDownload PowerPointWe chose a case of a patient with obesity in need of lifestyle changes, because students had been introduced to evidence-based guidelines for the management of obesity in a previous session (8). Second, students had additional skill practice during an in-class session (appendix b), using collaborative role-play and peer and instructor feedback. Because this was a role-play, students were encouraged to act as patients with problems commonly seen in their clinical rotation, like uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled blood pressure, smoking cessation, sexually transmitted diseases, or excessive alcoholic consumption.appendix a, \"Lifestyle Medicine–Obtaining a complete lifestyle history and setting behavior change goals,\" is a self-contained learning module that utilizes Articulate technology (Articulate Global, Inc. 2017). It is accessible on any web browser that supports HTML. The self-learning module can be used for independent study, as an online exercise, or as an in-class individual or collaborative exercise during didactic sessions. The module can be completed in 20–30 min. The module uses a progressive clinical case with immediate feedback. Students navigate through the module on demand, conducting a comprehensive lifestyle history; summarizing and interpreting the lifestyle information into a concise lifestyle profile; comparing the lifestyle profile to the evidence-based recommendations to prevent/manage chronic diseases; targeting areas for lifestyle intervention; and establishing SMART lifestyle change goals. Each question builds on the previous question, so learners should attempt to answer each question to the best of their ability and study the provided feedback. For tracking purposes, this mandatory module was deployed in Webcourses, our learning management system. Initially, the two instructors deployed this intervention during a mandatory, in-class didactic session in the Internal/Family Medicine Clerkship during the third year of a 4-yr curriculum. However, to decompress the didactic time in the clerkship (based on student feedback) and to stimulate self-directed learning, we converted the in-class intervention to this self-learning module.appendix b, the checklist for the role-play session, was given to the students at the beginning of the in-class session to score their partner's performance. Students were instructed to complete the following tasks:Task 1: Work in pairs to obtain a comprehensive lifestyle history from your partner. It can be a fictitious history or a real patient history (10 min). One student acts as the \"provider\" and should ask the lifestyle history questions. One student acts as the \"patient\" and should use the handout checklist to score the \"provider.\"Task 2: \"Provider\" shares the lifestyle profile with the \"patient\" and proposes a lifestyle change SMART goal for optimal wellness (5 min).Task 3: The \"patient\" uses the checklist to score the provider on the completeness of the goal.Task 4: \"Provider\" and \"patient\" debrief (5 min). The \"provider\" reviews the checklist to identify what needs to improve to achieve the targeted outcomes.Tasks 5, 6, and 7: The learners reverse the role and perform the same tasks (20 min). Throughout the session, the instructor listens and observes student interactions and facilitates learning as needed. After these tasks are completed, the instructor debriefs the large group with take-home messages from the learner's interactions (10 min).These educational interventions improved after each iteration, with feedback from both the content experts and the learners. Other educators at workshops, posters, and oral talks presented at international and national professional meetings also provided feedback for this approach. Initially, the skills presented in the self-learning module were taught in class, where students solved one of four patient cases in which lifestyle modifications were indicated. In the first iteration, each of the four cases was presented at different didactic sessions, with the case presentation mirroring the focus of the respective didactic session: for example, a patient with celiac disease in the gastrointestinal didactic session, and a patient with diabetes in the endocrinology didactic session. Students solved the cases by answering faculty questions on a volunteer basis. Minor improvements to subsequent cohorts included transferring content delivery to an asynchronous self-learning module and adding a skill practice role-play during the class session. Feedback from students and faculty highlighted three concerns. Concern 1 pinpointed the repetitive nature of the skill practice in the different cases. To address this concern, we condensed the four cases into one case: patient with obesity, which is a common presentation in the clinical environment. Concern 2 highlighted the overall lack of student engagement in the case when only students who volunteer participate in the history-taking practice. To address this concern, we utilized the chat feature in web courses and required all students to enter responses as a chat post. This resulted in more students practicing the skills and allowed faculty to address identified misconceptions in real-time. Concern 3 addressed the issue of the topic, perceived as \"not very difficult,\" represented a low-yield, in-class activity. To address this concern, we converted the in-class session into a self-explanatory, self-paced, self-learning module that students could access and complete at their own pace, depending on their previous skills and confidence.Assessment of the interventions.Engagement was measured only during the in-class session by 1) counting the number of shared completed tasks from the total number of learners in class at that time; and 2) subjective observation of the instructor moderating the activity.Transfer of learning was measured by scoring the seven components of the SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timely, short-term evaluation, long-term evaluation) that learners entered in Webcourses using the chat feature during the in-class session. A content expert scored student's entries using a rubric previously content validated by a group of medical educators. If the goal component was correct and complete, a score of 1 was assigned. If the goal component was incorrect and/or incomplete, a score of 0 was assigned. The percentage of correct goal components from the total number of goals entered was calculated to determine the average transfer of learning for each component of the SMART goal.Learner's perception of learning after the completion of the self-learning module was evaluated using a survey (appendix c) with three 5-point Likert scale questions (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) and one free text question for suggestions. The following statements were scored: \"Overall this module was valuable as an educational tool to increase my ability to obtain a comprehensive lifestyle history\"; \"Overall this module was valuable as an educational tool to increase my ability to assist patients with setting personalized, clear lifestyle change goals\"; \"It was easy to navigate this SLM.\" The survey was adapted from a validated published survey. The survey was completed online by one block of students (n = 27) in 2018.RESULTSFeasibility.This approach was feasible at the authors' institution. It has been used in the training of medical students since May 2016 (n = 240 students in 8 subsequent cohorts) as part of the Internal/Family Medicine Clerkship curriculum. After each delivery (every 12 wk), the authors further refined the material using insights gained from student feedback, faculty reflection, and lessons learned.Engagement.The self-learning module was required and, consequently, completed by all students. The attendance for the in-class session was required, and all students attended. For the in-class session, all students completed the tasks, including entering their SMART behavior goal in the Webcourses chat platform for the clerkship. The instructors observed high engagement between the learners during the role-play task.Transfer of learning.The transfer of learning (level 3 of behaviors on Kirkpatrick's pyramid) was evaluated by grading student's SMART behavior change goals (Table 1). On average, the learners created SMART goals that included all of the seven components, and most were correctly described (average score is 5.2 out of 7). Most students scored highly on the first five components. The worst performance was observed for the short-term and long-term follow-up evaluation, where only 28 and 48% of students, respectively, created a complete and correct answer. Most learners submitted an incomplete answer, mentioning an appropriate time period, but not including the method for evaluation. These issues were subsequently clarified with students by the instructor in real time during the large-group debrief.Table 1.

For example, one student reported: \"The vignette was a good idea to incorporate specific topics to address in terms of addressing lifestyle goals.\" Changes made to future iterations of the curriculum, based on student feedback, include more specific education on lifestyle management of diseases and motivational interviewing (with patient videos), more clarification of some of the questions in the self-learning module, and a complete list of lifestyle history questions before the module, now provided to students as part of the \"patient\" checklist (appendix b).DISCUSSIONThe need for effective and easy-to-use, active learning resources for teaching LM to medical students prompted the creation of this resource based on LM-defined national competencies (6). This study suggests that it is feasible to teach medical students advanced LM skills in only 90 min of curriculum, with associated engagement, as well as both actual and perceived learning. This intervention has multiple strengths. It is a resource for the education of medical students and residents created and delivered by a physician in collaboration with a psychologist, which provides the much needed physician modeling component (7). It is based on learning outcomes, derived from national learning objectives. It exposes students to multiple interactive pedagogies to stimulate life-long learning.Feasibility of the study.The intervention was deployed multiple times and incorporated feedback from a variety of experts. It was easy to use and feasible to implement with 30 students at a time by two instructors. The limitations of this intervention were identified as part of our quality improvement approach and speaks to the feasibility of the intervention. A limitation includes need for stakeholder buy-in. Since LM has yet to hold a preeminent role in the licensing board exams, it may be difficult to secure assigned curricular time. To address this limitation, we created the self-learning module version to limit the need for time- and place-bound curriculum delivery. Another limitation relates to students' willingness to pay attention to a nonmandatory, ungraded educational activity. As these are new skills that require practice, feedback, and modeling, they cannot be learned from a book. Our experience suggests making this a mandatory curriculum component. The self-learning module is asynchronously accessible by an unlimited number of users. The in-class session should be limited to no more than 30 learners for maximal benefit and interaction. The in-class session can be completed in 50 min with a group no larger than 30 students working in pairs. At least one instructor is needed to facilitate the session. We found that, if two instructors are present, the debrief is much richer. We noted that 3% of the students disagreed with the statement related to the ease of use of the self-learning module. We discovered this was due to the fact that the students were accessing the module via a platform that allowed student activity tracking but was more cumbersome for students to navigate. With this feedback, we transferred the self-learning module to an easy-to-use technology, which is the form presented here. Please note that this technology does not allow for tracking performance.Learner engagement.Our results suggest that the intervention generated engagement of learners, identified by the assignment completion, staying on task, and instructor observations. This is an important aspect of the activity, as the observed trends with the current student generation highlight a critical decrease in engagement with educational interventions in our school, and most likely at the national level.Learning transfer and perception.On average our students scored very high (5.2 out of 7) on the targeted skills, suggesting adequate transfer of learning. In addition, most students (93% and 96%) perceived that this intervention improved the targeted skills, suggesting adequate perception of learning. We recognize that a limitation of this study is that learners were not exposed to an alternate delivery of the same learning outcome in a control versus intervention comparison, but also note this is common in pilot educational interventions initiated to address local, observed pedagogical concerns. Though future studies should assess long-term retention of skills and detailed application in clinical practice, we interpreted both the transfer of learning and perception of learning as significant given the limited curricular time.Lessons learned for future improvement.With additional curricular time, students' clinical LM skills could be further developed by including patient videos or a standardized patient encounter and/or discussions with students about actual patient encounters in clinic. The checklist (appendix b) could be used for scoring, and providing feedback, for student's performance in clinical practice.This teaching resource could be implemented \"as is\" at other institutions seeking to enhance the education of future healthcare providers on LM, a science grounded in physiology and evidence-based medicine. In addition, primary care physicians and medical residents could benefit from this resource. As more resources for teaching LM become available, there are higher chances that LM will be integrated into the medical curriculum, with the long-term goal that physicians will have the needed skills and knowledge to integrate LM into the standard of care for increasing patients' quality of life and decreasing healthcare cost.GRANTSThis study was funded by a competitive grant from the Medical Education Department, University of Central Florida College of Medicine.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSM.P. and D.K. performed experiments; M.P., D.K., and R.C. analyzed data; M.P., D.K., and R.C. interpreted results of experiments; M.P. prepared figures; M.P. drafted manuscript; M.P., D.K., and R.C. edited and revised manuscript; M.P., D.K., and R.C. approved final version of manuscript.APPENDIX AThe educational self-learning module, \"Lifestyle Medicine–Obtaining a complete lifestyle history and setting behavior change goals,\" can be found at online at https://edtech.med.ucf.edu/files/2018-19/pasarica/historygoals/presentation_html5.html.APPENDIX BBelow is the checklist for the role-play and peer feedback session.Task 1: You will be asked questions about \"your\" lifestyle history as the \"patient.\" Use the following checklist to score the \"provider's\" performance:□ You were asked what foods you most often (or typically) eat for breakfast AND lunch AND dinner.□ You were asked what beverages you most often (typically) consume (type AND quantity).□ You were asked if you typically snack between meals (type AND frequency).□ You were asked about sitting habits during the day (duration AND purpose); for example, watching TV, playing video games, reading, etc.□ You were asked about physical activity habits (duration AND type AND intensity).□ You were asked about how many hours of sleep you get per night (average or usually).□ You were asked about tobacco use (type AND duration AND quantity).□ You were asked about alcohol use (type AND duration AND quantity).□ You were asked about illegal drugs use (type AND duration AND quantity).□ You were asked if you tried to change your lifestyle before.

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of conducting two interprofessional education (IPE) experiences during a multidisciplinary physiology graduate-level course was to provide basic science, physical therapy, and physician assistant graduate students opportunities to work as a team in the diagnosis, treatment, and collaborative care when presented with a patient case focused on acute kidney injury (first case) and female athlete triad (second case). The secondary purpose was to apply basic physiology principles to patient case presentations of pathophysiology. The overall purpose was to assess the longitudinal effects and the value of IPE integrated within a basic science course. The following Interprofessional Education Collaborative subcompetencies were targeted: roles/responsibilities (RR1, RR4). Students were given a pre- and postsurvey to assess their IPE perceptions and knowledge of professional roles. There were statistically significant increases from the presurvey renal IPE experience to the presurvey endocrine IPE experience for two perception questions regarding the ability to explain the roles and responsibilities of a physical therapist (PT) and physician assistant using a Likert scale. In addition, student knowledge of the role of a PT increased significantly when comparing the renal IPE presurvey to the endocrine IPE presurvey results to open-ended questions. Students' perceptions of their knowledge as well as their ability to express, in writing, their newly learned knowledge of the role of a PT was sustained over time. Incorporating multiple IPE experiences into multidisciplinary health science courses represents an appropriate venue to have students learn and apply interprofessional competencies.",

    "abstract": "The textbook is a pedagogical tool that provides students and professionals with scientific information. As exercise is an important strategy for the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and arterial hypertension, the presence of correct and up-to-date scientific information in exercise physiology textbooks is important. Our aim was to analyze T2DM and arterial hypertension content in exercise physiology textbooks and compare this content with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) position stands. Comparative descriptions were made between information regarding T2DM and arterial hypertension found in textbooks (n = 10) and similar information contained in the official ACSM position stands. The quality of the content was compared with current scientific information present in the ACSM position stands. In regards to T2DM, eight textbooks provided information regarding the purpose and benefits of exercise, two provided information regarding exercise prescription, seven provided information regarding the type of exercise, six provided information regarding general care and recommendations, and five provided information regarding the mechanisms involved. In regards to arterial hypertension, all textbooks provided information regarding the purpose and benefit of exercise, six provided information regarding exercise prescription, nine provided information regarding the type of exercise, two provided information regarding general care and recommendations, and seven provided information regarding the mechanisms involved. All textbooks analyzed contained information related to physical exercise for patients with T2DM and arterial hypertension. However, the textbooks differed in terms of the quality of the contents, especially in regard to exercise prescription.",

    "abstract": "Learning anatomy and physiology at university can be challenging, as students need to understand both the language of the discipline and complex topics, such as system integration. Yet learning strategies are rarely taught at university, making it difficult for students to adopt new strategies, if their approach to learning has not been effective or efficient. This study evaluated the use of small-group peer discussion boards as an avenue for sharing learning strategies between students in a first-year anatomy and physiology course. The majority of students (91%) identified strategies from the discussion board worth trying before they completed the midsemester exam. The most frequently reported type of strategy was transforming records. By the end of semester, 76% of students had adopted at least one new strategy; however, these students performed significantly worse on the exam compared with students who did not adopt new strategies. The students who adopted new strategies learned about them from peers (33%), the discussion board (32%), or through self-discovery (32%). The majority of students (83%) found the discussion boards to be useful as a source of new learning strategies and for insight into how others learn. Although the discussion boards provided an avenue for students to learn about new strategies from each other, further guidance from instructors may be required to help students evaluate the effectiveness of these learning strategies.",

There were 1,389 participants from seven universities who completed the 2019 P-MIG Student Survey. Thirty-seven percent reported enrollment in a physiology/human physiology major; allied health-related programs were the second most common (24%). Sixty-one percent of respondents reported attending a community college, the majority of whom enrolled in one or more courses at a community college while in high school (44%). Of participants who reported transferring coursework from one institution to another, 72% reported coursework transferred as expected. Homeostasis and structure/function were the two core concepts common to the top rankings for self-reported mastery, the expectation to be remembered in 5 yr, and deemed to be career relevant. Survey respondents indicated high engagement in co-curricular activities, with 72% participating or planning to participate in job shadowing opportunities, followed by volunteering (57%) and internships (50%). Over one-half of all survey participants indicated they “strongly agree” that their coursework and undergraduate programming has prepared them for success in their field of study. While the majority of respondents were satisfied with the academic advising received, additional guidance with regard to career choices and non-coursework professional development opportunities may be beneficial. Taken together, the collective data provides information from current physiology students that may inform development of consensus guidelines regarding curriculum, professional skills, and advising for undergraduate physiology degree programs.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increased reliance on prerecorded lectures as a source of learning in place of live lectures in higher education. However, we must appreciate that our students send countless intended and unintended messages during class that relate to their cognitive and emotional states. Shaping productive learning experiences requires understanding their cognitive and emotional states by interpreting their statements, actions, and body language in real time. This can only occur with face-to-face instruction and makes it possible to tailor the class to the students’ needs. Becoming aware of the students’ cognitive and emotional state by listening and learning their body language is fundamental to teaching, as it will alert educators to cognitive effort and attention, surprise, or uncertainty, as well as a range of emotions, including confusion. Without an understanding of the students cognitive and emotional states, we lose our ability to structure conversations or to reinforce difficult concepts and important ideas in real time. We also lose our ability to adjust on the fly and modify instruction on the basis of the needs of our students. Thus, learning the cognitive and emotional states of our students during class is an essential skill of teaching and the critical means that a teacher uses to promote understanding and positive attitudes about education.",

    "abstract": "It is important for medical students to understand the relationship between nutrition, obesity, and diabetes to educate their patients in the future. However, medical training does not always include nutritional education. An experiential learning project was incorporated into the medical school curriculum as an effort to implement nutrition in the physiology course. First-year medical students ( n = 140) received lectures on the regulation of blood glucose levels and their relationship to carbohydrates with different glycemic indexes (GI), obesity, and diabetes. Lectures were followed by a laboratory exercise where students calculated their body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, and percentage muscle using a Bioelectrical Impedance Commercial Scale. While 63% of students had normal BMI, 31% were overweight or obese and 5% were underweight. A subgroup of 54 students tested different types of breakfasts with varying GI and provided blood samples at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Their glucose responses were plotted based on the breakfast GI. Pre- and posttests were conducted to assess the teaching intervention where the Wilcoxon signed ranks test indicated that posttest ranks were significantly higher than pretest ranks (Z = −6.6, P &lt; 0.001), suggesting the intervention was beneficial to students.",

    "abstract": "Basic medical laboratory courses (BMLCs) play an important role in medical educational courses helping the student acquire three important skills of surgical operating, collaborative learning, and problem solving. The outcome-based student assessment (OBSA) is a learning evaluation method that establishes specific evaluation points based on performance of students in three aspects: surgical operating, collaborative learning, and problem solving in the BMLC curriculum practices. The purpose of the present randomized controlled trial study is to explore the efficiency of OBSA program in BMLCs. The 233 students attending BMLCs were randomly divided into 2 groups, 118 in the OBSA group and 115 in the control group. We conducted multiple-choice examination questions (MCQs) test and two questionnaires with the method of two-sample t test for statistics. The results of MCQs in total eight BMLC blocks showed that the academic performance of the OBSA group was significantly better than that of the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the average scores of direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) and mini-experimental evaluation exercise in OBSA group were significantly higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). The majority of the medical students preferred the OBSA and considered OBSA could effectively improve their surgical operating skills (83.9%), collaborative learning skills (92.1%), and problem-solving skills (91.1%). From the above, OBSA is an effective evaluation method for the implementation of the BMLC curriculum.",

However, many concepts are complex and difficult to understand based only on conventional classes or static images. The use of tools, such as educational software, may enhance the learning of dynamic molecular phenomena that occur in our bodies. Virtual Immunology is a software that aims to facilitate the learning of certain complex immunology concepts. Herein, we present the \"Antigen-antibody interactions\" module that was used and evaluated by 127 students and 3 teachers from medical schools from 2 universities, 1 public and 1 private, both in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The pretest/posttest research design was used to assess student learning in a randomized sample. To evaluate user perceptions concerning software quality, 14 statements were analyzed using a Likert scale. Results indicate suitable evaluations from both students and teachers concerning the \"Antigen-antibody module\" as an auxiliary tool in immunology teaching. The software was well rated as an educational resource since it allows dynamically viewing immunological phenomena. In addition, its ease of use and immunological process visualization were the best-evaluated parameters by the students, who recommended this software module as an auxiliary learning tool. The use of the evaluated software may motivate students and aid in the understanding of immunology-related concepts, becoming a complementary tool that may enhance the teaching-learning process.",

The primarily agreed on professional skills for a well-rounded scientist include teamwork, oral communication, written communication, and quantitative skills. The demand for these skills has been driven by employers and graduate/professional schools. To this end, instructors in higher education have begun to integrate professional skill development into their course design and student learning goals. However, the attitudes of students themselves toward the importance of different professional skills, the inclusion of these skills in their coursework, level of improvement, and end confidence has yet to be thoroughly characterized. It was the aim of this study to ascertain students' desire for the aforementioned professional skills within their undergraduate science programs by exploring student perceptions of professional skills inclusion, importance, improvement, and confidence and identify the local courses students recognize as utilizing \"teamwork activities.\" Here we detail these attitudes in biomedical science undergraduates at Michigan State University. By using the Science Student Skills Inventory (SSSI), a previously validated assessment tool, we observed differences in student perceptions of professional skills when compared to previous SSSI studies. We also observed significant differences in attitudes between age groups in respect to writing and communication skills, differing perceptions of what constitutes teamwork, as well as gender differences in respect to attitudes around communication and ethical thinking skills. Our results give valuable insight into student perspectives on how professional skills are developed in their program. These data may be used to inform curriculum development within and across institutions.",

In this activity, students demonstrated the all-or-none nature of AP generation, measured conduction velocity, and examined the dependence of the threshold stimulus amplitude on stimulus duration. For this purpose, they used the median giant nerve fiber (MGF) in the ventral nerve cord of the common earthworm ( Lumbricus terrestris). Here, we introduce a specialized stimulation and recording chamber that the nonanesthetized earthworm enters completely unforced. The worm resides in a narrow round duct with silver electrodes on the bottom such that individual APs of the MGF can be elicited and recorded superficially. Our experimental setup combines several advantages: it allows noninvasive single fiber AP measurements taken from a nonanesthetized animal that is yet restrained. Students performed the experiments with a high success rate. According to the data acquired by the students, the mean conduction velocity of the MGF was 30.2 m/s. From the amplitude-duration relationship for threshold stimulation, rheobase and chronaxie were graphically determined by the students according to Lapicque's method. The mean rheobase was 1.01 V, and the mean chronaxie was 0.06 ms. The acquired data and analysis results are of high quality, as deduced from critical examination based on the law of Weiss. In addition, we provide video material, which was also used in the practical course.",

Currently, EMG has uses both as a research tool, in noninvasively recording muscle activation, and clinically in the diagnosis and assessment of nerve and muscle disease and injury as well as in assessing the recovery of neuromuscular function after nerve damage. In the present report, we describe the use of a basic EMG setup in our teaching laboratories to demonstrate some of these current applications. Our practical also illustrates some fundamental physiological and structural properties of nerves and muscles. Learning activities include 1) displaying the recruitment of muscle fibers with increasing force development; 2) the measurement of conduction velocity of motor nerves; 3) the assessment of reflex delay and demonstration of Jendrassik's maneuver; and 4) a Hoffman reflex experiment that illustrates the composition of mixed nerves and the differential excitability thresholds of fibers within the same nerve, thus aiding an understanding of the reflex nature of muscle control. We can set up the classes at various levels of inquiry depending on the needs/professional requirements of the class. The results can then provide an ideal platform for a discovery learning session/tutorial on how the central nervous system controls muscles, giving insights on how supraspinal control interacts with reflexes to give smooth, precise muscular activation.",

Freshmen are frequently faced with several challenges, such as adaptation to a new academic environment and its associated different methods of teaching, learning, skills, and assessment. The aim of this study was to describe a 4-wk innovative summer premedical program developed by senior medical students at the College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, in an attempt to improve/smooth the experience(s) of prospective freshmen. This report describes the objectives/strategies/methodologies used to tackle the top three identified freshman challenges, namely, 1) advancement of the academic/scholastic/educational background, 2) the development of college-required skills to succeed and excel in the freshman year, and 3) adaption to the college environment. At the end of the program, a survey was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the summer premedical program. Seventy-two students attended this program over the past three summers from 2010 to 2012, and twenty-nine students answered the survey with a response rate of 74.1%. Overall, >90% of the survey respondents reported an improvement in their understanding of basic medical science, integration, presentation skills, medical terminology, and junior-senior relationships. Furthermore, the survey highlighted the need for more focus on skills such as time management, participation in large-group discussions, and use of electronic resources, as >50% of respondents reported no improvement in these areas. In conclusion, this is the first report, to our knowledge, that describes a program developed by senior medical students to improve the experience of freshmen.",

To provide diagnostic feedback earlier, for students enrolled in 2011 ( n = 128), we incorporated an in-class exam at 3 wk in addition to the final exam. Based on initial analysis and positive student comments, for the 2012 cohort ( n = 148), we expanded this to incorporate four 1-h in-class exams every 3 wk plus a short final integrative exam. Average scores from exams and questionnaires (student evaluations of learning and teaching, 10 questions) were compared among 2010, 2011, and 2012 cohorts. We also compared scores in the practical component of the course, which had a constant format for all cohorts. Data are given as means ± SD; statistical analyses were done with unpaired two-way Students t-tests. From 2010 to 2012, there was a significant improvement in total exam scores (59.7 ± 15.8 vs. 68.6 ± 14.2, P &lt; 0.001) but no significant change in total practical scores (72.3 ± 9.0 vs. 74.4 ± 10.2, P = 0.05), indicating that the rise in exam score was not due to higher academic abilities of the 2012 cohort. Overall mean student evaluation of learning and teaching responses (4.9 ± 0.4 vs. 5.3 ± 0.3, P = 0.015) and overall percent broad agreement (66.0 ± 8.0 vs. 79.2 ± 7.5, P = 0.003) indicated a significant improvement in student satisfaction. In conclusion, both learning outcome and perceived course quality were enhanced by the increased frequency of examinations, possibly by promoting consistent student study habits.",

In the experience, students use restriction endonuclease digestion, cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis, and microscopy to discover which of three putative patients have the sickle cell genotype/phenotype using DNA and blood samples from wild-type and transgenic mice that carry a sickle cell mutation. The inquiry-based, problem-solving approach facilitates the students' understanding of the basic concepts of genetics and cellular and molecular biology and provides experience with contemporary tools of biotechnology. It also leads to students' appreciation of the causes and consequences of this genetic disease, which is relatively common in individuals of African descent, and increases their understanding of the first principles of genetics. This protocol provides optimal learning when led by well-trained facilitators (including the classroom teacher) and carried out in small groups (6:1 student-to-teacher ratio). This high-quality experience can be offered to a large number of students at a relatively low cost, and it is especially effective in collaboration with a local science museum and/or university. Over the past 15 yr, >12,000 students have completed this inquiry-based learning experience and demonstrated a consistent, substantial increase in their understanding of the disease and genetics in general.",

The study sample (n = 260) was taken from a large human physiology class, which included both first- and second-year students. However, unlike the first-year students, the second-year students had significant prior knowledge, having completed a previous physiology course. Active learning, where students were required to engage with course material in a self-directed manner before tutorials and to identify areas of difficulty and discuss these within tutorial sessions, was a central component of the study. The second-year students adapted quickly to the novel approach, as indicated by stable levels of perceived difficulty and understanding. In contrast, the first-year students demonstrated a decrease in perceived difficulty and an increase in perceived individual understanding throughout the study. These results notwithstanding, there was a consistent low level of interest for both years but no significant difference between the first- and second-year individual and group learning skills by the end of the study, as measured by their performance in the tutorials. Overall, the results were encouraging, with both years achieving a reasonably high learning skill level (average: ∼70%) within the interteaching environment. The improvement of active learning shown by the first-year students may have compensated, to some extent, for the prior learning advantage of the second-year students, since both groups achieved similar marks in the written components of final exams for both interteaching modules.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, while disruptive and abrupt, provided instructors opportunities to redesign face-to-face (F2F) lecture courses to an online asynchronous delivery mode. Asynchronous course delivery is often synonymous with recorded lectures, discussion boards, and standardized assessments, yet this mode can be student-centered, include active learning, and engage students. Our undergraduate clinical pathophysiology course was redesigned with Understanding Your Physiology (Lt by ADInstruments) lessons with video case studies in place of a textbook. Most students (72.7%) found the Lt activities effective in helping them learn the material as well as a cost-effective replacement for a traditional textbook (50%). In addition, the course design focused on different types of Lt activities to deliver the course content in an interactive way. Specifically, students (82%) appreciated the opportunity to select an answer without penalty and make another selection if needed. The type of activity that students selected as most effective in helping them learn and understand the content was the ability to determine which statements were correct/incorrect (32%). Students enjoyed the video case studies of patients because they were directly related to course content, were visually engaging, and used real patients who told their personal story. All these factors contributed to the success in achieving the study's goals of redesigning a F2F lecture course to an asynchronous online format. The online course led to verifiable pedagogical outcomes of using the Lt platform to engage students in learning. This course was offered again in 2021, filled quickly, and will continue to be offered each year.",

    "abstract": "In the early 1950s Setsuro Ebashi was a graduate student at Tokyo University studying the biochemical models of muscle contraction. The muscle components in these models contracted in the presence of ATP, but what caught his attention was that the components did not relax when ATP was exhausted. Ebashi decided in 1952 to attempt to elucidate the mechanism of muscle relaxation using these models. This decision started a journey that would lead him to be the first to propose the calcium concept of muscle contraction and relaxation in 1961. It was an unpopular theory with biochemists who refused to accept that anything as simple as an inorganic ion, Ca2+, could control anything as important as muscle contraction. Ebashi was convinced that he was correct. He proceeded to show that micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ activated contraction. In 1961 he discovered the particulate nature of the ATP-dependent relaxing factor (the sarcoplasmic reticulum) and determined that it acted by binding Ca2+. Most notably, in 1966 he discovered troponin, the Ca2+ receptor in muscle, which mediated Ca2+ control of contraction. Ebashi's discoveries were considered the most important in the muscle field since the 1950s. Ebashi had to overcome the doubt of the scientific community. This story is one of great scientific achievement against great odds that marked the emergence of Japanese muscle research onto the international scientific stage.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Setsuro Ebashi proposed the calcium concept of muscle contraction and relaxation in 1961. It was a very unpopular theory. He showed that Ca2+ activated contraction and that the sarcoplasmic reticulum caused relaxation by binding Ca2+ in an ATP-dependent manner. Most notably, he discovered the receptor that mediated Ca2+ control of contraction and named it \"troponin.\" Ebashi's discoveries are considered to be the most important in the muscle field since the 1950s.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the impact of an \"active learning\" strategy employed alone or in combination with traditional lectures on the learning of mammalian physiology by undergraduate students. The study investigated the impact of three teaching strategies, namely 1) traditional lecture, 2) group discussion alone, and 3) combination of lecture and group discussion. For all strategies, students were given homework in a textbook and they completed written assignments before each session. Every student led the discussion of at least one assigned theme during each group session. The students had no access to the textbook or notes during group discussions. Four examinations (3 in-semester and a final) assessed the students' knowledge of fundamental concepts of physiology of specific organ systems. Part of the final examination reassessed knowledge of previously tested topics. The results show that the teaching modality employed to introduce physiology topics influenced students' learning. The average marginal effect of the lecture + discussion modality (average improvement linked to lecture + discussion strategy) on students' performance was 6.45% [95% confidence interval (CI95) (4.73, 8.16), P = 1.74 × 10-13], and the average improvement associated with the discussion-only modality was 5.5% [CI95 (3.84, 7.16), P = 7.84 × 10-11]. On average, all class ranks performed better on materials covered under active learning settings than under lecture-only conditions. Moreover, students' performance under combined lecture and discussion conditions is predictive of their overall performance in the course. The results support the positive effect of student-centered learning and demonstrate the efficacy of a combination of lectures and group discussions on learning of physiology by nonmajor students.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of group discussion on the learning of mammalian physiology by nonmajor undergraduate students. Combining traditional lectures with group discussions increased the active participation of students in class and improved their learning of physiology, as measured by the results of in-semester and final examinations. The active learning technique benefited all class ranks on average.",

The purpose of this new design was to extend the use of the noninvasive neck chamber method of baroreceptor investigation to teachers of physiology. Performance tests indicate that these new chambers are capable of delineating the stimulus-response relationship for both the blood pressure baroreflex [sensitivity = 0.425 +/- 0.13 mmHg mean arterial pressure (MAP)/mmHg neck chamber pressure (NCP); range = 24.9 +/- 4.6 mmHg MAP] and the heart rate baroreflex (sensitivity 0.273 +/- 0.12 beats.min-1.mmHg NCP-1; range = 16.7 +/- 6.8 beats/min). This was achieved by applying localized positive and negative air pressures to the carotid sinuses throughout the range from +60 to -60 mmHg in steps of 20 mmHg. This simplified neck chamber method offers distinct methodological advantages over traditional neck collars, making it a valuable tool for demonstrating baroreflex regulation of the circulation.",

For this experience, students are presented with \"unknown\" chart recordings illustrating pulsatile arterial pressure before and in response to several interventions. Students must analyze and interpret these unknown recordings and match each recording with the appropriate intervention.

To meet the need of new neuroscience courses, there has also been growth in the number of introductory neuroscience textbooks designed for undergraduates. However, textbooks typically trail current knowledge by five to ten years, especially in neuroscience where our understanding is increasing rapidly. Consequently, it is often important to supplement neuroscience and physiology textbooks with information about recent findings in neuroscience. To design supplementary educational material, it is essential first to identify the educational objectives of the program and the characteristics of the learners, which can differ dramatically between undergraduate and graduate or professional students. Four principles that may serve the selection and design of supplementary material for undergraduate neuroscience and physiology courses are that 1) material must be interesting to the undergraduates, 2) material should reinforce previously learned concepts, 3) students must be adequately prepared, and 4) the teacher and student must have sufficient appropriate resources.",

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of this paper is to present a basic overview of some “relatively” new ideas related to the regulation of cardiac performance and underlying excitation-contraction (EC) coupling that have yet to be incorporated to textbooks currently used for introductory graduate-level physiology courses. Within the context of cardiac EC coupling, this review incorporates information on microdomains and local control theory, with particular emphasis on the role of Ca 2+ sparks as a key regulatory component of ventricular myocyte contraction dynamics. Recent information pertaining to Ca 2+ release mechanisms specific to the sarcoplasmic reticulum is also presented, as well as the idea of the ryanodine receptor as a macromolecular signaling complex. Because of the potential relationship to maladaptive functional responses under conditions of cardiovascular pathology, the regulatory role of cardiac adrenergic and additional G protein-coupled receptors known to regulate cardiac function is included, and fundamental concepts related to intracellular signaling are discussed. Finally, information on the roles of vascular and cardiac nitric oxide as an important regulator of cardiac performance is included to allow students to begin to think about the ubiquitous role of nitric oxide in the regulation of the cardiovascular system. An important point of emphasis is that whole organ cardiac dynamics can be traced back to the cellular events regulating intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and as such provides an important conceptual framework from which the students can begin to think about whole organ physiology in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 35 years our understanding of bile salts, bilirubin metabolism, and hepatobiliary transport has progressively increased. From 1965 to the end of 2002, 3,610 articles and review papers have been published on hepatobiliary and enterocyte transport of bile salts. However, there is a lack of information in the content of current textbooks about hepatobiliary physiology, bile salt transporters, bile formation, mechanisms underlying cholestasis, and drug-induced liver injury. The use of an integrated multimedia program on the liver covering these gaps in textbooks may be useful to student learning. This study aims to 1) assess student views on a multimedia CD-ROM (\"The Liver\") integrating basic and clinical sciences related to the liver, bile salts, and bilirubin metabolism, 2) assess the usefulness of problem-based learning (PBL) cases included in the multimedia CD-ROM, and 3) assess student learning before and after use of the multimedia CD-ROM. A total of 106 first-year medical students (27 with and 79 without a prior university degree) at the University of Melbourne participated in this study. Students were tested on the liver, bile salts, and bilirubin metabolism before and after using the multimedia CD-ROM. After completing the multimedia CD-ROM, each student filled out a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire evaluating the features of the program and its usefulness to their learning. Results show that the aims of the package were clear to participants, the contents were logically organized and clear, the key concepts were easy to identify, the contents were pitched to an appropriate level, and the package was interactive and encouraged participants to reflect on their learning. Students also agreed that the assessment tools used in the program and the feedback provided were meaningful and helpful to their learning. No differences were found when responses were compared on the basis of academic background, gender, citizenship, or first language of participants. Students agreed that the PBL cases in the CD-ROM kept them engaged, were useful to their learning, and matched with the overall philosophy of the program. Compared with graduate-entry students (those with a prior university degree), school leavers (those with no prior university degree) showed a more positive attitude toward the PBL cases included in the multimedia CD-ROM and agreed that cases kept them engaged (P = 0.033). Students who completed the test after using the multimedia CD-ROM scored higher compared with those who completed the test before using the multimedia CD-ROM (P < 0.001). In conclusion, using bile salts, bilirubin metabolism, and their hepatobiliary transport as an example, the incorporation of a multimedia CD-ROM into the first-year medical course has the potential to improve student understanding of the main concepts in a variety of body systems.",

    "abstract": "The strong-inference protocol puts into action the important concepts in Platt's often-assigned, classic paper on the strong-inference method ( 10 ). Yet, perhaps because students are frequently performing experiments with known outcomes, the protocols they write as undergraduates are usually little more than step-by-step instructions for performing the experiment. The strong-inference protocol, however, includes an explicit statement of possible experimental outcomes and the interpretation that would follow from each. This approach encourages thorough planning, enhances the efficiency of experimental designs, and increases the power of statistical analysis by explicitly stating a priori predictions as well as the statistical methods that will be used to test them. A sample protocol for an experiment investigating temperature-metabolism relations in chicken embryos is provided to illustrate the important components of the strong-inference protocol and to encourage instructors to incorporate this powerful research tool into undergraduate laboratory courses.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has been recognized as a worldwide public health problem. It significantly increases the chances of developing several diseases, including Type II diabetes. The roles of insulin and leptin in obesity involve reactions that can be better understood when they are presented step by step. The aim of this work was to design software with data from some of the most recent publications on obesity, especially those concerning the roles of insulin and leptin in this metabolic disturbance. The most notable characteristic of this software is the use of animations representing the cellular response together with the presentation of recently discovered mechanisms on the participation of insulin and leptin in processes leading to obesity. The software was field tested in the Biochemistry of Nutrition web-based course. After using the software and discussing its contents in chatrooms, students were asked to answer an evaluation survey about the whole activity and the usefulness of the software within the learning process. The teaching assistants (TA) evaluated the software as a tool to help in the teaching process. The students' and TAs' satisfaction was very evident and encouraged us to move forward with the software development and to improve the use of this kind of educational tool in biochemistry classes.",

It is often difficult to provide students an opportunity to practice their skills, use their knowledge, and gain research experiences during a typical course laboratory. This article describes a model of an out-of-classroom experience during which undergraduate exercise science students provide a free health and fitness screening to the campus community. Although some evidence of the effectiveness of this experience is presented, this is not a detailed evaluation of either the service or learning benefits of the fitness screening. Working in small learning groups in the classroom, students develop hypotheses about the health and fitness of the population to be screened. Then, as part of the health and fitness screening, participants are evaluated for muscular strength, aerobic fitness, body composition, blood pressure, physical activity, and blood cholesterol levels. Students then analyze the data collected during the screening, accept or reject their hypotheses based on statistical analyses of the data, and make in-class presentations of their findings. This learning experience has been used successfully to illustrate the levels of obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and lack of physical fitness in the campus community as well as provide an opportunity for students to use statistical procedures to analyze data. It has also provided students with an opportunity to practice fitness assessment and interpersonal skills that will enhance their future careers.",

Furthermore, the spirogram can be an excellent tool for understanding how lung diseases alter pulmonary function parameters. For example, physiology programs at several schools have students determine their normal lung volumes, capacities, and flow rates by means of standard spirometry procedures (1). Subsequently, these programs have students simulate obstructive and restrictive lung diseases and repeat the procedures for pulmonary function testing. To simulate an obstructive impairment, a rubber stopper, with a small hole drilled through the center, is placed securely into the spirometer tubing. The stopper adds resistance to both inspiration and expiration, and the resulting spirogram closely resembles a typical obstructive curve (3). However, individuals with obstructive lung impairments experience less airflow resistance during the inspiratory phase due to the effects of radial traction and increased transmural pressure than during the expiratory phase. Importantly, the rubber stopper with the small hole drilled through the center adds equal resistance to both the inspiratory and expiratory phases. To address this concern, we modified the model so that students experience most of the resistance during expiration. The modification consists of altering a one-way valve [Rescuer, CPR Pro (2)] (Fig. 1). The original one-way valve had a small resistance to inflow (RIF) provided by the radius of the opening in the valve and an infinite resistance to outflow (ROF) provided by a stopper that blocked flow. By making a hole (with a smaller radius than the internal radius of the inflow valve, e.g., with a heated drill bit of 1/8-in. diameter) in the outflow stopper, outflow was allowed. In addition, it was important to block the valve side opening with glue from a glue gun (Fig. 1). Since the hole in the stopper was smaller than the radius of the inflow valve, it offered more resistance during expiration. Thus, ROF was higher than RIF (ROF > RIF). With this modification, students are able to feel the differences in resistance between inspiration and expiration (higher resistance during expiration, which simulates the pathological state). The spirometry exercise enhances students' understanding of pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology and allows them to experience the difficulty, discomfort, and apprehension associated with lung disease. Fig. 1.Left: one-way valve with rubber stopper and side opening. The stopper prevents air from flowing out. Expired air passes through the side opening. Right: modified one-way valve with rubber stopper that now has a small hole to allow air to flow out. Note that the small hole in the rubber stopper is much smaller than the radius of the inflow opening. This modification provides significant resistance to expiration without adding resistance to inspiration. Also note that the side opening has been filled with glue from a glue gun.Download figureDownload PowerPoint REFERENCES1 Carroll RG.

    "abstract": "The regulation of gastric acid secretion has been the subject of investigation for over a century. Inhibition of gastrin-induced acid secretion by the intestine-derived hormone secretin provides a classic physiological example of negative feedback in the gastrointestinal tract. A classic paper by Leonard R. Johnson and Morton I. Grossman clearly shows the ability of secretin to negatively regulate gastric acid secretion, providing students with an example of this feedback loop. In addition, this article demonstrates the step forward in gastrointestinal endocrinology that occurred when pure preparations of secretin and other gastrointestinal hormones first became available. The comparison of the effects of exogenous, purified secretin to the physiological stimulus of acid in the duodenum is an important example of how newly available reagents allow scientists such as Johnson and Grossman to clarify the mechanisms behind previously established processes. One or more figures from this classic paper can be used to give students insight into the role of secretin in the regulation of the function of the gastrointestinal tract and will also give students a clear example of how the careful experimentation and clear interest in gastrointestinal physiology led Johnson and Grossman to advance the field.",

Animal laboratories, however, have several advantages over alternative forms of instruction, including an increased sense of learner responsibility, long-term psychomotor competency, and improved ability to examine functional relationships. While the use of animal laboratories has been studied in medical programs, it has not been examined in physical therapy or other allied health programs. The purposes of this study were to examine the attitudes of student physical therapists toward clinically relevant animal laboratories and to determine if student physical therapists felt that the laboratory modules prepared them for future course work and clinical internships. Written surveys completed by the study participants indicated that most students enjoyed the labs and believed that they helped prepare them for course examinations. Additionally, the majority of students believed that the laboratory modules helped them prepare for future course work and clinical internships.",

    "abstract": "Open-ended or closed-ended case study design schemes offer different educational advantages. Anatomy and physiology faculty members who participated in a conference workshop were given an identical case about blood doping and asked to build either an open-ended study or a closed-ended study. The workshop participants created a rich array of case questions. Participant-written learning objectives and case questions were compared, and the questions were examined to determine whether they satisfied criteria for open or closed endedness. Many of the participant-written learning objectives were not well matched with the case questions, and participants had differing success writing suitable case questions. Workshop participants were more successful in creating closed-ended questions than open-ended ones. Eighty-eight percent of the questions produced by participants assigned to write closed-ended questions were considered closed ended, whereas only 43% of the questions produced by participants assigned to write open-ended questions were deemed open ended. Our findings indicate that, despite the fact that instructors of anatomy and physiology recognize the value of open-ended questions, they have greater difficulty in creating them. We conclude that faculty should pay careful attention to learning outcomes as they craft open-ended case questions if they wish to ensure that students are prompted to use and improve their higher-order thinking skills.",

In the present article, we review key new electrophysiological, electrochemical, and fluorescence optical techniques for the study of exocytosis in single cells that have made this a fertile area for recent research. Based on findings using these techniques, we developed a model of SSC for adrenal chromaffin cells that blends features of Ca 2+ entry-dependent SSC (characteristic of neurons) with G protein receptor-coupled, Ca 2+ release-dependent, and second messenger-dependent SSC (characteristic of epithelial exocrine cells and nucleated blood cells). This model requires two distinct pools of secretory graunules with differing Ca 2+ sensitivities. We extended this model to account for SSC in a wide variety of peripheral and hypothalamic/pituitary-based endocrine cells. These include osmosensitive magnocellular neurosecretory cells releasing antidiuretic hormone, stretch-sensitive atrial myocytes secreting atrial natriuretic peptide, K + -sensitive adrenal glomerulosa cells secreting aldosterone, Ca 2+ -sensitive parathyroid chief cells secreting parathyroid hormone, and glucose-sensitive β- and α-cells of pancreatic islets secreting insulin and glucagon, respectively. We conclude this article with implications of this approach for pathophysiology and therapeutics, including defects in chief cell Ca 2+ sensitivity, resulting in the hyperparathyroidism of renal disease, and defects in biphasic insulin secretion, resulting in diabetes mellitus.",

Over recent years other medical and life science journals have made substantial efforts to address similar problems. For example, the BMJ set out to improve reporting in medical journals through a sustained campaign of education and guidance (5). Among basic life science journals, the American Physiological Society notably has tried to improve statistical reporting in its journals (1; 2). A more recent initiative was a series of revealing ‘worked examples’, starting in 2007 (4). Our Societies recently endorsed the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving animals (3), which repeat the same advice on statistical reporting. Nevertheless, in many instances the quality of data presentation and statistical analysis can be poor, and this despite the widespread availability of books, articles, websites and easily used statistical packages. We feel that these messages, which are often a plea for simplicity, have not reached a critical mass of authors, and more needs to be done to raise reporting standards.To meet this need, we are publishing a series of short articles to provide clear non-technical guidance for authors on best practice in statistical testing and data presentation. Several other life science journals share our concerns and are also publishing the articles to broadcast the message as widely as possible. The articles will appear monthly over the next 15 months.Authorship of the series was a key question in early discussions. To get the project up and running we asked local authors to generate articles and get the project started. One of us, Gordon Drummond, Senior Statistics Editor for The Journal of Physiology, has had the help of a qualified medical statistician, Sarah Vowler (Cancer Research UK), in writing these articles. Others may become involved with future articles. We invite comment on the articles, as we are well aware that there is no single path, and valid differences of opinion should be considered.We recognise that in some fields, special means of data presentation and statistical treatment are required. We intend to address some of these fields and we would be happy to receive suggestions for topics. We may not explore these topics in depth, because the over-riding aim is to keep the articles simple to encourage easy reading and widespread application. The prime aim is to illustrate good practice and illuminate the perils and problems that often trap the unwary.The articles will be published under a non-exclusive licence to enable free re-use and duplicate publication in multiple journals. They will be published simultaneously in The Journal of Physiology, Experimental Physiology, The British Journal of Pharmacology, the American Physiological Society's Advances in Physiology Education, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology, and Microcirculation.

The motivation for the introduction of changes was to prepare the students to not only assimilate facts but to learn and understand how to integrate and apply them. The article considers how this reorganization was received by the students in both subjective and objective terms. Specifically, we investigate whether our changes resulted in both an enhanced learning experience and improved learning success. The following changes were introduced to the course: first, we integrated either experimental, computer-based teaching modules or case studies in five of the eight course units to give the students the opportunity to gain more hands-on experience; second, we organized regular meetings to enhance communication among the course tutors; and finally, we increased the pass mark for the entrance exam to the course from 50% to 60%. Student opinion was evaluated by means of a questionnaire that was distributed at the end of each course semester throughout the three-semester evaluation period (summer 2008, winter 2008/2009, and summer 2009). The students gave convincing positive feedback concerning the efficacy of the changes in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Moreover, their learning success improved significantly in objective terms as evidenced by enhanced final and State exam performance.",

The set of teaching laboratory activities outlined here uses various interventions, namely, 1) the heart rate response to deep breathing, 2) the heart rate response to a Valsalva maneuver, 3) the heart rate response to standing, and 4) the blood pressure response to standing, that cause fairly predictable disturbances in cardiovascular parameters in normal circumstances, which serve to demonstrate the dynamic control of the cardiovascular system by autonomic nerves. These tests are also used clinically to help investigate potential damage to this control.",

    "abstract": "Here, we describe a human physiology laboratory class measuring changes in autonomic function over time in response to atropine. Students use themselves as subjects, generating ownership and self-interest in the learning as well as directly experiencing the active link between physiology and pharmacology in people. The class is designed to concomitantly convey the importance of bias in experimentation by adopting a double-blind placebo-controlled approach. We have used this class effectively in various forms with ∼600 students receiving atropine over the last 16 yr. This class has received favorable feedback from staff and students of medicine, pharmacy, and neuroscience, and we recommend it for such undergraduates. The learning objectives that students are expected to achieve are to be able to 1) know the ethical, safety, and hygiene requirements for using human volunteers as subjects; 2) implement and explain a double-blind placebo-controlled trial; 3) design, agree, and execute a protocol for making (and accurately recording) precise reproducible measurements of pulse rate, pupil diameter, and salivary flow; 4) evaluate the importance of predose periods and measurement consistency to detect effects (including any reversibility) after an intervention; 5) experience direct cause-and-effect relationships integrating physiology with pharmacology in people; 6) calculate appropriate summary statistics to describe the data and determine the data's statistical significance; 7) recognize normal variability both within and between subjects in baseline physiological parameters and also recognize normal variability in response to pharmacological treatment; 8) infer the distribution and role of muscarinic receptors in the autonomic nervous system with respect to the heart, eye, and mouth; 9) identify and explain the clinical significance of differences in effect due to the route and formulation of atropine; 10) produce and deliver a concise oral presentation of experimental findings; and 11) produce a written report in the form of a short scientific research article. The results of a typical study are presented, which demonstrate that the administration of atropine by a subcutaneous injection elicited a significant increase in pulse rate and pupil diameter and a significant decrease in salivary flow, whereas administration of atropine in an oral liquid elicited significant effects on pulse rate and salivary flow, and an oral solid format elicited a significant alteration in salivary flow alone. More detailed analysis of the salivary flow data demonstrated clear differences between the routes of administration and formulation in the onset and magnitude of action of atropine.",

    "abstract": "Most undergraduate physiology laboratories are very limited in how they treat renal physiology. It is common to find teaching laboratories equipped with the capability for high-resolution digital recordings of physiological functions (muscle twitches, ECG, action potentials, respiratory responses, etc.), but most urinary laboratories still rely on a \"dipstick\" approach of urinalysis. Although this technique can provide some basic insights into the functioning of the kidneys, it overlooks the dynamic processes of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. In the present article, we provide a straightforward approach of using renal clearance measurements to estimate glomerular filtration rate, fractional water reabsorption, glucose clearance, and other physiologically relevant parameters. The estimated values from our measurements in laboratory are in close agreement with those anticipated based on textbook parameters. For example, we found glomerular filtration rate to average 124 ± 45 ml/min, serum creatinine to be 1.23 ± 0.4 mg/dl, and fractional water reabsorption to be ∼96.8%. Furthermore, analyses for the class data revealed significant correlations between parameters like fractional water reabsorption and urine concentration, providing opportunities to discuss urine concentrating mechanisms and other physiological processes. The procedures outlined here are general enough that most undergraduate physiology laboratory courses should be able to implement them without difficulty.",

To make the learning experience enriching, the Department of Physiology organizes four student seminars (two seminars/semester) in a year. The seminar includes topics that are covered in the theory lectures. Five groups consisting of eight students are given a topic and supervised by a faculty moderator. Students are required to individually prepare a 10-min summary, and one of the students is selected to present the seminar in front of large group of 150 students. The rest of the students are assessed by the faculty members after the presentation. The best speaker in each of the five groups is given a certificate of appreciation. The assessment marks are added in an internal assessment.Over the years, we have observed diminished interest among students in each batch. They developed a habit of copy and pasting material in summaries, nonpresenting students did not participate in active learning, and Powerpoint was used as a sole media for the seminars. To increase interest, we designed two active learning strategies to break the usual mode of seminar delivery by the students under assessment (Fig. 1).Fig. 1.A typical flowchart of seminar rotation and assessment. For the purposes of this diagram, students from batches A–D presented the seminar by the traditional mode of content delivery, whereas students from batch E were assigned into the wiki and role-playing group.Download figureDownload PowerPointInnovation.In the new strategy, students attended the seminar on the \"Pathophysiological Mechanism of Shock.\" Participating students were not required to provide a written summary but rather develop a Wikiversity page on the allotted topic. Wikiversity is a Wikimedia Foundation project developed as a learning resource for learning projects and research for use in all levels, types, and styles of education from preschool to university, including professional training and informal learning. The Wikiversity is a good tool as open educational resource for the collaborative learning community. The literature also suggests that peer instruction (1) and collaborative testing (1, 2) improves retention as well as performance in exams.A separate hands-on session with the students was included to learn how to edit the medical content on Wikiversity. Four of the participants actively participated and edited a stub page on Wikiversity into an informative one. A second hands-on session was taken on how to search on PubMed and use the PubMed identifier to properly reference the Wikiversity page. These \"hands-on\" sessions were specially conducted for the students outside the scheduled classes. Figure 2 shows the edited content by medical students before and after the intervention. The page markedly improved from a four-line stub to a meaningful resource (3).Fig. 2.Comparison of the wiki page before and after the innovation. Going to this webpage, http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Shock&action=history, and highlighting the first and last edits will lead to this webpage, http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Shock&diff=962222&oldid=201357, which will show all the changes were made by the students.Download figureDownload PowerPointA second objective was to involve the remainder of the nonparticipating class. Presenting students were discouraged to use Powerpoint; they were instead required to prepare a role-playing skit of a patient in hypovolemic shock in the emergency room. The script was designed to cover all the sign and symptoms of the underlying basic mechanisms.On the day of the presentation, four groups presented Powerpoint presentations of 10 min each to summarize the seminar based on the traditional format of the assignment. The last group incorporated the new innovations of a role play of a patient in emergency and how the treating doctor shows his/her residents all the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of shock. The students liked it very much, based on the thunderous applause at the end!Two faculty members from the jury also appreciated this new approach and advised students to rehearse the script more often in their future endeavors. The willingness of students to try out role play in other seminars (such as for biochemistry) indicated that this was indeed a better learning experience. This experience also enabled the participants to develop a new lifelong skill of editing medical content on Wikipedia as well as searching PubMed, which is not a part of the curriculum.Challenges.The challenges in developing and implementing this educational innovation were that not all of the eight students were interested. They were skeptical about editing an online page as well as role playing in front of an audience. This was expected, as everyone had not yet mastered the skills within the short time period. This, however, did motivate other students of the class who were members of college dramatics team to use more of this strategy in other seminars. The innovation was not quantitatively evaluated, but seeing the applause from the students we intend to measure it next time.Conclusions.We conclude that incorporating active learning strategies will make physiology seminars more interesting. The role of Wikiversity should be explored more for collaborative learning assignments. Role playing is an important pedagogical tool and valuable to enhance the experience of the didactic student seminar.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: S.S. conception and design of research; S.S. performed experiments; S.S. analyzed data; S.S. interpreted results of experiments; S.S. prepared figures; S.S. drafted manuscript; S.S. edited and revised manuscript; S.S. approved final version of manuscript.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe author thanks students Aman Kumar, Akash Goyal, Akash Kanojiya Amarjit, Aditya Rajan, and Aarchi Kataria for active participation in this innovation.REFERENCES1.

Following the Backward Design instructional model, a series of seven concept-based lessons was developed for undergraduate engineering students. These online lessons were created as prerequisite physiology training to prepare students to engage in a collaborative engineering challenge activity. This work is presented as an example of how to convert standard, organ system-based physiology content into concept-based content lessons.",

During the 1990s, USARIEM published a series of pocket guides providing guidance for sustaining Warfighter health and performance in Southwest Asia, Somalia, the former Republic of Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Haiti. Issues identified during Operation Desert Storm elicited research that improved nutritional guidelines for protracted desert operations; safer use of nuclear, chemical, and biological protective clothing; equipment, development, and fielding of efficient microclimate cooling systems; and effective evaluation of pharmaceuticals to protect soldiers from chemical and biological threats. During the first decade of the 21st century, USARIEM and the Department of the Army published official medical/performance doctrines for operations in the heat and cold and at high altitude. The current Global War on Terrorism focused research to improve doctrines for hot, cold, and high-altitude operations, reduce musculoskeletal training injuries, provide improved field nutrition, more efficient planning for operational water requirements, and improve both military clothing and materiel. This article also describes the critically important interactions and communications between USARIEM and deployed units and the benefits to Warfighters from this association. This report presents USARIEM's unique and world-class facilities, organizational changes, scientific and support personnel, and major research accomplishments, including the publication of 2,200 scientific papers over the past 25 yr.",

Fourth, how did the implementation of these case studies work out in the actual course, i.e., how did the tutor guide the students in this interactive session and how did the students tackle the problems? Finally, how was the integration of interactive modules received by the students and what was their learning experience (as assessed by questionnaires) and learning success (as assessed through the final course exam)? Equally, the tutor's perception of this transformation and its implementation is described.",

During this process, students lecture to their colleagues in the presence of faculty staff members. These lectures were evaluated by faculty staff and students simultaneously. The aim of this study was to compare feedback from faculty members and students on 66 minilectures conducted by students. Their perception of different qualities of lecture was assessed using a questionnaire. There were significant correlations between students and faculty members for many qualities of the lecture, including the speed of the lecture, retaining attention, clear introduction, and the overall quality of the lecture. However, ratings for gesture, eye contact, language usage, illustration usage, audiovisuals, voice usage, and important points stressed were significantly different between students and faculty members. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess the degree of effect of different aspects of a lecture on its overall quality. Aspects such as gesture, eye contact, and language usage showed very low β-values, suggesting a poor contribution of these factors to the overall quality of the lecture for both students and faculty members. The speed of the lecture, retaining attention, and clear introduction were qualities that faculty members and students rated equally, and these were the main contributors to the overall quality of the lecture. Awareness about the possible discrepancy between ratings given by faculty members and students may be important when interpreting the evaluation results of formal lectures by these two groups.",

In this report, we examined to what extent teaching of ethics is formally being incorporated into the physiology curriculum. We carried out an e-mail survey in which we asked the e-mail recipients whether their institution offered a course or lecture on ethics as part of the physiology teaching process at their institution, using the following query: “We are now doing an online survey in which we would like to know whether you offer a course or a lecture on ethics as part of your physiology teaching curriculum.” The response rate was 53.3%: we received 104 responses of a total of 195 sent out. Our responses came from 45 countries. While all of our responders confirmed that there was a need for ethics during medical education and scientific training, the degree of inclusion of formal ethics in the physiology curriculum varied widely. Our survey showed that, in most cases (69%), including at our Medical University of Graz, ethics in physiology is not incorporated into the physiology curriculum. Given this result, we suggest specific topics related to ethics and ethical considerations that could be integrated into the physiology curriculum. We present here a template example of a lecture “Teaching Ethics in Physiology” (structure, content, examples, and references), which was based on guidelines and case reports provided by experts in this area (e.g., Benos DJ. Ethics revisited. Adv Physiol Educ 25: 189–190, 2001). This lecture, which we are presently using in Graz, could be used as a base that could lead to greater awareness of important ethical issues in students at an early point in the educational process.",

    "abstract": "A simple \"stop think\" approach was developed to encourage the self-assessment of learning. A key element was the requirement for students to rate their feeling of difficulty before [FOD(pre)] and after [FOD(post)] completing each of three authentic anatomy and physiology concept map exercises. The cohort was divided into low- (group L) and high-performing (group H) groups (based on final subject marks). Both FOD(pre) (group L) and FOD(post) (groups L and H) were significantly negatively correlated with score for some maps. A comparison of FOD(pre) and FOD(post) showed that students changed their mind about difficulty in 58-70% of the completed maps. Students who changed their estimation were asked to provide explanatory comments, and an increase in difficulty was related to problems with map link generation. For students who found the maps easier, 40% of comments indicated that map generation prompted recall of information from memory. Both difficulty estimations and comments supported the contention that students were self-assessing their interaction with the concept maps. Group H was significantly older than group L, had significantly higher levels of deep strategic and deep motivational learning, and had significantly higher marks in two of three concept map exercises. Notwithstanding these differences, the results from the \"stop think\" approach were similar between groups, indicating that it may be appropriate for students of varying academic ability. It is suggested that \"stop think\" may be a useful approach to encourage student self-assessment, an important step in assisting self-regulated learning development.",

    "abstract": "Integrating medical ethics into the physiology teaching-learning program has been largely unexplored in India. The objective of this exercise was to introduce an interactive and integrated ethics program into the Physiology course of first-year medical students and to evaluate their perceptions. Sixty medical students (30 men, 30 women) underwent 11 sessions over a 7-mo period. Two of the Physiology faculty conducted these sessions (20–30 min each) during the routine physiology (theory/practicals) classes that were of shorter duration and could, therefore, accommodate the discussion of related ethical issues. This exercise was in addition to the separate ethics classes conducted by the Medical Ethics department. The sessions were open ended, student centered, and designed to stimulate critical thinking. The students’ perceptions were obtained through a semistructured questionnaire and focused group discussions. The students found the program unique, thought provoking, fully integrated, and relevant. It seldom interfered with the physiology teaching. They felt that the program sensitized them about ethical issues and prepared them for their clinical years, to be “ethical doctors.” Neutral observers who evaluated each session felt that the integrated program was relevant to the preclinical year and that the program was appropriate in its content, delivery, and student involvement. An ethics course taught in integration with Physiology curriculum was found to be beneficial, feasible, and compatible with Physiology by students as well as neutral observers.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that a strong metabolic interrelationship exists between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. In this paper, we present a detailed, overall equation, describing a possible metabolic link between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. We adopted a guided approach in which we strongly suggest that students, when faced with the problem of obtaining the overall equation of a metabolic pathway, carefully account for all atoms and charges of the single reactions, as well as the cellular localizations of the substrates, and the related transport systems. If this suggestion is always taken into account, a balanced, overall equation of a metabolic pathway will be obtained, which strongly facilitates the discussion of its physiological role. Unfortunately, textbooks often report unbalanced overall equations of metabolic pathways, including ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis. Most likely the reason is that metabolism and enzymology have been neglected for about three decades, owing to the remarkable advances of molecular biology and molecular genetics. In this paper, we strongly suggest that students, when faced with the problem of obtaining the overall reaction of a metabolic pathway, carefully control if the single reactions are properly balanced for atoms and charges. Following this suggestion, we were able to obtain an overall equation describing the metabolic interrelationship between ureagenesis and gluconeogenesis, in which urea and glucose are the final products. The aim is to better rationalize this topic and to convince students and teachers that metabolism is an important and rewarding chapter of human physiology.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the development, implementation, and students' perceptions of a new trilayer approach of teaching (TLAT). The TLAT model involved blending lecture, in-class group activities, and out-of-class assignments on selected content areas and was implemented initially in a first-year integrated pharmacy course. Course contents were either delivered by traditional lectures or by the TLAT. A survey instrument was distributed by SurveyMonkey to determine students' perceptions of the TLAT model. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Students' performance in a total of 225 examination and quiz questions was analyzed to evaluate whether the TLAT model improved students' learning. Students' (n = 98) performance scores for TLAT-based and lecture-based questions were 83.3 ± 10.2 and 79.5 ± 14.0, respectively (P < 0.05). Ninety-three percent of students believed that in-class group activities enhanced conceptual understanding of course materials, helped them take responsibility of their own learning, and enhanced their overall learning experiences. More than 80% of respondents felt that solving cases and developing concept maps helped them sharpen creative and critical thinking skills. In addition, 90% of the respondents indicated that the homework throughout the semester helped them stay up to date and focused with the progress of the course. The use of the TLAT model led to an improvement in student learning of complex concepts. Moreover, the results suggest that this model improves students' self-reliance and attitudes toward learning. Our findings should serve as an impetus for inclusion of diverse active learning strategies in pharmacy education.",

    "abstract": "In response to the Bologna Declaration and contemporary trends in Animal Physiology education, the Animal Physiology course at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad, Serbia, has evolved over a 12-yr period (2001-2012): from a classical two-semester course toward a one-semester course utilizing computer simulations of animal experiments, continual assessment, lectures, and an optional oral exam. This paper presents an overview of student achievement, the impact of reforms on learning outcomes, and lessons that we as educators learned during this process. The reforms had a positive impact on the percentage of students who completed the course within the same academic year. In addition, the percentage of students who completed the practical exam increased from 54% to >95% following the transition to a Bologna-based approach. However, average final grades declined from 8.0 to 6.8 over the same period. Students also appear reluctant to take the optional oral exam, and 82-91% of students were satisfied with the lower final grade obtained from only assessments and tests administered during the semester. In our endeavor to achieve learning outcomes set during the pre-Bologna period, while adopting contemporary teaching approaches, we sought to increase students' motivation to strive toward better performance, while ensuring that the increased quantity of students who complete the course is coupled with increased quality of education and a more in-depth understanding of animal physiology.",

In this study, we tried to assess whether an interactive animation was helpful in improving student comprehension and understanding of red cell indexes compared with conventional classroom teaching. Eighty-eight first-year MBBS students participated, of which 44 were assigned to group A and 44 were assigned to group B after randomization. After further creation of smaller groups, students were provided with 45 min to revise red cell indexes, after which they were required to complete a multimodal questionnaire. Group A subgroups used written material for revision, whereas group B subgroups had access to an interactive animation. After completion of the questionnaire, group A students also used the animation after which feedback was collected from all students. Efficacy of the animation to improve learning and retention was demonstrated, as group B students scored significantly higher than group A students on the questionnaire ( P = 0.0003). A clear majority of the students agreed/strongly agreed that the animation was easy to operate, conveyed important concepts efficiently, and improved their knowledge of related clinical aspects as well. From the results and feedback, we found that the animation was a simple, well-received model, which, by significantly improving student performance, corroborated our hypothesis that inclusion of interactive animation into student curriculum can advance their academic attainment, compared with didactic teaching alone.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian lower urinary tract, there is a reciprocal relationship between the contractile state of the bladder and urethra. As the bladder fills with urine, it remains relaxed to accommodate increases in volume, while the urethra remains contracted to prevent leakage of urine from the bladder to the exterior. Disruptions to the normal contractile state of the bladder and urethra can lead to abnormal micturition patterns and urinary incontinence. While both the bladder and urethra are smooth-muscle organs, they are differentially contracted by input from cholinergic and sympathetic nerves, respectively. The laboratory practical described here provides an experiential approach to understanding the anatomy of the lower urinary tract. Several key factors in urinary tract physiology are outlined, e.g., the bladder is contracted by activation of the parasympathetic pathway via cholinergic stimulation on muscarinic receptors, whereas the urethra is contracted by activation of the sympathetic pathway via adrenergic stimulation on α1-adrenoceptors. This is achieved by measuring the force generated by bladder and urethra smooth muscle to demonstrate that acetylcholine contracts the smooth muscle of the bladder, whereas adrenergic agonists contract the urethral smooth muscle. An inhibition of these effects is also demonstrated by application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and the α1-adrenergic receptor blocker phentolamine. A list of suggested techniques and exam questions to evaluate student understanding on this topic is also provided.",

Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, at 44 yr of age, won the Nobel Prize in 1937 for his work on vitamin C and the establishment of the groundwork of the citric acid cycle. He now wanted to investigate one of the fundamental aspects of life and settled on the study of muscle contraction. The Szent-Gyorgyi laboratory in Hungary during World War II demonstrated that contraction could be reproduced in vitro by threads consisting of just two proteins, myosin and the newly discovered protein by Bruno Straub that they called actin. Szent-Gyorgyi called seeing the contraction of these threads, which occurred in the presence of ATP and ions, “the most thrilling moment” of his scientific life. This major discovery of the generation of “life” in a test tube was totally unknown for years by the rest of the world because of the war. When the discovery was finally communicated to the world, it was not immediately accepted by all as being relevant to the physiology of muscle contraction. Nonetheless, this discovery opened up the modern phase of muscle research. Serendipity played an important role in the great discovery, and much later politics would lead to a shocking controversy around the true discoverer of actin.",

Structured exercises were preplanned on six different concepts that a student should possess for solving the problem. The large group of 250 students was divided into groups of 41 or 42 each. The groups were facilitated by one faculty member for one structured exercise. At the station, the group of 41 or 42 was further broken down into 6 smaller groups comprising 7 students each. After completion of the exercise, students cycled to the next exercise station facilitated by another faculty member. The case was solved in a plenary session. The effectiveness of the method was assessed by comparing the academic performance of the group with other similar groups from the previous year.

    "abstract": "Physiology teaching resources have advanced to include innovative pedagogical approaches that meet the learning expectations of the current generation of students, while at the same time ensuring content delivery is accurate and the use of technologies is appropriate. We developed a quick experimental assay protocol to introduce the basic concepts of cardiac rhythms, and to demonstrate simultaneously that smartphone applications are a reliable and cost-effective tool for data collection in teaching the scientific method and performing physiology activities. The cardiac rhythm dance (CRD) protocol engages students in dancing a cardiac cyclelike movement to the rhythm of classical, pop, and samba music, and measuring their own cardiac frequency. Students collected their own data using the app Instant Heart Rate (Azumio). The CRD protocol allowed students to conclude that cardiac cycle-like movements paced by a pop song could represent the normal cardiac rhythm, whereas a classical song induced a significant reduction of heart rate, and the samba song significantly increased heart rate compared with the pop song. After group discussion, students considered that the pop rhythm is more realistic of day-by-day movement rhythms and is equivalent to the steady state of daily cardiac rhythms. Students considered the bradycardic and tachycardic movements to the dancing performed to the classical and samba rhythms, respectively. Thus the CRD protocol provides a multiple sensory-based and active learning resource that can engage students in learning cardiovascular physiology and recognizes smartphones as scientific instruments for collecting data during hands-on activities.",

Some types of self-assessment quizzes can be associated with a dilemma between 1) medical students who want the self-assessment quiz to be clearly related to upcoming summative assessments or curated by the exam-setters, and 2) university administrators and ethics committees who want clear guarantees that the self-assessment quizzes are not based on the summative assessments or made by instructors familiar with the exam bank of items.

A resulting question/item subset was uploaded to the Synap online self-quiz web platform, and 48 year 1 medical students engaged with it for 3 wk. Anonymized engagement statistics for students were provided by the Synap platform, and a paper-based exit questionnaire with an 80% response rate ( n = 44) measured satisfaction.

The efficacy of the developed material was validated through a pretest-posttest design, in which the students had to answer a 10-question test. After booklet completion, students had better outcomes, with an increase in the percentage of correct answers in 7 out of 10 questions contained in the test (P < 0.05).

Hence, a multimedia-aided instruction on BLS, supplemented with cooperating learning groups, was developed to assist nursing students in gaining correct BLS knowledge. A pretest-posttest designed for single cooperating groups was employed to evaluate students' achievements. Sixty-five undergraduate nursing students took the pretest and posttest that consisted of 10 open-ended questions, each designed to evaluate an aspect of their BLS knowledge. The results show significantly more students (60 vs. 20%) answered more questions correctly on the posttest compared with the pretest (P value <0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

    "abstract": "Lewis Victor Heilbrunn has been called the pioneer of Ca2+ as an intracellular regulator (Campbell AK. Cell Calcium 7: 287-296, 1986; Campbell AK. Intracellular Calcium, 2015). In 1947, he was the first to provide convincing evidence that Ca2+ triggered muscle contraction (Heilbrunn LV, Wiercinski FJ. J Cell Comp Physiol 29: 15-32, 1947). Yet his work was met mostly with silence and neglect. One wonders why. Heilbrunn was a general physiologist who believed in the uniformity of nature with regard to movement. He believed that \". . . the theory of what makes cells divide should not be very different from the theory of what makes muscle contract . . .\" (Heilbrunn LV. The Dynamics of Living Protoplasm, 1956). He did not believe that one could understand how the living machine worked by investigating its parts. He believed that, to understand life, one must study the dynamics of living protoplasm. The origin and evolution of Heilbrunn's thought process regarding the role of Ca2+ as a physiological activator will be traced back to the 1920s. The ways in which he tested the Ca2+ hypothesis in sea urchin eggs in the 1920s and 1930s will be explored. This work shaped Heilbrunn's thinking about the role of Ca2+ in muscle contraction. Importantly, why he and his results were ignored for years will be examined. It turned out that being right was not enough. Bad luck and a stubborn belief in an outmoded scientific philosophy contributed to the neglect.",

    "abstract": "An accurate self-assessment of student work can enhance student learning and subsequently improve academic performance. Instructors can facilitate this process by providing \"standards\" that students can utilize as feedback when self-evaluating their understanding. Traditional forms of feedback, such as marked assessment tasks, are limited in their ability to serve as standards, as they do not adequately capture variations corresponding to different levels of understanding. To develop a complex understanding in physiology, students have to integrate concepts pertaining to different subcomponents of body systems. The present study attempted to ascertain if exposing students to variations in complexity would refine their ability to self-evaluate their understanding and capacity to integrate concepts. Students were tasked to answer an essay-length, open-ended physiology question to expose their current understanding of the topic. The change in students' self-marking of their answer before and after being exposed to the variations in conceptual understanding of the topic were used to determine whether improvements in self-evaluation accuracy occurred. These variations were presented as instructor-generated answers to the open-ended question, framed using the structure of the observed learning outcome (SOLO) taxonomy. Student scores in the integrative questions of the end-of-semester exam were used as a measure of student ability to integrate concepts. Findings indicated that this intervention led to improvements in student self-evaluation and exam performance, and the positive outcomes were replicated across multiple iterations of the activity.",

    "abstract": "Active learning promotes the capacity of problem solving and decision making among learners. Teachers who apply instructional processes toward active participation of learners help their students develop higher order thinking skills. Due to the recent paradigm shift toward adopting competency-based curricula in the education of healthcare professionals in India, there is an emergent need for physiology instructors to be trained in active-learning methodologies and to acquire abilities to promote these curriculum changes. To address these issues, a series of International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) workshops on physiology education techniques in four apex centers in India was organized in November 2018 and November 2019. The “hands-on” workshops presented the methodologies of case-based learning, problem-based learning, and flipped classroom; the participants were teachers of basic sciences and human and veterinary medicine. The workshop series facilitated capacity building and creation of a national network of physiology instructors interested in promoting active-learning techniques. The workshops were followed by a brainstorming meeting held to assess the outcomes. The aim of this report is to provide a model for implementing a coordinated series of workshops to support national curriculum change and to identify the organizational elements essential for conducting an effective Physiology Education workshop. The essential elements include a highly motivated core organizing team, constant dialogue between core organizing and local organizing committees, a sufficient time frame for planning and execution of the event, and opportunities to engage students at host institutions in workshop activities.",

Short-term research courses offer opportunities for medical students to advance their research experience in subsequent high-demanding long-term research opportunities. The purpose of the present study was to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a research-oriented series (ROS) on undergraduate students at Alfaisal University in Saudi Arabia. The ROS was designed to comprise eight sessions. Each session addressed core principles and the practice of research concepts and was based on theoretical morning sessions supplemented by afternoon practical sessions delivered by experienced senior medical students and faculty members. Students were assessed comprehensively by the end of the ROS. The series was conducted twice, and 35 students were involved each time. A total of 70 enrolled students (35 men and 35 women) with grade point averages of &gt;3.5 and &lt;3.5 were asked to fill out an anonymous, online, self-administered questionnaire assessing their perception of knowledge, skills, and confidence after attending the ROS and evaluating their senior peers. Ninety percent of the medical students responded to the online survey and rated the ROS highly in improving their research knowledge, skills, and confidence. Male students reported significant gains compared with their female peers ( P &lt; 0.05). Grade point averages did not play a role in student gains after attending the ROS. Qualitative responses were in support of three recurring themes favoring the unique learning environment in the ROS. In conclusion, the ROS offers a short-term systematic approach to fundamental steps and concepts of biomedical research.",

    "abstract": "Multiple-choice questions are a gold-standard tool in medical school for assessment of knowledge and are the mainstay of licensing examinations. However, multiple-choice questions items can be criticized for lacking the ability to test higher-order learning or integrative thinking across multiple disciplines. Our objective was to develop a novel assessment that would address understanding of pathophysiology and pharmacology, evaluate learning at the levels of application, evaluation and synthesis, and allow students to demonstrate clinical reasoning. The rubric assesses student writeups of clinical case problems. The method is based on the physician's traditional postencounter Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan note. Students were required to correctly identify subjective and objective findings in authentic clinical case problems, to ascribe pathophysiological as well as pharmacological mechanisms to these findings, and to justify a list of differential diagnoses. A utility analysis was undertaken to evaluate the new assessment tool by appraising its reliability, validity, feasibility, cost effectiveness, acceptability, and educational impact using a mixed-method approach. The Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan assessment tool scored highly in terms of validity and educational impact and had acceptable levels of statistical reliability but was limited in terms of acceptance, feasibility, and cost effectiveness due to high time demands on expert graders and workload concerns from students. We conclude by making suggestions for improving the tool and recommend deployment of the instrument for low-stakes summative assessment or formative assessment.",

The present paper examines the challenges of teaching physiology in a PBL curriculum and gleans through the literature supporting PBL. It appears that one of the reasons why PBL is not becoming readily acceptable is the lack of concrete reports evaluating the curricular outcomes. The suggestion (R.E. Thomas. Med Educ. 31:320-329, 1997) to standardize and internationalize all components of validated PBL curricula is quite valid. A database needs to be generated that can be easily accessed by traditional institutions to see the rationality and easy implementation of the PBL curriculum.",

Study of a particular special circulation starts with the application of these building blocks in the context of the function of that tissue. For example, control of skin blood flow is largely concerned with regulation of body temperature (neurohumoral control) and the response to injury (paracrine control). Regulation of coronary blood flow is almost entirely a matter of meeting the metabolic needs of the myocardium (metabolic control). By mixing and matching the five building blocks and keeping in mind the special functions of a particular tissue, students can master the peripheral circulation efficiently.",

We describe a laboratory exercise in physiology for medical students using BHT as the teaching tool. The students collect fasting samples of expired air from each other using a simple nasal prong technique. They then drink one of several different aqueous carbohydrate solutions. Additional samples of expired air are collected by the students at 90 and 120 min after substrate ingestion and are analyzed by gas chromatography. Between sampling periods, discussions of digestive physiology are provided by the faculty. Students tabulate their BHT results as well as recording any symptoms using a standard scoring system. A total of 460 students have participated. We found that the percentage of students who malabsorbed a given substrate was similar each year. The results obtained in these student exercises closely parallel those reported in the literature. We conclude that BHT is an excellent teaching tool for illustrating carbohydrate digestion and absorption, even when performed by minimally trained subjects.",

Our institutions are no aid. They reward scientific productivity (read: number of papers published per year and research dollars), not teaching. Some suggested cures are production of better texts, training of science teachers in the field in which they teach, and, most importantly, involvement of scientists in the process.

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine whether students within a large (100-160 students) didactic lecture-based course, \"Elementary Physiology\" (EP), who were given an active-learning opportunity would perform better on objective examinations over EP material compared with their classroom peers who did not have the same active-learning experience. This was achieved by offering the EP students the option of taking a supplemental one credit hour discussion-based course, \"Case Studies in Physiology\" (CSP). Approximately 14% of the EP students opted for the CSP course. The format of CSP consisted of a one-hour-per-week discussion of applied problems based on the factual information presented in EP. On a subjective scale of 1 to 4, the CSP students felt that the course helped them to understand the EP material (3.5). This was reflected in the EP examination results for which the CSP students scored significantly higher compared with their non-CSP peers (81.1% vs. 75.7%; P &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that when active-learning methods, such as discussion of applied problems, are used as a supplement to didactic lectures in physiology, performance on objective examinations of lecture material is improved.",

    "abstract": "An educational microcomputer-based simulation of respiratory control has been developed. The program contains three major sections: tutorial, stimulation, and unknown testing. The tutorial section provides a brief discussion of the major factors involved in respiratory control. The simulation section provides a menu of variables to demonstrate the effects of altering inspired gases, changing compliance or airway resistance, metabolic acidosis, neural activity, and lesions (including vagotomy) or exercise. The last section of the program allows students to test their understanding of abnormal respiratory and blood gas values. The program has been used as a problem-solving exercise in a medical physiology course. Student groups were assigned to a microcomputer and given a specific problem during a regularly scheduled laboratory period. The students collected data using the program, analyzed and graphed or tabulated the results, and presented their findings in a minisymposium format to their fellow students. This approach has proven valuable and provides a number of pedagogical benefits that are lacking in a lecture-based basic science curriculum.",

    "abstract": "Dr. Penny Hansen is an international physiology educator. She was born in America and became a Canadian citizen, and her husband is from Sweden. Dr. Hansen has a reputation throughout the world from international meetings and visiting professorships in North America and Europe. She received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Ohio, and her PhD and entire academic career have been at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland, which is closer to London than to New Orleans. She found a hospitable environment and stayed. Remember how some jet planes were grounded on Sept. 11 at Gander, Newfoundland; the local people opened their homes, transported passengers in school buses, and served them free meals for a couple of days. Dr. Hansen has received local and national awards for her teaching skills. At St. John’s, her ideas about education quickly outgrew the Basic Science Division in the Faculty of Medicine. She went from Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Medical Education to Director of Academic Development for Medicine to director of a center for health professional education for five professional schools. With this track record she might have been chosen to be dean of a medical school. Dr. Hansen’s most notable contribution to international physiology has been in editing our Society’s teaching journal, Advances in Physiology Education, for nine years. During that time, she has written provocative editorials, encouraged authors from developing countries, and found ways to incorporate fresh ideas about teaching. As far as I know, no other society in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology has a journal devoted to teaching. This is a tribute to Dr. Hansen and her associate editors in their encouragement of teachers to do research on teaching and publish their findings. Dr. Hansen will continue writing and is authoring a textbook entitled Physiology of Life Situations, which will have unique organization. Dr. Hansen was recently appointed co-chair of the Education Committee for the International Union of Physiological Sciences. In that role, she is responsible for conducting teaching workshops and providing resources to teachers of physiology worldwide, particularly in developing countries. She spends time each winter teaching at St. George’s Medical School in Granada. Dr. Hansen is also the elected chair of the Teaching Section for the next three years. It is particularly appropriate that, on this Earth Day 2002, whose motto is “One People, One Earth, One Future,” we hear a citizen of Canada who teaches worldwide talk about“Physiology’s Recondite Curriculum.”—Roger TannerThies, PhD, Professor Emeritus of Physiology, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.",

The students performed several protocols to understand how NE acts to contract aortic ring vessels, which sources of calcium are mobilized, and whether the calcium sensitivity of the contractile regulatory apparatus is involved. The design of this exercise allowed students to participate actively in an exercise demonstrating that many mechanisms are involved and act additively to allow arterial tone to develop. Furthermore, the students were introduced to an isolated organ chamber technique that is used to study cellular mechanisms of many tissues and that is still important for smooth muscle research.",

With the use of a clinical case-based environment, CBT aimed to achieve integration of structure-function relationships and an increase in students’ capacity to apply a physiological understanding to clinical observations/symptoms and data. With peer-peer interactions in small groups, students could trial history taking and examination skills, interpret common investigations, and relate their findings to an understanding of structure and function. Here, the cardiovascular tutorials highlight the centrality of an understanding of structure and function in the evaluation of a case of syncope. An independent evaluation of the students’ learning experience demonstrated that CBT tutorials were successful in their aims. The “hands-on” experience was highly rated, with students reporting that the CBT approach gave relevance to structure and function. Whatever the curriculum learning style, underpinning practice with an understanding of theory remains a desirable feature of medical education.",

A computer program was developed allowing students to register learning issues identified as needed during tutorial sessions and learning issues stated as covered during the individual study periods. In our study, we compared \"planned\" (learning issues identified during PBL sessions) and \"accomplished\" learning issues (covered after the independent study periods) identified by pathophysiology students from three consecutive years. We found that the planned learning issues raised during tutorial sessions related to the issues effectively accomplished during the independent study and that their number grew stepwise from basic to preclinical to clinical sciences. Pathophysiology was, globally, the most mentioned discipline. Moreover, the most mentioned disciplines from the basic, preclinical, and clinical areas were physiology, histopathology, and internal medicine, respectively. The single-discipline approach did not limit the student's capacity to identify and cover learning issues beyond the objectives of pathophysiology.",

Compared with their precourse test performance (mean = 41.8%), collectively, the students nearly doubled their grade by the end of the course (mean = 81.4%). Their scores in subcategories of the material improved in inverse proportion to what they knew initially. A second goal was to evaluate a two-dimensional, computer-generated matrix as a way to assess test question validity and value. The evaluation of individual test questions as assessed from the matrix often, but not always, was similar to the classical pedagogical analysis that uses difficulty and discrimination indexes. Strengths of the matrix are its ability to render data as a gestalt, as well as flexibility and intuitive ease of use.",

The major objective of this teaching module is to critically examine the pathophysiological mechanism and significance of the hypotension-bradycardia paradox unique to this condition. We narrate here how we discussed the pathophysiology of vasovagal syncope in a large classroom session attended by 275 doctors and medical students. A case study was used to describe the typical clinical presentation of vasovagal syncope. The pathophysiological mechanisms involved were then discussed systematically using a series of open-ended questions. We made it clear 1) that the occurrence of bradycardia or asystole in the face of acute severe hypotension is a mechanism to possibly minimize further blood loss, prevent myocardial damage, and increase ventricular filling; and 2) that fainting, which occurs as a consequence of this, is a homeostatic mechanism that serves to restore venous return and cerebral blood flow before blood pressure is normalized by neural reflex mechanisms. Eighty-four percent of participants reported that they were satisfied with the session. The information contained herein could be used to explain to any suitable audience the neural regulation of blood pressure in the face of acute severe hypotension and the pathophysiology of vasovagal syncope.",

Our course incorporates the human patient simulator for experiential learning in which undergraduate university juniors and seniors are instructed to design, conduct, and present (orally and in written form) their project testing physiological adaptation to an extreme environment. This article is a student report on the physiological response to acute carbon monoxide exposure in a simulated healthy adult male and a coal miner and represents how 1) human patient simulators can be used in a nonclinical way for experiential hypothesis testing; 2) students can transition from traditional textbook learning to practical application of their knowledge; and 3) student-initiated group investigation drives critical thought. While the course instructors remain available for consultation throughout the project, the relatively unstructured framework of the assignment drives the students to create an experiment independently, troubleshoot problems, and interpret the results. The only stipulation of the project is that the students must generate an experiment that is physiologically realistic and that requires them to search out and incorporate appropriate data from primary scientific literature. In this context, the human patient simulator is a viable educational tool for teaching integrative physiology in a laboratory environment by bridging textual information with experiential investigation.",

It is usually expensive to provide every student group in the laboratory with an individual stimulator. This article presents the design and application of a low-cost [about $100 (U.S.)] isolated stimulator that can be controlled by two analog-output channels (e.g., output channels of a data-acquisition card or onboard audio channels) of a computer. The device is based on a voltage-to-current converter circuit and can produce accurate monopolar and bipolar current pulses, pulse trains, arbitrary current waveforms, and a trigger output. The compliance of the current source is ±15 V, and the maximum available current is ±1.5 mA. The device was electrically tested by using the audio output of a personal computer. In this condition, the device had a dynamic range of 46 dB and the available pulse-width range was 0.1–10 ms. The device is easily programmable, and a freeware MATLAB script is posted on the World Wide Web. The practical use of the device was demonstrated by electrically stimulating the sciatic nerve of a frog and recording compound action potentials. The newly designed current stimulator is a flexible and effective tool for teaching in the physiology laboratory, and it can increase the efficiency of learning by maximizing performance-to-cost ratio.",

The evaluation of blood glucose levels in human volunteers over time is a powerful teaching tool for endocrinology that has the added benefit of exposing the student to the most fundamental task in diabetes management. The classic procedure involving the ingestion of sucrose followed by blood glucose monitoring was used here to teach the concepts of nonhormonal control of hormone release and blood glucose homeostasis. In addition, a number of volunteers did not ingest a sucrose solution but merely held it in their mouths and expectorated. This so-called “spit” technique has been successfully used to induce the cephalic phase of insulin release (CPIR), an example of neural control of hormone release. As expected, volunteers who ingested sucrose displayed a 38.5% increase in blood glucose 20 min postingestion and a concomitant decrease in blood glucose to near baseline by 60 min postingestion. Those volunteers who did not ingest the sucrose solution displayed a 12.9% reduction in blood glucose levels by 40 min postcompletion, suggestive of the CPIR, followed by a gradual increase in blood glucose levels to near baseline by 60 min postcompletion. The addition of the “spit” technique to this revised protocol of the evaluation of blood glucose exposes the student to the neural control of hormone release and a second example of energy homeostasis.",

One of the first microscopes of the epoch was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek’s microscope, a deceptively simple device that contains a single ball lens housed in a metal plate allowing the observation of samples at up to ×250 magnification. Such magnification was much greater than that achieved by rudimentary compound microscopes of the era, allowing for the discovery of microscopic, single-celled life, an achievement that marked the study of biology up to the nineteenth century. Since Leeuwenhoek’s design uses a single ball lens, it is possible to fabricate variations for educational activities in physics and biology university and high school classrooms. A fundamental problem, however, with home-built microscopes is that it is difficult to work with glass. We developed a simple protocol to make ball lenses of glass and gelatin with high magnification that can be done in a university/high school classroom, and we designed an optimized support for focusing and taking photographs with a smartphone. The protocol details a simple, easily accessible, low-cost, and effective tool for the observation of microscopic samples, possible to perform anywhere without the need for a laboratory or complex tools. Our protocol has been implemented in classrooms in Chile to a favorable reception.",

    "abstract": "Advances in physiology and other fields are strongly associated with a solid base knowledge of biochemistry and cell metabolism. On the other hand, the complex and abstract nature of metabolic pathways, the traditional lecture method, and other factors made the teaching-learning process of biochemistry a challenging endeavor. To overcome this, we developed and tested a novel active learning tool called Interactive Metabolism ( iM-tool). The iM-tool was developed with simple and low-cost materials. We used it for interactive teaching of several metabolic pathways and physiological mechanisms for students enrolled in the Biochemistry subject belonging to different undergraduate courses. The results of evaluation tests showed that the iM-tool significantly (ANOVA, P &lt; 0.01) and consistently improved the biochemistry knowledge of students in classrooms with up to 50 students for 7 different and consecutive academic semesters. A survey intended to mine students’ opinions on the tools showed significant satisfaction with the teaching using the iM-tool over traditional lecture-based teaching, and the iM-tool contributed to collaborative learning among students. Therefore, our results showed that the iM-tool improves the biochemistry and cell metabolism teaching-learning process in a more attractive and interactive manner.",

The purpose of the workshop was to provide PE instruction through social media and develop online learning modules. The 3 days of activities consisted of 4 lectures and 6 workshops provided to 177 PE teachers from 32 provinces in Indonesia. Participants were informed about the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on children, and healthy life during the pandemic. Online applications that were free of charge, easy to use, highly rated, and widely downloaded were also introduced to them. These multimedia applications could help teachers develop and deliver remote learning modules to their students. The workshop supported the teachers as they adapted to interactive distance learning. The workshop also successfully illustrates an innovative distance learning module delivered through multimedia.",

Although lectures and tutorials are readily communicated by this approach, the execution of laboratory exercises is much more difficult. To overcome these challenges, face-to-face laboratory sessions were replaced by a blended learning approach in which students were provided instructional material online and then required to conduct the laboratory exercises at home. These laboratory exercises made use of easily accessible household materials and mobile applications. A self-report survey was designed to assess students' perception of their learning experience and attitudes to the home-based laboratory exercises. The survey consisted of 16 questions that students had to respond to using a 5-point Likert scale. Students were also allowed to provide open responses to select questions. Overall, the 80% of students that completed the survey expressed strong satisfaction with their learning experience and were enthusiastic toward home-based laboratory exercises. However, concerns about not being able to complete particular face-to-face exercises that required specialized equipment were expressed. Several students proposed a combined approach going forward. Our results show that home-based laboratory exercises offer a multimodal option that enriches the learning curriculum by engaging students in \"hands-on\" bespoke practicals using inexpensive household materials.",

This article presents a procedural study of a PBL tutorial cycle with high school students new to the method regarding human respiration and circulation physiology. We observed group dynamics and the learning process that occurred throughout the PBL tutorial cycle. The results indicate that conceptual changes were close to the planned learning objectives and that students enjoyed studying applying PBL. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between group dynamics, self-directed learning and learning outcomes. Our results provide grounds for restructuring the tutorial cycle, especially important for novice PBL students, such as problem reformulation and the development and diversification of applied learning scaffolds. We conclude that the qualitative analysis performed herein can yield a deeper understanding of the PBL tutorial cycle and may be used to foster PBL implementation in institutions with little experience with the method and monitor its outcomes in organizations with mature PBL use.",

Teachers can use a variety of teaching-learning methods, which may encourage adaptability and lifelong learning. Instructional strategies that are lively, educative, and encourage students to actively participate in the process are better than an uninterrupted exposition of information. This article was designed to clarify how one can use role playing and skits to make the learning of rather simple principles in human cardiopulmonary physiology more fun and relevant, in the absence of clinical classes in first-year undergraduate studies. These role plays also allow students to practice their communication skills in a conducive environment. It has been shown that improvisation is not only entertaining but extremely useful in understanding concepts (3).The idea behind the enactment of role plays was that a hands-on experience is a lifelong experience: it is the best teacher. There have been many definitions of role plays. The simplest one states that role plays consists of \"acting out a defined character in a mock situation.\" Since one experiences a situation, therefore role plays can help make classes dynamic, energetic, and actively involve students in the teaching-learning environment. In fact, skits and games have been used to enhance the learning of physiology, and it has been observed that the planning of skits serves as a good review of some course material (2).METHODSRole plays were designed related to lung volumes and capacities, applied aspects of respiratory physiology, and basic life support. Four role plays were designed. It was decided that different students would play different roles, to ensure maximum participation. The role plays were conducted after the major portion of the theory of respiratory physiology and anatomy was completed and after the history taking and general physical examination and examination of respiratory system in practical demonstration classes were taught to the students. Students were randomly selected by the teacher and were grouped in 4–5 students/group for the four role plays, but they were included to play parts only when they gave their consent for the same. The role plays were partially scripted. The teacher directed from a distance and acted as a facilitator. Participating students were asked to decide on the character that they would play. The roles were narrated, and the situation and the way in which they had to act were explained to them. Students were asked to read the relevant literature and to practice for the role plays, acting in a collaborative manner. After a few days of practice, students acted the roles in front of the teacher before they presented the scene in front of the class. Participating students were asked to choose a group leader from each of the four groups. The group leader coordinated the activities of the group and also acted as the narrator, as happens in many dramas and portrayal of poems. The role of the narrator was to explain the various aspects and techniques used during the act and discuss concepts at the end of the role play. Anything still unclear was explained by the teacher. This would make the role play more coherent. The role plays were conducted during the practical physiology classes and during the demonstration time. The class of 100 students was divided into 2 practical groups of 50 students each.Role Play 1: the Celebration Party Role PlayObjective: to demonstrate the Heimlich maneuver.Number of participating students: 5 (for each practical group).Scene.Three students go to a restaurant to celebrate good grades on the physiology exam. They call upon the waiter and order fish. They are talking, laughing, and enjoying the dish. Then, suddenly, one of them stops talking and starts choking. This individual is red in the face, can't speak, and is unable to breathe. Initially, his/her friends can't decipher whether s/he is having a heart attack at such a young age or if it is a different matter. The waiter runs to call the ambulance. In the meantime, one of the friends asks the afflicted individual to cough. S/he is not able to do even that. Now the friends know that their companion is choking. One friend tries the Heimlich maneuver, but s/he is not able to do it correctly, and nothing happens. Then another friend comes forward and performs the act with the right method. S/he puts their fists at the epigastric area and gives quick, strong thrusts backward and upward, and out pops the fish bone! The student patient starts to cough, and his/her respiration resumes. They all take a sigh of relief.All during the enactment, the narrator student (group leader) narrates what is happening. S/he also narrates how the procedure should be carried out technically and why the first time the procedure was not correct. As the group leader narrated, the participating students froze their posture, so that students in the audience could digest the whole concept. Later, three to four groups of students in the audience were asked to come forward and perform the maneuver on each other. The physiology concepts, physiological changes during choking, and physiology behind the maneuver were discussed. Student questions were then answered.Role Play 2: the Drowning Role PlayObjective: to demonstrate the Holger-Neilson technique of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).Participating students: 4 (for each practical group).Scene.Four students performed this role play. The group leader was also the narrator. Three students go for a picnic near a sea. One of the students starts to drown. S/he is helped by two friends out of the water. One student starts calling the ambulance. The second friend starts performing the Holger-Neilson technique of CPR. The subject is held prone on the solid beach bed. The method is performed step wise. The narrator keeps on narrating the correct method while the second student is performing the act. The act was replayed for students in the audience based on their request. A few groups of students were invited to perform the experiment. The concepts, physiological changes, and physiological advantages and disadvantages of the method were discussed with students. The doubts of the students were clarified, first by the participating students and, if needed, by the teacher.This role play was designed to provide fascinating insight into early attempts to resuscitate people. The students were apprised of the resuscitation methods used in the past, the lacunae in them, and how the present technique of CPR has overcome those lacunae.Role Play 3: the Accident Victim/Mannequin Role PlayObjective: to perform CPR on a mannequin.Participating students: 4 (for each practical group).Scene.The group leader narrates the story. An accident victim/mannequin is lying on the road. Two friends travelling that way stop by and find the victim. They block the traffic and check the victim for vital signs. They call the ambulance and start to resuscitate the injured individual. One student starts with chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 compressions/min and a compression depth of at least 2 in., allowing for the complete recoil of chest compressions. The second student cleans the victim's mouth and nose, extends their neck, and starts mouth-to-mouth breathing, maintaining a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2. The narrator keeps on narrating the correct technique.Later, all components of this CPR technique were discussed by the teacher; the doubts of the students were removed. The discussion also focused on 2010 American Heart Association guidelines for CPR. The change in CPR sequence from the airway-breathing-chest compression (A-B-C) method to the chest compression-airway-breathing (C-A-B) method was reiterated. Emphasis was made that an untrained lay rescuer should provide compression only-CPR, with stress added to \"push hard and fast\" on the center of the chest, with minimal CPR-free intervals. For a trained lay rescuer who is able, the recommendation remains for the rescuer to perform both compression and ventilation. A few student groups were then invited to demonstrate the technique.Role Play 4: the Doctor-Patient Role PlayObjective: to demonstrate history taking and perform a respiratory system examination and spirometry.Participating students: 5 (for each practical group).Scenes.In the following scenes, the group leader is the narrator. One student acts as a doctor. A second student acts out the part of the nurse, and another two students act out the parts of patients.scene 1.The first student patient walks in and performs as a patient with obstructive lung disease. The doctor takes the history and performs the respiratory system examination. S/he then performs spirometry.scene 2.The second student patient walks in and acts like a patient with restrictive lung disease. Their history is taken, a respiratory system examination is done, and spirometry is performed.Two different types of computerized spirometry were previously obtained (spirometries of a patient with obstructive lung disease and a patient with restrictive lung disease patient). The graphs were shown, and students in the audience were asked to explain them and the type of disease shown in the graphs. The technique behind the procedure, the physiology behind the diseases, and interpretations of the graphs were discussed at length. Student doubts, if any, were removed.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe tried to make the role plays very simple. We tried to accomplish a few important aspects. We tried the simplest and clearest approach. Any complexities regarding the role plays were elaborated on later during the discussions. Focus group discussions were held with the participating students. They were asked how they prepared for their roles and how they studied for them. The effectiveness of role plays in enhancing communication skills was also discussed. All students agreed that the role plays improved their communication skills and collaboration among group members. They were asked about their reactions in the beginning, at the middle, and at the end of the role plays. They were then asked to suggest advice for future students. Students in the audience were asked about their perception of the role plays, and 76% of students strongly agreed and 21% of students agreed that the role plays created interest and greatly enhanced their knowledge of the concepts. Only 3% of students were neutral on this aspect. Students were happy with the cheerful practical classes. It was ensured that all students were involved in some way, either as performers or in the audience. Therefore, nobody felt excluded.In an earlier study (1), it was concluded that role-play lectures were an effective, economical, and easily reproducible method to help students better understand the core concepts and features involved in different neurological diseases. The most important advantage of role play is that if such experience in a real setting is not possible, then a mock situation can be created, which may not be ideal but will at least be satisfactory for experimental learning. If students can talk about or act what they are learning, then they can relate to it and apply it in their daily lives. The visual impact and active participation helped students to better understand the concepts. We believe that it is important to plan activities for students because activities engage the audience, build curiosity, and create a challenge.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: R.G.T. conception and design of research; R.G.T. and A.K.A. performed experiments; R.G.T. analyzed data; R.G.T. interpreted results of experiments; R.G.T. drafted manuscript; R.G.T. and A.K.A. edited and revised manuscript; R.G.T. and A.K.A. approved final version of manuscript; A.K.A. prepared figures.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "The primary purpose of this article is to present a basic overview of some key teaching concepts that should be considered for inclusion in an six- to eight-lecture introductory block on the regulation of cardiac performance for graduate students. Within the context of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, this review incorporates information on Ca 2+ microdomains and local control theory, with particular emphasis on the role of Ca 2+ sparks as a key regulatory component of ventricular myocyte contraction dynamics. Recent information pertaining to local Ca 2+ cycling in sinoatrial nodal cells (SANCs) as a mechanism underlying cardiac automaticity is also presented as part of the recently described coupled-clock pacemaker system. The details of this regulation are emerging; however, the notion that the sequestration and release of Ca 2+ from internal stores in SANCs (similar to that observed in ventricular myocytes) regulates the rhythmic excitation of the heart (i.e., membrane ion channels) is an important advancement in this area. The regulatory role of cardiac adrenergic receptors on cardiac rate and function is also included, and fundamental concepts related to intracellular signaling are discussed. An important point of emphasis is that whole organ cardiac dynamics can be traced back to cellular events regulating intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis and, as such, provides an important conceptual framework from which students can begin to think about whole organ physiology in health and disease. Greater synchrony of Ca 2+ -regulatory mechanisms between ventricular and pacemaker cells should enhance student comprehension of complex regulatory phenomenon in cardiac muscle.",

    "abstract": "Medical students following a traditional curriculum get few opportunities to engage in activities such as a literature search, scientific writing, and active and collaborative learning. An analytical essay writing activity (AEWA) in physiology was introduced to first-year students. Each student prepared an essay incorporating new research findings with existing knowledge on a medical topic. Students were expected to study on the topic in detail from textbooks as well as from research publications and write a descriptive and critical analysis. This activity would help them to be aware of new developments in the field and understand the complexity and rapidity of changes in the subject. The aim of this study was to learn how students used the AEWA as a learning process. For this purpose, student perceptions were assessed quantitatively and those of the faculty staff were assessed qualitatively. The data from the students showed considerable achievements in the medical database search, scientific writing, group work, and search for new scientific knowledge. The activity was influenced by prior capabilities in computer use, English language knowledge, and writing ability. Resources available at the medical school had a greater influence on the activity. Faculty staff appreciated the quality of the essay while highlighting areas of improvement. The students seemed to be satisfied with the supervisory role of the faculty staff, whereas the staff felt that the students used the supervisors less than expected. The AEWA was a successful activity promoting many aspects of active and collaborative learning. The low availability of books and information and communications technology (ICT) resources, poor internet connection, and insufficient English language skills were probably responsible for the negative feedback on this activity in this resource-deprived environment.",

Research has shown that weakness in English can impact student performance. Recent studies have also highlighted sex-based differences in students' learning and listening styles. These factors pose both challenges and opportunities for teachers of physiology. Student presentations were incorporated for a number of years into the traditional didactic second-year medical physiology curriculum at the NRMSM. Feedback obtained about the perceived benefits of these presentations for the learning of gastrointestinal and endocrine physiology included demographic data pertaining to students' sex, home language, and self-reported performance in tests. Analysis of the 50-item questionnaire responses, obtained over a 2-yr period, provided some interesting insights. Student responses to the items differed significantly in 27 of the 50 items in the questionnaire, based on sex alone (22%), sex and home language (7%), home language alone (37%), performance alone (26%), and performance and home language (7%). Our analyses of student perceptions support the findings of other studies and show that factors such as sex, home language, and student performance can play an important role in the way students are motivated to learn. In designing active learning strategies, academics need to take into account the potential influences that might affect student learning in diverse, multicultural, and multilingual classes.",

    "abstract": "Hypovolemic and orthostatic challenge can be simulated in humans by the application of lower body negative pressure (LBNP), because this perturbation leads to peripheral blood pooling and, consequently, central hypovolemia. The classic paper by Foux and colleagues clearly shows the effects of orthostasis simulated by LBNP on fluid shifts and homeostatic mechanisms. The carefully carried out experiments reported in this paper show the interplay between different physiological control systems to ensure blood pressure regulation, failure of which could lead to critical decreases in cerebral blood flow and syncope. Here, a teaching seminar for graduate students is described that is designed in the context of this paper and aimed at allowing students to learn how Foux and colleagues have advanced this field by addressing important aspects of blood regulation. This seminar is also designed to put their research into perspective by including important components of LBNP testing and protocols developed in subsequent research in the field. Learning about comprehensive protocols and carefully controlled studies can reduce confounding variables and allow for an optimal analysis and elucidation of the physiological responses that are being investigated. Finally, in collaboration with researchers in mathematical modeling, in the future, we will incorporate the concepts of applicable mathematical models into our curriculum.",

    "abstract": "The maximal rate of O 2 consumption (V̇o 2max ) constitutes one of the oldest fitness indexes established for the measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and aerobic performance. Procedures have been developed in which V̇o 2max is estimated from physiological responses during submaximal exercise. Generally, V̇o 2max is estimated using the classical renowned Astrand-Ryhming test. In young adults, poor fitness and low aerobic performance are often associated with a sedentary lifestyle, which is a well-described factor for the development of obesity and its related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. In the Indian Ocean, the inhabitants of La Reunion Island, a French overseas department, exhibit an increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes. At the University of La Reunion, a new laboratory course involving students was designed to teach the indirect evaluation of their V̇o 2max from the classical Astrand-Ryhming test and using a cycle ergometer as the exercise mode. Inverse and significant correlations were established between the students' fat mass percentages and their V̇o 2max and between their waist-to-hip ratio and V̇o 2max as well. Results from the international physical activity questionnaire showed that most participants in this laboratory were sedentary students. Therefore, this laboratory makes the students practice and understand the use of a classical test to estimate their V̇o 2max . It also alerts them to the correlation between a sedentary lifestyle and higher body fat content. This exercise allowed students to use a scientific method to engage the problem of sedentary lifestyle, which is a real world issue.",

    "abstract": "This study describes an undergraduate student laboratory activity using isolated preparations from rat gastrointestinal tissues that possess contractile profiles typically exhibited by striated and smooth muscle cells. While students are introduced to an ex vivo methodology, they can compare differences in trace experiments, twitch aspects, phasic and tonic properties, force-frequency relationships, and pharmacological responsiveness of esophageal (striated) and fundic (smooth muscle) segments. Muscle strips were subjected to electrical field stimulation (EFS) applied by platinum electrodes immersed in the physiological solution. The contractile profile of EFS responses varied between these two types of gut preparations. Atropine and tubocurarine revealed differential inhibitory influences in esophagus or fundus tissues; caffeine and procaine produced similar effects, i.e., potentiation and blockade of the EFS-induced contractile response in these tissues, respectively. Experimental results obtained during the activity helped the improvement of student learning about basic concepts previously discussed in theoretical lectures. To measure student learning with this laboratory exercise, a questionnaire was applied before and after the activity, and the number of expected correct answers, concerning the mechanisms of contraction in striated and smooth muscle, could be clearly evidenced.",

    "abstract": "In response to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Association of American Medical Colleges Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians (SFFP) report and a concern for better preparing undergraduates for future doctoral programs in the health professions, the deans of the College of Arts and Sciences and Division of Basic Biomedical Sciences of Sanford School of Medicine of the University of South Dakota formed an ad hoc Premedical Curriculum Review Committee with representatives from the science departments and medical school. The Committee began by reviewing the university's suggested premedical curriculum and matching it to the proposed competencies from the SFFP to document duplications and deficiencies. The proposed changes in the Medical College Admission Test for 2015 were also evaluated. The Committee proposed a stronger premedical curriculum, with the development of some new courses, including an inquiry-based physiology course with team-based learning, to more fully address SFFP competencies. These analyses convinced the university that a new major would best help students achieve the competencies and prepare them for admission exams. Thus, a new Medical Biology major was proposed to the South Dakota Board of Regents and accepted for its initial offering in 2012. The new major has been broadly advertised to future students and is successful as a recruiting tool for the university. This article details the process of evaluating the curriculum and designing the new major, describes some of the difficulties in its implementation, and reviews outcomes from the new major to date.",

At nearly the same time in Marburg, Carl Ludwig, unaware of Bowman's findings, proposed that urine formation begins with glomerular filtration followed by tubule reabsorption. The controversy lasted 80 yr. Prominent investigators weighed in on both sides. Rudolph Heidenhain's findings in 1874 swung the pendulum toward Bowman's theory until Arthur Cushny published his book, The Secretion of Urine, in 1917, in which he found the evidence insufficient to prove either theory. In 1921, a young physician, Joseph Wearn, began his postresidency training in the laboratory of Alfred N. Richards. He read Cushny's book and learned how to expose the glomerulus of a living frog. Richards proposed that Wearn use that experimental preparation to inject epinephrine into the glomerulus. Wearn proposed a different experiment: instead of using injection, collect fluid from the glomerulus and analyze it. Richards agreed, and the landmark results of that experiment, published in 1924, settled the controversy. The modern era of renal physiology was born.",

In this context, collaborative teaching strategies in the undergraduate classroom setting may be useful, since it has been reported to enhance both transfer and retention of learned material in a time-efficient fashion (3). In a previous study (4), we investigated whether different collaborative teaching strategies would improve medical students' skills in acid-base physiology. Students received a 45-min ex cathetra class on acid-base physiology, which was followed by a 20-min interactive session, where students assessed eight different arterial blood gases. The latter was either done by conventional group work, where students worked in pairs and spent 2 min on each arterial blood gas, or by Mazur's peer instruction technique (2), where students worked individually for 1 min and then in pairs of two for 1 min. We found that conventional group work and peer instruction equally enabled second-year medical students to diagnose common acid-base disorders immediately after class, indicating successful transfer of the learned material (4). In the present 2-yr followup study, we investigated whether these collaborative strategies also lead to long-term retention of the learned skills.We obtained institutional approval for the present study from the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Copenhagen, and participation was voluntary. Twenty-four months after our initial study on collaborative teaching strategies for diagnosing common acid-base disorders was conducted (4), we recruited 31 of the 41 students who had originally participated (\"collaborative group\"), of which 14 students had been subjected to conventional group work and 17 students had been subjected to the peer instruction technique. Furthermore, 58 other fourth-year medical students that had participated in the same physiology course 2 yr earlier, but without any collaborative elements, were recruited (\"control group\"). The two groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and previous experience with diagnosing acid-base disorders (data not shown). All students underwent an individual written test, in which they were to diagnose acid-base disorders by assessing four arterial blood gases (Table 1). During the test, students received a sheet with normal ranges for all arterial acid-base variables, and for each of the four arterial blood gases, they were to provide a diagnosis and report how confident (0-100%) they felt that their diagnosis was correct. Students completed the test in <5 min. In the analysis of test results, one point was awarded for each correctly diagnosed acid-base disorder. IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh (version 22.0, IBM, Armonk, NY) was used to compare test scores and confidence levels by nonparametric statistics (Mann-Whitney U-test). Unless otherwise stated, data are reported as medians with corresponding interquartile ranges.Table 1.

For three of the four acid-base disorders, a higher proportion of students in the collaborative group reached the correct diagnosis and generally did so with a higher level of confidence (Table 2). Within the collaborative group, there were no differences between test scores or confidence levels of students that had learned acid-base physiology by conventional group work or the peer instruction technique (data not shown).Fig. 1.Total test scores.

Such strategies may therefore be beneficial for conveying the complexity of acid-base physiology to undergraduate students in a time-restricted setup.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: J.P.H. performed experiments; J.P.H., L.N.T., and R.M.G.B. analyzed data; J.P.H., L.N.T., and R.M.G.B. interpreted results of experiments; J.P.H., L.N.T., and R.M.G.B. edited and revised manuscript; J.P.H., L.N.T., and R.M.G.B. approved final version of manuscript; L.N.T. prepared figures; R.M.G.B. conception and design of research; R.M.G.B. drafted manuscript.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "In the present study, a preparation of frog skin was presented, which can be used to demonstrate the basic concepts of blood flow regulation in a very clear and attractive way to high school and university students. In a freshly euthanized Xenopus, a patch of abdominal skin was exposed from the internal side and viewed with a USB microscope while it remained connected to a functioning circulatory system. In this way, it was possible to obtain sharp images of arteries and veins and to visualize blood flow. This allows students to learn about the functional differences between arteries and veins and about the complexity of hemodynamics as well as the particularities of the amphibian pulmocutaneous circulation. Students can then quantitatively estimate the effect of norepinephrine and epinephrine on the diameter of blood vessels by simply superfusing the skin patch with a series of solutions of the two substances. They can also test the effect of α-adrenergic receptor blockers, used to treat high blood pressure, on the norepinephrine-induced muscle tonus of blood vessels.",

This study aimed to investigate the impact of an exercise physiology blended learning theory module on student performance, engagement, and perceptions. The module, which comprised a range of elements (student guide, lecturer-recorded videos, supplementary videos, formative quizzes, workshops, and discussion forum), was implemented in a third-year subject taken by students in nonspecialist undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees. Students chose which elements to engage with to support their learning. Exam performance was assessed by comparing exam marks from fully face-to-face delivery to the blended delivery with an independent t test. Student perceptions were determined via an end-of-module questionnaire comprised of Likert-scale questions and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted on the Likert-scale responses, and qualitative content analysis was conducted on the open-ended responses. Student engagement with online resources was determined through analysis of access statistics from the learning management system. Student exam marks in the blended learning student group were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than in the face-to-face group, even though the questions were of a higher Bloom's level in the blended learning group. Students preferred blended delivery over fully face-to-face delivery. Most students accessed the student guide, lecturer-recorded videos, and quizzes, with supplementary videos, workshops, and discussion forums accessed by fewer students. In conclusion, a blended exercise physiology theory module improved student exam performance and was positively perceived by students, and engagement with the elements of the module was varied.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Few studies have explored the impact of blended delivery of exercise physiology theory curricula on student learning and experience.

The OK-INBRE Research Project Investigator (RPI) award program has supported 30 faculty from both research-intensive universities and primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) over the past 15 yr. To examine the impact of this program, we assessed the career trajectory of OK-INBRE RPI awardees and compared their productivity with a control group of applicants who applied for but did not receive an RPI award. A mixed-methods approach was employed to assess longitudinal programmatic impact. Regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effect of an RPI award on faculty productivity, controlling for institutional affiliation. Key informant interviews were conducted to capture qualitative information about satisfaction and additional outcomes. OK-INBRE RPI awardees had a higher number in total and mean number of publications. In achieving extramural funding, RPI awardees were 12.5 times (P = 0.005) as likely to receive a grant award of any type and 4.5 times (P = 0.06) as likely to receive a subsequent federal grant as those in the control group. Many RPI awardees attributed their career success to OK-INBRE, but they also helped to identify barriers to advancement or productivity associated with their specific home institutions.

    "abstract": "There is extensive and increasing use of ultrasound in medical care and scientific research, so it is important that the technique, indication, and interpretation of ultrasound investigations are included in medical and biological education. Applications of ultrasound in medical care and education employ not only noninvasive imaging of structure but also the evaluation of organ function. Vascular ultrasound is one such application that has been hitherto relatively neglected in physiology education. The techniques of vascular ultrasound and the physiological regulation of human limb blood flow are reviewed to inform students and curriculum designers. Emphasis is placed on the value of converting velocity measurement by ultrasound to volumetric flow and on the mechanisms involved in rapidly changing flows with interventions. Live collection of real data by ultrasound can show macrovascular and microvascular features of vascular physiology. Macrovascular features include imaging and flow velocity profiles. Microvascular perfusion studies show conductance changes with interventions such as exercise and ischemia. Vascular ultrasound offers exciting opportunities for undergraduate research projects using human subjects. The literature is interesting and, though complex, offers excellent educational experience, with scope for the development of critical thinking and meaningful original research.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Ultrasound imaging has emergent prominence in clinical investigation and education. Vascular ultrasound also evaluates function. Simple methods are described that enable the application of basic ultrasound principles to the measurement of velocity and, importantly, to calculate absolute volumetric blood flow. These methods should be useful in undergraduate and graduate education, with application in clinical practice and research.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, basic science educators at medical and health science programs are faced with the challenge of delivering fundamental science content using evidence-based pedagogical approaches that build students' fund of knowledge while also supporting their development as self-regulated learners. This has led to an increased use of active learning-based pedagogies such as flipped classroom teaching. However, there are many open questions about the conditions necessary for successful flipped classroom sessions. In particular, the role of student compliance (i.e., participation, engagement, attendance) in mediating performance needs to be evaluated. This is especially important in accelerated curricula where multiple basic science disciplines are integrated together in pass-fail courses, presenting challenges to both students' time and cognitive load. Data on prematriculation performance, in-class participation, weekly quiz performance, and summative assessment performance from three cohorts of medical students (n = 146) at a new medical school were collected and analyzed. We found that historically high-performing students more readily participated in flipped classroom application sessions compared with historically lower-performing students. Correlational analysis of performance on weekly formative quizzes and the summative course exam was not related to in-class participation. However, performance on weekly formative quizzes played the most significant role in students' performance on summative exams. Efforts to understand the benefits of in-class participation beyond short-term assessment performance, such as long-term knowledge retention or development of noncognitive skills, should be undertaken to justify using such time- and human resource-intensive pedagogies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study explores the use of flipped classroom teaching in a voluntary and accelerated medical school course. We found that historically high-performing students attend class, whereas historically low-performing students do not attend class as readily. Formative assessment performance appears to be more important than participation in determining the final grade. Correlation of high performance (>90%) with participation may differentiate students who excel in our curriculum from those who simply pass with superficial knowledge.",

However, this relationship has never been explored in the medical education context. This study's aim was to explore the relationship between learning strategies and personality traits among medical students. This study was a cross-sectional study, and a quantitative approach was employed using two self-administered questionnaires: one to assess the personality traits from the Five-Factor Model (Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, and Agreeableness), and the other to assess 10 learning strategies (Anxiety, Attitude, Concentration, Information Processing, Motivation, Selecting Main Ideas, Self-Testing, Test Strategies, Time Management, and Using Academic Resources). A stratified random sampling technique was used to recruit medical students at Alfaisal University in the preclinical and clinical years (N = 309). Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the relationship between variables, and linear regression was used to evaluate how personality traits predicted learning strategy selection. Personality traits predicted the selection of learning strategies, especially Conscientiousness and Neuroticism. Conscientiousness showed a positive correlation with seven learning strategies and was the most important predictor of learning strategies students employ. Neuroticism correlations and predictions were negative. The other three traits showed weaker correlations. These correlations were between Extraversion and Using Academic Resources (r = 0.27), Information Processing (r = 0.23), and Attitude (r = 0.19); Openness and Information Processing (r = 0.29); and Agreeableness and Attitude (r = 0.29).

This is achieved through a combination of central and peripheral mechanisms that influence cardiac output and vasomotor tone throughout the vascular system. Furthermore, the capability to preferentially direct blood to tissues with increased metabolic demand (i.e., active hyperemia) is crucial to exercise tolerance. However, the interaction between these systems is difficult to understand without real-life examples. Fortunately, monitoring blood flow, blood pressure, and heart rate during a series of laboratory protocols will allow students to partition the contributions of these central and peripheral factors.

    "abstract": "A task force of physiology educators from 25 Australian universities generated an Australia-wide consensus on seven core concepts for physiology curricula. One adopted core concept was \"cell membrane,\" defined as \"Cell membranes determine what substances enter or leave the cell and its organelles. They are essential for cell signaling, transport, and other cellular functions.\" This concept was unpacked by a team of 3 Australian physiology educators into 4 themes and 33 subthemes arranged in a hierarchical structure up to 5 levels deep. The four themes related to defining the cell membrane, cell membrane structure, transport across cell membranes, and cell membrane potentials.

The majority (28) of items evaluated were rated as either Essential or Important. Theme 2: cell membrane structure was rated as less important than the other three themes. Theme 4: membrane potential was rated most difficult, while theme 1: defining cell membranes was rated as the easiest. The importance of cell membranes as a key aspect of biomedical education received strong support from Australian educators.

    "abstract": "Internodal conduction pathways are the communication apparatus of the cardiac conduction system conveying sinus node action potentials (APs) to the atrioventricular node and atrial working myocytes. In 1910, at the Deutschen Pathologischen Gesellschaft held in Erlangen, Charles Thörel related his discovery of an internodal bundle structured with Purkinje-like cells, which was rejected by the participants, who endorsed the then-leading doctrine that atrial contractile cardiomyocytes operate as internodal routes. Starting in 1963 and for five subsequent decades, two groups have revisited this issue. The first group, led by Thomas James, defended the histological existence of uninsulated, high-speed cordlike internodal conduction tracts. Although not supported by robust experimental data, this hypothesis achieved the status of a physiological creed in the scientific community. The second group, led by Robert Anderson, systematically refuted this stance and adopted anisotropy as an innovative internodal conduction mechanism operating via spindle-shaped atrial contractile myocytes structured in anisotropic muscular bundles relaying sinoatrial node (SAN) APs to their atrial destinations at physiologically required (fit for purpose) velocities to enable electromechanical synchrony of atrial systoles. Modern imaging and electrophysiological techniques can now clearly visualize muscular internodal and interatrial tracts and SAN depolarization electrical waves, confirming the existence of atrial conduction paths consisting of anisotropically arranged contractile cardiomyocytes. Mastery of the current best-science anatomy and physiology of the human atria is required for electrophysiologists to safely perform atrial radiofrequency ablation interventions to restore sinus rhythm in patients distressed by supraventricular arrhythmias.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This report reexamines disparate historical views on internodal pathway existence and nature. The conflicting research, ongoing since 1963, regarding these issues, is appraised. The discovery of myocytes anisotropically structured in atrial bundles relaying sinoatrial node (SAN) action potentials (APs) to atrioventricular node (AVN) and atrial wall destinations is emphasized, since it is still a relatively unfamiliar subject in physiology teaching. Modern imaging technologies can now visualize internodal pathways as muscular bundles displaying SAN electrical waves traversing the atrial walls.",

    "abstract": "Attitude, ethics, and communication are key attributes in the doctor-patient relationship and to strengthen these qualities, the National Medical Commission, the body that regulates medical education and medical professionals in India introduced a course called Attitudes, Ethics and Communication (AETCOM) in the undergraduate medical curriculum. The objective of this study was to ascertain the perceptible qualitative influence of the modules in communication in the AETCOM course and to obtain feedback on its implementation. In this cross-sectional study, the attitude of medical students in all stages of training including internship was first explored using a Communication Skills Attitude Scale. Out of 27 modules in AETCOM course, five modules named foundations of communication deal with communication, and they are taught from the first to final professional years of training. After introducing communication modules in AETCOM for all professional years, feedback was collected from interns who had completed training in all modules. The interns provided feedback with a validated scale and two focused group discussions. Additionally, feedback from faculty involved in teaching AETCOM was analyzed. There was a significant increase in the positive attitude scores in the final year and internship compared to the first year. Eighty percent of the interns agreed that communication modules in AETCOM were useful and that they equipped them with the communication skills required for actual practice during their internship. Faculty agreed that these modules motivated the students to acquire communication skills. However, faculty also felt that these modules alone may not be sufficient to learn communication skills.",

    "abstract": "The cardiovascular system is a central topic in physiology classes, yet it is difficult to provide undergraduates with quality laboratory experiences in this area. Thus a model circulatory system was developed to give students hands-on experience with cardiovascular fluid dynamics. This model system can be constructed from readily available materials at a reasonable cost. It has a realistic pressure drop across the different vessels. Using this system, students can investigate the effect that blood volume, vessel compliance, vessel construction, and heart activity have on blood pressure and flow. The system also demonstrates the effect of vessel diameter on resistance and fluid velocity. This model may give students a more concrete, intuitive feel for cardiovascular physiology. Another advantage is that it allows dramatic and easily controlled manipulations with quantitative results. Finally, its simple construction allows students to interchange components, giving them greater flexibility in experimentation.",

This article illustrates, with a few examples, the importance of conveying a \"big picture\" conceptual framework before discussing the details of cardiovascular physiology. Also, I have chosen examples from cardiac output and blood pressure regulation that show the importance of discussing cardiovascular physiology in terms of feedback control systems and integrating information from other areas, such as renal and endocrine physiology.

Students learn basic science in small groups led by a faculty facilitator, and students are responsible for a great deal of their own teaching and learning. The curriculum is centered around patient cases and is called patient-centered learning (PCL). The curriculum includes traditional lectures and laboratories supporting faculty-generated learning objectives. Endocrine physiology is taught in year one, utilizing four weeks of patient cases that emphasize normal structure and function of endocrine systems. Endocrine physiology is revisited in year two, which is primarily focused on pathobiology.

After four years in Buffalo, first as a postdoctoral fellow and then as an assistant professor, Harold made the long trek to Seattle, WA, where he has been ever since. Harold Modell’s contributions to physiology education are many and varied. He was certainly one of the early developers of teaching software aimed at helping students learn physiology. His programs are widely used, but more importantly, he has been instrumental in bringing others into the field of computer-based education. The existence of the Teaching Section is in no small measure the result of Harold’s efforts to persuade APS that teaching was important to a great many of its members, and to the Society. Similarly, this journal, Advances in Physiology Education, came to life after a long campaign spearheaded by Harold. As the journal’s founding editor, he set the stage for the growing success that it is enjoying today. Finally, Harold is an educational researcher of note whose every project is aimed at helping the learner to learn. As a leading advocate of this attitude, Harold has helped physiology teachers at all levels adopt this approach to teaching.",

Thermodynamically, the cell is an open system making a universe with the surrounding, which provides the substrates that the cell needs for living and receives the waste substances disposed of by the cell. Changes in the physical chemical conditions beyond a narrow range leads to the cell's death. In multicellular organisms, as in the human being, the medium surrounding the cell (represented by the extracellular fluid and known as the internal environment) is continuously monitored by a variety of control systems in the body. Several variables of the internal environment, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−, HCO3−, and glucose concentrations, temperature, pH, O2 and CO2 partial pressures, osmolarity, and many others, are tightly controlled within a nonlethal range. If the conditions of the internal environment are favorable, each cell keeps itself alive and hence gives its functional contribution to the tissue of which it is a part. In a similar way, tissues contribute to organs, which, in turn, are part of systems. Ultimately, a homeostatic cycle (Fig. 1) can be constructed in which the systems of the body work interdependently to give their functional contributions to the adequate maintenance of extracellular fluid. This implies that the primordial function of all systems of the body is to maintain a tight control over the thermodynamic variables of the internal environment, granting living conditions for each cell to functionally contribute to the body economy as a whole. The maintenance of a stable condition of the internal environment is known as homeostasis. An intense change in the external environment that overcomes the capacity of the control systems or the hypofunctionality of a control system breaks homeostasis and may result in illness or even in death. In this context, the primordial task of physiology is to understand the processes by which organisms maintain homeostasis.To make clear the concept of homeostasis for students starting in physiology, let's make an analogy between a cell tissue of the body (Fig. 2A) and a cell culture in the laboratory (Fig. 2B). The analogy shows that what the researcher has to do for keeping the cell alive is to make the growth medium similar to the extracellular fluid and to mimic the actions of homeostatic control systems. Whereas in the in vivo system the nutrients are delivered to and metabolites are withdrawn from the surroundings, respectively, by the arterial and venous circulations, in the in vitro system the researcher does the same by periodically changing the growth medium. In other words, the researcher has to maintain the homeostasis of the growth medium, which is exactly what organic systems do for the internal environment. A classical example is as follows: to control the extracellular fluid temperature, there is a system composed for temperature sensors responding to hot and cold scattered throughout the body, an integrative control center, i.e. the hypothalamic thermostat, and by effectors that can produce more heat (increasing metabolic rate, shivering) and change heat loss (blood vessel dilatation or constriction, sweating). This system is able to set the temperature to ∼37°C and keep it constant by making the difference between production and loss of heat equal to zero. For achieving the same temperature control over the growth medium, the researcher keeps the petri dish in a temperature chamber, which is equipped with a controlled heat source, a thermostat, and a knob for setting the temperature at 37°C. In this way, the researcher makes, in relation to the temperature, the in vitro universe (growth medium-cell) similar to the in vivo universe (extracellular fluid-cell). This analogy can be used for any other physical chemical variable of the internal environment comparing control systems of the body and the researcher's actions.Fig. 1.Homeostatic cycle. The homeostatic functions of the body are built up from the functional unit, the cell, to the structures of higher level of organization, the systems, which work interdependently for the maintenance of a stable condition of the extracellular fluid.Download figureDownload PowerPoint Fig. 2.A schematic representation of the analogy between an in vivo cell tissue (A) and an in vitro cell culture (B).Download figureDownload PowerPointI thank Dr. Wamberto Varanda for comments on the previous version of the manuscript.This article has no references to display.

In this brief commentary, I will comment on those guidelines as well as present my own personal view of this discipline to make this meaningful for readers of Advances in Physiology Education.My interest in statistics was sparked by a rather unfortunate remark made by one of my teachers in medical school over 40 years ago. Emphatically stressing the wrong syllable and with a characteristic jiggle of the head, he declared “Statistics is an extremely boring subject, but I'm afraid I have to teach it to you.” I was cussed enough to find inspiration in that remark.Statistics is far too exciting to be labeled dull or boring. The essence of any inquiry is to tease out meaningful information from a welter of noise. Proper use of statistics can give us the confidence that any statements we make at the end of our research can be justified or have “warranted assertibility,” to use Dewey's expressive term (7). The guidelines prepared by Curran-Everett and Benos (5) provide a checklist of do's and don'ts. In several earlier reports (3, 4), Curran-Everett and others have provided the appropriate background material, and reading those reports is crucial to appreciate the logic underlying the guidelines.Modern science, which is built on 17th century foundations, seeks to infer events in the real world by manipulating it. Scientists provoke changes and assess the meaning and directions of those changes with calibrated instruments. They can select, at best, a small sample from a larger population (rats, mice, dogs, or humans) and attempt to infer from the effects observed in the small sample, what the effects would be if the entire population had been subject to the same manipulations. Knowledge of statistics helps them to extrapolate the information they gather from these limited samples to the larger population with varying degrees of confidence.This helps them deal with two fundamental questions: 1) Has there been a change in any of the quantities measured and 2) Is the change large enough to be meaningful? The first question is answered by hypothesis testing and the second by estimation. It is important to establish whether or not a change has occurred that cannot be accounted for by random variations. However, hypothesis testing is fairly limited, and the authors point out it that is largely an artificial construct. The more important issue is whether the magnitude and direction of the change have any relevance. Unfortunately, considerable misunderstanding exists as to what statistics can and cannot do, and the authors deal with some very important elements in their short review. There is an unwarranted obsession with P values, in particular, and this may lead to either exaggerated or understated claims. This point is made more trenchantly by Goodman (8), when he refers to the P value fallacy. The authors emphasize that there is a clear distinction between statistical significance and scientific significance, with hypothesis testing pointing to the first, but only estimations revealing the latter.The later set of guidelines is based on the information presented in this brief review. The guidelines are clear and provide very useful information for both authors and reviewers. Their suggestion that authors report a precise P value is a good one, since it does provide the reader with the options of considering or discarding the results presented. However, this point could be disputed, since some texts would state that there really is no point of quibbling once you have set a significance value that is acceptable. Daniel (6) also noted that authors have a tendency to place “more and more zeroes to the right of the decimal place to make a calculated P value more noteworthy,” so that the reported probabilities look like the scoreboard for a no-hitter in baseball, even though this may have “absolutely nothing to do with the practical significance of the results.”There are other instances where the authors appear to be excessively prescriptive, particularly for contributors to this journal.Consider, for example, the injunction to report variability using a standard deviation. This is excellent advice. However, for some studies reported in this journal, it may not be the best approach. Authors should be able to provide their data in the format that best suits their purposes without being constrained. In their review, Curran-Everett et al. (3) do agree that although a standard deviation is useful, it could be a deceptive index of variability, since even subtle departures from a normal distribution can make it useless. In educational settings, deviations from a normal distribution may occur fairly often when one is dealing with selected samples of students. As the authors are not unaware of this issue, it is surprising, then, that in their guidelines they are so prescriptive. Several years ago, I published a report (11) in this journal, where I reported on a course designed to teach students the elements of scientific discovery. I included a table that showed student evaluations of the course, where I showed data as median, mode, and range of responses to each question on a 5-point scale. I could well have given just the mean and standard deviation, but as the responses were skewed toward the higher end, giving the data in the format I chose was more meaningful.Curran-Everett and Benos (5) also cautioned authors from presenting data giving variability in terms of standard errors of the mean rather than standard deviations. This is a reasonable position but could, again, be more rigid than necessary. I would argue that what we are really trying to do in most studies is to gauge what the population parameters are based on our sample characteristics. Thus, giving the standard error of the mean allows the reader to have some idea as to how closely the mean values reported approximate the population mean. Furthermore, giving standard errors of the mean and n values helps readers gauge the confidence limits of the mean.Another point on which authors should be given leeway is to choose not to do any statistical tests at all. The authors point out, in an earlier report (3), the problem with tests of significance. This particular issue has been debated at length (1, 2, 6). Daniel (6) made much the same point when he suggested that editors should “require authors to avoid using SSTs (statistical significance tests) where not appropriate.” Carver (1), in an earlier commentary, was less conciliatory, stating bluntly that “Statistical significance testing has involved more fantasy than fact. The emphasis on statistical significance testing over scientific significance in educational research represents a corrupt form of the scientific method. Educational research would be better off if it stopped testing its results for statistical significance.” I would have liked the authors in their guidelines to make an explicit statement, by stating that when changes are clear enough, there is really no need to do any tests at all or fall back on what pharmacologists call the “the bloody obvious test” (9). Motulsky (10) made this point quite explicit when he said that “If your data speak for themselves, don't interrupt.” Although I am not disputing the need for clear guidelines and that the authors have succeeded admirably in their aims, I feel a bit uncomfortable that these may be interpreted in a narrow sense to exclude good information from being published in this journal.REFERENCES1 Carver RP.

Following 2 wk of didactic sessions and baseline data collection at sea level, the group ascended to a research station at 12,500-ft elevation. Here, teams of three to four students measured the maximal rate of oxygen uptake, cognitive function, hand and foot volume changes, reticulocyte count and hematocrit, urinary pH and 24-h urine volume, athletic performance, and nocturnal blood oxygen saturation. Their data allowed the students to quantify the effect of altitude on the oxygen cascade and to demonstrate the following altitude-related changes: 1) impaired performance on selected cognitive function tests, 2) mild peripheral edema, 3) rapid reticulocytosis, 4) urinary alkalinization and diuresis, 5) impaired aerobic but not anaerobic exercise performance, 6) inverse relationship between blood oxygen saturation and resting heart rate, and 7) regular periodic nocturnal oxygen desaturation events accompanied by heart rate accelerations. The students learned and applied basic statistical techniques to analyze their data, and each team summarized its results in the format of a scientific paper. The students were uniformly enthusiastic about the use of self-directed experimentation to explore the physiology of altitude adaptation and felt that they learned more from this course format than a control group of students felt that they learned from a physiology course taught by the same instructor in the standard classroom/laboratory format.",

Data concerning potential objections to the CICR theory are discussed as well. In closing, technical issues associated with the skinned cell model are mentioned. Based on this review article, teaching and learning points are put forth in this article to highlight two concepts: 1) the regulatory mechanisms of CICR in cardiomyocytes and 2) the recognition of contradicting hypotheses and limitations in experimental design. The first concept is certainly an important one for physiology students. The second concept is universally applicable to researchers in all fields of science. It is thus the aim of this article to cultivate a rewarding teaching and learning experience for both instructors and students.",

I have argued (1, 2) that the findings of the Guyton et al. study (4) that Curran-Everett discusses have been misinterpreted, particularly in the profound misconcept that mean circulatory pressure (Pmc) is somehow the driving force for steady-state flow (Q) through the peripheral vasculature. Nonetheless, I agree that students stand to benefit from study of the paper's findings, both for comprehension of the physics of the peripheral vasculature and for appreciation of the history of development of cardiovascular physiology. Unfortunately, the Curran-Everett presentation includes a serious error. I also have comments about other aspects of Curran-Everett's development that I think interfere with the purpose of exploiting this learning opportunity.The error is in Fig. 2, which shows physical models for discussion of venous return and analogous electrical circuits. In Fig. 2, the two circuit diagrams show the pressures at the inflow and outflow ports as Pmc and right atrial pressure (Pra), respectively. The inflow port pressure should be arterial pressure (Pa), not Pmc. With (Pmc − Pra) as the pressure differential between the input and output ports, Q would not then be described by the Eqs. 1 and 2 of the article, but simply as (Pmc − Pra) divided by the sum of the resistances.If the schematics of Fig. 2 were to show a constant current generator or flow source, respectively, connected between the input and output ports, and if pressures at the ports were Pa and Pra, then they would represent the circuit that Guyton et al. actually worked with and would be consistent with equations in Curran-Everett's development. Q would relate to pressures at the ports as follows: (1)Through algebraic manipulation, we can replace this simple description of the behavior of the circuit with a complicated one, Curran-Everett's Eq. 2. The manipulation eliminates Pa in the flow-to-volume relationship by equating two expressions for the total volume contained within the vasculature: one expressed in terms of the pressures in the arterial and venous compartments, PaCa + PvCv (where Ca is arterial capacitance and Cv is venous capacitance); and one based on the definition of Pmc, Pmc(Ca + Cv). The latter has physical meaning in terms of measureable quantities only in the situation of zero flow, with Pmc being the pressure observed throughout the vasculature when flow stops and the blood volume distributes passively according to the elastic properties of the vascular compartments.In the equality Pmc(Ca + Cv) = PaCa + PvCv, we can use the details of the pressure-flow relationships of the circuit described in Eq. 1 above to replace Pv with Pra + QRv and Pa with Pra + QRv + QRa (where Ra is arterial resistance and Rv is venous resistance) to obtain the following equation: (2)Equation 2 connects Q, Pmc, and Pra. By rearranging it, i.e., solving for Q (see the appendix), one obtains Curran-Everett's Eq. 2. But why do that? It distracts from what is really driving flow and establishing the pressures, that is, the energy of the current or flow source manifested in driving pressure (Pa − Pra). (Pmc − Pra) simply isn't a “driving pressure.” The intent to show this differential as a driving pressure is perhaps what led to the error of placing Pmc at the input ports in Curran-Everett's Fig. 2.Beyond the problem with this error, I see another with the emphasis on vascular impedance. The more a student knows about impedance, the more confusing this treatment must be. Curran-Everett, as did Guyton and coworkers, refers to the denominator in his Eq. 2 as an impedance. Impedance is the appropriate concept for understanding voltage and current (or, by analogy, pressure and flow) in a circuit containing both resistive and capacitive elements, especially when driven sinusoidally. In such circuits, the voltage-to-current ratio depends on the frequency at which the power source cycles, and the quantitative expression for the voltage-to-current ratio typically includes terms with resistances and capacitances multiplied together, such as RvCv in Curran-Everett's Eq. 2.But quantitative expressions of circuit impedance necessarily include the driving frequency. The denominator of Curran-Everett's Eq. 2 is not about impedance for the obvious reason that it is not frequency dependent. Curran-Everett's Eq. 2 describes a steady-state relationship between flow and pressures, equivalent in electrical terms to a voltage-to-current relationship when voltages and currents are not changing, i.e., a direct current as opposed to alternating current situation. The superficial similarity to an expression for impedance, i.e., the RC products, is the consequence of the algebraic manipulation necessary to replace Pa in the simple relationship for flow, Q = (Pa − Pra)/(Ra + Rv).I also see potential for confusion in the complicated expressions for the partial derivatives of Curran-Everett's Eq. 2. Students disinclined toward calculus will surely be daunted by the series beginning with Curran-Everett's Eq. 5. But those who look closely at the physical models and Eq. 1 above will see that the partial derivatives of Q with respect to Ra and Rv, with the driving pressure (Pa − Pra) held constant, are identical. In terms of the electrical circuits in Curran-Everett's Fig. 2, a 1-Ω resistance change has exactly the same effect on flow regardless of which resistance changes.Curran-Everett's partial derivatives come from the expression with the artificial driving pressure (Pmc − Pra). They reveal a magnified effect of changes in Rv because the constraint imposed in forming the total derivative is that (Pmc − Pra) be constant. That constraint brings in the effect on volume distribution of the large ratio of Cv to Ca via the complicated way of expressing Pa in terms of Pmc. Curran-Everett's thought experiment that concentrates on the effects of altered pressure gradients on the distribution of a fixed total volume between the two compartments seems to me a much better direction to pursue, both toward the goal of helping students understand the physics of the peripheral vasculature and toward appreciation of the classic experiment (4).In summary, it seems to me that an approach to helping students to learn from the classic paper of Guyton et al. (4) should begin with focus on the advances made possible by their innovation of holding total volume constant while flow was varied and should tackle the difficult problem of understanding how the Starling resistor functioned as a negative feedback control element for establishing the flow that would result in a specific Pra (2). That approach and technology revealed the characteristics of the isovolumic “venous return curves” that would have been concealed had they forced varied rates of flow through the vasculature without regard to total circulating volume.With the aid of simple models such as those illustrated in Curran-Everett's Fig. 2 (with the correction that Pa be put in the place of Pmc), students can be encouraged to think about how a fixed total volume is distributed among the capacitive elements of the vasculature at different levels of flow when flow changes, along the direction that Curran-Everett does take in the thought experiment described. With this concept grasped, students can move on to understanding of the built-in negative feedback mechanism: increasing Q through the peripheral vasculature obligates a generally upstream-ward transfer of volume, thus reducing Pra and in turn acting to reduce cardiac output through the influence of Pra on stroke volume (1, 2). They can then advance to thinking about how transient differences between venous return and cardiac output occur during intercompartment transfers of volume.Inveigling Pmc into these conceptual views is not necessary. It seems to me that any conceptual legitimacy of Pmc lies in its proxy representation of total volume. But that representation is complicated by the coinvolvement of tone within the smooth muscle of the vasculature, i.e., Pmc reflects the volume within the vasculature but also the state of vascular smooth muscle. Rather than Pmc, why not speak directly in terms of the volume contained within the vasculature?APPENDIXBegin by rearranging Eq. 2 above as follows: Collect the terms as follows: Collect the terms and rearrange them as follows: Then, All that remains to make this identical to Curran-Everett's Eq. 2 is to replace (Ca + Cv) with total capacitance and divide both sides by [RvCv + (Ra + Rv)(Ca)]. In showing how Pra falls, relative to Pmc, with increases in flow, it reflects the redistribution of volume that occurs as Q, Pa, and Pv change under the constraint of fixed total volume.REFERENCES1 Brengelmann GL.

Students are not routinely exposed to the assessment methods for obesity, its overall prevalence, causative factors, short- and long-term consequences, and its management by lifestyle modification. This physiology laboratory exercise involving students of medicine (n = 106) was developed to 1) introduce medical students to methods of obesity assessment and to differentiate between general and abdominal obesity, 2) generate an interest and sensitivity about obesity, and 3) stimulate thinking about modification of their lifestyle in relation to eating habits, weight control, and physical activity. Spinal shrinkage (the difference between the standing height of a person and his/her recumbent length) was used as an immediate observable parameter to demonstrate the effect of adiposity. Spinal shrinkage is recognized as an index of the compressive forces acting on the spine and is related to body mass index. A positive correlation (r = 0.365, P < 0.05) was observed between body mass index and spinal shrinkage. A questionnaire was used to assess student responses to this exercise. Students were motivated to engage in more physical activity (74%), adopt healthier eating (63%), and enhance their knowledge about obesity (67%). They expressed keen interest in the laboratory exercise and found the sessions enjoyable (91%). The laboratory exercise proved to be a success in motivating the students to actively learn and inquire about obesity and to adopt a healthier lifestyle.",

The concepts of face, construct, and predictive validity are used as indicators to estimate the extent to which the animal model mimics the disease. Currently, we used these three concepts to design a theoretical assignment to integrate the teaching of neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, and experimental design. For this purpose, seven case studies were developed in which animal models for several psychiatric and neurological diseases were descibed and in which neuroactive drugs used to treat or study these diseases were introduced. Groups of undergraduate students were assigned to one of these case studies and asked to give a classroom presentation in which 1) the disease and underlying pathophysiology are described, 2) face and construct validity of the animal model are discussed, and 3) a pharmacological experiment with the associated neuroactive drug to assess predictive validity is presented. After evaluation of the presentations, we found that the students had gained considerable insight into disease phenomenology, its underlying neurophysiology, and the mechanism of action of the neuroactive drug. Moreover, the assignment was very useful in the teaching of experimental design, allowing an indepth discussion of experimental control groups and the prediction of outcomes in these groups if the animal model were to display predictive validity. Finally, the highly positive responses in the student evaluation forms indicated that the assignment was of great interest to the students. Hence, the currently developed case studies constitute a very useful tool for teaching neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, and experimental design.",

    "abstract": "Over recent decades, education has increasingly focused on student-centered learning. Guided practices represent a new way of learning for undergraduate students of physiology, whereby the students turn into teacher-students and become more deeply involved in the subject by preparing and teaching a practical (laboratory) class to their peers. The goal was to assess the students' opinions about guided practices and how physiological parameters change during the activity. For this objective, two experiments were performed. First, a voluntary questionnaire on guided practices was completed by the students during 2 academic years. Students could also write a free text commentary. The positive answers obtained in the questionnaire and the free commentary responses point to the effectiveness of this methodology in students' minds. Negative aspects included the time spent preparing the activity, and the stress that students experienced in the teaching role. Second, information about how the teacher-students felt before teaching the practical class was self-reported, and physiological parameters related to stress (heart rate, pulse rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and electrocardiogram recorded to evaluate R-R interval and heart rate variability) were measured immediately before and while the practical class was taught. This evaluation reported an increase in stress during the execution of the practice. In conclusion, despite a new and stressful situation, guided practices are of interest for the students as a learning tool and for the acquisition of skills that may be of use in their later professional lives.",

As part of this new program, we designed a 1000-level, 1-credit, pass-fail course entitled Introduction to Research in Regenerative Medicine. During a student's first year at the University, opportunities to build research skills and gain exposure to topics within the field of the biomedical sciences are relatively rare, so, to fill this gap, we focused our course on teaching primarily freshman undergraduate students how to synthesize and contextualize scientific literature, covering both basic science and clinical applications. At the end of the course, students self-reported increased confidence in reading and discussing scientific papers and review articles. The critical impact of this course lies not only in an early introduction to the popularized field of regenerative medicine, but also encouragement for younger students to participate in research early on and to appreciate the value of interdisciplinary interactions. The teaching model can be extended for implementation of student-taught introductory courses across diverse undergraduate major tracks at an institution.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to explore the factors associated with the recall of basic medical physiology knowledge among medical interns and to determine the level of retained basic science knowledge. Two hundred and four interns, 114 women and 90 men, working in two major tertiary medical care centers, King Fahad Medical City (KFMC; 29 students) and King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH; 117 students), in Riyadh city, participated in the study. An anonymous knowledge test with 10 validated multiple-choice questions was developed specifically for this purpose. One hundred and forty-six interns (117 working at KKUH and 29 at KFMC) had graduated from medical schools adopting a conventional instructional system, whereas 58 (3 from KKUH and 55 from KFMC had graduated from schools adopting an integrated system (hybrid problem-based learning). Fifty-two students (26%) gained a score ≥60%, whereas 152 students (74%) obtained <60% of the score. Higher scores were associated with younger age ( P < 0.01), traditional curriculum ( P < 0.001), interns from KKUH ( P < 0.001), and candidates for postgraduate studies ( P < 0.02). There was no significant association between recall of physiology knowledge and all other variables studied, including sex. Multivariate analyses show that age and traditional curriculum are the only significant predictors of knowledge retention. Almost three-fourths of the interns scored <60%, and higher scores were significantly associated with younger interns, traditional curriculum, working in KKUH, and interns preparing for graduate studies. However, the difference between the two curricula disappears when the influence of hospital training is considered.",

The symposium focused on alternative delivery modes of physiology education, from undergraduate to professional programs. Lecture used to be the gold standard and proven method by which students learned, but the course delivery method is rapidly changing. While there is still significant skepticism about the quality and level of student engagement in online learning, it is being offered widely due to increased demand and due to other benefits, such as the flexibility and convenience. Universities with several campuses may now synchronize lectures between campuses, utilizing video conference technology, thus bypassing the need for instructors on each campus. Other modes of delivery include online lectures with laboratories scheduled on campus. Offering biology laboratories online is on the rise but to counter skepticism, more studies are needed to demonstrate that online laboratories effectively meet laboratory objectives. The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offers many courses for free and challenges the role of universities. Assessment of the effectiveness of MOOCs and online courses is critical, as some of the concerns raised about them include level of student engagement in learning and the social aspect of interaction with peers and faculty.",

We sought to determine which (if any) of these possible benefits are commonly experienced by undergraduate students and are thus especially worthy of further investigation. Four hundred ninety-three students in nine physiology courses at two midsized American universities rated the usefulness of short instructor-penned mathematical physiology songs and explained in their own words why each song would or would not be a useful study aid. The students collectively perceived the usefulness of each song to depend on both academic factors (e.g., the lyrics' clarity or relevance to the course) and aesthetic values (e.g., the appeal of the rhythm or the quality of the singing). Most strikingly, although students' free responses were brief (median length: 18 words in study phase 1, 16 words in study phase 2), nearly one-half of them (1,039 of 2,191) concerned memory, suggesting that many students see educational songs primarily as mnemonic devices. A second major theme of students' comments concerned the conciseness and information density of the songs. Though all 10 songs were brief, lasting 17-54 s, students seemed to prefer shorter songs (perhaps better called \"jingles\"). This first-of-its-kind data set on student perceptions of educational songs should inform the creation and usage of such songs, as well as further research on their possible value.",

Limited research exists examining the predictors of success within an undergraduate Exercise Science program. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the viability of an admission policy implemented within an undergraduate Exercise Science program as a method of predicting student success. Data from 652 students from 2012 through 2018 were collected from the University’s Enterprise Information Management system. Regression analysis indicated ES 2100, an introductory Exercise Science course, was the best predictor of student performance in required major courses. Furthermore, the results indicated performance in general education courses, including English Composition II, Precalculus, General Chemistry II Laboratory, Human Anatomy and Physiology II, and General Psychology were also significantly related to performance in the required major courses, after controlling for performance in other courses. The results of the investigation provide insight regarding future success within required major courses in the program. This knowledge can be valuable when examining methods to improve retention of students, progression, minimizing repeat attempts at courses, and improving graduation rates. In conclusion, the identification of these courses, related to student success, may provide valuable insight for other Exercise Science-related programs that are considering implementing a program admission policy.",

    "abstract": "The new generations of physicians are, to a large extent, unaware of the complex philosophical and biological concepts that created the bases of modern medicine. Building on the Hellenistic tradition of the four humors and their qualities, Galen (AD 129 to c. 216) provided a persuasive scheme of the structure and function of the cardiorespiratory system, which lasted, without serious contest, for 1,300 yr. Galen combined teleological concepts with careful clinical observation to defend a coherent and integrated system in which the fire-heart—flaming at the center of the body—interacts with lungs’ air- pneuma to create life. Remarkably, however, he achieved these goals, despite failing to grasp the concept of systemic and pulmonary blood circulations, understand the source and destiny of venous and arterial blood, recognize the lung as the organ responsible for gas exchange, comprehend the actual events taking place in the left ventricle, and identify the source of internal heat. In this article, we outline the alternative theories Galen put forward to explain these complex phenomena. We then discuss how the final consequences of Galen’s flawed anatomical and physiological conceptions do not differ substantially from those obtained if one applies modern concepts. Recognition of this state of affairs may explain why the ancient practitioner could achieve relative success, without harming the patient, to understand and treat a multitude of symptoms and illnesses.",

TBL-based didactic methodology has proven beneficial in enhancing learning and consolidating key educational concepts throughout educational curricula. Such areas of application include neuroscience, which is traditionally considered to be one of the most difficult disciplines to be taught in undergraduate medical courses to the point where the scientific literature reports “neurophobia” among undergraduate medical students. Herein, we report the design and application of a modified version of TBL, which we termed team-based review (TBR) throughout two cohorts of undergraduate medical students undertaking neuroscience. We show that our TBR methodology enhanced student understanding of neuroscience, increasing average marks and grades achieved in final exams, while also increasing the proportion of students obtaining higher grades. Application of TBR also improved marks obtained by students throughout continuous assessment (midterms, TBL, and problem-based learning grades). In surveys taken following final exams, students strongly felt that TBR enhanced their learning experience and aided knowledge acquisition, consolidation, and exam preparation. Collectively, we show that TBR-based methodology was effective in enhancing the student learning experience and performance in neuroscience and could potentially be successfully used to enhance performance and learning in other subjects in the undergraduate medical curriculum.",

In parallel, students display limited critical-thinking and creative skills, integration abilities, and/or a deeper engagement with subject content. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of introducing active learning methods (cooperative learning) in a relatively large class to final-year undergraduate physiology students (Bachelor of Science stream) at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. An assignment designed to enhance active and engaged learning was made available to the students ( n = 225) during the second week of a 5-wk cardiovascular physiology series of lectures. Students were instructed to freely form working groups ( n = 3/group) and the assignment was due by the end of the module. Student groups were expected and encouraged to continuously work on the assignment (outside class time). Three cooperative learning slots were also created during class time, with the lecturer and postgraduate students acting as guides. After the module, students anonymously completed an electronic questionnaire. This study revealed three major findings in terms of implementing cooperative learning in large classes within a South African context, i.e., 1) relatively good reception by students with some indication of group work; 2) it is logistically feasible in relatively large classes, although adequate support is crucial; and 3) additional measures need to be adopted to ensure its success.",

However, the integrative interpretation of the responses occurring during the contraction-relaxation cycle is challenging due to the dynamic interaction of underlying factors. Starting in 2017, we adopted the mathematical computer simulation model of human ventricular myocyte (Cardiac E-C_Sim), hypothesizing that this educational technology may facilitate students’ learning of cardiac physiology. Here, we describe the overall process for the educational application of Cardiac E-C_Sim in the human physiology practicum of Seoul National University College of Medicine. We also report the results from questionnaires covering detailed assessment of the practicum class. The analysis of results and feedback opinions enabled us to understand how the students had approached the problem-solving process. As a whole, the students could better accomplish the learning goals using Cardiac E-C_Sim, followed by constructive discussions on the complex and dynamic mechanisms of cardiac E-C coupling. We suggest that the combined approach of lecture-based teaching and computer simulations guided by a manual containing clinical context would be broadly applicable in physiology education.",

During training cardiovascular physiology, students and early-stage medical personnel should understand the role of different functional parameters for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as for blood flow. The impact of isolated parameters can only be studied in models. Here physical hydraulic models are an advantage in which the students have a direct contact to the mechanical properties of the circulatory system. But these models are often difficult to handle. The aim of the present study was to develop a comprehensive model of the cardiovascular system, including a mechanical heart with valves, an elastic aorta, a more rigid peripheral artery system, a total peripheral resistance, and a venous reservoir representing the variable cardiac preload. This model allows one to vary systematically several functional parameters and to continuously record their impact on pressure and flow. This model is embedded into a computer-based teaching system (LabTutor) in which the students are guided through the handling of the model (as well as the systematic variation of parameters), and the measured data can be analyzed. This hybrid teaching system, which is routinely integrated in physiology laboratory courses of medical students, allows students to work with a complex hydraulic model of the cardiovascular system and to analyze systematically the impact of influencing variables (e.g., increased peripheral resistance or changed cardiac preload) as well as pathophysiological dysfunctions (e.g., reduced aortic compliance).",

Although several innovations have been attempted to improve its effectiveness, the influence of the number of sessions remains unexplored. The current study investigated the effect of the number of sessions (one vs. four) of conduction of journal club on critical appraisal skills of postgraduate students at two institutions. A quasi-experimental study was conducted comparing the effectiveness of JC in a one- versus four-session JC format using two objective tests: Critical Appraisal Skills Test (CAST) and Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) score. The degree of changes (pre-JC vs. post-JC session) after each format exposure, association of prescores to postscores, and correlation between the CAST and PICO scores were discerned. CAST score was higher in the four-session format ( P = 0.03), whereas PICO score increased in the single-session format of JC ( P = 0.03). Also, the change in CAST score was higher in the four-session versus single-session JC format ( P = 0.04). We conclude that a four-session format of JC is more effective in augmenting critical appraisal skills of postgraduate students, whereas a single session is sufficient for improving factual knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Students find cardiovascular physiology challenging. Misunderstandings can be due to the nature of the subject, the way it is taught, and prior knowledge, which impede learning of new concepts. Some misunderstood concepts can be corrected with teaching (i.e., preconceptions), whereas others are resistant to instruction (i.e., misconceptions). A set of questions, specifically created by a panel of physiology experts to probe difficult cardiovascular concepts, was used to identify preconceptions, misconceptions, and the effect of education level on question performance. The introductory cardiovascular lecture used in this study was created based on these questions. In-class polling of medical students’ ( n = 736) performance was performed using the Turning-Point clicker response system during lecture instruction. Results were compared with published data from undergraduates ( n = 1,076) who completed the same questions but without prior instruction. To our knowledge, there have been no studies directly comparing performance using the same instrument and large numbers of undergraduate and medical students. A higher education level was associated with increased performance (preconceptions), whereas several concepts resistant to instruction (misconceptions) were identified. Findings suggest that prior knowledge interfered with the acquisition of medical knowledge. Based on these results, potential causes for these misconceptions and remedial teaching suggestions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In higher education, it is a great challenge for instructors to teach international medical students (IMSs) efficiently. These students usually have different learning obstacles and learning style preferences from domestic students. Thus it is necessary to use teaching modalities targeting the specific characteristics of IMSs. Accordingly, we have developed a teaching modality composed of classical teacher-centered approach (TCA), enriched with components of student-centered approach (SCA) and online interactions targeting the learning characteristics of IMSs, which we defined as TESOT (an acronym made of the underlined words' initials). Aside from the online interactions that provide both answers to questions raised by students and guidance throughout a course, this modality contains additional in-classroom components (i.e., pre-lecture quiz, student-led summary, and post-lecture quiz). The effectiveness of this modality was tested in the nervous system module of the Physiology course for IMSs. The final exam scores in the nervous system module in the year taught with TESOT were higher than those earned by students taught with a classical TCA modality in preceding 2 yr. The improvement of teaching effectiveness is attributable to increasing communication, bridging course contexts, and meeting diverse learning style preferences. These results indicate that TESOT as an effective teaching modality is useful for enhancing efficiency of teaching IMSs.",

    "abstract": "Although traditional didactic lecturing is the principal instructional approach used in numerous medical schools, this method has several limitations. Experiential learning approaches place students in the center of the learning process and creates a positive and supportive classroom learning environment. In this article, we propose an active pedagogical approach for teaching a basic physiology concept, namely, neuromuscular transmission (NMT), and we evaluate the effectiveness of this approach among undergraduate medical students. One-hundred forty-two undergraduate medical students were involved in this study ( cohort A, n = 62; cohort B, n = 80). Cohort A received a didactic lecture on NMT and subsequently tested their knowledge of the topic via test 1, after which their perceptions of didactic lectures were recorded. The students were then asked to participate in a touch-and-go (TAG) active-learning session regarding NMT, after which their learning was subsequently tested by taking test 2. Their perceptions about the TAG game were also recorded. Students in cohort B were first administered test 1 regarding NMT. Then, they were asked to attend a didactic lecture blended with a TAG active-learning session, after which test 2 was administered, and their perceptions were recorded. Both the didactic lecture and active learning sessions facilitated student learning regarding the concepts involved in NMT. A comparison of the lecture followed by the game used in cohort A with the game blended lecture used in cohort B revealed no significant differences. However, both formats created a positive influence on students’ interest in learning the concept, and the students preferred active learning over didactic sessions alone.",

    "abstract": "Although there is increased uptake of active learning approaches in especially developed countries, this is still lagging within the African context. The current study therefore focused on the implementation of group learning at Stellenbosch University, with several modifications versus our earlier, pilot study. Students freely formed small groups at the start of a 5-wk cardiovascular physiology lecture series and were apportioned three separate assignments to complete over this period. This included three in-class group-learning sessions, while students also completed group work outside class times. The active learning element was embedded within a constructive alignment framework. Our data revealed that 75% of the students felt that the in-class sessions was a good use of their time and that they progressively improved their assignment scores, i.e., 67.5 ± 9.3%, 72.4 ± 9.8%, and 76.1 ± 9.5% for the first, second, and final ones, respectively (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the average class score for their final test (68 ± 15.1%) was higher when compared with the average class score (57.5 ± 19.4%) calculated for the previous 3 yr (P < 0.0001). This study revealed two major findings: i.e., 1) students displayed a strong positive response regarding the adoption of in-class collaborative group work, and 2) the introduction of such active learning elements correlated with improved student assignment and test scores. Based on these findings, we propose additional modifications (including a shift to more formative assessments) to ensure even greater success with the roll-out of such active learning elements within the African context.",

    "abstract": "The physiology of respiration is a challenging subject for many medical students. To assist students, we have developed an active learning game that physically places students within a model outlining the respiratory control pathway. Participants were provided with a vodcast describing the physiology of respiratory control and instructed to view this before the activity. Once in the classroom, groups of students sat at tables marked to represent components of the respiratory control pathway (e.g., apneustic center, diaphragm etc.). Tables were connected with green and red ropes indicating excitatory or inhibitory effects, respectively. Students were presented with various scenarios (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis) and asked to predict and illustrate the scenario's effect on subsequent steps in the respiratory pathway by waving the appropriate connecting rope. The next table would continue the pattern to simulate the collective physiological adaptation of the respiratory pathway. Thirty first-year medical students participated in this study. Following the activity, 25 out of the 30 participants completed an optional survey. The survey aimed to assess the benefits of adding this activity to our first-year medical curriculum to build a foundational understanding of the physiology of respiration. Responses were overwhelmingly favorable, and participants reported that playing the game significantly improved their perceived understanding of the physiology of respiratory control. All but one of the participants recommended using the activity in future classes. Because the small size of the study group may limit generalizability, future larger scale studies are planned.",

That approach considers the variation of the data, and specifically the variation between samples, which is related to the presence of different levels of the factor related to a group. The variation between samples is contrasted with the residual variation, found within the samples. We consider the possibility that the groups could be different, because of the different conditions of a factor. This is as far as the analysis can extend: the consideration is restricted to groups characterized by the different category of the factor being considered. For example, in Figure 1A, the factor we had considered in our samples of jumping frogs is the State from which they were sampled. The data were categorized according to the geographic origin of the frogs. However, in many biological experiments, the factor considered may not be just a simple category, but it may be expressed in terms of order, or even as a continuous variable. If this can be done, then other helpful and powerful methods of statistical analysis can be used.Fig. 1.A: the original samples, categorized by US State. B: the samples from each State, ordered by longitude. C: the individual frog jump lengths, related to the longitude of where the frog was found.Download figureDownload PowerPointRanked tests.If the categories can be ranked, then tests can exploit this ranking. These include the Mann-Whitney (also known as the Wilcoxon rank sum) test, and Kendall's and Spearman's rank correlation tests, and simple examples are clearly described by Moses and colleagues (7). By arranging the levels in a way that allows a factor to be logically graded (such as either not present, mild, moderate, or severe) ordered levels are related to the measurements. For example, in Figure 1B we have ranked the geographic origin from east to west, and there appears to be a possible association.Quantitative variables.In many other experiments, we use quantitative variables rather than ranked categories, and relate the values observed in one quantitative variable to another associated quantitative variable. The linkage, or association, between them can be mathematically determined by their correlation. When correlation is calculated, the strength of the association indicates how much of the variation of the two features occurs in the ‘same direction'. A simple example might be body weight and height: if the correlation between these measures in a sample of adult females were perfect the strength of the association, indicated by the correlation coefficient, would be 1, indicating that these two factors are exactly linked. The correlation coefficient can range from −1 (a perfect inverse association) to 1 (a perfect positive association). The mathematics of correlation are explained by Curran-Everett (2).When using correlation procedures, a simple plot should be made and inspected first. In biology, truly linear associations are probably rare. Many interactions between factors may tend to a maximum, some are reciprocal, others could be logarithmic; forcing a straight line through such relationships is possible but illogical. The common correlation method used, Pearson's method, is only valid if at least one and preferably both of the measures are normally distributed. A dot plot of the association may show the distribution and prevent inappropriate use of the method. A dot plot can also prevent illogical conclusions. Figure 2 shows some of the patterns that may be found.Fig. 2.The variety of possible associations between two measures. A: positive correlation. B: correlation where the variation is not uniform: a common pattern in biological variables. C: a plot where there is little variation in one measure: no correlation. D: scattered values: no correlation. E: if an association is not linear, it may have no linear correlation. F: some associations may have a linear correlation, but are better described in other ways. G: a dot plot may reveal unexpected complex associations. H: a correlation can be caused by a few outlying values that have a strong effect.Download figureDownload PowerPointCorrelation is generally only applicable if the variation in the measurements is uniform. Example B in Figure 2 shows a pattern that is not uncommon in biology, where the variability of the measures gets greater as the values increase. This feature (heteroscedascity) makes simple analysis unwise, although there are means to correct for it. In some instances (E and F), a straight line is not the most appropriate way to describe the link; in some the relationship may be more complex (two different groups in panel G); and in others, the correlation may be the result of outlying points (panel H) that deserve careful consideration before conclusions are drawn.Correlation is very frequently abused. If many variables are measured, and correlations sought, then some of them–often unrelated–will correlate, by chance. In particular, possibly false associations may be drawn from a time series, such as changes in the prevalence of obesity and the manufacture of fashion clothing over a number of years. A correlation may result from data that are biased: if for example we only measured the frogs we could catch easily, we might not appreciate that Ohio frogs were even better jumpers. We have already considered how the effects of another factor such as sex (a covariate) could skew the measurements: finding young female frogs and older males could cause a false association. Correlation is not necessarily the best or only means to assess agreement between two methods of measurement. Mathematical linkage between two measurements causes spurious correlation (1). Obvious links could be a change in weight in relation to starting weight, or relating a part to the whole. Others are more subtle: for example, when oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption are both calculated using the same measure of cardiac output and of arterial oxygen content, this generates a false association (8).'Equal' association in two measures, assessed by correlation, is not often sought in experimental situations. More often in the laboratory, measurements are considered to be affected by a factor that is not only quantifiable, but one that can be adjusted or pre-determined, rather than randomly occurring. For this type of analysis, linear regression is often used. This should be approached as a separate statistical method from correlation, although it is often considered in the same chapter of the statistical textbooks.Linear regression.What is linear regression? When we considered analysis of variance, we attributed some of the variation in a measurement to factors that were classified as categories: the State where the frog was found, for example. In the theory of regression analysis, variation is attributed not to a specific category, but to an input factor that varies continuously. It aims to describe mathematically the association between the measured value and this input factor. Variation in the ‘dependent' measure is explained in part by the magnitude of this input value, which is termed the ‘independent' variable. In a simple regression analysis, the ‘% explained' is given by the square of the regression coefficient, R2, expressed as a percentage. Thus if R2 were 0.7, in a simple regression analysis we can say that 70% of the variation in the dependent values is attributable to the independent value. This approach can be extended by considering several factors that could ‘explain' the variation.In our example, we wish to explore the association between origin and jumping ability. We could express the origin of the frogs in terms of the longitude of where they were found. We choose to use longitude as a convenient continuous variable to ‘quantify' origin. (Strictly speaking, this violates one of the assumptions of regression, which is that the independent variable should be normally distributed. In our example we have data from three States, which do not meet this assumption, as can be seen from the data plotted in Figure 1C, showing the jump length of frogs found at different longitudes.) We wish to derive what association there is between jump length and the longitude that the frog comes from, so that we may attribute some of the variation in jump length to this factor. A general, simple, equation can be based on the classic equation for a straight line: Y=mX+bIf the independent variable is X, and the dependent variable is Y, then Dependent variable=m(Independent variable)+b And in our example Jump length=m(Longitude)+b The constants m and b are calculated to minimize the differences between the observed jumps and the jumps that would be predicted, at that longitude. Indeed, the equation allows us to predict, to some extent, the value of the dependent variable, for a given value of the independent variable. Extrapolation is unwise: in our example, the relationship is only likely to apply between Ohio and California in the USA, not least because there are few frogs to be found in the Pacific Ocean. The mathematical background of regression is described by Curran-Everett (3).One approach, often used in preliminary analysis, is to average the jumps from each State (as is done in ANOVA). ANOVA showed us that there was indeed a difference between Ohio and the other States. However, this approach neglects what we consider an important feature of the data, which is the ‘variation' in origin, and which is present in the samples for each State. In Figure 3A we show the calculated linear regression line with the 95% confidence limits of this line.Fig. 3.A: the linear regression relationship, and 95% confidence limits around the line, for jump length related to longitude. B: if the association is considered within each State, a significant relationship is not found in two States (the range of longitude is insufficient).Download figureDownload PowerPointIt is unlikely that we would have obtained these data if there were no difference between the distances that the frogs jumped, in relation to their longitude of origin. However, the R2 value is small: although 12% of the variation in jump length can be explained by longitude, there remains a lot of variation at each longitude that cannot be attributed to this factor.One of the reasons that we were able to pick out this small signal (longitude has a small effect) is that we used large samples, and travelled far to collect our frogs. A smaller sample, or a sample which had less variation in longitude might not have shown this effect. Figure 3B shows that using the same analysis within a single State, even a large one like Texas, fails to detect this effect. Clearly, caution is needed when interpreting such data: is it biologically plausible that longitude is important? Maybe it's the great divide, or genes, or rainfall, or latitude; correlation and regression do not automatically indicate cause and effect. Guidelines in reporting these tests are available (5).The form of linear regression analysis we have just applied is almost universal, but is not always appropriate. Correlation considers variation in both measures by relating the pair of values in each set to their distance from the mean of the measures (Figure 4A). However, linear regression generally only considers variation in the dependent variable (plotted on the Y axis) and fits a line to minimize the difference between (in our example) jump length observed and jump length predicted (Figure 4B). With global positioning satellites, it may be justifiable to believe that we can estimate longitude exactly enough, but what if we had been using a sextant and a chronometer to measure longitude? We would then be less certain of the accuracy of longitude, and should use analysis in which both X and Y values can be considered to be variable. Unfortunately, biological signals may vary in both values, particularly if measurements are being compared. In such circumstances an alternative means of linear regression should be used (6).Fig. 4.A: correlation considers variation in both measures, away from the mean values. B: the commonly used linear regression procedure does not allow for uncertainty in the independent variable. C: if both measures have measurement error, then more complex analysis is needed.Download figureDownload PowerPointDISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSG.B.D. and S.L.V. prepared figures; G.B.D. and S.L.V. drafted manuscript; G.B.D. and S.L.V. edited and revised manuscript; G.B.D. and S.L.V. approved final version of manuscript.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "This article describes a laboratory protocol for a multiweek project piloted in a new upper-level biology laboratory (BIO 426) using cell culture techniques. Human embryonic kidney-293 cells were used, and several culture media and supplements were identified for students to design their own experiments. Treatments included amino acids, EGF, caffeine, epinephrine, heavy metals, and FBS. Students researched primary literature to determine their experimental variables, made their own solutions, and treated their cells over a period of 2 wk. Before this, a sterile technique laboratory was developed to teach students how to work with the cells and minimize contamination. Students designed their experiments, mixed their solutions, seeded their cells, and treated them with their control and experimental media. Students had the choice of manipulating a number of variables, including incubation times, exposure to treatment media, and temperature. At the end of the experiment, students observed the effects of their treatment, harvested and dyed their cells, counted relative cell numbers in control and treatment flasks, and determined the ratio of living to dead cells using a hemocytometer. At the conclusion of the experiment, students presented their findings in a poster presentation. This laboratory can be expanded or adapted to include additional cell lines and treatments. The ability to design and implement their own experiments has been shown to increase student engagement in the biology-related laboratory activities as well as develop the critical thinking skills needed for independent research.",

Australas Ann Med 16: 20-32, 1967) provides a simple and reproducible approach for studying the chemical control of breathing. It has been widely used since the modifications made by Duffin and coworkers. Our use of a rebreathing laboratory to challenge undergraduate science students to investigate the control of breathing provided 8 yr of student-generated data for comparison with the literature. Students (age: 19-22 yr, Research Ethics Board approval) rebreathed from a bag containing 5% CO2 and 95% O2 (to suppress the peripheral chemoreflex to hypoxia). Rebreathing was performed, and ventilation measured, after hyperventilation to deplete tissue CO2 stores and enable the detection of the central chemoreflex threshold. We analyzed 43 data sets, of which 10 were rejected for technical reasons. The mean threshold and ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 were 43.3 ± 3.8 mmHg and 4.60 ± 3.04 l·min(-1)·mmHg(-1) (means ± SD), respectively. Threshold values were normally distributed, whereas sensitivity was skewed to the left. Both mean values agreed well with those in the literature. We conclude that the modified rebreathing protocol is a robust method for undergraduate investigation of the chemical control of breathing.",

    "abstract": "This laboratory exercise demonstrates fundamental principles of mammalian locomotion. It provides opportunities to interrogate aspects of locomotion from biomechanics to energetics to body size scaling. It has the added benefit of having results with robust signal to noise so that students will have success even if not \"meticulous\" in attention to detail. First, using respirometry, students measure the energetic cost of hopping at a \"preferred\" hop frequency. This is followed by hopping at an imposed frequency half of the preferred. By measuring the O2 uptake and work done with each hop, students calculate mechanical efficiency. Lessons learned from this laboratory include 1) that the metabolic cost per hop at half of the preferred frequency is nearly double the cost at the preferred frequency; 2) that when a person is forced to hop at half of their preferred frequency, the mechanical efficiency is nearly that predicted for muscle but is much higher at the preferred frequency; 3) that the preferred hop frequency is strongly body size dependent; and 4) that the hop frequency of a human is nearly identical to the galloping frequency predicted for a quadruped of our size. Together, these exercises demonstrate that humans store and recover elastic recoil potential energy when hopping but that energetic savings are highly frequency dependent. This stride frequency is dependent on body size such that frequency is likely chosen to maximize this function. Finally, by requiring students to make quantitative solutions using appropriate units and dimensions of the physical variables, these exercises sharpen analytic and quantitative skills.",

With the development of the pressure suit needed for high-altitude and space flight during the 1950s, technicians had developed the means for urine collection. However, cultural mores, combined with a lack of interagency communication, and the technical difficulties of spaceflight made human waste collection a difficult task. Despite the difficulties, technicians at NASA created a successful urine collection device that John Glenn wore on the first Mercury orbital flight on February 20, 1962. With minor modifications, male astronauts used this system to collect urine until the Space Shuttle program. John Glenn's urine collection device is at the National Air and Space Museum and has been on view to the public since 1976.",

He was the first to conceive that the closure of the heart valves depends not on a static back pressure nor upon eddies but is primarily the consequence of the decelerated systolic efflux. This pioneer research of Ceradini was first published in German in 1872 ( 4 ). The purpose of the present report is to revisit Ceradini's pioneering experiments and his interpretation of heart valve closure, which remains as true as it was in 1872.",

From a teaching point of view, a subsequent challenge is to develop innovative strategies to train new staff members in creative thinking, which is the most complex and abstract skill in the cognitive domain according to Bloom's revised taxonomy. In this sense, current technological and digital advances offer new possibilities in the field of education. Computer simulation and biological experiments can be used together as a combined tool for teaching and learning sometimes complex physiological and biophysical concepts. Moreover, creativity can be thought of as a social process that relies on interactions among staff members. In this regard, the acquisition of cognitive abilities coexists with the attainment of other skills from psychomotor and affective domains. Such dynamism in teaching and learning stimulates teamwork and encourages the integration of members of the working group. A practical example, based on the teaching of biophysical subjects such as osmosis, solute transport, and membrane permeability, which are crucial in understanding the physiological concept of homeostasis, is presented.",

Performing PhUn Week at an Australian private primary school during a family vacation in 2014 enabled me to receive a fellowship to return the following year for further implementation. To set up the outreach, I contacted the assistant principal of a public primary school, and she connected me with the physical education (PE) teacher. Together, the PE teacher and I planned the event. Over the course of 2 days, I taught eight classes, a total of 176 K-12 students. I started each lesson by explaining the role of a physiologist. The scientific method was described and explained. A hypothesis, \"Exercise increases heart rate,\" was designed and tested. The students measured their heart rates, exercised, and measured their heart rates again. After data collection, results were reported, and the students all agreed that their hypothesis was supported. We then discussed heart function and why heart rate increases with exercise. The students then performed a pedometer challenge, where they estimated the number of steps during walking, running, and kangaroo hopping. They enjoyed testing their predictions and repeated these experiments several times. The students then made suggestions of ways they could continue this lesson outside of school. This first report of an international PhUn week confirmed that these events form partnerships among educators and inspire K-12 students to think about becoming scientists.",

    "abstract": "SIMULATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL processes is a powerful tool to help students integrate and apply the knowledge they gained during traditional forms of teaching (e.g., lectures, textbooks).Several physiology simulation packages are commercially available or custom made and are usually tailored to specific processes or systems.Typical commercial examples are, e.g., SimHeart, SimVessel, SimNerv, SimMuscle, SimNeuron (2), SimBioSys Physiology Laboratories (3); noncommercial examples include ECGSIM (11) and CircAdapt (8).They are typically student proof, which makes them very suitable as a teaching tool.Many of the software packages available require software to be installed locally and administration-intense planning to deploy and use them in university computer classes.Because locally installed software requires specific operating systems and is usually licensed, installation on the devices of students is not always an option.The constraint of most packages is that it holds only one or a limited number of simulated model systems.The model itself, or the parameters that can be modulated by students, is generally not under control of the teacher.From the research field of physiology, a large source of more than 600 of highly relevant, but complex models from various disciplines, encoded in the CellML format ( 6) is freely available (7).CellML is an open standard based on the XML markup language and was developed by the Auckland Bioengineering Institute at the University of Auckland (1).The flexibility of these models and tools is extremely useful for researchers, but a serious drawback for use in a teaching context.The models are usually complex, and it is difficult for students to understand all the different parameters of a model and know to what extent a specific parameter can be altered without destabilizing the model.Furthermore, with the available software tools, they are not easy to set up and deploy for teaching purposes.We, therefore, aimed to combine the best of both the teaching and research simulation worlds and have created a web-based, versatile simulation platform called \"eSolv.\"It can be used on any device, and allows teachers to load any CellML model and define exactly which model parameters are available",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness and perception of the in-class activity. After completion of a lecture on the topic of cell cycle regulation, students completed a 10-question multiple-choice quiz before and after engaging in the activity. The activity involved reading of a headline news article published by ScienceDaily.com entitled \"One Gene Lost Equals One limb Regained.\" The name of the gene was deleted from the article and, thus, the end goal of the activity was to determine the gene of interest by the description in the story. The activity included compiling a list of all potential gene candidates before sufficient information was given to identify the gene of interest (p21). A survey was completed to determine student perceptions of the activity. Quiz scores improved by an average of 20% after the activity (40.1 ± 1.95 vs. 59.9 ± 2.14,P< 0.0001,n= 96). Students enjoyed the activity, found the news article interesting, and believed that the activity improved their understanding of cell cycle regulation. The majority of students agreed that the in-class activity piqued their interest for learning the subject matter and also agreed that if they understand a concept during class, they are more likely to want to study that concept outside of class. In conclusion, the activity improved in-class understanding and enhanced interest in cell cycle regulation.",

Groups of two to three students planned a series of experiments using one of three cultured cell lines that required them to 1) learn to culture cells; 2) determine treatment conditions, including apoptotic agent solubility and concentration ranges that had been reported in the literature; 3) choose two methods to validate/quantify apoptotic capacity of the reagent; and 4) attempt to \"rescue\" cells from undergoing apoptosis using one of several available compounds/methods. In essence, given some reagent and equipment constraints, students designed an independent experiment to highlight the effects of different apoptotic agents on cells in culture. Students presented their experimental designs as in a laboratory group meeting and their final findings as a classroom \"symposium.\" This exercise can be adapted to many different types of laboratories with greater or lesser equipment and instrumentation constraints, incorporates several core cell physiology methods, and encourages key experimental design and critical thinking components of independent research.",

Yet answers to the questions “What is systems biology?” and “What constitutes a systems biology approach in 2016?” are somewhat more elusive. This seems to be due largely to the diversity of disciplines involved and the varying emphasis placed on the computational modeling and experimental aspects of systems biology. As such, the education of systems biology would benefit from multidisciplinary collaboration with both instructors and students from a range of disciplines within the same course. This essay is the personal reflection of a graduate student trying to get an introductory overview of the field of systems biology and some thoughts about effective education of systems biology.",

Gamblegrams, named after physician James L. Gamble, are bar diagrams displaying the relative abundance of extracellular anions and cations and are commonly used in the analysis of acid-base disorders. The Edelman equation represents the physiological variables that determine plasma sodium concentration, namely, total body sodium mass, total body potassium mass, and total body water volume. Edelman Gamblegrams inspired by traditional Gamblegrams but using the components of the Edelman equation, visually demonstrate how sodium, potassium, and water contribute to plasma sodium concentration under normal and pathological conditions. Scenarios that lead to hypotonic hyponatremia and hypernatremia in Edelman Gamblegrams are also discussed. Furthermore, examples of how these visual aids can enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of dysnatremias are also presented. Overall, the use of Edelman Gamblegrams has the potential to improve comprehension and retention of concepts related to water/plasma tonicity homeostasis.",

In postlaboratory evaluations, undergraduate introductory neuroscience students indicated that they appreciated the opportunity to record electrical activity from their own bodies. The students found the exercise enjoyable, believed that they had learned from it, and indicated that it should be a regular part of the course.

    "abstract": "We have developed a simple laboratory exercise that uses an inexpensive dialysis membrane (molecular weight cutoff = 100) to illustrate the generation of membrane potentials (Vm) across plasma membranes of animal cells. A piece of membrane approximately 2.0 cm2 is mounted in an Ussing-like chamber. One chamber half is designated cytosol and the other half external. Chamber sidedness helps students relate their findings to those of real cells. As in real cells, outward directed K+ concentration gradients [high cytosolic K+ concentration ([K+]c) and low extracellular K+ concentration] generate cytosol electrically negative Vm with a slope of approximately -45 mV/decade change in [K+]c. The polarity of Vm reflects the outward flow of potassium ions because flow of the larger counterion, H2PO4-, is restricted to the pores in the membrane. A slope less than Nernstian (&lt;59 mV/decade) suggests that the membrane is slightly permeable to H2PO4-. Importantly, this facilitates teaching the use of the Nernst equation to quantify the relationship between ion concentration ratios across membranes and magnitude of Vm. For example, students use their data and calculate a permeability ratio PK/PH2PO4 that corresponds to a slope of approximately 24% less than Nernstian. This calculation shows that Nernstian slopes are achieved only when permeability to the counterion is zero. Finally, students use the concept of membrane capacitance to calculate the number of ions that cross the membrane. They learn where these ions are located and why the bulk solutions conform to the principle of electroneutrality.",

The HR response to progressive increases or decreases in blood pressure is recorded, and a baroreflex curve is generated by plotting mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) vs. HR. Observation of altered CO allows for discussion of the relationship between MAP, CO, HR, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance. Administration of arginine vasopressin demonstrates the ability of this hormone to alter the sensitivity of the baroreflex. Throughout the demonstration, students answer questions from a handout about general cardiovascular physiology, specific pathways of agonists, and the baroreflex system, encouraging group and individual critical analysis of the results.

Medical students usually read the textbooks but not the literature that contain the original research articles and reviews. Here, we examined the gap between the current textbooks and literature with the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells as an example. A total of 70 textbooks that were published for medical education during the last 10 yr was examined. The literature has been searched mainly from the Internet. We found that most textbooks (59 of 70) fail to mention the ECL cells. Due to the lack of information on the ECL cells, the mechanisms behind gastric acid secretion are described variously from book to book. However, up to the year 2000, 574 research articles and reviews have been published on the various aspects of the ECL cells. The role of the ECL cells in the regulation of the acid secretion has been well demonstrated for more than 20 years. The fact that the textbooks are out of date cannot be explained by the time required to write and publish them. Therefore, we question whether or not the current textbooks are good enough for physiology education and suggest both teachers and students read not only the textbooks, but also utilize the other sources such as the Internet to find and fill the gaps between the textbooks and literature. This is one of the approaches of problem-based learning.",

    "abstract": "We used the following multiple-choice question after a series of lectures in cardiovascular physiology in the first year of an undergraduate medical curriculum ( n = 66) to assess whether students had understood the neural regulation of cardiovascular function. In health, neural cardiovascular mechanisms are geared toward maintaining A) cardiac output, B) total peripheral resistance (TPR), C) arterial blood pressure (BP), D) tissue blood flow. The same question was administered to 275 graduates preparing for postgraduate exams (but not following the same series of lectures as the undergraduates). In both groups, we found a large proportion of incorrect answers (70% in undergraduates and 85% in graduates) and sorted this out by offering a step-by-step explanation and two examples and found it successful: 1) What happens to BP and heart rate (HR) when a person loses 500 ml of blood (∼10% of blood volume) in one minute? 2) What happens to your BP and HR as you get out of bed after a night’s sleep? Flow = perfusion pressure/resistance to flow; cardiac output = BP/TPR; BP = cardiac output × TPR = [stroke volume (SV) × HR] × TPR. In both examples, BP decreases and is rapidly brought into the normal range by the arterial baroreflex mechanism. TBF is regulated chiefly by varying local vascular resistance (autoregulation). In summary, the ultimate goal of all neural cardiovascular reflex mechanisms is to maintain arterial BP within a range in which tissues can regulate their own blood flows. Cardiovascular control during exercise was used as an example to emphasize these facts. A discussion of this kind triggered interest in the minds of students and graduates, helping them get rid of a major misconception in about 20–40 minutes.",

In addition to a characterization of the effects of ACTH on aldosterone regulation, this study is useful for discussing the basic principles of negative feedback pathways of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This study also provides examples of early bioassay techniques for the detection of angiotensin II and of the importance of quantitative measurements when investigating physiological responses.

    "abstract": "Capillary filtration is a key area in the understanding of cardiovascular function and has both physiological and pathophysiological relevance in nearly every organ system. This article describes how classic papers in the Legacy collection of American Physiological Society publications can be used in a teaching symposium exploring the evidence supporting current concepts of capillary fluid exchange. Individual students are given papers to read, edit, and present to the class. The appropriate selection and sequencing of these papers allows the development of important physiological concepts to be tracked. A series of papers concerned with capillary filtration is suggested, and the contribution of each to the developing story is outlined. This approach allows students to develop critical and presentation skills and provides them with a case study of the scientific method as it is applied to physiology as well as establishing an appropriate knowledge base concerning the role of hydrostatic and oncotic forces in capillary fluid exchange. Relevant teaching points are explored further using questions based on a figure from one of the three classic papers used: \"Microinjection studies of capillary permeability: II. The relationship between capillary pressure and the rate at which fluid passes through the walls of single capillaries,\" by E. M. Landis (Am J Physiol 82: 217-238, 1927).",

    "abstract": "In this article, a practical demonstration suitable for any biology college classroom is presented. With the examples of a complex biological specimen (slug's radula) and a simple reference specimen (electron microscopical grid imprint in gelatin), both of which can be easily prepared, the capabilities of two imaging modes commonly used in optical microscopy are demonstrated. The results obtained under phase contrast (a rather sophisticated method, 1953 Nobel Prize to Zernike) and off-axis illumination (a very simple method) are compared. The off-axis illumination setup is capable of delivering noticeably better microscopic images of these two particular specimens, yet it can be easily assembled in a laboratory classroom. The outcome of such a demonstration is expected to be the realization on the part of the students that one needs to carefully choose the apparatus to address a given biological problem, with the “bottom line” being that a more complex one may not necessarily yield better results. An attempt to explain this “paradox” is presented, in the particular case presented here, partly from the physiology of vision perspective (the shape-from-shading problem). The overall aim of the present article is to induce in students critical thinking about the capabilities of a laboratory equipment in general and about data interpretation.",

The physiology record books also contain a set of questions to be answered by the students. Faculty members and students had indicated that responding to these questions did not serve the intended purpose of being an effective learning tool. The purpose of this study was to obtain the views of the medical students and faculty members at our institution concerning the usefulness of responding to the questions and to gather suggestions for possible improvement. Data were collected through focus groups and questionnaires to first-year medical students and faculty members in physiology and were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods. The students and faculty members viewed the physiology record books as a potentially useful learning aid, but lack of time led the students to write the answers without understanding the topic rather than generating their own responses to the questions. Faculty members and students recommended that the students should write the responses to the questions on site during the practical classes, using relevant on-site resources and interacting with faculty members. The findings of the present study may be of value to other medical colleges in India and outside India with modifications based on their specific needs to improve the effectiveness of physiology record books as a learning tool.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to evaluate the applicability of artisanal simulators to teach veterinary and medical students the ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy using a tru-cut needle. The artisanal simulators consisted of bovine liver between two layers of commercially available grape gelatin. Students were paired, with one doing the biopsy and the other the ultrasound guidance. After performing the biopsies, each student answered a questionnaire with close-ended questions using a visual analog scale. The evaluated items were realism of the model, liver scanning, procedure instructions, biopsy feasibility, tru-cut needle handling, technique learning, and confidence to perform in vivo procedures. Items that received a score of 7 or higher were considered strong items; items with a score between 5 and 6.9 were classified as average items; and items with a score of 5 or lower were considered weak items. The answers to all questions had an average score of 7 or higher, suggesting that the simulator was classified as strong for all of the evaluated items. Answers to question 7 suggested that some of the students did not develop confidence to perform a tru-cut biopsy on a patient. Students evaluated the artisanal simulator as a strong method to be used in ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy with a tru-cut needle. Additionally, the model presented a low cost of production and was proven accurate to teach biopsy skills in health professional schools dealing with veterinary or human medicine.",

    "abstract": "Poor academic performance from extensive social media usage appears to be due to students' inability to multitask between distractions and academic work. However, the degree to which visually distracted students can acquire lecture information presented aurally is unknown. This study examined the ability of students visually distracted by social media to acquire information presented during a voice-over PowerPoint lecture, and to compare performance on examination questions derived from information presented aurally vs. that presented visually. Students ( n = 20) listened to a 42-min cardiovascular pathophysiology lecture containing embedded cartoons while taking notes. The experimental group ( n = 10) was visually, but not aurally, distracted by social media during times when cartoon information was presented, ~40% of total lecture time. Overall performance among distracted students on a follow-up, open-note quiz was 30% poorer than that for controls ( P < 0.001). When the modality of presentation (visual vs. aural) was compared, performance decreased on examination questions from information presented visually. However, performance on questions from information presented aurally was similar to that of controls. Our findings suggest the ability to acquire information during lecture may vary, depending on the degree of competition between the modalities of the distraction and the lecture presentation. Within the context of current literature, our findings also suggest that timing of the distraction relative to delivery of material examined affects performance more than total distraction time. Therefore, when delivering lectures, instructors should incorporate organizational cues and active learning strategies that assist students in maintaining focus and acquiring relevant information.",

    "abstract": "Sculpting representations of human organs out of modeling clay is an acknowledged method of teaching anatomical structures. Because of its potential to provide detailed spatial information, stereoscopic imagery can be understood to function as a suitable template for such sculpting tasks. Currently, it is unknown whether the advantages of stereoscopic images for modeling structures result from enhanced depth impression alone, or whether task performance is impacted by factors such as situational intrinsic motivation and perceived competence while sculpting a human organ using stereoscopic imagery as template. To clarify these queries, 35 eighth-grade students constructed a representation of the nasal cavity consisting of modeling clay. After the working phase, their situational intrinsic motivation and their perceived competence were assessed by a paper-and-pencil test and then analyzed, as was the elaboration of the sculpted representations. A control group with 38 students working with nonstereoscopic visualizations functioned as a counterpart. Stereoscopic imagery outperformed nonstereoscopic imagery concerning the accuracy in elaborating structures within the representations. However, there was no difference between situational intrinsic motivation and perceived competence in the context of using the digital template for forming the representations. Within the cohort working with nonstereoscopic imagery, situational intrinsic motivation was correlated with task performance. In contrast, within the cohort working with stereoscopic imagery, there was no relation concerning this. The findings show that depth impression due to stereoscopic imagery can be utilized to construct template-close representations, independently of situational feelings. This independence from situational sensitivities indicates that low situational intrinsic motivation will not condemn students to poor task performance.",

To explore how best to integrate physiology teaching in our Thai medical curriculum, we investigated relationships between student's academic performance, their attitude, self-evaluated knowledge, and proportion of physiology taught in an organ-system integrated block. We organized 13 physiology laboratory classes, during which students self-rated attitude and knowledge. Academic performance was measured by formative and summative assessments. One hundred thirty-six participants were categorized into most proactive (Most PA), more proactive (More PA), less proactive (Less PA), and least proactive (Least PA) attitude groups by self-preparation questionnaire. Eighty participants were categorized into high (HighE), moderate (ModerateE), and low (LowE) self-evaluation rating groups. Mean formatives score in the Most PA group was significantly higher than in the other PA groups (P = 0.003, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). Mean summative score in the Most PA group was significantly higher than the Less PA and the Least PA groups (P = 0.017 and P = 0.015 respectively). There was no significant difference in mean assessment scores among HighE, ModerateE, and LowE groups. Proportion of teaching time dedicated to physiology positively correlated with student attitude (r = 0.84, P = 0.001) and negatively correlated with self-evaluation rating (r = -0.73, P = 0.007). Thai medical students may benefit from a proactive attitude to studying physiology, contrasting with traditional didactic expectations of Thai education. Proportion of teaching time dedicated to physiology does not influence academic performance; therefore, future adjustments to curriculum integration may incorporate classes that facilitate self-directed learning. Future study should explore other influences on learning and assessment performance.",

ELEs enhance student-learning gains, increase career readiness, and provide important networking opportunities. However, students do not often recognize the benefits of ELEs. Reflection is a highly effective tool to articulate learning gains and connect new content with established knowledge. Therefore, senior undergraduate students (n = 23), majoring in biological sciences or biotechnology, wrote required reflective essays about their ELE, in response to an intentionally vague prompt. Qualitative assessment of the reflective essays identified themes present in the reflective essays that typically included descriptions of what students did, with whom they worked, and what they learned during their ELE, but lacked critical analysis or deep reflection about their experience. Differences were also present between different types of ELEs. These results provide a foundation for guiding students to deeper reflection, ultimately resulting in greater benefits from their ELEs. To promote more robust reflection, and, therefore, theoretically enhance learning gains from ELEs, we suggest multiple iterations of reflection, instructor feedback and coaching, and ELE-specific prompts that focus on the placement of ELEs within students' personal and professional trajectory.",

Active learning methodologies, where students play a central role in the learning process, are proving to be more effective and interesting when it comes to acquiring knowledge. Thus we decided to develop an innovative technique for teaching Human Endocrine Physiology, called “Endocrine Circuit.” The circuit consisted of eight stations in which students were asked to organize a scheme with cards to answer a specific question about a gland or tissue with endocrine relevance. The effectiveness of the developed activity was validated through a pretest-posttest design, in which the students had to answer a 10-question test. We found out that, after the Endocrine Circuit application, students showed an improvement in the percentage of correct answers for 7 out of 10 questions contained in the questionnaire ( P ≤ 0.05). In addition, the activity showed positive outcomes regarding student’s engagement in this study, besides showing to be more efficient than the Brazilian traditional theoretical classes.",

However, this advice runs contrary to the habits of university students who sleep late on weekends. Pharmacy students at Duquesne University sit for frequent examinations, typically commencing at 7:30 AM, and they complain about mental fatigue. Here, we tested the central hypothesis that longer sleep durations on both weekdays and weekends are linked to stronger academic performance in men and women. Students in their first professional year were administered three surveys to collect data on sleep habits and factors that might influence sleep, such as roommates, long commute times, and sleep interruptions. Grade point averages (GPAs) were collected from the Dean’s office, with individual permissions from the students. Longer weekend—but not weekday—sleep durations were significantly correlated with higher cumulative GPAs in men and not in women. Women achieved slightly higher cumulative GPAs than men. Students who fell asleep within 15 min of going to bed had higher professional-phase GPAs than those who fell asleep after an hour or more. Our observations cannot establish causal links, but, given the body of prior evidence on the salutary properties of sleep, men may reap more benefit from recovery sleep on weekends. Rather than recommending that students force themselves awake early on weekends in an attempt to maintain a consistent sleep routine, the real-life habits of students should also be given consideration.",

While it is logistically challenging to facilitate students’ conducting their own experiments in the laboratory, allowing students to “fail” in a safe environment could help with the development of problem-solving skills. To allow students a safe place to fail and encourage them to think through a laboratory protocol, online decision trees were created to lead students through protocols and give them timely feedback. The online decision trees present students with a scenario, then students execute a protocol by selecting options that will lead them down different paths and result in various realistic results from their experiments. They receive feedback and instructional tutorials throughout the simulation that are dependent on their choices. The significance of this new resource for student learning is that it allows students to practice their problem-solving skills and gain theoretical knowledge about the purpose of various experimental steps. The purpose of this research study was to evaluate whether online decision trees affected students’ self-efficacy, metacognition, and motivation for completing a wet laboratory. A mixed-methods approach was used; three surveys were administered throughout the academic term. For survey 1, students completed the decision tree and survey before the wet laboratory. For survey 2, students completed the survey before the wet laboratory but completed the decision tree after the wet laboratory. Students’ reported self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation were increased with the administration of the online decision trees before the wet laboratory, but their extrinsic motivation and metacognitive scores were unchanged. For survey 3, students provided written feedback about the impact of the online decision trees, and their responses highlighted the importance of the visual components of the approach.",

    "abstract": "Learning physiology is challenging for students. The nature of the discipline, which includes many complex mechanisms, makes the subject complicated. Furthermore, the length of the textbooks and the usual multiple-choice tests, which prioritize memorizing instead of understanding, tend to discourage the students. Therefore, different pedagogical strategies have been adopted to motivate and facilitate the learning of physiology. In this sense, many pedagogical strategies have been using art as a tool to motivate and induce students to self-learn. Besides, art as a pedagogical tool has also been shown to be important in developing self-assurance, self-pride, as well as the development of critical-thinking skills in the students. Here, we incorporate a new practice of self-directed teaching and learning, which involves artwork interpretation in a physiological context. This extra-classroom activity integrating art and physiology (The PhysioArt Project) improved students’engagement, increasing their interest in the discipline by providing a more creative, pleasurable, and enthusiastic atmosphere for enjoying and learning physiology, which also has contributed to the development of creativity, critical thinking, and students’ self-assurance. Interestingly, the benefits elicited by The PhysioArt Project activities have also helped us to enhance the student-professor relationship, inducing a more humanized education.",

    "abstract": "The history of hunger is a story about natural disasters and wars, but, on the other hand, also about the investigation of evolutionary defense mechanisms concerning quantitative food shortages. The article presents how fasting and the experimental starving oriented the development of physiology, and it is based on a comparative analysis of monographs and articles on starvation in the medical context from library collections and the PubMed database. Over the centuries, doctors have believed that fasting has a beneficial effect on health, and they recommended a restrictive diet during an illness. In the 19th century, the growth of modern physiology was determined by experimental fasting of human subjects and animals. Furthermore, undernourishment and chronic hunger in large populations were recognized as a threat to public health for the first time. During both world wars, depriving civilians of food became a strategy of combat and a method of genocide. The mass nature of war hunger motivated doctors to research the pathophysiology of starvation and refeeding of emaciated people, even in the ghetto or concentration camps. After the Second World War, the invention of the scanning electron microscope enabled systematic studies on the effects of starvation on the human body. As a result, the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the cellular metabolism of cholesterol at the submolecular level were clarified. At the turn of the 21st century, the research on the metabolic response to starvation shed new light on atherogenesis and the link between lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.",

Rather than provide a detailed lecture with key facts, we attempted to outline our approach to teaching integrative cardiovascular physiology to medical students, which includes five major themes. First, focus on questions versus answers and facts. We believe that this offers both the learner and teacher a number of advantages. Second, avoid teaching dogma in the name of clarity (i.e., heavy focus on teaching \"facts\" that have not yet been fully investigated). This is especially important because of the way knowledge evolves over time. Third, include laboratory-based experiences in human integrative physiology. Fourth, provide students with intellectual frameworks versus a list of \"facts\" to serve as a platform for question generation. Finally, focus on the role of integration and regulatory redundancy in physiology and the idea that physiology is a narrative that can help. In this article, we discuss the philosophy behind the themes outlined above and argue that questions, and not answers, are where the action is for both research and education.",

It complements an interview of Dr. Greenleaf sponsored by the American Physiological Society Living History Project found on the American Physiological Society website. Dr. Greenleaf is a \"thought leader\" and internationally renowned physiologist, with extensive contributions in human systems-level environmental physiology. He avoided self-aggrandizement and believed that deeds rather than words define one's legacy. Viewed another way, however, Greenleaf's words define his deeds: 48% of his 185 articles are first author works, which is an unusually high proportion for a scientist of his stature. He found that writing a thorough and thoughtful discussion section often led to novel ideas that drove future research. Beyond Greenleaf's words are the many students, postdocs, and collaborators lucky enough to have worked with him and thus learn and carry on his ways of science. His core principles included the following: avoid research \"fads,\" embrace diversity, be the first subject in your own research, adhere to rules of fiscal responsibility, and respect administrative forces-but never back down from them when you know you are right. Greenleaf's integrity ensured he was usually right. He thrived on the axiom of many successful scientists: avoid falling in love with hypotheses, so that when unexpected findings appear, they arouse curiosity instead of fear. Dr. Greenleaf's legacy will include the John and Carol Greenleaf Award for prolific environmental and exercise-related publication in the Journal of Applied Physiology.",

    "abstract": "Gas exchange in animals is ultimately diffusion based, generally occurring across dedicated respiratory organs. In many aquatic amphibians, however, multiple modes of gas exchange exist, allowing for the partitioning of O 2 uptake and CO 2 excretion between respiratory organs with different efficiencies. For example, due to the physical properties of O 2 being vastly different between air and water phases, the lung and skin play disproportionately important roles in O 2 uptake. Many aquatic frogs are renowned for their cutaneous gas exchange capacity, where often the majority of CO 2 is excreted across the skin. Furthermore, the roles of these gas exchange organs change with the animal's behavior. Under diving conditions, most of the frog's gas exchange needs must be met by the skin. In this article, we describe an interactive undergraduate laboratory that allows a class of students to share equipment while assessing pulmonary and cutaneous respiration in frogs provided with an air/water choice and under enforced dive conditions. Concepts explored in this laboratory exercise include animal energetics, diving reflex, pulmonary and cutaneous gas exchange processes, diffusion-based gas flux, and O 2 debt.",

This article describes an exercise that solidifies learning as students manipulate, using paper models, “transporters” and “electrolytes” in the basolateral and luminal membranes of “nephron cells.” Most important is the opportunity for the students to apply and test their own knowledge related to changes that occur in physiological processes, such as excess of salt or water intake or blood volume alterations, or pathology, such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, among many other applications.Description of the ManipulativeThis study was applied to first-year medical students at the end of renal physiology lectures at Virginia Tech Carilion Medical School. The protocol was granted exempt status by the Virginia Tech Institutional Review Board (IRB no. 14-039). Students working in self-assigned groups of four or five were given packets containing all necessary materials. Figures 1–3 show examples of one cell, some transporters, and plasma used in this initial study. Complete material is available upon request. Each packet included paper diagrams (8.5 × 11 in.) of the major cell types of the nephron (see Fig. 1 for the early proximal tubule). Small pieces of color-coded cardstock were constructed to represent the major transporters and ion channels present within the various epithelial cells of the nephron (see Fig. 2 for examples of some transporters). Strips of grid paper were used to represent several prominent ions, which were color coded to match the transporters. Ions used in the demonstration included Na+, Cl−, K+, HCO3−, water, amino acids, and glucose, where each box of the grid paper represented 10% of the filtered load of the respective ions (Fig. 3).Fig. 1.An example of the paper cells distributed to students. Blank spaces with arrows serve as placeholders for the placement of transporters, which are shown in Fig. 2.Download figureDownload PowerPointFig. 2.An example of some transporters that were cut out and distributed to students for placement along the basolateral and luminal interfaces of the cells of the nephron. Instructors may easily add or subtract transporters based on their educational goals.

The columns representing ions, water, glucose, and amino acids (AA) were cut into strips and distributed to students, with each strip representing 100% of the respective filtered load of that substance. Students were then able to tear the strips apart to represent reabsorption and secretion as they moved through the cells of the nephron in terms of the percentage of filtered load. The paper strips were presented to students as a “plasma sample,” and the remaining pieces at the end of the activity, after students have moved through all of the cells sequentially, was said to be the “urine” produced.Download figureDownload PowerPointOne important benefit of this teaching methodology is the ability to adapt the manipulative to best fit the instructor's learning objectives. Lecturers may add or subtract pieces from the model to best suit their own classroom needs. In the work described here, we did not cover the transport of Mg2+, Ca2+, urea, organic anions, organic cations, carbohydrates, urate, and ammonia, but they can easily be included using the manipulative.Use of the ManipulativePart 1: basics of the nephron manipulative.Initially, groups were asked to place the cell types of the nephron in sequential order, beginning with the early proximal convoluted tubule and ending with cells of the collecting duct. Groups were then challenged to place the pieces representing the various transporters and ion channels present in the tubular epithelium in their correct locations. Correct placement required students to know not only the appropriate region of the nephron (e.g., the early proximal tubule, late proximal tubule, early distal tubule, and collecting duct) but also the correct side of the epithelial cell (i.e., basolateral or lumen interface). This setup allowed students to assess their knowledge of the nephron and provided an opportunity for peer teaching and discussion among students.Students were then asked to move a “plasma sample” (see Fig. 3) consisting of ions, glucose, amino acids, and water through the glomerulus and then through the cells of the nephron sequentially, demonstrating as they move along how the concentrations of various solutes and molecules changed (in terms of approximate percentage of the filtered load in each nephron segment) until the sample reached the collecting duct to be excreted into the bladder and form the “urine.”Once students had arranged the cells, transporters, and electrolytes to their satisfaction, they were debriefed in a large group format on the correct placement with open discussion among students and faculty members. Questions that checked for comprehension and promoted critical thinking were also posed to the large group during the debriefing session. For instance, when discussing the proximal convoluted tubule, students were asked what percentage of HCO3− is reabsorbed (answer: 80–90%). Students were then asked whether or not there is a HCO3− transporter in the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule (answer: no; HCO3− moves indirectly via Na+/H+ exchanger 3).Part 2: application and integration of knowledge.In the second part of the activity, students were asked to select a scenario that they would present to the rest of the class using the nephron model. Examples of scenarios used are shown in Table 1, but this content can be modified based on the instructor's content needs. For our purpose, as a supplement to the first-year medical education curriculum, we attempted to select scenarios that we felt best highlighted the core physiological principals. Students were encouraged to get creative and were allowed to create additional transporters or hormones out of paper as needed to adequately explain their assigned scenario.Table 1. Examples of scenarios students were asked to demonstrate using the modelA person consumes a bag of salty potato chips, causing an increase in plasma osmolarityA patient with hemorrhagic shockA patient with hypertension treated with diureticsA patient with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretionAs an example, one group of students was tasked with explaining syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion to the class and used the model to demonstrate the activation of the V2 receptor by antidiuretic hormone and the subsequent insertion of aquaporins into the apical membrane of principle cells of the collecting duct. Another group discussing hemorrhagic shock decided to draw angiotensin II because they felt it was an essential piece of the scenario that was not included in the initial packet. Each group then presented and described the physiological consequences of their patient scenario, with instructor-led discussion after each presentation.DiscussionStudent feedback immediately after the session was positive and suggested that the activity served as a self-assessment tool that allowed students to gauge their understanding of renal physiology. In a brief postactivity survey, 81% of participants rated the activity as “useful,” “very useful,” or “extremely useful”, and 73% of students found the activity “effective” or “very effective” compared with studying on their own. We intend to further evaluate the model in the upcoming academic year by evaluating student performance on a renal physiology knowledge assessment before and after the manipulative session.One interesting aspect of this model is that the format allowed for the incorporation of all four of the learning styles described in Fleming's revised VARK system (where V is visual, A is auditory, R is reading/writing, and K is kinesthetic) (7). While standard lectures are able to reach visual, aural, and read/write learners to an extent, this hands-on model also incorporates kinesthetic learning styles, which appears to be the most common overall learning preference in studies of medical (10), dental (11), and nursing students (1).The first part of the activity checked for basic knowledge of nephron structure and the second portion, where students applied their knowledge using case scenarios, allowed for an indepth discussion and application to real-world scenarios. This is important because activities that are authentic and applicable to other areas are more highly valued by learners (4). Furthermore, the ability to solve problems and gain an indepth understanding of the underlying concepts will be of more use to students in the long run than any particular piece of factual information (8).A growing body of evidence suggests that students do not retain physiology concepts presented in passive, lecture-based formats (3, 5), suggesting that instructors should implement more active learning into their classrooms. Several active learning techniques have been described for physiology, including neurophysiology (9) and cardiovascular physiology (2). Specific strategies for renal physiology education have also been discussed previously in the literature. Dietz and Stevenson (6) described the successful implementation of active learning in a large medical classroom for renal physiology instruction. They broke students up into small groups and used PowerPoint slides describing medical cases related to renal physiology. TurningPoint clicker questions were then posed to the groups to check for comprehension and encourage class discussion. Through the implementation of such active learning sessions, they were able to reduce renal didactic lecture hours by 25% while enhancing student satisfaction and maintaining student academic performance (6). Here, we describe a different approach to implementing active learning into renal physiology instruction through the use of a manipulative model of the nephron. Our model can be used by itself or to supplement didactic lectures.ConclusionsIn summary, we have developed a nephron manipulative model that is simple and inexpensive to implement. It may be particularly useful in educational settings with limited financial resources that seek to implement small- or large-group active learning sessions. The manipulative also gives instructors a great deal of flexibility in its use. Components can be added or removed to adapt the activity to any given education setting. A variety of different plasma and urine samples may be created to demonstrate how urine laboratory values change with pathological processes. Undergraduate students could focus only on electrolyte movement with or without the transporters. Pharmacy educators could have students use the manipulative to demonstrate the sites of action of various diuretic drugs. Furthermore, the activity can be adapted to different teaching formats. It can be used during a large-group didactic session by the instructor to illustrate key concepts to the entire class or, as it was in our school, as a small-group activity where students were responsible for setting up materials on their own. The manipulative serves as a flexible teaching tool that incorporates multiple learning styles, including kinesthetic learning styles, in an effort to engage students and promote long-term retention of basic and applied nephron physiology concepts.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: Z.C.G. and H.C. performed experiments; Z.C.G. and H.C. analyzed data; Z.C.G. and H.C. interpreted results of experiments; Z.C.G. and H.C. prepared figures; Z.C.G. drafted manuscript; Z.C.G. and H.C. edited and revised manuscript; H.C. conception and design of research; H.C. approved final version of manuscript.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to provide undergraduate medical students at Melaka Manipal Medical College (Manipal Campus), Manipal University, in Karnataka, India, an opportunity to apply their knowledge in cardiovascular concepts to real-life situations. A group activity named “Heart Shots” was implemented for a batch of first-year undergraduate students ( n = 105) at the end of a block (teaching unit). Students were divided into 10 groups each having 10–11 students. They were requested to make a video/PowerPoint presentation about the application of cardiovascular principles to real-life situations. The presentation was required to be of only pictures/photos and no text material, with a maximum duration of 7 min. More than 95% of students considered that the activity helped them to apply their knowledge in cardiovascular concepts to real-life situations and understand the relevance of physiology in medicine and to revise the topic. More than 90% of students agreed that the activity helped them to apply their creativity in improving their knowledge and to establish a link between concepts rather than learning them as isolated facts. Based on the feedback, we conclude that the activity was student centered and that it facilitated learning.",

    "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a useful and powerful tool to study molecular interactions applied to nanomedicine. The aim of the present study was to implement a hands-on atomic AFM course for graduated biosciences and medical students. The course comprises two distinct practical sessions, where students get in touch with the use of an atomic force microscope by performing AFM scanning images of human blood cells and force spectroscopy measurements of the fibrinogen-platelet interaction. Since the beginning of this course, in 2008, the overall rating by the students was 4.7 (out of 5), meaning a good to excellent evaluation. Students were very enthusiastic and produced high-quality AFM images and force spectroscopy data. The implementation of the hands-on AFM course was a success, giving to the students the opportunity of contact with a technique that has a wide variety of applications on the nanomedicine field. In the near future, nanomedicine will have remarkable implications in medicine regarding the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of different diseases. AFM enables students to observe single molecule interactions, enabling the understanding of molecular mechanisms of different physiological and pathological processes at the nanoscale level. Therefore, the introduction of nanomedicine courses in bioscience and medical school curricula is essential.",

    "abstract": "Taste perception was the focus of an undergraduate course in the health sciences that bridged the sciences and humanities. A problem-based learning approach was used to study the biological issues, whereas the cultural transmutations of these molecular mechanisms were explored using a variety of resources (novels, cookbooks, and films). Multiple evaluation procedures were used: problem summaries and problem-solving exercises (tripartite problem-solving exercise) for the problem-based learning component and group tasks and individual exercises for the cultural issues. Self-selected groups chose specific tasks from a prescribed list of options (setting up a journal in molecular gastronomy, developing an electronic tongue, designing a restaurant for synesthetes, organizing a farmers' market, marketing a culinary tour, framing hedonic scales, exploring changing tastes through works of art or recipe books, and crafting beers for space travel). Individual tasks were selected from a menu of options (book reviews, film reviews, conversations, creative writing, and oral exams). A few guest lecturers (wine making, cultural anthropology, film analysis, and nutritional epidemiology) added more flavor. The course was rated highly for its learning value (8.5 ± 1.2, n = 62) and helped students relate biological mechanisms to cultural issues (9.0 ± 0.9, n = 62).",

    "abstract": "From a Cartesian perspective of rational analysis, the electric potential difference across the cell membrane is one of the fundamental concepts for the study of physiology. Unfortunately, undergraduate students often struggle to understand the genesis of this energy gradient, which makes the teaching activity a hard task for the instructor. The topic of bioelectrogenesis encompasses multidisciplinary concepts, involves several mechanisms, and is a dynamic process, i.e., it never turns off during the lifetime of the cell. Therefore, to improve the transmission and acquisition of knowledge in this field, I present an alternative didactic model. The design of the model assumes that it is possible to build, in a series of sequential steps, an assembly of proteins within the membrane of an isolated cell in a simulated electrophysiology experiment. Initially, no proteins are inserted in the membrane and the cell is at a baseline energy state; the extracellular and intracellular fluids are at thermodynamic equilibrium. Students are guided through a sequence of four steps that add key membrane transport proteins to the model cell. The model is simple at the start and becomes progressively more complex, finally producing transmembrane chemical and electrical gradients. I believe that this didactic approach helps instructors with a more efficient tool for the teaching of the mechanisms of resting membrane potential while helping students avoid common difficulties that may be encountered when learning this topic.",

    "abstract": "Student populations are diverse such that different types of learners struggle with traditional didactic instruction. Problem-based learning has existed for several decades, but there is still controversy regarding the optimal mode of instruction to ensure success at all levels of students' past achievement. The present study addressed this problem by dividing students into the following three instructional groups for an upper-level course in animal physiology: traditional lecture-style instruction (LI), guided problem-based instruction (GPBI), and open problem-based instruction (OPBI). Student performance was measured by three summative assessments consisting of 50% multiple-choice questions and 50% short-answer questions as well as a final overall course assessment. The present study also examined how students of different academic achievement histories performed under each instructional method. When student achievement levels were not considered, the effects of instructional methods on student outcomes were modest; OPBI students performed moderately better on short-answer exam questions than both LI and GPBI groups. High-achieving students showed no difference in performance for any of the instructional methods on any metric examined. In students with low-achieving academic histories, OPBI students largely outperformed LI students on all metrics (short-answer exam: P &lt; 0.05, d = 1.865; multiple-choice question exam: P &lt; 0.05, d = 1.166; and final score: P &lt; 0.05, d = 1.265). They also outperformed GPBI students on short-answer exam questions ( P &lt; 0.05, d = 1.109) but not multiple-choice exam questions ( P = 0.071, d = 0.716) or final course outcome ( P = 0.328, d = 0.513). These findings strongly suggest that typically low-achieving students perform at a higher level under OPBI as long as the proper support systems (formative assessment and scaffolding) are provided to encourage student success.",

It is valuable to explore what is taught within this course. The purpose of the present study was to facilitate an understanding of what instructors teach in undergraduate exercise physiology, how it compares with various guidelines, and to continue the conversation regarding what should be taught. A survey was created using course outcomes from the American Society of Exercise Physiologists, National Association for Sport and Physical Education, Ivy's 2007 Quest article, the National Athletic Training Association, the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, and 36 undergraduate exercise physiology course syllabi. The 134-item survey was disseminated to individuals who use exercise physiology: university faculty members, clinical exercise physiologists, researchers, and other practitioners on various exercise physiology lists; 2,009 surveys were sent, and 322 surveys were completed (16% rate of return). There was a high degree of agreement about a lot of important content in undergraduate exercise physiology. Instructors of exercise physiology should focus their curriculum on regulation and homeostasis (including adaptation, fatigue, and recovery), aerobic systems, bioenergetics, muscle physiology, and fitness principles. In addition, attention should be paid to performance and technical skills. In conclusion, it is up to exercise physiologists to ensure quality of knowledge and practice. Doing so will improve the uniformity and quality of practitioners within the various kinesiology/exercise science fields and increase the value of a Kinesiology/Exercise Science degree and set it apart from other healthcare providers and fitness professionals.",

    "abstract": "A specific faculty development program for tutors to teach cross-cultural care in a preclinical gastrointestinal pathophysiology course with weekly longitudinal followup sessions was designed in 2007 and conducted in the same manner over a 6-yr period. Anonymous student evaluations of how “frequently” the course and the tutor were actively teaching cross-cultural care were performed. The statements “This tutor actively teaches culturally competent care” and “Issues of culture and ethnicity were addressed” were significantly improved over baseline 2004 data. These increases were sustained over the 6-yr period. A tutor's overall rating as a teacher was moderately correlated with his/her “frequently” actively teaching cross-cultural care ( r = 0.385, P &lt; 0. 001). Course evaluation scores were excellent and put the course into the group of preclinical courses with the top ratings. Students in the Race in Curriculum Group asked that the program be expanded to other preclinical courses. In conclusion, from 2007 to 2012, a faculty development program for teaching cross-cultural care consistently increased the discussion of cross-cultural care in the tutorial and course over each year beginning with 2007 compared with the baseline year of 2004. Our data suggest that cross-cultural care can be effectively integrated into pathophysiology tutorials and helps improve students' satisfaction and tutors' ratings. Teaching cross-cultural care in a pathophysiology tutorial did not detract from the course's overall evaluations, which remained in the top group over the 6-yr period.",

Hubbard and replicated part of his original experiment during our discussion of gastric secretions.Specifically, Hubbard and Munford, in 1923, demonstrated that the urine of control subjects becomes more alkaline after a standard meal (3).However, in sharp contrast, the urine of patients with achlorhyydria (a condition where the production of hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions of the stomach is absent) showed no increase in alkalinity after a meal.The investigators concluded that the secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach was the cause of the increased alkalinity of the urine after a meal.At this point, students were challenged to consider how the secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach caused an increased alkalinity of the urine.To replicate part of the experiment demonstrating how the secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach caused an increased alkalinity of the urine, two volunteer students were selected, and, using standard pH test strips, the pH of their urine was determined in the privacy of the restrooms.Upon returning to class, one student drank a protein shake and the other student drank an equal volume of water.

To compete with pseudoscience, we need to improve science literacy and make science accessible through the same media on which pseudoscience thrives. As scientists and educators, we believe it is our responsibility to reconceptualize science literacy as a lifelong process and take greater accountability over the future of science communication. We hypothesize that increasing the accessibility of scientific literature to the public through adopting mainstream media forms and increasing access to informal science education (ISE) opportunities will decrease the proliferation of pseudoscience. To accomplish this, we propose eight recommendations housed under three action areas: 1) modify undergraduate science education by increasing opportunities for informal science communication, 2) increase accessibility to informal science education, and 3) bridge the gap between formal and informal science learning opportunities.",

This relationship (tension is proportional to the product of radius × pressure) has a broad implication in physiology and medicine, such as pulmonary and circulatory mechanics, bladder function, intraocular pressure, pregnancy, heart failure, hypertension, and several other conditions (1, 2). Students' difficulty in understanding Laplace's law frequently lies in the arid way it is presented: hastily in respiratory physiology courses, in which the only emphasis is given on the role of surfactant in alveolar collapse, despite the fact that the law probably has little to do with alveoli collapse (4). Little attempt is dedicated to its underlying principles or to its role in linking anatomic design to the functional capability of diverse body structures. Here, we describe a quite simple way for physiology students to figure out the physical forces involved in Laplace's law. The novelty proposed here is to make students somatically “feel the law,” by means of touch and proprioception. An ever-growing body of evidence has shown us the importance of this kind of active and meaningful learning (3).In this demonstration, the instructor places two students one in front another, keeping a distance of ∼1.5 yd between them. Both students have to firmly hold the extremities of a piece of fabric (a towel, for example, as shown in Fig. 1). In the middle of the fabric, the instructor should place an object weighing ∼10 lb. A student's purse or a backpack is a good choice. The instructor then asks students to compare how difficult is to hold the fabric in two distinct situations (as shown in Fig. 1) and report it to the rest of the class. The object weight simulates the pressure of a content (like a fluid) against the walls of a given body structure (a blood vessel, for instance). The difficulty of holding the fabric is associated with the tension stress in the curved wall of that structure, a tangential force to its surface. Students will easily feel that the tension in the fabric changes as a function of the distance between them. The closer they are, the lesser is the tension; consequently, the easier it is to hold the fabric (and vice versa). As the pressure (object weight) remains constant along the demonstration, tension increases and decreases as a function of the radius of the imaginary circle shaped by the fabric: tension is proportional to pressure × radius. After the demonstration, the instructor can discuss with the class about what happened. The perpendicular component of the tension in the curved wall counterbalances the pressure, and the size of this component varies as a function of radius.Fig. 1.The vertical component (Ty) of the tension (T1 and T2) cancels the weight [W; which simulates the pressure against the wall of container (the imaginary circle formed by the fabric)]. A: when the students are close together, given the small radius, a smaller tension is needed to produce the vertical counterbalancing component, as in the following relation: tension is proportional to pressure × radius. B: as the distance between the two students increases, the radius of the imaginary circle increases as well, increasing the angle between the tension made by each student separately. Given the vectorial nature of forces, a greater tension is needed to generate the same vertical component (T2 > T1), which is vividly felt by the students. The instructor should point that the object weight (pressure) remains the same throughout the demonstration.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe law of Laplace can provide valuable insights into the function of many of the body's systems. However, it often leads to counterintuitive predictions about the behavior of hollow structures that work under pressure. It has been shown that students have serious misconceptions about this kind of behavior (5). We performed this simple demonstration in our introductory physiology courses with great results and extremely positive feedback from the students.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors thank the students in the photos and Prof. Marcus Vinicius C.

    "abstract": "China's Clinical Medicine Level Test (CMLT) was designed to evaluate the key factors that affect the learning outcome of medical students prior to entering clinical practice. In this study, we systemically analyzed the performance of a cohort of medical students at Jinan University School of Medicine participating in the recent CMLT. The analytical results of the medical students' written and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) scores showed that their academic performance was predominantly associated with students' internship allocations, although other demographic characteristics such as sex, age, geographical origin of students, and grade point average (GPA) might be sporadically related to the students' OSCE performance at different OSCE stations. To explore the inherent reasons behind this, a survey was implemented among the medical students who participated in the examination to further interpret the factors influencing the students' learning outcome. The findings of this questionnaire manifested that intrinsic motivation and identified regulation acted as the major motivational profiles for the medical students from three different internship sites, whereas external regulation emerged as the crucial factor to make the students perform well academically in the CMLT. The result of this study suggested that strengthening the quality control of the clinical learning environment and improving medical administration may still be the most effective approaches to ensure the quality of clinical medical education.",

    "abstract": "Pulse oximetry has become the standard of care in operating rooms, intensive care units, and hospitals worldwide. A pulse oximeter continuously and noninvasively monitors the functional oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood ([Formula: see text]). [Formula: see text] is so important in medical care that it is often regarded as a fifth vital sign. Before pulse oximetry, arterial puncture for blood gas analysis was the only method available to determine [Formula: see text] and to identify the presence of hypoxemia. Pulse oximetry is based on the principle that oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) absorbs more near-infrared light than deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) and HHb absorbs more red light than O2Hb. It is important to understand the principles of pulse oximetry, how the equipment works, and its limitations to interpret the information it provides. Accordingly, we used colored balloons to introduce the physics of how a pulse oximeter detects and measures oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in pulsatile (arterial) and nonpulsatile (venous and capillary) blood. The foundations of oximetry started in the 1700s with Johann Lambert (1728-1777). We approached this complex physics in a straightforward way while still providing an understanding of the fundamental concepts developed by Johann Lambert in 1760.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Educators must go beyond teaching the facts and encourage students to think, investigate, and appreciate the subject matter in a broader framework. To achieve these goals, we used a simple and inexpensive experimental approach to introduce the physics of how a pulse oximeter detects and measures oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in blood. We approached this complex physics in a straightforward way while still providing an understanding of the fundamental concepts developed by Johann Lambert in 1760.",

In a mixed-method design, a metacognitive calibration self-assessing (MCC) survey tool was applied to HFPS (n = 80, 20 teams of 6 medical students) and semistructured interviews were conducted with faculty (n = 5). When scored by faculty with a rubric, the mean student accuracy ranged from 23% to 74%, whereas their self-assessment of confidence ranged from 71% to 86%. This result revealed overconfidence bias in novice students regarding the correctness of their wrong responses. The most common misconception identified was inverting cause and effect: metabolic acidosis was pointed to as the cause of the patient's problems rather than a consequence of untreated diabetes mellitus. The most common treatment error was overtreatment, with unnecessary added medication. Interviews with faculty suggested that the MCC tool improved the team process by slowing students down, requiring them to think through their answers, and that overall the tool improved their critical thinking. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using a metacognitive confidence calibration tool to assist novice students in learning safely to make deliberate diagnostic reasoning and decisions on patient care in real time during complex simulations while observing objectively their levels of psychological confidence against patient outcomes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study demonstrates the feasibility of a metacognitive confidence calibration tool (MCC) to assess and promote novices in the learning of diagnostic reasoning and treatment decisions on patient care in real time during high-fidelity patient simulations while comparing confidence and accuracy data and identifying students' scientific misconceptions. Results revealed the presence of overconfidence bias, overtreatment, and the misconception of metabolic acidosis as the cause of the patient's problems rather than a consequence of untreated diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "The year 2023 marks the 300th anniversary of the death of Antonio Maria Valsalva (1666-1723). Valsalva was a leading physician across the 17th and 18th centuries, specifically for his focus on experimental physiology, the science dealing with the normal functioning of bodily organs as a basis for a better understanding of diseases, symptoms, and care. He used a top-down systematic approach typical of the Enlightenment, rather than a heuristic one (\"trial-and-error\"), which became feasible after the long-lasting ban on dissecting human corpses was lifted. Valsalva's main interest was exploring the complex structure of the human ear, to which he dedicated a specific treatise, De Aure Humana. He understood the issues inherent in the imbalance in pressure between the outer and inner ear and found ways to exploit it to get rid of purulent fluid by deliberately raising the inside pressure with his maneuver. Time was however not yet ripe to see the broader importance that the Valsalva maneuver would achieve, not just in otorhinolaryngology, but also in cardiology and other fields of medicine. Although Valsalva's name is usually associated with his maneuver, his contributions to the history of medicine were broader: he discovered several anatomical parts (i.e., the sinuses of Valsalva), built the basis for the development of pathological anatomy, introduced advances in surgery, and promoted compassionate care of patients affected by mental diseases.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Antonio Maria Valsalva (1666-1723) was a pioneer in experimental physiology between the 17th and 18th centuries. The Valsalva maneuver is still a popular academic topic and has broad applications not only in physiology research, but also in the diagnosis and therapy of various diseases. The celebration of 300 years from his death could be a timely occasion to commemorate the scientific works of this illustrious scientist.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of these service-learning experiences on Exercise Science students' self-efficacy for fitness assessment and exercise prescription. Students completed a seven-item self-efficacy questionnaire administered at both the beginning and end of each service-learning course and reflected on their experience using an end-of-course survey. Our results showed significant improvements in self-efficacy from pretest to posttest for each of the two service-learning experiences, with the second experience producing additional gains in self-efficacy over and above the first.

Given the variation in students' educational background and competencies, there was a need to develop an Anatomy and Physiology (A&P) Foundational Knowledge Assessment to establish the levels of preparedness of first-year medical students. Previous work that focused on the development of the assessment showed it to be effective in measuring students' foundational knowledge in human anatomy and physiology. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the A&P Foundational Knowledge Assessment in determining students' prior knowledge and predicting academic performance of first-year students in their anatomy and physiology studies. Three hundred seventy first-year students, across two cohort years, 2017 and 2018, completed the A&P Foundational Knowledge Assessment. Data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and Pearson's correlation. Results show that for both cohorts ∼30% of students scored ≤55% and were potentially at risk of performing poorly in their anatomy and physiology studies. Pearson's correlation showed a significant relationship between students' performance on the foundational knowledge assessment and their anatomy and physiology assessments. For both cohorts, >10% of students identified by the A&P Foundational Knowledge Assessment were at risk of either failing the course, entering an extended degree program, or being excluded from the program.

However, although past work has characterized the alignment of physiology programs with the core concepts, it is unclear to what extent these core concepts have influenced instructors' pedagogical decisions or how represented these core concepts are across physiology courses. We surveyed undergraduate physiology instructors to determine their familiarity with the core concepts, the impact of the core concepts on their teaching, as well as the alignment of their courses with these core concepts. Instructors report predominantly relying on textbooks and past syllabi of their courses as resources that influence their instructional decisions on which topics to include in a course. However, many instructors report reorganizing their physiology courses in subsequent iterations or reducing the number of concepts covered to allow more time for critical thinking and active learning. In addition, we find that the majority of instructors indicate that they are not knowledgeable about the list of physiology core concepts and that the influence of these core concepts is limited even for those who report familiarity with the list of core concepts. Finally, we find that instructors report uneven coverage of physiology core concepts in their courses, with some core concepts ubiquitous while others are sparsely covered. We conclude by discussing implications of our work for the physiology education community and call for the continued development of resources to support new physiology instructors and the need to promote coverage of certain core concepts in physiology courses.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The physiology core concepts are a critical resource for undergraduate physiology instructors.

Autonomic pharmacology is difficult in that it requires students to synthesize detailed anatomy, physiology, clinical reasoning, and pharmacology. The subject poses a challenge to learn as it is often introduced early in medical school curricula. To ease the difficulty of learning autonomic pharmacology, we created a free web application, PharmaMemory (www.pharmamemory.com), that interactively depicts the effects of high-yield autonomic drugs on the human body. PharmaMemory provides users with the opportunity to read and quiz themselves on the mechanisms, side effects, indications, and contraindications of these drugs while interacting with the application. We provided PharmaMemory to first-year medical students for three consecutive years of quality improvement and assessed the application's perceived effects on learning via user surveys. Survey feedback showed that users viewed PharmaMemory favorably and self-reported increased knowledge and confidence in the subject of autonomic pharmacology. Comments revealed that users liked the website's visuals, opportunity for challenged recall, and conciseness. PharmaMemory utilizes challenged recall, visual stimulation, and interactive learning to provide users with a multifaceted learning tool. Preliminary data suggest that students find this method of learning beneficial. Further studies are needed to assess PharmaMemory compared with more traditional learning methods such as PowerPoint or text-based learning. Additionally, further research is needed to quantitatively assess reduction in cognitive load.",

We found that students defaulted to memorization of disease with treatment and bypassed gaining an understanding of the mechanistic physiology behind disease and treatment. To adjust our student's approach, we developed a novel way to enhance student learning. To accomplish this shift from memorization to physiological mastery, we created the Inverted Case Study. This approach diverges from the traditional model in that students are given the diagnosis and treatment beforehand and are tasked with explaining the actual physiology of the case. In this way, students can no longer rely on the memorization of symptoms-disease-treatment but rather gain a solid understanding of the physiological mechanisms of the disease since that is the focus of the Inverted Case Study Technique. The Inverted Case Study approach is an effective approach to apply and hone critical thinking skills.",

The preclass and in-class activities in this framework encourage individualized learning and collaborative problem-solving among students, fostering engagement. The Innovative Flipped Learning Instruction Project (IFLIP) conducted faculty development workshops over 4 years, guiding science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty in integrating flipped teaching (FT) into their courses. The research aimed to assess its impact on pedagogical practices, explore its effectiveness, and provide a framework to implement FT across multiple institutions. It sought to evaluate the experiences of these educators throughout the transitional period of instructional change. In the fourth year of this project, a symposium was organized for IFLIP participants to share their experiences and findings concerning FT. This symposium helped promote collaboration among IFLIP participants and faculty interested in FT to disseminate participants' knowledge and experiences in implementing FT strategies. A survey conducted at the end of the symposium indicated that faculty participants with FT experience continued to embrace this pedagogy, and the new adopters expressed intentions to incorporate it into their courses. The survey revealed positive responses: 93% of respondents plan to integrate FT methods in future classes, 90% gained new information from the symposium and intend to implement it, and 91% are likely to recommend FT to colleagues. Ultimately, the symposium underscored the transformative impact of FT in empowering educators to deepen students' conceptual understanding, emphasizing the significance of this pedagogical approach in advancing the quality of education.",

However, the most effective strategies for training peer tutors (PTs) for their role are not known. This paper examines the use of an Objective Structured Teaching Exercise (OSTE) to augment PT training sessions. Applying deliberate practice as a conceptual framework, an OSTE was used to provide tutors with an opportunity to practice their skills and receive feedback about their performance when meeting with a student presenting with a challenge. The newly trained PTs were required to assess a standardized student, determine challenge(s) being experienced, and present options to address the challenge(s). Standardized students evaluated the tutors' performance and a pre- and post-OSTE questionnaire was used to determine whether the OSTE was effective in increasing the confidence level of PTs to effectively assess and support students seeking help. Participants reported an increase in confidence in their ability to assess areas requiring improvement, understand the active learning strategies, and suggest appropriate active learning study strategies. Evaluations completed by standardized students documented that newly trained PTs accurately diagnosed the challenge presented in the OSTE and in most cases PTs asked all relevant questions to assess.

    "abstract": "Internationalization in higher education is essential, and although active learning methodologies are increasing and allow students to develop transversal skills, most still have a very local scope. In this context, the Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) methodology is an interesting approach to benefit the students' development. It consists of an online program that involves creating multicultural teams to develop a specific learning project. Although this methodology is expanding, its use in physiology is still scarce. This paper aims to show an example of applying COIL methodology in physiology topics to enhance higher-education students' innovation and business skills. Our example project developed a sports-assessment service concept focused on physiology and biomechanics assessments. The program involved teams from Brazil, Germany, and Spain, comprising undergraduate and master students. Over 7 weeks, these teams, mentored by professors and researchers, engaged in workshops covering COIL methodology, business model design, executive summary planning, economic analyses, and communication techniques. Key outcomes included learning new concepts, developing soft skills, building confidence in innovative solution proposals, and experiencing diverse cultures. Challenges faced were language barriers, scheduling, task complexity, and logistical issues. This experience confirms the effectiveness of incorporating programs using COIL methodology into educational curriculums. Doing so exposes physiology students to innovation, entrepreneurship, and business creation while strengthening their professional connections and opening up postgraduation opportunities.",

The rising prevalence of adolescent obesity necessitates innovative educational strategies that effectively engage high school students in understanding the complex physiologic mechanisms and nutrition concepts underlying its development. This submission presents a session that is designed to integrate the physiological concepts and nutrition that are associated with the development of obesity. Foundational information about the different food ingredients and physiology of the gastrointestinal organ system followed by concepts associated with the development of obesity and its complications were introduced. The session was delivered using combined educational approaches such as a dialogical-narrative approach and hands-on application activities by two discipline experts, physiology and nutrition. This innovative approach was well received, as evidenced by high satisfaction rates among participants. While direct measures of critical thinking and practical skills development were not captured, the positive feedback suggests that students appreciated the engaging, hands-on application of theoretical concepts. The sessions fostered an awareness of personal health responsibilities, with students actively participating and connecting learned material with practical scenarios. We believe that using combined educational approaches in interdisciplinary team-teaching sessions promotes inclusiveness and interactive engagement and enhances long-life learning.",

    "abstract": "Understanding complex physiological processes is a cornerstone of medical education, and one such fundamental concept is the regulation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by Starling forces. Therefore, developing a physiologically sound educational model to demonstrate these forces can significantly enhance the learning experience for students, providing them with a clear and comprehensive understanding of renal filtration. Starling forces include the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, which drives plasma filtration; the plasma colloid osmotic pressure (also referred to as the oncotic pressure within the capillary), which opposes filtration; and the Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure, which resists fluid influx. Bowman's capsule oncotic pressure is typically considered negligible in healthy kidneys and, therefore, does not usually influence the glomerular filtration process. It is crucial for future clinicians to understand these Starling forces in order to monitor and manage kidney function effectively. To aid in understanding these concepts, we present a simple yet effective physical model of GFR. This model uses pressurized air and a serological pipette setup to simulate the filtration process, with a ping-pong ball's height representing GFR. Various perturbations demonstrate changes in Starling forces, allowing students to visualize the impact of different physiological and pathological conditions on GFR. This hands-on approach aims to simplify the complex interplay of factors affecting GFR, making it an invaluable educational tool for medical students.",

    "abstract": "Why, after enduring the grueling demands of medical school and successfully completing the pre-clinical curriculum, must students further burden themselves with 4-8 weeks of exam preparation for the licensing exam instead of engaging in meaningful, real-world experiences? The relentless focus on licensing exams like the USMLE Step 1 and COMLEX-USA Level 1 diverts attention from activities that truly matter, such as direct patient care, community service, research, and interprofessional education. Tens of thousands of medical students are confined to weeks of isolated study, reviewing comprehensive resources such as textbooks, online courses, and question banks on content already covered and tested during the pre-clinical curriculum. This represents a significant time sink that could otherwise be used to enhance clinical skills, empathy, and social responsibility. Hands-on clinical experiences are essential for developing practical skills and building strong patient-doctor relationships, while community service fosters social responsibility. Research engagement is crucial for medical advancements, and interprofessional education and global health initiatives broaden students' perspectives. Despite being viewed as competency measures, these licensing exams are repetitive and focus on already-mastered content, failing to justify their extensive time demands. We argue for a reassessment of the necessity of these exams, advocating for an education system that prioritizes real-world experiences. This shift would foster competent, empathetic, and socially conscious healthcare professionals, poised to make a significant societal impact.",

The AT has found purchase in various contexts, such as clinical settings, research, outreach, and education. Studies into the efficacy of the AT in teaching settings have been generally positive but limited in its application, particularly in clinical procedure education. In this study, we conducted an informal workshop for second-year Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) students to aid in being able to identify the important neuraxial landmarks for performing peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs), an anesthetic technique often used before other procedures. In our workshop, we paired the AT with identification of the same neuraxial landmarks on volunteer models with an ultrasound probe to provide students with relevant tactile experience for the procedure.

Reviewers are contacted via email and can accept or decline the invitation. Reviewers evaluate the work's strengths and weaknesses, then independently submit comments and recommendations to the Associate Editor. After review, the Associate Editor collects and weighs Reviewers' comments, sometimes garners additional reviews and input, to make a recommendation to the Editor. The Editor reviews the process, comments, and recommendations to render a final decision. Both authors and Reviewers receive an email with the decision. The editorial staff assist with communication and help track the overall process. Peer review is integral to scientific publishing, ensuring quality and rigor, and reviewing is both a privilege and a responsibility of all in the scientific community.",

Memories are not static; rather, they are constantly updated via reactivation, and this reactivation occurs preferentially during Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS, also referred to as N3 in humans). Here we present a scalable neuroscience research investigation of memory reactivation using low-cost electroencephalogram (EEG) recording hardware and open-source software, for students and educators across the K-12 and higher education spectrum. The investigation uses a method called targeted memory reactivation (TMR), whereby auditory cues that were previously associated with learning are re-presented during sleep, triggering the recall of stored memories and (through this) strengthening these memories. We demonstrated the efficacy of this technique on seven healthy human subjects (ages 19-35). The subjects learned to play a spatial memory game on an app where they associated pictures (e.g., a clock) with locations on a grid while they listened to picture-appropriate sounds (e.g., \"tic-toc\"); next, they took a nap while undergoing EEG recordings. During SWS, half of the sounds from the game were replayed by the app, while half were substituted with non-learned sounds. Subjects then played the memory game again after waking. Results showed that spatial recall was improved more for cued than uncued memories, demonstrating the benefits of memory replay during sleep and suggesting that one may intervene in this process to boost recall of specific memories. This research investigation takes advantage of the importance of sleep for memory consolidation and demonstrates improved memory performance by cueing sounds during SWS.",

Thus the study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Objective, Integrated, Clustered Examination Software (VOICES) compared to traditional viva voce methods. Using a mixed-method design with 103 students, questions were framed using VOICES software created by the National Informatics Center (NIC), Chhattisgarh State Center, Government of India, and students responded through voice messages. Faculty graded students based on personalized videos created by the app. Then, feedback was given, and a focused group discussion was conducted for the students. Traditional viva voce examinations were conducted as part of internal assessments, and the marks obtained from these assessments were compared to evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to the VOICES app. There was no significant difference in the marks obtained using both methods indicating that viva voce using an oral assessment app is equally effective. Students responded positively to the VOICES method. The formative oral assessment conducted through the use of the VOICES app successfully addresses the challenges typically associated with traditional viva voce examinations.",

Breaking down content in a structured manner allows for segmented bite-sized learning that may enhance students’ learning beyond conventional online lectures. We compared the effectiveness of (1) bite-sized structured learning (BSL) and (2) synchronous Zoom lecture (SZL) in teaching muscle physiology to first-year allied health undergraduates. For the same student cohort, the topic was divided into two lectures with the first taught via BSL, and the second via SZL. Pre- and post-quizzes were used to evaluate students’ understanding of the topic. Mixed-methods online questionnaires were used to examine students’ perceptions towards the two modes of learning, encompassing content coverage, delivery, engagement, effectiveness, preference and convenience. A total of 223 and 215 students completed both pre- and post-quizzes for BSL and SZL respectively. Student performances were improved via both modes (p&lt;0.001) with a higher median score improvement in BSL when compared to SZL [3.0 (1.0–4.0) vs 2.0 (1.0–3.0)]. Among students who completed the survey, 65% expressed strong preference towards BSL over SZL (17%), which could be attributed to the benefits of self-paced microlearning such as higher motivation and improved attention. BSL was perceived to be manageable and well-structured to support learning. Our study suggests that BSL is equally effective as conventional lectures and is a learning approach favored by students. There could be merits in combining both instructional modes as their complementary advantages may enhance students’ learning.",

Additionally, the LM+VM group had a lower failure rate (i.e., grade F for students scoring below 60) (3.23% [LM+VM] vs. 13.48% [LM-only], P = 0.02). The implementation of VM was well-received by students in the LM+VM group, who, while disagreeing that VM could entirely replace LM, overwhelmingly preferred the blended learning model (93.55%). Furthermore, students in the LM+VM group reported higher satisfaction levels compared to the LM-only group (t = 8.49, df = 180, P &lt; 0.001). Overall, blended learning with LM and VM resulted in significant improvements in student performance, satisfaction, and perception compared to traditional LM learning.",

    "abstract": "John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach, consistently emphasized the distinction between winning and true success. For Wooden, success was not about defeating others or standing out in a competition, but about personal growth, self-improvement, and the pursuit of excellence. His philosophy offers a powerful lesson, particularly for educators, as they guide students through their academic journeys. Wooden's message highlights the importance of fostering an environment where success is measured by effort and progress, not merely by grades or test scores. Unfortunately, many educators seem to overlook this, focusing heavily on grades as the primary measure of achievement. By placing such a strong emphasis on grades, teachers inadvertently create a culture where students begin to equate their self-worth with their performance on a test. This not only diminishes the value of personal growth but also fosters anxiety and discouragement among students who may struggle academically. Student may begin to fear being wrong and avoid challenges and opportunities. This limits creativity, the chance to learn, grow, and contribute to society. Wooden's wisdom reminds us that educators have the power to influence how students perceive success. By encouraging a more holistic view of achievement, one that values hard work, resilience, and continuous improvement, teachers can help students develop a healthier, more positive understanding of what it means to succeed. In today's educational system, this shift is crucial, as too many students are being taught to see their value solely in terms of grades, rather than their personal and intellectual growth.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of three different learning modalities in histopathology teaching: optical microscopy, in-class virtual microscopy (VM), and online VM lectures. We examined relational aspects, didactic effectiveness, and satisfaction of these learning settings, both during class time and in private study, outside the dedicated spaces and hours of the university. The comparative design of the study, based on a set of surveys taken during the course and at its end, resulted in valuable methodological insights and a clear picture of the students' needs. These were characterized both by high technological expectations and by desire for a stimulating social environment. Our results show that the implementation of new learning tools has a positive impact on teaching, and not only at the didactic level. It also positively affects the way the university is experienced by the students, it facilitates their wanted socializing lifestyles, and it exposes them, as a new generation of professionals, to the latest technologies used by specialty physicians.",

    "abstract": "Optimising the workload of university students is important for their academic performance and student experience. Large perceived workloads are associated with poorer academic performance and lower student satisfaction in university students. In response to student feedback in 2021, we redesigned a second-year undergraduate physiology subject in order to optimise workload and improve student experience. The practical assessments (contributing 50% of the subject grade) were consolidated from five small reports to two more comprehensive reports. The new subject design resulted in a 3.85% reduction in practical assessment marks (p<0.05), although students maintained their academic performance in the end of trimester quiz. Upon reflection, the new practical assessments may have been more challenging for students and more discriminating of academic performance, as they required greater levels of critical thinking and more in-depth discussion of complex physiological concepts. Student satisfaction was reduced following the first iteration of the new subject design, but with additional assessment support for students by academic staff in 2022, the student experience ratings were no longer below expected values. In summary, consolidating the number of practical assessments was predicted to foster deeper learning of physiological concepts. However, to successfully achieve this, support from academic staff appears to be an essential factor to foster a positive student experience.",

The osmotic pressure is defined at equilibrium when there is no net flow, and it takes some time to reach this equilibrium. Although the osmotic pressure is certainly important, teaching only this point of view implicitly diminishes the importance of osmotic flow, which begins almost instantaneously across a membrane. A device was constructed with which students could measure the flow across a model membrane (dialysis tubing) as a function of concentration for solutes of different sizes. The device produced flows that were linearly proportional to the concentration, providing a confirmation of van't Hoff's law. Separate student groups repeated these experiments using both different solutes and different dialysis membranes. The combined results of four student groups showed that the flow across these nonideal membranes depends on the solute and membrane as well as the concentration of solute. Given a value for area times filtration coefficient (A x Lp) for the membranes (determined beforehand by their instructor), the students could calculate the reflection coefficient (sigma) for three solutes and two membranes. The results showed that large solutes had large sigma and that less porous membranes had larger sigma. A concurrent demonstration using this device and membranes showed that the osmotic flow can generate large pressures. These experiments and demonstration provide a balanced view of osmotic flow and pressure.",

To understand the changes associated with aging, we developed a laboratory exercise that compares and contrasts the cardiopulmonary responses to exercise in a young and an older individual. We also developed this interactive tool because it is our experience that learning is better facilitated when students are encouraged, and required, to become an active and integral part of the educational process. This exercise provides a unique opportunity to analyze, integrate, and interpret the changes associated with aging because more is learned about how a system operates when it is forced to perform than when it is idle. In this laboratory exercise, basic anatomical and physiological data about aging are provided. Subsequently, figures are presented that illustrate the responses of specific cardiopulmonary variables during exercise (e.g., heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure), and the students are challenged to analyze and assimilate information from the figures, answer questions, make calculations, and plot graphs. The laboratory does not require equipment or software, only rules and pencils. Questions, and answers to them, are provided in the appendix. The emphasis is on the application of basic science principles, interpretation of pictorial or tabular material, and problem solving skills. In addition, an evaluation instrument was developed to assess the effectiveness of this instructional tool in an academic setting. Specifically, the evaluation instrument addressed four major components, including aims and objectives, content of materials, components and organization, and summary and recommendations.",

Practitioners ordering these tests are not formally trained in spirometry interpretation. Providing effective off-site training can be challenging. Our objective was to develop a remotely accessible computer-based tutorial for teaching spirometry interpretation to nonpulmonologists. We designed an educational module that was accessible via the Internet and tested by 65 medical trainees at a major university medical center. In addition, the module was posted within the Virtual Hospital on the World Wide Web. Increases in spirometry interpretative skills were assessed using pre- and post-tests submitted electronically. The spirometry module significantly improved spirometry interpretation by nonspecialist trainees. This improvement included a broad increase in knowledge base and was observed independent of training level and prior spirometry reading experience. We conclude that computer-based tutorials can effectively train off-site practitioners in spirometry interpretation. This technology allows for the dissemination of educational material from a central site of expertise and provides a valuable adjunct to limited teaching resources.",

However, just \"turning them loose in the lab\" is time-consuming and can be frustrating for both students and faculty. We describe three different ways of providing structures for labs that require students to design their own experiments but guide the choices. One approach emphasizes invertebrate preparations and classic techniques that students can learn fairly easily. Students must read relevant primary literature and learn each technique in one week, and then design and carry out their own experiments in the next week. Another approach provides a \"design framework\" for the experiments so that all students are using the same technique and the same statistical comparisons, whereas their experimental questions differ widely. The third approach involves assigning the questions or problems but challenging students to design good protocols to answer these questions. In each case, there is a mixture of structure and freedom that works for the level of the students, the resources available, and our particular aims.",

The anatomy curriculum was switched from fetal pig dissections to the use of human cadavers, computer animations, and plastic models. An inquiry approach was integrated into the physiology curriculum. Student attitude surveys suggest that the physical and curricular changes resulted in a significant increase in student learning. An experiment designed to specifically test the effect of new vs. old equipment did not support a benefit to new equipment independent of changes in the lab physical environment and curriculum. Because the improvements in student attitude surveys occurred in the physiology but not the anatomy labs, we suggest that at least a portion of the increase is due to the institution of the inquiry approach.",

We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the use of a HPS with a standard lecture. The teaching objectives included understanding the determinants of oxygen delivery and the pathophysiology of different types of shock. The primary outcome measured was a difference in pre-teaching test (pre-TT) and post-teaching test (post-TT) scores between the two groups.Novice second-year preclinical medical students were recruited on a volunteer basis after ethics approval had been obtained. Students were aware of the experimental nature of the session and that testing of their performance was required. The topic of the session was concealed to avoid preparation. Participants were randomized to receive a 1-h teaching session either via a traditional lecture in the form of a slide presentation or a session using a HPS (Medical Education Technologies, Sarasota, FL). All students performed a pre-TT to establish their baseline score, which served as each student's control. The test was of written format, consisting of questions requiring written responses as well as multiple-choice questions. The syllabus of both forums was standardized and delivered by different instructors concurrently at different venues. After a brief break, all students were asked to complete a post-TT of a similar nature to the pre-TT.For the HPS session, physiological variables were displayed in real time on a monitor with all its audible features enabled. Students were asked in turn to predict responses to different physiological maneuvers such as alterations in preload, myocardial contractility, and systemic vascular resistance. The results of the students' suggestions were then presented on the monitor and discussed, with the expected “correct” response presented when necessary.Tests were marked by a blinded examiner, and scores are expressed as a percentage of the maximum obtainable score. Means and SDs were calculated for pre-TT and post-TT scores of each group. The pre-TT score was compared by t-test. Analysis of covariance was performed to compare the improvement of score (post-TT − pre-TT score) between the two groups, adjusting for the pre-TT score.Only 19 of the 140 eligible students participated in this study, with 10 students randomized to the HPS group and 9 students to the lecture group. There were no differences in pre-TT scores between groups (P = 0.58; Table 1). Both groups made significant improvements in their test scores after the intervention, with the mean score increasing from 23.8% to 56.6% (32.8%) for the HPS group and from 26.5% to 53.8% (27.3%) for the lecture group. However, the 5.5% difference in pre-TT to post-TT scores between HPS and control groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.22) and was not correlated with the pre-TT score (P = 0.62).Table 1.

TT, teaching test.It is recognized that RCTs in education may lack true blinding and randomization, uniformity in the intervention, and a pure outcome (1). However, RCTs are probably still the most rigorous design and, as such, was used in this study. Given the volunteer nature of recruitment, only a small number of students participated. With the estimated SD of the improvement of TT score, a sample size of 45 students/group would be required to show the difference of 5.5% with statistical significance, at a maximal chance of false positive error of 0.05 and 80% power.An improvement in future studies of this type may include a crossover design using two subject matters. Each instructor is required to teach both subject matters sequentially using a different method for each topic. Assessment of the perception of the instructor's competency would also have to be measured and compared. This may minimize teacher styles as a confounder, as may have the case in this study. Furthermore, other variables may also be measured, such as evaluating the student's decision abilities. In conclusion, context-based learning using a HPS may enhance the understanding of certain basic pathophysiological principles compared with standard lecture.GRANTSThis study was in part funded by the Run Run Shaw Research and Teaching Endowment Fund (teaching grants administered by the University of Hong Kong).The authors thank all the students who took part in this study during their term break.REFERENCE1 Norman GR, Schmidt HG.

This exploratory study examined freshman attrition from an undergraduate exercise physiology program in Appalachia with the goal of identifying potential strategies for improving retention across similar programs in this underserved region. Questionnaires were administered at the beginning and end of the fall semester to freshman ( n = 247) and students transferring out of the major [Transferred group (T); n = 50] by the end of their first semester were compared against those that remained [Retained group (R); n = 190]. The Transferred group was invited to participate in qualitative interviews. Fewer Transferred students reported feeling underprepared in academic preparedness skills, but more reported feeling underprepared in math. At the end of the semester, more in the Transferred group reported doing worse than expected in math and in getting good grades and had a lower grade point average (R: 3.27 ± 0.05; T: 2.62 ± 0.15; P &lt; 0.01). More in the Transferred group were first-generation (FG) college students (R: 17%; T: 30%). Transferred FG had lower academic preparation and performance and more financial need than Retained FG. In interviews ( n = 35), most students expressed a change in career goals and many noted the academic rigor of the program, while academic advising, faculty, and the major received generally positive praise. This study identified several factors that would allow for early identification of incoming freshmen at risk for attrition and proposes strategies for improving retention within Appalachian physiology programs.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is thought to be an effective means to quick weight loss. However, few people have realistic exercise-induced weight loss expectations. Fewer understand how weight is “lost” and where the lost mass goes. Understanding that fat is “burned” with inhaled oxygen and most of the mass lost must be exhaled as carbon dioxide might help individuals create realistic weight loss expectations. The purpose of this laboratory activity is to 1) provide students with a basic understanding of the role of oxygen in fuel metabolism during physical activity and its relationship to energy expenditure and mechanical work, and 2) engage students with collection of their own data to determine a realistic timeframe for exercise-induced weight loss. In the prelaboratory, questions such as, “When you lose weight, where does it go?” are asked. A guided discussion helps students understand the basic biochemistry required for weight loss. For the activity, students complete walking or running exercise, recording the time and distance. The relationship of exercise to physics’ concepts of mechanical work and energy utilization are discussed with the concept of “calorie burn” and its relationship to oxygen consumption. Students estimate oxygen consumed and calories burned during exercise using established metabolic equations. Finally, the amount of energy (i.e., calories) equivalent to 1 pound of fat is discussed. Students calculate how long he/she would have to exercise to burn 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of fat. A person of average size and fitness, needs 60+ h of exercise to burn 10 pounds of fat. Supplementary activities including a dramatic gummy bear oxidation and the use of a metabolic cart reinforces these concepts and validates the laboratory estimates.",

    "abstract": "Significant disruptions in higher education course delivery occurred during the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic. The implementation of emergency remote teaching (ERT) offered exercise science faculty a safe method to continue educating students in courses generally taught face-to-face. The purpose of this investigation was to explore faculty perceptions of their ERT efforts with respect to student successes, challenges, and faculty expectations. Through an electronic survey, participants (n = 112) from higher education institutions in 31 states and three Canadian provinces provided feedback on their perceptions of the student experience across 315 fall 2020 courses. Data analysis included a thematic analysis to identify themes and trends in participant responses. Faculty identified student adaptability, increased autonomy of learning, and maintenance of learning as successes. Also noted was the increased flexibility of alternative pedagogy methods. Participants perceived student challenges related to technology, time management, and well-being. Faculty perceived students expected increased accommodations and instructor responsiveness during fall 2020. While faculty and students were challenged to adapt during the global pandemic, the perceived ERT experiences during COVID-19 highlight the resiliency of higher education students and underscores changes needed by educational institutions to provide resources and training upon return to traditional education or in response to a future crisis.",

Despite the complexity of this task, clear themes emerged as our courses transitioned to an online format in spring 2020 and were solidified in the fall of 2020. This article reflects on the history, features, benefits, and challenges of current laboratory teaching when applying a scientific teaching approach to facilitate the redesign process.

This study combined both self-reported and observational measures of students' learning experiences and examined the relations between the two sets of measures and their contributions to learning outcomes. Australian medical students were asked to report their approaches to, and perceptions of, learning. The frequency and duration of their interactions with both online formative and summative tasks were observed and recorded. Correlation analyses showed that the learning outcome was positively related to deep approaches to using online technologies and duration of interactions with online summative tasks. The hierarchical multiple regression analysis found that the self-reported approaches and duration of interactions jointly explained the learning outcomes, accounting for 6% of the variance. The study demonstrated the complementary nature of using both self-reported and observational measures of students' learning experiences to explain the learning outcomes in blended course designs.",

    "abstract": "Student enrollments in online college courses have grown steadily over the past decade, and college administrators expect this trend to continue or accelerate. Despite the growing popularity of online education, one major critique in the sciences is that students are not trained in the hands-on skills they may need for the workforce, graduate school, or professional school. For example, the Association of American Medical Colleges has recommended that medical schools evaluate applicants on their motor skills and observation skills, yet many online biology programs do not offer opportunities for students to develop these skills. In on-campus biology programs, students commonly develop these skills through hands-on animal dissections, but educators have struggled with how to teach dissections in an online environment. We designed a fully online undergraduate biology course that includes at-home, hands-on dissections of eight vertebrate specimens. Over three course offerings, we evaluated changes in four student outcomes: anatomical self-efficacy, confidence in laboratory skills, perceptions of support, and concerns about dissections. Here, we describe how we implemented at-home dissections in the online course and show that students taking the course gained anatomical self-efficacy and confidence in multiple laboratory skills. Based on open-ended responses, the students perceived that their experiences with the at-home dissections facilitated these gains. These results demonstrate that at-home, hands-on laboratories are a viable approach for teaching practical skills to students in fully online courses. We encourage science instructors to introduce at-home laboratories into their online courses, and we provide recommendations for instructors interested in implementing at-home laboratories.",

Cotransmission involving the simultaneous release of norepinephrine, ATP, and neuropeptide Y can easily be demonstrated in an isometric ring preparation of the rat tail artery, which is described here. The experiment clearly demonstrates the principle of cotransmission but allows more advanced concepts in autonomic cotransmission to be addressed.",

Data were collected from 56 groups of medical students that had participated in this laboratory exercise. The acquired data showed very consistent and solid findings after the development of both metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. All results were consistent with the appropriate diagnosis of the acid/base disorder.

As teachers, we are all education researchers to some degree but our appreciation of when and how regulatory requirements apply to our work is variable. A significant number of articles in Advances in Physiology Education that might be classified as \"research involving human participants\" do not document ethical safeguards such as Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, which are required according to journal policy. I elaborate my personal view that we should strive to maintain the present community standards for conducting and publishing education research. And, as always, I hope the road to hell is not paved with good intentions!",

    "abstract": "The study and teaching of gastrointestinal (GI) physiology necessitates an understanding of the cellular basis of contractile and electrical coupling behaviors in the muscle layers that comprise the gut wall. Our knowledge of the cellular origin of GI motility has drastically changed over the last 100 yr. While the pacing and coordination of GI contraction was once thought to be solely attributable to smooth muscle cells, it is now widely accepted that the motility patterns observed in the GI tract exist as a result of a multicellular system, consisting of not only smooth muscle cells but also enteric neurons and distinct populations of specialized interstitial cells that all work in concert to ensure proper GI functions. In this historical perspective, we focus on the emerging role of interstitial cells in GI motility and examine the key discoveries and experiments that led to a major shift in a paradigm of GI physiology regarding the role of interstitial cells in modulating GI contractile patterns. A review of these now classic experiments and papers will enable students and educators to fully appreciate the complex, multicellular nature of GI muscles as well as impart lessons on how shifting paradigms in physiology are fueled by new technologies that lead to new emerging discoveries.",

This thought is translated into the practice of research in the August Krogh principle, which provides argumentative support for researchers who dare to venture beyond the range of commonly used models by choosing a new experimental organism for a particular scientific question. Established model organisms often hold high exploratory power to the researcher yet little explanatory power to the student, in particular when represented in a secondary source. This essay puts forward the suggestion that Krogh's principle applies to the use of organisms as instructional models and textbook examples too and encourages educators to continuously venture beyond established illustrative teaching examples in a continuous exploration of the “book of the world” and the “treasure house of nature.”",

    "abstract": "The ability to understand and implement calculations required for molarity and dilution computations that are routinely undertaken in the laboratory are essential skills that should be possessed by all students entering an undergraduate Life Sciences degree. However, it is increasingly recognized that the majority of these students are ill equipped to reliably carry out such calculations. There are several factors that conspire against students' understanding of this topic, with the alien concept of the mole in relation to the mass of compounds and the engineering notation required when expressing the relatively small quantities typically involved being two key examples. In this report, we highlight teaching methods delivered via revision workshops to undergraduate Life Sciences students at the University of Nottingham. Workshops were designed to 1) expose student deficiencies in basic numeracy skills and remedy these deficiencies, 2) introduce molarity and dilution calculations and illustrate their workings in a step-by-step manner, and 3) allow students to appreciate the magnitude of numbers. Preworkshop to postworkshop comparisons demonstrated a considerable improvement in students' performance, which attenuated with time. The findings of our study suggest that an ability to carry out laboratory calculations cannot be assumed in students entering Life Sciences degrees in the United Kingdom but that explicit instruction in the form of workshops improves proficiency to a level of competence that allows students to prosper in the laboratory environment.",

    "abstract": "In international surveys, Brazilian students have been consistently ranking low in science. Continuing education for secondary school teachers is certainly a way to change this situation. To update teachers and provide teaching and learning experiences for graduate students, our department organized a \"Winter Course in Physiology\" where schoolteachers had the opportunity to attend lectures that were offered by graduate students and participate in discussions on teaching and learning strategies and their applicability, considering different schools and student age groups. This work evaluated the ways in which the Winter Course in Physiology improves continuing education for secondary school teachers. Graduate students prepared, presented, and discussed with the audience the concepts, content, and topics of the program, which were previously presented to the organizing committee and a supervising professor. Potential participants were recruited based on their curriculum vitae and a letter of intent. During the course, they completed a questionnaire that graded different aspects of course organization and lectures. The results indicated that the Winter Course was positively evaluated. Most topics received a grade of ≥4.0, considering a range of 1.0 (low) to 5.0 (high). In a followup, both the participants and instructors reported positive impacts on their overall knowledge in physiology. Schoolteachers reported improvements in the performance and participation of their students. In conclusion, the results suggested that the Winter Course is a good way to promote continuing education for schoolteachers and promote university outreach. It also provided an important experience for graduate students to develop teaching skills.",

Case studies represent a form of problem-based learning that engages students in realistic scenarios to achieve a deeper understanding of concepts. Case studies have been shown to facilitate the learning of challenging subject matter. We hypothesized that the use of a case study would help students better learn the topic of genomic imprinting, an abstract phenomenon in molecular biology and genetics. We wrote an interrupted case study that focused on genomic imprinting. The case study consists of three short popular news articles that relate to genomic imprinting. Each article is followed by a set of two to four questions. Students read each article and discuss its associated questions in small groups and then with the entire class before moving on to the next article. We deployed the case study in an intermediate-level molecular biology course at a small, liberal arts university. We assessed student learning and attitudes toward the case study (50 pre/postmatched pairs). In four true/false assessment questions, our results showed that the students' performance on the assessment after the case study was significantly higher than their performance before the case study. Students also self-reported increased knowledge of concepts related to genomic imprinting. Finally, students were likely to agree that the case study was beneficial to their learning and was an enjoyable classroom activity. We conclude that the case study is an effective way to instruct students about the topic of genomic imprinting.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Students often struggle with the concept of genomic imprinting, in part because it violates Mendelian rules of inheritance.

With increasing pedagogical activities being conducted in virtual or remote settings, this study assessed how a remote practical assisted by physiological monitoring smartphone applications impacted student motivation and the achievement of intended learning outcomes in exercise physiology teaching. A total of 24 students (out of 30; 80%) were surveyed via a mixed-methods questionnaire containing 27 closed-ended, and 3 the traditional in-class practical in randomized order. Unpaired Student's t tests were performed for comparisons between interventions with a significance level set at P < 0.05. Students reported that both remote and in-class practicals strongly facilitated the achievement of learning outcomes. Self-reported scores for student satisfaction and perceived achievement of learning outcomes were similar between the two practical methodologies. Student motivation scores assessed using the Lab Motivation Scale revealed that students were more motivated during the remote practical, particularly in the effort domain (P < 0.05). This was in line with the identified themes from the qualitative responses that indicated that the remote practical was more engaging than the in-person practical, with greater opportunities for experiential learning and class involvement being the main factors underlying these findings. Taken together, remote practicals can be critical aspects of a blended learning curriculum that encourages student engagement and experiential learning. With further advancements in physiological monitoring wearables and smartphone technologies, remote practicals can be potential alternatives to traditional in-person practicals in exercise physiology teaching.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Remote practical classes, supported by physiological monitoring smartphone applications, were assessed for their utility in facilitating learning and raising student motivation in health sciences education in this study. A comparison of remote practicals with traditional in-class practicals revealed that a remote practical is an effective method for reinforcing physiology learning objectives with the added advantage of increased student motivation. The added value of remote practicals may be attributed to more experiential learning opportunities and increased engagement levels.",

The English Wikipedia was searched for the selected 100 drugs, and prints of the identified articles were obtained. Readability was calculated with an online instrument (http://www.readabilityformulas.com/). Articles were independently scored by two researchers using the modified DISCERN tool for content assessment. The modified DISCERN scores had a median value of 24 [interquartile range (IQR) = 7.5]. Two articles (2%) had good quality (DISCERN score 36-40), thirty-eight (38%) were moderate (DISCERN 26-35), and sixty (60%) were poor in score (DISCERN ≤25). The articles covered drug indications and most side effects. However, the majority lacked information on the routes of administration, contraindications, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action. We found a correlation between DISCERN scores and number of edits (P value = 0.00033, R2 = 0.1238). The number of references varied from 2 to 150 (median= 17, IQR = 17). Several problems were identified in the lists of references and citations. Most articles lacked tables and figures.

The lecture includes an overview of the history of letters, the definition and purposes of letters, letter themes, examples of letters published in exercise physiology journals, and a search method for discovering letters. The student is then assigned a project comprised of two parts. Part 1 requires the student to independently discover a letter exchange in a scientific journal, including the original research article, the letter commenting on the article, and the reply to the letter. The student then writes a report that summarizes the exchange. The report includes an analysis of the letter's themes and the validity of the arguments made. Part 2 of the assignment requires the student to independently discover an article published in the past year that they believe requires comment. The student then writes a letter, commenting on the article. Students who write convincing letters can be encouraged to submit their letter to the journal. The assignment should help prepare the next generation of journal editors, reviewers, and readers for the task of preserving and participating in a practice that serves to refine knowledge.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Letters to the editor are a form of postpublication review and thus help to refine knowledge through discussion and debate, yet exercise physiology students are rarely introduced to letters in their formal education.

In all physiological systems, the structure from a microscopic level to an organ level dictates its function.\" As a framework for the structure and function core concept, the renal system was unpacked by a team of 5 Australian Physiology educators from different universities with extensive teaching experience into hierarchical levels, with 5 themes and 25 subthemes up to 3 levels deep. Within theme 1, the structures that comprise the renal system were unpacked. Within theme 2, the physiological processes within the nephron such as filtration, reabsorption, and secretion were unpacked. Within theme 3, the processes involved in micturition were unpacked. In theme 4, the structures and processes involved in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration were unpacked; and within theme 5, the role of the kidney in red blood cell production was unpacked. Twenty-one academics rated the difficulty and importance of each theme/subtheme, and results were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. All identified themes were validated as \"essential\" to \"important\"/\"moderately important\" and rated between \"difficult\" to \"not difficult.\" A similar framework consisting of structure, physiological processes, physical processes, and regulation can be used to unpack other body systems. Unpacking of the body systems will provide a list of what students should be taught in curricula across Australian universities and inform assessment and learning activities.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first attempt to unpack and validate the \"structure and function\" core concept in physiology with all Australian educators. We unpacked the renal system into themes with hierarchical levels, which were validated by an experienced team of Australian physiology educators.

However, while many students remember basic information about membrane structure, they often have difficulty relating that structure to membrane functions, such as vesicular transport, active transport, osmosis, and current flow across the membrane. To better understand what students recall about the cell membrane, students were given an open-ended prompt to draw what they know about the structure and function of the animal cell membrane. This activity was repeated 1-2 weeks after finishing discussion of the cell membrane in class, with an emphasis on the concepts of membrane transport and a related core concept, flow along gradients. Student responses were analyzed using the conceptual framework for the \"cell membrane\" core concept published by Michael and Modell (Michael J, Modell H. Adv Physiol Educ 43: 373-377, 2019). Before covering this content in class, the majority of submissions included a representation of the cell membrane as a phospholipid bilayer, and a high percentage also included membrane proteins or the fluid mosaic model. Similar percentages of students included these concepts in the postcoverage drawing. However, other components of the conceptual framework were included less frequently or not at all before covering the content in class but improved dramatically afterward. This activity provides information about what students recall from prior coursework and which concepts need to be revisited, and it can provide a complementary assessment of student understanding of the core concept of the cell membrane.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Student-constructed drawings can give insight into student understanding, and misunderstandings, of core concepts about the cell membrane.",

    "abstract": "The structure and function relationship is a core concept identified by physiology faculty. Prior research has shown this may be a difficult concept for students to understand. Formative written assessments, such as short answer essay questions, allow students to demonstrate their thinking by encouraging students to use their diverse ideas to construct their responses. Varying the context of a question, such as the inclusion of a scenario, may be used to provide insight into the different stages of students' emerging biological expertise. Short answer questions based on the core concept structure↔function were administered to students in a junior level General Physiology course and a sophomore level Human Anatomy and Physiology course at a large southeastern public university. Questions were based on the integumentary, muscular, digestive, and cardiovascular systems. Student responses were scored with a conceptual rubric developed for each question prompt as well as each organ system represented in the question prompts. Students were interviewed to determine if their responses to the short answer questions accurately reflected their thinking. Less than half of the student responses in this study demonstrated a conceptual understanding of the structure-function relationship. Students demonstrated different conceptual understanding of structure↔function concepts depending on the question prompt with a scenario versus the question prompt without a scenario. The question prompts with scenarios versus non-scenarios provided a different context, which may have influenced student explanations. These results suggest that instructors should provide students with questions in varying contexts to allow students to demonstrate their heterogeneous ideas about a concept.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Formative assessment provides feedback to both students and instructors about the process of learning. The core concept structure-function provides a foundation upon which many topics in anatomy and physiology can be built across all levels of organization. This study contributes to existing research about student conceptual understanding of the core concepts. Implications for practitioners include the design of formative assessments and a suite of questions to be used to gauge student understanding of structure-function.",

The Core Concepts of Physiology: a New Paradigm for Teaching Physiology, 2017). Concepts were selected for their suitability in an introductory physiology unit and their ability to scaffold advanced physiology learning. Innovative curricular and pedagogical approaches were employed to 1) create a Core Concepts structure, 2) sell the Core Concepts approach to students, 3) foreground Core Concepts in learning materials, 4) actively engage students with Core Concepts, 5) revise, and 6) assess Core Concepts understanding. Median student marks and overall satisfaction with the unit were unaffected by the introduction of a Core Concepts approach.

    "abstract": "In exercise physiology, laboratory components help students connect theoretical concepts to their own exercise experiences and introduce them to data collection, analysis, and interpretation using classic techniques. Most courses include a lab protocol that involves exhaustive incremental exercise during which expired gas volumes and concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide are measured. During these protocols, there are characteristic alterations in gas exchange and ventilatory profiles that give rise to two exercise thresholds: the gas exchange threshold (GET) and the respiratory compensation point (RCP). The ability to explain why these thresholds occur and how they are identified is fundamental to learning in exercise physiology and requisite to the understanding of core concepts including exercise intensity, prescription, and performance. Proper identification of GET and RCP requires the assembly of eight data plots. In the past, the burden of time and expertise required to process and prepare data for interpretation has been a source of frustration. In addition, students often express a desire for more opportunities to practice/refine their skills. The objective of this article is to share a blended laboratory model that features the \"Exercise Thresholds App,\" a free online resource that eliminates postprocessing of data and provides a bank of profiles on which end-users can practice threshold identification skills with immediate feedback. In addition to including prelaboratory and postlaboratory recommendations, we present student accounts of understanding, engagement, and satisfaction following completion of the laboratory experience and introduce a new quiz feature of the app to assist instructors with evaluating student learning.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We present a laboratory to study exercise thresholds from gas exchange and ventilatory measures that features the \"Exercise Thresholds App,\" a free online resource that eliminates postprocessing of data and provides a bank of profiles on which end-users can practice threshold identification skills.

    "abstract": "Mass balance (MB) reasoning offers a rich topic for examination of students' scientific thinking and skills, as it requires students to account for multiple inputs and outputs within a system and apply covariational reasoning. Using previously validated constructed response prompts for MB, we examined 1,920 student-constructed responses (CRs) aligned to an emerging learning progression to determine how student language changes from low (1) to high (4) covariational reasoning levels. As students' abilities and thinking change with Context, we used the same general prompt in six physiological contexts. We asked how Level and Context affect student language and what language is conserved across Contexts at higher reasoning Levels. Using diversity methods, we found student language becomes more similar as covariational reasoning level increases. Using text analysis, we found context-dependent words at each Level; however, the type of context words changed. Specifically, at Level 1, students used context words that are tangential to MB reasoning, while Level 4 responses used words that specify inputs and outputs for the given Item Context. Further, at Level 4, students shared 30% of language across the six contexts and leveraged context-independent words including rate, equal, and some form of slower/lower/smaller. Together, these data demonstrate that Context affects undergraduate MB language at all covariational reasoning levels, but that the language becomes more specific and similar as Level increases. These findings encourage instructors to foster context-independent, comparative, and summative language during instruction to functionally build MB and covariational reasoning skills across contexts.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article builds on the work of Scott et al.

The primary aim is to advance the competency relating to good nutrition knowledge for future health professionals to enable them to guide and counsel patients and clients toward better health. A review of the literature provides scant nutritional content relating to vegetable intake, particularly across physiology subjects and health professional programs in general.

    "abstract": "Application-of-knowledge skills are highly valued in clinical medicine, as indicated by recent changes to licensure and entrance exams for nursing and physician programs (i.e., the NCLEX and MCAT). Such emphasis should be both welcomed and supported by approaches to teaching human anatomy and physiology that emphasize critical thinking skills built upon logic, reasoning, and judgment. The argument for development of these skills is not simply philosophical. Rather, such emphasis is strongly supported by a 2016 Johns Hopkins study (Makary MA, Daniel M. BMJ 353: i2139, 2016) that estimates that medical errors are now the third leading cause of death in the United States! Active learning techniques known to require critical thinking skills are often supplemental to standard expository lecturing or other avenues of imparting content knowledge (reading, videos, etc.). We propose that all content dissemination can and should provide for the development of critical thinking skills, preparing students for active learning techniques requiring this ability. This can be accomplished by establishing an intellectual framework for understanding the adaptive benefits of anatomical or physiological traits. Additionally, explanations conveying the causality of mechanistic sequences result in learning content within intuitive functional groups rather than as isolated phenomena, the latter often accomplished mainly through memorization as opposed to real understanding. Here, we provide a template for lecture development based upon these principles as well as a specific example from human anatomy and physiology. Our hope is to provide a model for how students should think about all physiology, making comprehensive coverage of content (an impossible task!) much less important.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Critical thinking skills are essential to the effective performance of many careers, particularly those involving health care. To aid the development of these skills in physiology, the formation of logical cognitive frameworks needs to be supported via instruction that emphasizes the context of physiological functions (the \"why\") as well as the causality of their sequential actions. Within such frameworks, students become capable of cognitive reasoning required to reach intuitive conclusions after system perturbations.",

A beaver must maintain a constant water level in the pond for the proper functioning of the lodge, just as blood glucose is maintained for, among other reasons, brain function. The beaver controls the water level by changing outflow over the dam and inflow from stream beds. Water flow over the dam is analogous to glucose leaving the blood for tissues, which is controlled by insulin. Inflow of water from streams is analogous to glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and glucose release from the liver, the latter being controlled by glucagon and other counterregulatory hormones. The analogy is extended by considering the effects of exercise in normal and diabetic individuals on blood glucose levels.",

    "abstract": "A mechanical analog of the human lung-chest wall system was developed in Fribourg and Geneva Universities, Switzerland, to help students understand chest-lung statics. The equipment comprises a lung bellows, with upper airway connected to a three-way manifold, and a transparent chest whose lower part is another bellows that can be mobilized manually. Two water manometers measure intrapulmonary and intrathoracic pressures. The pressure-volume relationships of the lung-chest wall analog, which are essentially determined by the diameters of the bellows and the strains imposed by steel coils, closely parallel those of the human respiratory system. The chest can be opened to demonstrate pneumothorax. A first, guided manipulation of the model at the physiology laboratory provides excellent preparation for--or useful complement to--a human subject experiment on chest-lung statics. Unguided, further use of the model provides an opportunity for students to teach each other. Since the model is used, mean score on chest-lung statics at the practical examination is as good as that on other, more easy subjects.",

As a result, we have developed a physical model of the gastrointestinal tract, which is used in the GI sections of our medical and graduate physiology courses to demonstrate ingested, secreted, reabsorbed, and excreted fluid volumes by the human digestive tract in a typical 24-h period.The model was built on a four-tiered homemade shelving system (Fig. 1) assembled from lumber and other materials obtained from a local home improvement center (a list of materials and assembly instructions can be obtained upon request from the author). The tiered shelves make it possible for fluids to flow between the various containers by gravity when the model is in operation. The containers used for the model consisted of a 2-liter plastic soft-drink bottle filled with water (or water with food coloring added) to simulate the typical 24-h dietary fluid intake (A), a 2-liter clear glass bottle with an outlet containing 1.5 liters of water containing food coloring to simulate 24-h salivary secretion (B), a large funnel to simulate the oral cavity (C), a 5-liter clear glass bottle with an outlet to simulate the stomach containing 1 liter of colored water (the equivalent of the volume of gastric juice produced in 24 h (D), a 10- or l5-liter clear glass bottle or carboy with a side inlet to simulate the small intestine containing 1–2 liters of colored water (to simulate the 24-h production of intestinal secretions (E), a 2-liter bottle with outlet to simulate the liver containing the equivalent of the volume of bile produced in 24 h (0.5–1 liter of colored water (F), a 2-liter bottle with outlet to simulate the exocrine pancreas containing 1 liter of colored water (the equivalent of pancreatic juice produced in 24 h (G), a 4-liter bottle with outlet to simulate the colon (H), a 100-ml beaker (I), and a 3-liter bottle (J). The latter two containers are used to show, respectively, the volume of water normally excreted in feces in 24 h and the plasma volume. A small recirculating pump (K) is used to simulate “reabsorption” of fluid from intestine.The model is operated by first identifying for the students what the containers represent and the volumes of fluid they contain. Then the contents of the “dietary liquids” bottle (A) are poured into the funnel (C). Next, the stopper is removed from the tubing from the “salivary gland” bottle (B) and the “saliva” is allowed to flow into the funnel. These fluids mix in the “stomach” (D), and the combined volume is allowed to drain into the “intestine” (E) by removing the he-mostat that clamps the connecting tubing. As the fluid from the “stomach” container flows into the “intestine” carboy, the hemostat clamping the tubing from the “liver” (F) and “pancreas” (G) containers is released, simulating the relaxation of the Sphincter of Oddi. As fluids flow into the “intestine” container, the “reabsorption” pump (K) is activated, pumping fluid from the “intestine” carboy into the “plasma volume” container (J). Water is also allowed to drain from the “intestine” carboy to the “colon” bottle (H). After 1–2 liters have drained, 100 ml of fluid are removed from the “colon” into a small beaker (I) to simulate the amount of water normally excreted in the feces. At this time, it is also possible to discuss the volumes of water that are excreted with common diarrhea or with more serious conditions like cholera. The explanation and operation of the model requires ∼10–15 min. The only problems we have encountered are an occasional leaky connection and slow “reabsorption” flow from the pump. Students find this demonstration interesting and sometimes humorous (if leaks develop) as they learn and review fluid handling by the GI tract.

Advan Physiol Educ 25: 53–61, 2001. Significant differences exist among textbook definitions for the terms preload and afterload, leading to confusion and frustration among students and faculty alike. Many faculty also chose to use in their teaching simple terms such as “end-diastolic volume” or “aortic pressure” as common-usage approximations of preload and afterload, respectively, but these are only partial representations of these important concepts. Straightforward definitions both of preload and afterload that are concise yet still comprehensive can be developed using the Law of LaPlace to describe the relationships among chamber pressure, chamber radius, and wall thickness. Within this context, the term “preload” can be defined as all of the factors that contribute to passive ventricular wall stress (or tension) at the end of diastole, and the term “afterload” can be defined as all of the factors that contribute to total myocardial wall stress (or tension) during systolic ejection. The inclusion of “wall stress” in both definitions helps the student appreciate both the complexities of cardiac pathophysiology and the rationale for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have recently highlighted a number of limitations in medical textbooks. The aims of this study were to 1) to assess whether available medical textbooks provided students with adequate information about bile salt transporters, 2) compare the level of detail and the amount of information provided in current textbooks on hepatic transport mechanisms with those available in the literature, and 3) compare the amount of information provided in medical textbooks on hepatocyte transport mechanisms with those involving other transporters e.g., those found in the nephron. Seventy medical textbooks from disciplines including physiology, pathology, cell biology, medicine, pediatrics, pharmacology, pathophysiology, and histology published during the past six years were examined. The literature on bile salt transport has been searched mainly from the Internet (MEDLINE and PubMed). Most textbooks failed to provide any information on transporters found in the basolateral and canalicular membranes of hepatocytes. There are also deficiencies in information on bile salt transporters in the terminal ileum. However, up to the end of 2002, 3,610 articles and reviews had been published on hepatobiliary and enterocyte transport of bile salts. During the same period (from 1965), 10,757 articles had been published on renal transport. Thus the contents of textbooks may reflect the overall volume of research knowledge on renal transport. However, despite our current understanding of hepatic and intestinal transport of bile salts and extensive research, particularly over the past 12 years, there are major deficiencies in textbooks in this area. These findings indicate that there is an imbalance in the contents of current textbooks and a lack of information about hepatobiliary physiology, bile salt transporters, bile formation, and mechanisms underlying cholestasis and drug-induced injury. Authors, editors, and publishers of medical textbooks should consider the need to update the information provided on bile salt transporters.",

This SEA requires each student to choose a topic among a long list of topics and interact with it in any way to produce a finished product without the interference of the course instructor. Students are told that the SEA will be graded based on their commitment, creative thinking, innovation in developing the idea, and finishing up of the chosen assignment. The SEA has been implemented in three introductory courses, namely, Biology, Introduction to Human Nutrition and Food Science, and The Human Body. Many interesting projects resulted from the SEA, and, based on an administered survey, students assessed this assignment very favorably. Students expressed their pleasure of experiencing freedom in choosing their own topics, interacting with such topics, learning more about them, and finishing up their projects. Students appreciated this type of exposure to biological sciences and expressed that such an experience enhanced their interest in such sciences.",

As per the modified Henderson equation, the pH of arterial plasma would be 7.4; however, we explain that this may be associated with intracellular acidosis due to intracellular hypercapnia and that derangement of homeostasis is evident from the occurrence of respiratory depression and, eventually, coma in the patient described.

In taking this notion further, antibodies have been used in vivo to modulate physiological systems and to improve our understanding of their molecular interactions. To develop antibodies with physiological activity (efficacy), physiologists have worked with immunologists in developing interdisciplinary insights, requiring basic knowledge of immune system function in designing strategies to generate antibodies that interact with endogenous molecules of physiological interest, in vivo. Antibodies in different physiological systems have been shown to enhance or inhibit endogenous molecular functions. Two approaches have been used: passive and active immunization. Antibodies in these contexts have provided tools to develop further insights into molecular physiological mechanisms. Perhaps surprisingly, enhancing antibodies have been developed against a diverse set of target molecules including several members of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axes and those of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor axis. Antibodies that inhibit the actions of somatostatin have also been developed. A further novel approach has been the development of antibodies that interact with adipose cells in vivo. These have the potential to be used in therapeutic antiobesity approaches. Antibodies with efficacy in vivo have provided new insights into molecular physiological mechanisms, enhancing our understanding of these complex processes.",

A classic paper that is useful in both of these regards is by I. E. Lawton and N. B. Schwartz (A circadian rhythm of luteinizing hormone secretion in ovariectomized rats. Am J Physiol 214: 213–217, 1968). The primary objective of the study is to determine whether tonic (pulsatile) secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland exhibits a circadian rhythm. While this hypothesis seems relatively straightforward, its in vivo investigation necessitates an awareness of the multitude of factors, in addition to the circadian clock, that can influence plasma LH levels (and a consideration of how to control for these factors in the experimental design). Furthermore, discussion of the historical context in which the study was conducted (i.e., before the pulsatile nature of LH secretion had been discovered) provides students with the realistic perspective that science is not a set of facts but rather a systematic series of attempts by scientists to understand reality (a perspective that is difficult to convey using a traditional textbook alone). A review of the historical context in which the study was conducted, and a series of discovery learning questions are included to facilitate classroom discussions and to help deepen students' understanding of the complex nature of pituitary hormone regulation.",

To encourage active participation by the students, a discussion question is provided before the laboratory exercise in which each student is asked to search the literature and provide written answers to questions and to formulate an experiment to test the role of ovarian estrogen in inducing implantation in female rats. One week before the laboratory exercise, students discuss their answers to the questions with the instructor to develop an experiment to test their hypothesis that estrogen is involved with inducing implantation in the rat. A rat delayed implantation model was established that utilizes an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780), which inhibits the action of ovarian estrogens. Groups of mated females are treated with either carrier (control) or ICI 182,780 (ICI) every other day, starting on day 2 postcoitus (pc) until day 8 pc. One-half of the females receiving ICI are injected with estradiol-17β on day 8 pc to induce implantation 4 days after the controls. If the ICI-treated females are not administered estradiol, embryo implantation occurs spontaneously ~4 days after the last ICI injection on day 8. This is a very simple protocol that is very effective and provides an excellent experiment for student discussion on hormone action and the use of agonists and antagonists.",

    "abstract": "The Kansas-IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (K-INBRE) is an infrastructure-building program funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Undergraduate education, through undergraduate research, is a key component of the program. The K-INBRE network includes 10 higher education institutions in Kansas and northern Oklahoma, with over 1,000 student participants in 16 yr. Since 2003, the K-INBRE has held an annual state-wide research symposium that includes national and regional speakers and provides a forum for undergraduates to give platform and poster presentations. The symposium is well attended by K-INBRE participants and has grown to a size of over 300 participants per year from all 10 K-INBRE schools. Two surveys were distributed to students and mentors to assess the impact of the symposium on student learning. Surveys (153) were distributed to students who participated in K-INBRE from 2013 through 2015 with a 51% response rate. Mentors were surveyed with a response of 111 surveys out of 161. Survey results indicate that students and mentors alike find the symposium to be beneficial and enriching of the student experience. Almost 80% of student respondents indicated that their participation in the symposium fostered appreciation of research. In short, the K-INBRE symposium provides a unique opportunity for students to gain experience in collecting, preparing, and communicating research in a professional environment. The collaborative experience of the annual K-INBRE symposium, the impact it has on student learning, and how it has influenced the research culture at our 10 institutions will be described.",

Accordingly, textbook publishers are developing supplemental resources that are purported to improve student learning outcomes by encouraging deep learning and critical thinking. The purpose of this study is to 1) survey students in a physiology course about their use of multiple course resources; and 2) assess the effect of self-reported engagement in course resources on learning outcomes, as assessed by comparing course grades. Students who had completed an undergraduate physiology course were sent an online survey about their course experience; two reminders were e-mailed. Students were asked to report their physiology course grade, satisfaction with how much they had learned, which resources they had used, and how they had completed course assignments (critical thinking exercises and online quizzes), i.e., whether they had 1) looked up answers online, 2) looked up answers in the textbook, 3) tried to figure out the answers before using the textbook, or 4) only used their recall. Categories 1 and 2 were considered nonretrieval strategies, and categories 3 and 4 were considered retrieval strategies. There was no association with the type of resource students used and course grade or course satisfaction. Students who practiced retrieval strategies achieved significantly higher course grades than students who did not for both critical thinking exercises and online quizzes.",

    "abstract": "Developing hands-on activities that engage and excite K-12 students is critical for stimulating interest in science-based careers. We created an activity for high school students that required them to integrate biology and physics concepts to experience how humans and animals maneuver through their environments (i.e., turning). Understanding how turning works is important because it accounts for up to 50% of daily walking steps and is needed for survival when animals elude predators and capture prey. For this activity, student groups used 2 × 4 lumber, wood screws, and a power drill to build an apparatus that, when connected to the body, altered rotational inertia (object's resistance to change in angular motion, I = mass × radius2). Students navigated through a slalom course with the apparatus (increased radius and rotational inertia) and without the apparatus (mass-matched control). Times to complete the course were compared between trials to determine the influence of rotational inertia on turning performance. Students compiled their data, graphed their results, and found that increased rotational inertia decreased turning performance. Results were connected to sports, rehabilitation, and dinosaur evolution. This activity was implemented during local, regional, national, and international outreach events and adapted for use in undergraduate courses as well (total impact, 250 students). At the end of the activity, students were able to 1) describe whether their results supported their hypothesis; 2) explain how radius influences rotational inertia and turning performance; and 3) apply results to real-world examples. Students and teachers appreciated this \"outside-the-box\" activity with an engineering twist and found it entertaining.",

However, research demonstrates that, when instructors utilize active learning approaches (such as in laboratory settings) where students participate in their own learning, students have improved outcomes, such as higher test scores and better retention of material. To provide community college students with opportunities for active learning in physiology, we developed two laboratory exercises to engage students in cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology. We utilized low-cost SpikerBox devices to measure electrical activity during cardiac (electrocardiogram) and skeletal muscle (electromyogram) contraction. Laboratory activities were employed in Anatomy and Physiology courses at two community colleges in southeast Michigan. A 2-h laboratory period was structured with a 20-min slide presentation covering background material on the subject and experiments to examine the effects of environmental variables on nervous system control of cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction. Students were asked to provide hypotheses and proposed mechanisms, complete a results section, and provide conclusions for the experiments based on their results. Our laboratory exercises improved student learning in physiology and knowledge of the scientific method and were well-received by community college students enrolled in Anatomy and Physiology. Our results demonstrate that the use of a SpikerBox for cardiac and skeletal muscle physiology concepts is a low-cost and effective approach to integrate physiology activities into an Anatomy and Physiology course.",

Gameful learning, a pedagogy supporting student-driven learning, can further reinforce the development of peer evaluation skills, if students are motivated to improve upon them. To better understand the effects of a peer evaluation training on the quality of student-generated peer evaluations, we scored peer evaluations from two cohorts taking a graduate-level nutritional sciences class using gameful learning pedagogy. The intervention group completed a peer evaluation training before engaging in peer reviews, while the control group did not. The training included two readings, a video, and reflection questions. The peer evaluations submitted by both the intervention and control groups were assessed on a validated rubric. The peer evaluation training had a positive effect on the quality of the submitted peer evaluations. The intervention group had a 10.8% higher score on its first submitted peer evaluation compared with controls ( P = 0.003). The intervention group improved the quality of its future submissions by a further 8.9%, whereas the controls did not continue to improve substantially ( P &lt; 0.001). Overall, peer review training enhanced the quality of peer evaluations and allowed students to develop professional skills that they can utilize in any biomedical profession. Our results highlight the importance of peer evaluation training in combination with repeated practice and student-driven learning brought forth by gameful learning pedagogy in improving the quality of evaluations and developing professional skills.",

In medical laboratories, flow cytometers are used to quantify changes in cell populations associated with disease states, such as AIDS. While a powerful technique, it is challenging to teach the principles of flow cytometry to undergraduate students. One approach is to have students process and analyze a patient sample. However, this is not possible when the patient has an infectious disease. Here we report a two-stage approach to address this challenge. Magnetic beads were used to manipulate leukocytes cell populations in healthy blood to mimic the phenotype of eight immune disease conditions. The cells were then stained against cell surface markers for cell populations and analyzed by flow cytometry. The second stage focused on teaching flow cytometry over 2 wk. Week 1 involved a lecture, followed by a laboratory session where students learned how to stain a blood sample. In week 2, students worked in a computer pool to analyze the previously generated data and determine the immunological status of a control and patient sample. Using this approach, all students achieved 100% correct diagnosis of both control and patient samples. Student feedback via a questionnaire was overwhelmingly positive, and student perceived knowledge of flow cytometry increased after the session significantly. We effectively mimicked several disease states, eliminating the need to source patient samples, yet still teaching undergraduate students the principles of flow cytometry.",

    "abstract": "Access to knowledge has never been easier in the internet age, and so it is important that students develop skills to discriminate undependable information from reliably investigated research. We have created an exercise that teaches good research practice by exploring the history, ethics, and design of clinical trials. Students apply their understanding of these principles through an assessed systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) exercise. Here, a clinically themed hypothesis is tested using a structured literature search in conjunction with an eligibility matrix to map study design, ethics, subject selection, randomization and blinding, methodological standards, study power, and other potential sources of interstudy heterogeneity. Data extracted from selected studies are used to produce a forest plot with an aggregated effect size, confidence range, and measure of interstudy heterogeneity. A funnel plot is then used in conjunction with the eligibility matrix to evaluate study bias tendency, and, in this way, students reflect on the factors that promote disparate conclusion-making among studies with a common research focus. This exercise produced a normally distributed grade-profile across three academic-year cohorts, and comparison of individual exercise grade with year-long aggregated average suggested students who performed less well on conventional assignments engaged successfully with the systematic nature of this assessment. Those opting to use this format for their final-year capstone project also performed above their grade point average from the preceding year. We suggest that SRMA offers a readily applied method for students to quantitatively explore how differences in experimental research practices influence study dependability.",

The proposed exercise examines cutaneous water loss using gelatin frogs. The use of models provides a unique approach to learning about water loss without the need of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval or specialized equipment to measure dehydration from relatively small invertebrates. The first described hands-on experiment examines gelatin frogs of different sizes to understand how surface area-to-volume ratio impacts water loss. The second experiment exposes gelatin models to various conditions, such as convective air currents (wind) or extreme temperature, to understand how abiotic factors influence the vapor pressure deficit between the animal and environment and thus water loss. These easily adaptable activities use everyday household items and can be scaled accordingly to classes of different sizes and academic levels. Thus these flexible exercises can be approached through facilitated, guided, or open inquiry, as students formulate hypotheses, design the experiments, create graphs, and interpret the data through answering questions or a write up.",

The purpose of this report is to preliminarily describe the collective curriculum of physiology programs represented at the Physiology Majors Interest Group (P-MIG) annual meetings from 2018 to 2019. A short preconference survey was sent to attendees that inquired about degree requirements of their respective physiology programs. The requirement for Physiology I (69.2%) with laboratory (66.7%) and Anatomy I (57.1%) with laboratory (42.9%), or combined Anatomy and Physiology I (16.7%) and laboratory (18.2%), were common requirements, but many programs did not require Physiology II (27.3%) or Anatomy II (11.1%). There was nearly consensus on required prerequisites such as Biology (2 semesters with laboratories, 85.7%), Chemistry (2 semesters with laboratory, 88.9%), Physics (2 semesters with laboratory, 75%), Calculus I (61.1%), and Statistics (Biostatistics 42.9%; General Statistics 13.3%). There was less agreement among programs in regards to Calculus II (20.0%), Organic Chemistry (2 semesters, 55.6%), and Biochemistry I (47%), which may be reflective of individual department focus. There was considerable heterogeneity among physiology program course requirements for disciplinary core courses and upper division electives. This report is meant to generate discussion on physiology program curricula in efforts to improve physiology education for majors and assist P-MIG in determining minimal points of consensus as they write the first set of national curricular guidelines for degree programs.",

Furthermore, inculcation of physiology knowledge may lead to an increased likelihood of career goals that align with this area of study. In pursuit of these goals, we set out to educate middle and high school students about diabetes. Thirty (16 high school; 14 middle school) students from a Sunday school program at an urban religious center completed a 10-question pretest as a way to measure initial knowledge about diabetes. Following completion of the survey, a 1-h education session was presented by a local physician who also brought a glucometer and insulin syringes for students to have a hands-on experience with some disease-specific tools. A posttest was administered following the presentation. The posttest consisted of 11 questions, where all but 2 questions were the same as for the pretest, measuring improvement of prior knowledge and engagement in the presentation. The overall posttest average score increased by approximately two correct responses, which was a significant improvement ( P &lt; 0.0001), suggesting that the students were motivated to and did learn diabetes concepts. This study also suggests that exposing students to educational activities related to physiology is beneficial and may lead to an increase in interest in physiology, an awareness of diabetes, and perhaps the development of healthy habits.",

    "abstract": "Although active learning works, promoting it in large undergraduate science classes is difficult. Here, three students (F. Naji, L. Salci, and G. Hoit) join their teacher (P. K. Rangachari) in describing one such attempt. Two cohorts in a first-year undergraduate biology course explored the molecular underpinnings of human misbehavior. Students were divided into 18 groups and randomly allotted to deal with one of the four deadly sins: sloth, gluttony, lust, and wrath. Students were expected to read primary sources to devise molecular ways to counter these sins. Group progress was monitored over the 12-wk period by the preceptor (P. K. Rangachari) at scheduled intervals. A single randomly selected student was questioned about the work done, and future directions were provided by the preceptor. At the end of the term, randomly selected students defended their group's approaches to the entire class. A final written report was graded. The following multiple target molecules were considered for each sin: gluttony (cholecystokinin, ghrelin, GABA, leptin, peptide YY, neuropeptide Y, and the melanocortin 4 receptor); sloth (dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and orexin); wrath (serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2); and lust (prolactin, testosterone, oxytocin, dopamine, and estrogen). Students noted that the project provided a valuable learning experience, and the random selection approach gave students a greater sense of responsibility to their group. The project helped students hone their skills at searching, synthesizing, sharing, and presenting information, fostered group interactions, and provided a solid knowledge base for subsequent courses.",

    "abstract": "A wide variety of cellular processes use molecular motors, including processive motors that move along some form of track (e.g., myosin with actin, kinesin or dynein with tubulin) and polymerases that move along a template (e.g., DNA and RNA polymerases, ribosomes). In trying to understand how these molecular motors actually move, many apply their understanding of how man-made motors work: the latter use some form of energy to exert a force or torque on its load. However, quite a different mechanism has been proposed to possibly account for the movement of molecular motors. Rather than hydrolyzing ATP to push or pull their load, they might use their own thermal vibrational energy as well as that of their load and their environment to move the load, capturing those movements that occur along a desired vector or axis and resisting others; ATP hydrolysis is required to make backward movements impossible. This intriguing thermal capture or Brownian ratchet model is relatively more difficult to convey to students. In this report, we describe several teaching aids that are very easily constructed using widely available household materials to convey the concept of a molecular ratchet.",

When told that he had died, the acerbic writer Dorothy Parker remarked, “How could they tell?” Telling if something has not happened is a perennial problem in science, particularly so in laboratory experiments. Why should this be?In the case of Cal Coolidge, they probably could tell. But in science, random events make it hard to tell, with certainty. There are also different ways of “telling”. Mortality is a good categorical measure, an unequivocal endpoint. When diagnostic tests are used to define categories, we meet the concepts of “false positive” and “false negative”. Here, we use the expression “false” to indicate that the conclusion we drew from the test would be incorrect. In the example we use below, we have a test for “alive”. If we know the true condition, we can classify test results as true or false. Classifying a dead animal as alive would be a false positive. True and false are words usually applied to a diagnosis or similar categorical events but also crop up in other aspects of statistical inference. Categorical analysis and categorical logic (it's either there or it isn't) are not the same as the frequentist logic (the likelihood is small) that is used in common statistical analysis, and this leads to a great deal of argument and misunderstanding. Our previous comment that statistics has an impoverished vocabulary rings true: in this instance, the concepts of false positive and false negative conclusions are applied in different ways to different procedures, causing confusion.Considering categories, imagine that a pool that has become overheated in the sun: some of the frogs in it have died. Our observations suggest that the frogs on the surface of the pool are still alive, and the ones at the bottom of the pool are dead. Is this correct? A random sample produces the data in Figure 1.Fig. 1.Example data.Download figureDownload PowerPointNot all the frogs on the surface are alive. If we used “on the surface” to indicate being alive, we would falsely attribute life to 10 frogs. Since 107 frogs are dead, this is a false positive rate of 10/107 (which we only know if we have an unequivocal means of determining death). The positive predictive power of the test for life being present, if we were to look at the next frog on the surface, would be 80/90.Unfortunately, expressions such as sensitivity, false positive, and so on can be used in two different senses. Here we assume we already have an exact means to determine death, much in the way that some statistics theory will start by defining a population. Thus we consider that the false positive rate of our test for “alive” is the proportion of dead frogs on the surface, expressed as a proportion of the frogs that really ARE dead. An alternative view would be if we were to consider the proportion of frogs on the surface that are later found to be dead, we would then be considering the outcome of the test. The diagnostic false positive rate would be 10/90. This is a diagnostic probability, and this form is less commonly used.Many diagnostic tests don't rely on categories like this: a continuous variable is often used to distinguish categories. Suppose we measure the blood lactate concentration in frogs that are still alive, and relate these concentrations to subsequent survival, we might obtain the results shown in Figure 2.Fig. 2.Plasma lactate values in frogs after overheating, related to survival. The groups are different (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The median value for survivors is 1.29 and for non-survivors, 1.86 (mmol·l−1).Download figureDownload PowerPointAlthough the median concentrations are different, some frogs with high lactate concentrations can survive. Is there a particular lactate concentration that will distinguish survival from non-survival? The capacity to predict outcome (sensitivity and specificity) alters as we choose different cut-off values. Using a series of cut-off values we can plot sensitivity and (1 − specificity) for each chosen value (Figure 3). This is known as a receiver-operator characteristic curve, or ROC curve, because one of its first applications was to find how operators of radar receivers distinguish “real” echoes from background noise. In this case, we are looking for survivors using a lactate concentration that is less than the cut-off value we have chosen.Fig. 3.A receiver operator characteristic curve for the capacity of a lactate concentration below a chosen value to predict survival. An effective diagnostic test should have a large area below the curve, which would show a combination of good sensitivity and specificity. Since tests vary, so does opinion about the area below the curve that indicates a good test. It should be substantially greater that 50%, which would be no better than chance alone, and the closer to 100% the better.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe large overlap of individual values between the two groups in Figure 2 suggests that lactate concentration is a poor indicator of survival, as there is no value that combines useful specificity and sensitivity. Any cut-off values we could choose would have too many false positive or false negative conclusions. Despite this, there is a statistically significant difference according to the Mann-Whitney test, showing that a significant difference doesn't mean the measure is the basis of a good diagnostic test.In other forms of statistical inference, an expression such as “false positive” is less appropriate and is often not well defined, hidden in the logic of these tests. For example, the t test does not provide black or white conclusions: statistical inference is restricted to judging how large a part chance could play in what we observe. Frequentist statistical tests such as the t tests are measures of uncertainty. The usual laboratory experiment question “do these data show an effect?” has to be worded “are these samples statistically different?” As we know, the question then is re-worded “How likely are these results if the samples came from the same population?” Let's say our test result is that P = 0.01, which would usually be taken to indicate there is an “effect”. This is not so: this P value is the probability that we conclude there is an effect, and we still could be wrong. Although small, a chance still exists that we would be wrong, about 1 in 100 times. This is known as the α error, the possibility that we might classify our result as showing an effect, when in fact there is none. In the long run, if we were to repeatedly sample two populations that actually were the same, then results like the ones we found would be found 1 in 100 times. This is sometimes called the “false positive” rate. However, it's based on the premise that there is NO difference and is perhaps better called the “false conclusion” rate.Reasoning for “no effect” is even less certain, and also often misconstrued. If the P value is 0.12, then we judge that the results are quite possible, assuming the data are from the same population. If we did the same experiment again and again, then we might obtain data like this in almost 1 out of 8 experiments. Is this unlikely? We usually choose to decide this is quite likely, and thus do not reject the null hypothesis: if we rejected it, the chance of a false conclusion is too great. This “chance of a false conclusion” is often misleadingly called a “false negative rate”. The hypothesis the test uses, which is the NULL hypothesis, is resoundingly negative; there are no positive results lurking here. Positive results come if we are persuaded, by an estimate of probability (the P value), that the null hypothesis is not tenable.The context of the question “is there an effect?” is relevant. The consequence of the answer “no effect” may be unimportant. However, in some cases the consequence of concluding that there is no difference, because a difference is not apparent, could be devastating. How often do we hear the claim “there is no evidence that X is toxic?” to assert that X is not toxic? Immediately, the sceptic will ask how toxic, and how much evidence? The statistician may add another qualification: how much variation is present?A reasonable example (not a perfect analogy) is the radar operator: there is a greater certainty about a blip on the screen if the signal is large (accept the answer only if it's very likely), if you can keep looking at the screen (improve the sample size), and if there is not a lot of background noise (Figure 4).Fig. 4.In each of these examples of signal averaging, there is an identical signal with added random noise. The signal is more easily seen if the noise is reduced (vertical arrow). Signal detection is improved by taking more samples to allow more averaging (horizontal arrow). The final feature of signal detection is how certain we wish to be (from “just discernible” to “barn door”) that the event is not random (a concept analogous to the P value).Download figureDownload PowerPointIn this example, a signal is always present, but we just can't be sure in all the cases. This is equally so when statistics are applied to the null hypothesis. We have to consider the β error: the possibility that we might classify our result as showing no effect where in fact there could be a difference. To demonstrate, consider two populations that are known to be different, as shown in Figure 5.Fig. 5.A: Random samples from two different populations, low and high, where the population means differ by 0.1 mmol·l−1. A t test finds the P values shown. B: A valuable further analysis that should be applied before erroneously assuming “no difference” is to inspect the 90% confidence limits of the difference between the means. This indicates the size of the possible differences.Download figureDownload PowerPointHere, a small sample of 20 per group, and a small true difference between the groups, does not reject the null hypothesis, with a P value of 0.05. In this particular case, there is indeed a true difference in the populations from which these samples have been taken, but the power of the test applied has been inadequate. The power of a test is the chance of finding a defined difference: a power of 90% would mean that there was only a 10% chance of failing to find a difference of the defined magnitude. Thus power is (1 − β). The 10% false negative conclusion rate, or β error, is also known as a type II error. Some call this a “false negative” but this could be misleading since there is never a “true” negative here.The frequentist definition is that if the experiment were repeated over and over, the conclusion would be incorrect occasionally, and the rate is the β error. For the example we have chosen, the relationships between power, sample size and the difference we seek to detect are shown in Figure 6.Fig. 6.Using the samples in Figure 4, the power of the test (the chance of finding a specified difference between samples, given that it exists) is shown, where n = 20 and n = 40, for two different P values. The populations that provided the example data in Figure 4 were different, by 0.1 mmol·l−1, indicated by the vertical dotted line. If P is accepted at 0.05 and n = 40, the power of the test is only about 40%.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe retrospective use of power calculations has been often criticized, but this is usually because the authors were seeking to reject a null hypothesis (they would have liked to find a difference). If a null hypothesis cannot be rejected, this is not sufficient evidence that there is NO difference. Claiming “no difference” can be a serious error. If we wish to convince ourselves, and others, that there is no difference, we must be sure that the test was capable of rejecting a specifically defined difference, if it were present. If a small difference is considered important, and variation in the population is substantial, then a small sample will be inadequate. Put simply, the study is underpowered. Although there are software packages to calculate power, a simple approach for a simple two group comparison is to plot the 90% confidence limits of the difference between the means (Figure 5B). This will show the likely range of differences that could be detected.The logical error (concluding that no significant difference is equivalent to the same) is frequently made worse when test results are compared, for example: the effect of substance A causes a significant difference, but substance B does not; thus A has more effect than B. As we explain above, several factors, not explicitly stated, could affect this result. It could well be that B has a greater, but more varied, effect.Because most tests are looking for a positive, many scientists fail to consider negatives adequately. In the old song “Accentuate the positive” the accomplished song writer Johnny Mercer also cautioned to “eliminate the negative, don't mess with Mr In-Between”.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: G.B.D. and S.L.V. conception and design of research; G.B.D. and S.L.V. performed experiments; G.B.D. and S.L.V. analyzed data; G.B.D. and S.L.V. interpreted results of experiments; G.B.D. and S.L.V. prepared figures; G.B.D. and S.L.V. drafted manuscript; G.B.D. and S.L.V. edited and revised manuscript; G.B.D. and S.L.V. approved final version of manuscript.AUTHOR NOTESThis article is covered by a non-exclusive license between the authors and the Nutrition Society (London, UK) and is being simultaneously published in 2011 in The Journal of Physiology, Experimental Physiology, British Journal of Pharmacology, Advances in Physiology Education, Microcirculation, and Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology as part of a collaborative initiative among the societies that represent these journals.Address for reprint requests and other correspondence: G.

This report involves a qualitative evaluation of CD health sciences undergraduate laboratory experiences in which concepts and students from two distinct disciplines [chemistry (CHEM) and exercise physiology (EPHE)] combined to study exercise thermoregulation and sweat analysis. Twenty-eight senior BSc Kinesiology (EPHE) students and 42 senior BSc CHEM students participated as part of their mutually exclusive, respective courses. The effectiveness of this laboratory environment was evaluated qualitatively using written comments collected from all students as well as from formal focus groups conducted after the CD laboratory with a representative cohort from each class (n = 16 CHEM students and 9 EPHE students). An open coding strategy was used to analyze the data from written feedback and focus group transcripts. Coding topics were generated and used to develop five themes found to be consistent for both groups of students. These themes reflected the common student perceptions that the CD experience was valuable and that students enjoyed being able to apply academic concepts to practical situations as well as the opportunity to interact with students from another discipline of study. However, students also reported some challenges throughout this experience that stemmed from the combination of laboratory groups from different disciplines with limited modification to the design of the original, pre-CD, learning environments. The results indicate that this laboratory created an effective learning opportunity that fostered student interest and enthusiasm for learning. The findings also provide information that could inform subsequent design and implementation of similar CD experiences to enhance engagement of all students and improve instructor efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Digestive physiology laboratory exercises often explore the regulation of enzyme action rather than systems physiology. This laboratory exercise provides a systems approach to digestive and regulatory processes through the exploration of postprandial blood glucose levels. In the present exercise, students enrolled in an undergraduate animal physiology course select to participate in either an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or one of the following three meal treatments based on typical student breakfasts: 1) high glycemic load (HGL), 2) moderate glycemic load (MGL), and 3) low glycemic load (LGL). The caloric value of the meals is 540 kcal. An Accucheck glucometer is used to determine fasted and 30-, 60-, and 120-min postprandial blood glucose levels. Students discover that postprandial glucose levels peak similarly for the OGTT and HGL group (137 ± 7.1 and 145 ± 4.7mg/dl) and remain higher than MGL and LGL groups over the 2-h period. Between sampling, vibrant discussion covering such topics as glucose and cognitive function, insulin resistance, epigenetics, and fad diets occurs. The postlaboratory assignment requires students to discuss the importance of glucose homeostasis, graphically summarize their findings, review the literature to describe results in light of published data, and describe relationships between hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and disease processes. Students evaluated this laboratory as highly effective and one of the top three experiences of the course.",

    "abstract": "In the present article, a novel model of artificial membranes that provides efficient assistance in teaching the origins of diffusion potentials is proposed. These membranes are made of polycarbonate filters fixed to 12-mm plastic rings and then saturated with a mixture of creosol and n-decane. The electrical resistance and potential difference across these membranes can be easily measured using a low-cost volt-ohm meter and home-made Ag/AgCl electrodes. The advantage of the model is the lack of ionic selectivity of the membrane, which can be modified by the introduction of different ionophores to the organic liquid mixture. A membrane treated with the mixture containing valinomycin generates voltages from -53 to -25 mV in the presence of a 10-fold KCl gradient (in to out) and from -79 to -53 mV in the presence of a bi-ionic KCl/NaCl gradient (in to out). This latter bi-ionic gradient potential reverses to a value from +9 to +20 mV when monensin is present in the organic liquid mixture. Thus, the model can be build stepwise, i.e., all factors leading to the development of diffusion potentials can be introduced sequentially, helping students to understand the quantitative relationships of ionic gradients and differential membrane permeability in the generation of cell electrical signals.",

Because of this requirement to publish sound science, the process of peer review is part of our culture and has been integral to ensuring the highest quality of our publications since the 18th century (9). However, this concept has been questioned repeatedly over the past few decades (2, 6, 10, 12, 13), and some have even advocated eliminating prepublication peer review altogether (1, 7). The underlying premise of this initiative is that anything in the correct format is publishable and that postpublication scrutiny using blogs and comments–a vox populi of sorts–will ultimately expose the truth. This was called \"scholarly skywriting\" almost two decades ago (5) and more recently \"trial by twitter\" (11). While proponents of this school of thought have increased in number and influence, the Publications leadership of the American Physiological Society (APS) continues to believe that prepublication peer review is worth the effort and cost and is critical to maintaining the scientific integrity of our publications.That being said, it is also vital that the peer review process be fair, equitable, and civil. There is no room for ad hominem comments in peer review, nor should self-serving or inappropriate motivations be allowed. Our Editors and Publication Committee occasionally receive complaints from authors that unreasonable demands and impossible requests for new experiments are articulated in reviews. We have probably all experienced such unnerving comments at one time or another. Requests for numerous new experiments, extensive new data analyses, or an unreasonable extension of the original hypothesis based on reviewer bias can be discouraging and inappropriate. Our Editors-In-Chief and Associate Editors handling a manuscript know that it is within their prerogative to modify or even discard such extensive and sometimes impossible requests by reviewers. Indeed, we encourage our editors to clearly articulate in their cover letter to authors which parts of the requests for revision by the reviewers are critical and which are unreasonable or unnecessary.So what can be done to address these issues and improve the peer review process? To reduce the types of inappropriate behavior mentioned above, it has been proposed that revealing reviewer identities to authors might be helpful (3). It has also been suggested that removing author names from submitted manuscripts (and for that matter, grant applications) may improve the process. The APS Publications Committee has discussed and rejected both of these tactics and disagrees with the idea that they would improve peer review. This decision has been confirmed consistently by several thorough scientific analyses that failed to find a beneficial effect of blinding reviewers to authorship or of asking reviewers to sign their reviews (4, 8, 14, 15). It is virtually impossible to disguise authorship of well-known scientists within an area of focus (8), and many highly qualified and sought-after reviewers would not agree to participate in the process if they could not maintain anonymity (15).Instead, we prefer to be persistent in the education of our reviewers and editors alike, urging them to be sensitive to the needs and expectations of our author base. Most of those responsible for the review process are, of course, authors themselves. We ask them to wear their author hats when they are working on the other side of the fence performing the peer review process. The ethic of reciprocity should always come to mind; we should treat others as we expect to be treated.This editorial is intended to alert participants in the publication process that they have the responsibility to ensure that the review process is rapid, fair, and equitable. This includes reviewers who should not let their personal feelings or experimental bias influence reviews; it includes editors who should strive to function not as administrators who simply pass along reviewers' comments to authors without guidance; and it includes authors who should realistically assess the comments of the reviewers and determine whether or not the remarks are justified. In this way, we hope to continue to transform the APS publication process into one that satisfies the dual requirements of ensuring scientific rigor as well as providing authors with a satisfying and constructive experience that will encourage them to submit their best work for consideration in our journals.DISCLOSURESH.

    "abstract": "In our physiology laboratory course we introduced several simple but instructive experiments in which medical students make observations on their own blood cells. In this experiment, students measured and discussed the effect of different temperatures on Na+ and K+ distribution between blood cells and plasma. In venous blood of 35 female and 64 male students, plasma (extracellular) [Na+] and [K+] were measured with ion-selective electrodes immediately after blood sampling and successively four times in intervals of 1 h in three samples stored at 1, 20, and 37 degrees C. At 1 degree C, plasma [K+] increased significantly and nearly linearly with cooling time of the blood, whereas plasma [Na+] decreased. In contrast, at 37 degrees C plasma K+ levels significantly decreased in the first 2 h and then stabilized at new levels clearly below baselines. At 1 degree C blood cells had a greater K+ loss in women than in men, whereas at 37 degrees C the K+ loss was significantly less pronounced in women. Plasma Na+ did not significantly change at 37 degrees C. This remarkably reproducible experiment demonstrates the existence of active Na(+)-K+ transport in human blood cells by showing medical students, with their own blood, that the basal chemical processes of such pumps are inhibited at a temperature of 1 degree C and stimulated when blood temperature is slightly higher than the usual body temperature.",

We have analyzed some of the factors that may contribute to these complaints, such as the fragmentation of physiology and the conflicting roles of the medical basic scientist. We have also reviewed some previous suggestions for improving basic science teaching. We suggest that a basic scientist with a background of integrative physiology, pharmacology, anatomy, and pathology, with a special emphasis on pathophysiology, would be well qualified to assume an important role in the medical education of the future. Because there is at present no established training program of this type, we have proposed a PhD training track with this objective and have listed some of the advantages and disadvantages of such a program.",

    "abstract": "A computer model is described that simulates many basic aspects of chemical synapse physiology. The model consists of two displays, the first being a pictorial diagram of the anatomical connections between two presynaptic neurons and one postsynaptic neuron. Either or both of the presynaptic cells can be stimulated from a control panel with variable control of the number of pulses and firing rate; the resulting presynaptic action potentials are animated. The second display plots the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell versus time following presynaptic stimulation. The model accurately simulates temporal and spatial summation when the presynaptic cells are arranged and stimulated in parallel and simulates presynaptic inhibition when they are arranged and stimulated in series. Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can be demonstrated by altering the nature of the ionic conductance change occurring on the postsynaptic cell. The effects on summation of changing length constant or time constant of the postsynaptic cell can also be illustrated. The model is useful for teaching these concepts to medical, graduate, or undergraduate students and can also be used as a self-directed computer laboratory exercise. It is available for free download from the internet.",

All first-year health science students undertaking the Physiology course were invited to take part in the laboratory exercise. The primary outcome was the measurement of gastrointestinal transit time from the amount of time taken for ingested whole-kernel sweetcorn to be eliminated, which was calculated as the time period between ingestion of corn and the time of corn first seen in the stool and the time corn was last seen in the stool. The secondary outcome was an association between emotional irritability and/or anxiety and gastrointestinal transit time. The study analyzed responses of 175 students, who reported a median transit time of 29 (1–99) h. There was no difference in gastrointestinal transit time between male and female students. Likewise, there was no difference in the duration of the corn in the bowel between male and female students. Students who reported being worried and irritable during the exercise had more bowel movements before they saw corn in their stool and had slower transit times, respectively. A wider range of transit time was reported in a group of young, healthy students compared with previous studies in the literature. There were no differences between male and female student bowel activity. Anxiety did impact the bowel activity of the participants.",

When definitions have been provided, they are often inconsistent across publications. As part of a larger research study, we interviewed 11 participants on 2 occasions while they were enrolled in a sequence of anatomy and physiology courses. Part of the interview protocol asked participants for their definitions of learning, memorizing, studying, and understanding. Definitions were isolated from the transcript, deidentified, and sorted by qualitative similarities. The research team developed code categories and assigned definitions to these groups after discussing coding differences. Multiple definition groups emerged for each term. Learning, memorizing, and studying definition groups highlighted processes, outcomes, or a combination of both a process and outcome. Understanding definition groups focused solely on an outcome. These findings highlight the need for communication between students and instructors with regard to term usage. In addition, future research in biology and physiology education should be careful to provide working definitions of these terms to ensure communicative and interpretive validity and to promote transferability and repeatability of findings.",

    "abstract": "There has been a gradual shift in the delivery of physiology laboratory classes over the last 30 years. For many, wet-lab demonstrations using animal tissues have been reduced or replaced with student-led investigations where students are both subjects and researchers. Despite these changes, expectations remain that physiology courses should include a practical component to encourage deeper and higher-order learning. Wet-lab tissue experiments and student-based group research formats can be expensive to run, associated with various ethical constraints, and, as discovered in these times of COVID-19, difficult to operate while adhering to physical distancing. We address the proposition that online and/or remote delivery of laboratory classes using digital technologies may provide a solution to both financial and ethical constraints of on-campus laboratory classes. Our discussions, as an international group of 10 physiologists from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, revealed that although some of the financial and ethical constraints of using animal tissues and student-led investigations were addressed by the introduction of online alternatives, the construction and maintenance of online delivery modes could also be expensive and ethical issues, not previously considered, included digital equity and student data security. There was also a collective perception that if face-to-face laboratory classes were changed to an entirely virtual mode there was a risk that some intended learning outcomes would not be met. It was concluded that the “ideal” approach is likely a hybrid model whereby student attendance in face-to-face, on-campus classes is supported with interactive digital content either developed in house or obtained through third-party providers.",

    "abstract": "Traditional didactic methods have not been successful in promoting independent and reflective students. Thus new teaching techniques are essential to optimize the way students learn. This study aimed to evaluate the perception of students, from the Faculty of Ceilandia, University of Brasília (FCE/UnB), about the active method “inverted class,” which has as its primary characteristic to stimulate the student to study and research the contents before the theoretical classes or explanation of the teacher. To this end, 64 students of the summer course participated in the Flipped Classroom and later evaluated the discipline method. Initially, they received a script with clinical questions about the class’s content, which should be discussed and answered about the basic, clinical, and practical application concepts. To evaluate the didactic method applied, on the last day of class, the summer class students were invited to answer a survey about satisfaction when learning the contents. For 98% of the students, the teaching method used was approved. It is also emphasized that this class had 48 repeating students, unmotivated with the course because, for many, they declared themselves unable to be approved. Given the success of the method, we decided to apply it throughout 2018, so the method was applied to over 180 students of FCE/UnB health courses. In short, it is considered that the results presented here to support other studies that highlight the need for changes in traditional teaching methods, which is a didactic option in undergraduate courses.",

However, the lack of understanding of basic neuroscience concepts among the general public is likely to hinder, and in some instances possibly even prevent, the appropriate application of scientific advancements to issues facing society today. Greater neuroscience literacy among the general public is necessary for the benefits of neuroscientific discovery to be fully realized. By actively enhancing neuroscience literacy, scientists can dispel falsehoods established by early research that harmed underrepresented communities, ensure that public conversations concerning neuroscience (e.g., legalization of psychotropic substances) revolve around facts, and empower individuals to make better health decisions. The widespread implementation of communication technologies and various forms of media indicate there are numerous means to engage classroom learners across disciplines and age cohorts and the public to increase neuroscience knowledge. Thus, it is not only necessary but timely that neuroscientists seek meaningful ways to bridge the widening knowledge gap with the public.",

    "abstract": "Graduate physiology programs strive to provide students with in-depth expertise in a particular academic discipline, often facilitating this process in the form of a departmental seminar course. Within the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of California Irvine (UCI), students are required to attend a seminar course, most often designed as a journal club, each quarter until they are ready to graduate. While this format may work well in departments where research topics are closely related, it has historically been less successful in UCI's Department of Physiology and Biophysics, where wide-ranging interests make for little overlap in foundational knowledge, limiting meaningful engagement with the material or with peers in the class. In this paper, we describe a complementary approach of developing a syllabus around student interests and covering topics that are critical for student success but often omitted from graduate curricula, such as interview skills, grant writing, and scientific communication. Results from our preclass survey motivated this approach to the class, and our retrospective survey demonstrated the substantial differences in student engagement, enthusiasm, and perceived benefits of this course relative to the journal club style course. We hope that the success of our course may serve as an exemplar for strategies to engage students more effectively and provide critical training in diverse skillsets that will help students after graduation.",

    "abstract": "To help educators deliver their physiology laboratory courses remotely, we developed an inexpensive, customizable hardware kit along with freely available teaching resources. We based the course design on four principles that should allow students to conduct insightful experiments on different physiological systems. First, the experimental setup should not be constrained to laboratory environments. Second, students should be able to take this course without prior coding and electronics experience. Third, the hardware kit should be relatively inexpensive, and all other resources should be freely available. Fourth, all resources should be customizable for educators. The hardware kit consists of commercially available electronic components, with a microcontroller as its hub (Arduino friendly). All measurement systems can be assembled without soldering. The hardware kit is cost-effective (approximately the cost of a textbook) and can be customized depending upon instructional needs. All software is freely available, and we share all necessary codes in open-access online repositories for simple use and customizability. All lab manuals and additional video tutorials are also freely available online and customizable. In our particular course, we have weekly asynchronous physiology lectures and one synchronous laboratory session, where students can get help with their equipment. In this article, we only focus on the novel and open-source laboratory part of the course. The laboratory includes four units [data acquisition, ECG, electromyography (EMG), activity classification] and one final project. It is our intent that these resources will allow other educators to rapidly implement their own remote physiology laboratories or to extend our work into other pedagogical applications of wearable technology.",

The aim of this study was to examine the degree of consistency in evaluating the practicality and logic of questions from a medical school pathophysiology test, between students and family medicine doctors. The study engaged 77 family medicine doctors and 51 students. Ten questions were taken from cardiac pathophysiology and 10 questions from pulmonary pathophysiology, and each question was assessed on the criteria of practicality and logic. A nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to test the difference between evaluators. On the criteria of logic, only four out of 20 items were evaluated differently by students in comparison to doctors, two items each from the fields of cardiology and pulmonology. On the criteria of practicality, for six of the 20 items there were statistically significant differences between the students and doctors, with three items each from cardiology and pulmonology. Based on these indicative results, students should be involved in the qualitative assessment of exam questions, which should be performed regularly under a strictly regulated process.",

    "abstract": "We implemented a team-based activity in our exercise physiology teaching laboratory that was inspired from Abbott et al.’s classic 1952 Journal of Physiology paper titled “The physiological cost of negative work.” Abbott et al. connected two bicycles via one chain. One person cycled forward (muscle shortening contractions, positive work) while the other resisted the reverse moving pedals (muscle lengthening contractions, negative work), and the cost of work was compared. This study was the first to link human whole body energetics with isolated muscle force-velocity characteristics. The laboratory activity for our students ( n = 35) was designed to reenact Abbott et al.’s experiment, integrate previously learned techniques, and illustrate differences in physiological responses to muscle shortening and lengthening contractions. Students (11–12 students/laboratory section) were split into two teams (positive work vs. negative work). One student from each team volunteered to cycle against the other for ~10 min. The remaining students in each team were tasked with measuring: 1) O 2 consumption, 2) heart rate, 3) blood lactate, and 4) perceived exertion. Students discovered that O 2 consumption during negative work was about one-half that of positive work and all other physiological parameters were also substantially lower. Muscle lengthening contractions were discussed and applied to rehabilitation and sport training. The majority of students (&gt;90%) agreed or strongly agreed that they stayed engaged during the activity and it improved their understanding of exercise physiology. All students recommended the activity be performed again. This activity was engaging, emphasized teamwork, yielded clear results, was well received, and preserved the history of classic physiological experiments.",

In March 2020, health authorities in Brazil imposed social isolation and the interruption of on-site activities in schools and universities. In this context, the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), one of the largest universities in Brazil and Latin America, developed an emergency remote learning (ERL) plan that allowed the return of classes in an online format and supported students to obtain access to equipment and internet network. Within this new perspective, the Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) program of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics (DFIB) explored strategies to minimize the impact of the absence of face-to-face classes. Using different available tools in online platforms and social media such as Microsoft Teams, YouTube animated video classes, and Instagram, the UTA program assisted >500 undergraduate students and strongly supported professors during ERL. In just over a year, our video classes on YouTube Channel reached ∼40,000 views. Most of the students reported that their questions were fully and quickly solved by the UTA program. Collectively, our results indicate that the strategies implemented by the UTA program helped the undergraduate students and professors to adapt to a remote learning format.",

    "abstract": "Humanization of donors in gross anatomy courses has been reported to facilitate professional behavior in healthcare students. However, there is a lack of research investigating whether students' knowledge of donor information is associated with humanization of whole body donors. To address this gap, the present study aimed to 1) determine whether knowledge of donor information is associated with greater humanization of donors and 2) investigate student perceptions of receiving donor information. Donor information was provided to students at the beginning of the course (cohort A) or at midsemester (cohort B). Questionnaires utilized quantitative and qualitative methods to assess humanization and student perceptions at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester. Independent t tests demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in mean humanization scores between cohorts A and B before the first dissection [t(37) = 0.449, P = 0.656], at midsemester [t(35) = -1.546, P = 0.131], or at the end of the semester [t(28) = 0.004, P = 0.997]. Thematic analysis demonstrated that as the semester progressed students' view of dissection as an invasion of privacy and the donor as a patient decreased. Themes delineated from students' open-ended responses revealed that students felt a connection with their donors; that the donors' consenting information gave permission to dissect; and that the information gave students an invaluable learning experience. Students demonstrated detached concern toward their donor, viewing the donor as a learning tool or educator rather than a patient. However, their responses also indicated the development of a deeper, personal connection to donors.NEW & NOTEWORTHY A look at the use of donor personal statements and information to humanize donors and how it influenced students' experiences in a gross anatomy laboratory.",

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted this course for an online learning environment, emphasizing image analysis (identifying immunoreactive signal in an immunohistochemical stain, making neuroanatomical distinctions in a cytoarchitectural stain) and translation of image data to the brain atlas. Using a quasiexperimental mixed methods approach, we evaluated aspects of student engagement and perceived gains in student confidence with respect to the nature and process of science and student science identity development. Additionally, we examined the dynamics of mentorship and student connectedness experienced in the online-only context. We found that the majority of students reported positive affective outcomes for the course in domains such as project ownership and project engagement in addition to positive responses toward perceived mentorship received during the course. Unsurprisingly, students expressed frustration in not being able to freely communicate with members of the course in an organic face-to-face environment. Furthermore, we found that students encountered greater difficulty in mastering image software skills causing a delay in producing consistent-quality data maps. From our analysis of the course, we have identified both useful approaches and areas for course improvement in any future iterations of the online research course.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Herein, we describe the process of converting a novel, face-to-face neuroanatomy course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) to an online-only research setting.

Then Cl- secretion is stimulated by theophylline and subsequently inhibited by furosemide. In some experiments K+ secretion can be detected by the blocking effect of mucosal Ba2+. Response of tissues from pig and cow is qualitatively similar but quantitatively different. The equipment is sturdy and inexpensive, can be provided by most departmental workshops, and has been tested for 3 yr in regular lab courses. Observations made during these experiments are closely related to clinical states, such as secretory diarrhea, cystic fibrosis, and hyperaldosteronism, as well as to the mechanisms of clinically used diuretics.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes, a syndrome characterized by high plasma glucose and low plasma insulin concentrations, is associated with somatic and autonomic neuropadiabetes as well as cardiac and vascular disorders. These consequences of diabetes significantly affect the organism's ability to maintain homeostasis. To understand the changes associated with diabetes, we developed a laboratory exercise that compares and contrasts the cardiovascular responses to exercise in an individual with diabetes and in an individual without diabetes. This exercise provides a unique opportunity to analyze, integrate, and interpret the changes associated with diabetes, since more is learned about how a system operated when the system is forced to perform than when it is idle. In this laboratory, anatomical and physiological data concerning diabetes are provided. Subsequently, a figure that illustrates the response of a specific cardiovascular variable during exercise (e.g., heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure) is presented. Students are challenged to analyze and assimilate information from figures, answer questions, make calculations, fill in tables, and plot graphs. The laboratory does not require equipment or software, only rulers and pencils. The answers to the questions and tables are provided in the APPENDIX. Students obtain experience in evaluating and understanding diabetes as well as applying basic cardiovascular concepts. The emphasis is on the application of basic cardiovascular principles, interpretation of pictorial or tabular material, and problem-solving skills.",

At the University of Western Ontario, graduate student volunteers of Let's Talk Science have launched a project that introduces senior high school students to research presentations given by undergraduate physiology students. The project has given the undergraduate students an opportunity to present their work to an interested audience other than their peers or faculty, while it provides the high school students with positive role models and a greater awareness of postsecondary science. This project was judged a success by all participants, because many of the high school students became interested in physiology and claimed to be more confident in their ability to participate in science, and it also appeared to improve the presentation and communication skills of the undergraduates. This innovative and cost-efficient project is an effective way to demonstrate the excitement of physiology to potential future scientists while showing undergraduate students that public communication of science is not only important but can also be fun.",

Students should learn the power of the experimental approach and to appreciate the immense variability possible in responses in complex organisms. They should also learn that principles of statistical probability applied logically can detect important differences in data that may be obscured by this variability. They should learn that there are no rigid answers when studying an individual and that they must continue to learn throughout their lives.",

Plethysmography is an appropriate, noninvasive technique to use but may not be available to some institutions. Therefore, for measurement of blood flow in human limbs, we developed a simple water-filled plethysmograph that may be built with minimal technical support. The device is formed from a plastic cylinder and houses a latex sleeve sealed at either end by means of circular flanges and rubber O-ring seals. Limb volume changes are transcribed using an air-filled piston recorder. This instrument proves to be sensitive and accurately determines limb volume changes over time. Utilizing an appropriate venous occlusion protocol, predicted vascular responses to postural challenge and physical exercise may be followed. In response to a questionnaire, a majority of students (n = 33) agreed that performing blood flow measurements succeeded in relating theory to practice, improved technical and observational skills, and made the learning experience real. This modified plethysmograph proves to be a valuable teaching tool in human physiology classes.",

Here, we present a class practical session that is taken by undergraduate students at our University. In the first part of this class, students record action potentials from papillary muscles with the use of glass microelectrodes, and they change extracellular conditions to study the ionic basis of the action potential. In the second part of the class, students simulate action potentials using the Oxsoft Heart model (v. 4.0) and model their previous experiments on papillary muscle to quantify the effects. In particular, the model is very helpful in promoting understanding of the effect that extracellular potassium has on cardiac action potential by simulating voltage clamp experiments. This twin approach of papillary muscle experiments and computer modeling leads to a good understanding of the functioning of the action potential and can help introduce discussion of some abnormal cardiac functioning.",

He suggested that teaching should be more than just an expectation for faculty; it should be held to similar standards as other scholarly work and should be recognized and considered as such in promotion and tenure decisions. He called for rigorous assessment and documentation of the scholarship of teaching using established criteria (1, 4, 5). However, defining the phrase scholarship of teaching and determining the criteria by which it should be assessed have been elusive. It has been suggested that the scholarship of teaching should focus on the quality of student learning that results from teaching practices. Furthermore, the scholarship of teaching should focus on providing the evidence for and documentation of the teaching practices that most efficiently and effectively facilitate student learning (4).Although many educators have begun to embrace the concept of scholarship of teaching, there is still a paucity of scientific documentation supporting specific teaching strategies. Thus educators have been challenged to conduct and document research in the profession of education for two reasons: 1) to contribute to the scientific knowledge base of the profession and 2) to bolster the future of the profession in the academic community through the scholarly pursuit of educational research (3). It is for these reasons that we conducted a study to determine the effectiveness of a previously published educational tool, “Understanding the Cardiovascular Adjustments to Upright Posture” (6).A class of 12 graduate students and a class of 58 undergraduate students majoring in exercise science in the Department of Kinesiology were given the educational tool as part of their regular course assignments. They received the educational tool 1 wk before a regularly scheduled laboratory session and were instructed to complete the tool independently before the laboratory session.During the laboratory session, students met in groups of four or five students to further discuss, clarify, and review the questions, problems, and case scenarios from the educational tool. Two instructors were present to assist students as needed. After the small group discussions, the instructors facilitated further discussion with the entire group and provided students with copies of the educational tool's answer key for future reference.At the end of the laboratory session, students were given a survey, adapted from a survey used by Chandler and DiCarlo (2), accompanied by a cover letter asking them to voluntarily and anonymously complete the survey to determine the effectiveness of the educational tool and of the discussion groups. The survey protocol was approved by the University's Institutional Review Board, and anonymous completion of the survey served as informed consent. The survey contained statements that related to four areas: goals and objectives, content, components and organization, and laboratory group discussions. Students were asked to rate each statement by circling either 1 (strongly disagree), 2 (disagree), 3 (neutral), 4 (agree), or 5 (strongly agree). Results from the survey were then analyzed using descriptive statistics (means ± SD).All of the graduate and undergraduate students volunteered to complete the survey for a 100% response rate. The survey statements and student responses are presented in Table 1. Overall, responses were favorable for both the educational tool and the laboratory group discussion. The most favorable responses of the undergraduate students were that “the tool contains challenging and motivating material for the subject matter” (4.12 ± 0.73) and “group discussion allowed me to go beyond my previous level of knowledge” (4.24 ± 0.63).Table 1.

The scale was as follows: 1, strongly disagree; 2, disagree; 3, neutral; 4, agree; and 5, strongly agree.All of the graduate student responses were 4.0 or greater for both the educational tool and the group discussion except for the statement “the tool was free of confusing and/or conflicting concepts” (3.67 ± 0.89). This statement was also rated lowest by the undergraduate students (2.71 ± 0.99). However, it appears that the group discussion “provided the students with an opportunity to discuss incorrect answers and fill in knowledge gaps” (undergraduate, 4.16 ± 0.56; graduate, 4.58 ± 0.51) and “enhanced understanding and ability to synthesize and integrate the material” (undergraduate, 4.21 ± 0.59; graduate, 4.58 ± 0.67). In general, the evaluation of the group discussion was the most favorable aspect of the learning experience.Graduate student responses were overall more favorable than those of the undergraduate students. This may be due to the characteristics of the students, their educational background, and their course of study. The undergraduate class included students in a variety of exercise- and health-related fields (exercise physiology, prephysical therapy, physical education, and athletic training) with limited educational background in cardiovascular physiology. They were also younger, more traditional students. Graduate students were older, had previous coursework in exercise physiology, and had a more narrowly focused course of study in exercise science.The nature of graduate coursework is also more congruent with active and independent learning. Class sizes are typically smaller and more conducive to discussion, courses often have a hands-on laboratory component, and the content areas of the courses are related and more focused. The courses taken by undergraduate students are typically larger in size, and the traditional lecture format predominates. Thus undergraduate students may have had much less experience with active learning strategies and may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the type of learning required of the educational tool.Graduate students recommended that both the educational tool (4.42 ± 0.67) and group discussion (4.33 ± 0.78) format be used for other content areas. Undergraduate students were neutral in regard to recommending the educational tool format for other areas (3.33 ± 0.98) but would recommend the group discussion format (3.90 ± 0.91). Given these results, as well as the overall results regarding higher level learning, this educational tool, accompanied by group discussion, is an effective teaching strategy for both undergraduate and graduate students in the field of health science. It promotes active, independent, and collaborative learning that enhances a student's ability to apply, integrate, and synthesize the course material. It also provided students with opportunities to problem solve and think critically, which are skills that are applicable to all levels of learning in the classroom and in health science professions.REFERENCES1 Boyer EL.

    "abstract": "We were recently challenged with trying to maintain the integrity and learning experience of our Physiology course, which included the use of long-answer, essay-style test questions, with a class size that increased over 2 yr by ∼200 students. We reorganized the teaching assistant (TA) support structure in an attempt to keep the testing style and mark (or grade) the exams accurately, in a timely fashion, and provide feedback to the students that want it. Each of four TAs became experts in two sections of the course. To assess our success, TA time allocation for specific duties was recorded. Marking (or grading) accuracy was assessed by recording test data including the number of tests returned for remarking and how much marks changed by when a grade was reassessed. Student feedback was solicited to determine whether this structure provided adequate feedback and support to the students. TAs spent an average of 115 h and 35 min ± 7 h 21 min of a total of 140 h contracted. On average, 13.2 ± 0.5% of the tests were identified as being inaccurately graded by 4.2 ± 0.7%. When asked to score whether the statement of assessment of students was fair, it scored 4.5 out of 5, where 5 equals strongly agree. When asked whether the course provided a worthwhile learning experience, the question scored 4.84 out of 5. Thus, we were successful at marking the exams accurately, in a timely fashion, and providing the necessary feedback, and we were successful at maintaining the objectives of the Physiology course with a class size of 440 students.",

    "abstract": "The present report commemorates the persecution of five renown Italian physiologists of Jewish descent that lost their chairs in medical schools because of the anti-semitic policies of the fascist regime. In 1938, Mussolini promulgated the Racial Laws, officially with the aim of safeguarding the purity of the Italian race in conquered African colonies. However, their true intent was to persecute the Italian Jewish community in agreement with the policy of Nazi Germany. In accordance with the Racial Laws, all non-Aryans were banished from professional activities and were evicted from public, social, and academic life. As a result, 98 full professors in Italian universities were removed from their academic positions. In medical schools, physiology, more than other discipline, lost the most prominent faculty members. Of the 17 full Professors of Human Physiology, five were of Jewish descent, and all were evicted: they were Camillo Artom from Palermo, Mario Camis from Bologna, Carlo Foà from Milan, Amedeo Herlitzka from Turin, and Ugo Lombroso from Genoa. All were talented and famous scientists who were forced to leave Italy and take refuge in foreign countries. At the end of World War II, Camis, Foà, Herlitzka, and Lombroso returned to Italy and resumed their previous academic positions, whereas Artom remained in the United States. Unfortunately, Camis died later that year. During the postwar period, some of the fascists responsible for the Jewish persecution were killed or committed suicide while the survivors were imprisoned and prosecuted. However, all were soon released and resumed their former positions.",

We developed a program to enhance science literacy in elementary school children that allows experts to reach a tremendous audience while minimizing their time commitment. The foundation of the program is a television series entitled “Desert Survivors.” The episodes air on local cable access television and are available to teachers on DVD. Each episode features a guest expert who spotlights a particular organism and how that organism overcomes the myriad of hardships inherent to desert survival. Local classrooms are visited to solicit questions from students regarding the organism of interest. These videotaped questions are integrated into Desert Survivors television production and provide the guest expert with the basis to discuss the ecology, physiology, and evolutionary biology of the organism. The program is bolstered through the use of an interactive website. Assessment strategies are in place to ensure program efficacy. Herein, we describe the development of the program as a model for innovative outreach opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Item test analysis is an aid to identify items that need to be eliminated from an assessment. An automatic elimination procedure based on item statistics, therefore, could help to increase the quality of a test in an objective manner. This was investigated by studying the effect of a standardized elimination procedure on the test results of a second-year course over a period of 6 successive years in 1,624 candidates. Cohort effects on the item elimination were examined by determining the number of additional items that had to be eliminated from three different tests in 3 successive academic years in two cohorts. The items that were part of more than one test and had to be eliminated according to the procedure in at least one of the tests appeared to have to be retained according to the same procedure in most of the other tests. The procedure harmed the high scoring students relatively more often than the other students, and the number of eliminated items appeared to be cohort dependent. As a consequence, automatic elimination procedures obscure the transparency of the grading process unacceptably and transform valid tests into inadequate samples of the course content.",

The aim of the workshop was to explore how experimental design is taught to students of physiology in different institutions, to consider the aspects that students find challenging, to share good practice, and to think about how experimental design teaching could be improved. Through small-group discussions that were then shared with the whole group, participants were challenged to develop the outline of a research project to investigate a broad topic and then to identify the challenges that students might face if they were given that task. Finally, the group thought about what, in practical terms, could be done to help develop experimental design skills in undergraduates. The outcomes of the discussions are summarized in this report.",

The application of first-person perspective (FPP) technology may provide interesting new approaches to providing prelaboratory preparation. However, there is limited knowledge as to whether this perspective is useful or enjoyable for students preparing for laboratory tasks. The purpose of this study was to examine whether prelaboratory preparation, utilizing the FPP technique, was enjoyable and led to improvements in laboratory task-specific self-efficacy in comparison to the traditional text-only (TO) style. We observed that the FPP group found the style to be generally more enjoyable, entertaining, and generally fun compared with the TO group (5.3 ± 0.2 and 2.7 ± 0.3, respectively, P < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that the FPP group had a greater laboratory task-specific self-efficacy than their counterparts in the TO group, following the prelaboratory preparation (93.6 ± 1.6 and 83.5 ± 3.2, respectively, P < 0.05). We did not find any differences in scenario-based self-efficacy between the FPP and the TO group. Taken together, our data support the use of FPP videos as a novel, refreshing approach to prelaboratory preparation that builds self-efficacy in students performing laboratory tasks.",

This annual tournament brings over 2,000 middle and high school students, teachers, and parents to the UVA campus, and teams of 15-17 people from roughly 90 schools across Virginia participate in 46 different events (23 middle school, Division B; 23 high school, Division C) relating to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields throughout the day-long competition. The national SciOly organization sets the events and rules to comply with national education standards, and the VASO board coordinates the teams and tournaments within the state. By collaborating with VASO, UVA ESC was able to plan a large-scale SciOly tournament at UVA in approximately 10 mo with the support of the UVA School of Engineering and Applied Science. Since this event was planned and executed solely by undergraduates in cooperation with the nonprofit organization, there were institutional hurdles that were overcome through the months of planning. The Virginia SciOly state tournament has continued to be held at UVA with the support and cooperation of the UVA ESC and VASO, and bringing this tournament to UVA has allowed for increased excitement for participating K-12 students and a mitigated burden to the VASO organizers in planning the state competition. This paper aims to provide a resource for other universities to support STEM activities in K-12 outreach organizations, like SciOly, in the future.",

    "abstract": "Medical students have difficulty understanding the mechanisms underlying hyperkalemia-mediated local control of blood flow. Such control mechanisms are crucial in the brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle vasculature. We aimed to identify medical students' misconceptions via assessment of students' in-class knowledge and, subsequently, improve future teaching of this concept. In-class polling was performed with the TurningPoint clicker response system (n = 860) to gauge students' understanding of three physiological concepts related to hyperkalemia: membrane potential (Vm), conductance, and smooth muscle response. Vm includes the concepts of equilibrium potential (Veq) for specific ions, as well as driving force (DF = Vm - Veq). Students understood the concept of DF (~70% answered correctly), suggesting their understanding of Vm. However, students misunderstood that hyperkalemia results in depolarization (~52% answered correctly) and leads to an increase in potassium conductance (~31% answered correctly). Clarification of the type of smooth muscle as vascular increased the percentage of correct responses (~51 to 73%). The data indicate that students lacked knowledge of specific potassium conductance in various muscle types, resulting in divergent responses, such as the canonical depolarization in skeletal muscle versus hyperpolarization in smooth muscle cells during hyperkalemia. Misunderstanding of this crucial concept of conductance is directly related to the students' performance. Furthermore, we connected the paradoxical effect of hyperkalemia to pathological acute and chronic hyperkalemia clinical scenarios.",

The model was used to validate predictions and explore solutions prompted by student discussion. This interactive teaching laboratory provides an engaging experiential exercise that demonstrates regulation of flow and pressure in an intact cardiovascular system with apposite changes in heart rate and resistance. In addition, the system provides strong clinical correlates and illustrates how that regulated system responds to challenges such as heart failure, inappropriate vasodilation, and hemorrhage. The results demonstrate that, with limited practice, the instructor can effectively guide the students to reliably reproduce physiologically appropriate results.",

    "abstract": "The Physiology Understanding (PhUn) Week is a national outreach event sponsored by the American Physiological Society. Our PhUn team conducted an event for 551 students (12.5 ± 0.9 yr old) in a middle school in Indiana. The aims of this program were to: 1) teach about the negative consequences of inactivity on cardiovascular (CV) health and overall well-being; 2) help students to determine their own CV fitness level and design their fitness plan; and 3) test the hypothesis that students who are offered daily physical education (PE) classes are able to meet the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. The University of Louisville PhUn team visited the school during school hours to execute the outreach program to students enrolled in Health and PE as their course elective. During the event, students were educated about CV physiology and the effects of exercise on CV fitness and metabolism. Additionally, students were asked to completed a questionnaire about their physical activity behaviors outside the school. Students were also educated about ways to increase energy expenditure by 150 METy (units of metabolism for youth) per day during 7 days. CV fitness levels were estimated by using the PACER (Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run) test, and students were asked to create a plan to increase energy expenditure daily. The results showed that 53% of the students did not perform enough physical activity outside school to meet the guidelines. In conclusion, the incorporation of PE in schools is critical to cultivate healthy lifestyles and decrease the sedentarism epidemic in the U.S.",

    "abstract": "Vertical integration is believed to increase motivation by providing context for the learning. In this quasi-experimental study, cohort I took two horizontally integrated modules: structure and function of head, neck, and special senses in the second year, and pathophysiology and clinical sciences in the third year. Cohort II took a combined, vertically integrated module in the second year. Data from the questionnaire and examination scores were compared. Response rate was 80.1% (125/156) for cohort I and 57.6% (98/170) for cohort II. Response to the statement that vertical integration provides context to basic sciences was mixed with a higher agreement in cohort II (51.5 vs. 37.2%; P = 0.04). Cohort II was least satisfied with the appropriateness of self-study time (52.0 vs. 34.7%; P = 0.01). However, cohort II felt that the basic sciences lectures (90.8 vs. 69.4%; P &lt; 0.01) and the clinical skills sessions (85.7 vs. 62.1%; P &lt; 0.01) were more effective. Cohort II was less satisfied with clinical lectures (80.6 vs. 56.1%; P &lt; 0.01) and was less confident in achieving clinical learning objectives (72.8 vs. 40.8%; P &lt; 0.01). Mean multiple-choice questions and problem-based learning scores were similar. However, the short-answer question score was higher for cohort I [82.48 (SD 14.9) vs. 70.74 (SD 17.9); P &lt; 0.01]. Overall, the idea of early vertical integration had a mixed response. It improved the effectiveness of basic sciences lectures and clinical skills sessions. Achievement of clinical learning outcomes was compromised. A disparity in the module’s duration and curricular content, and students' ability to grasp clinical concepts and faculty’s expectations are the possible reasons. Increased duration and better communication with clinical faculty may improve early introduction of vertical integration.",

    "abstract": "The Wright table is introduced as a novel tool for teaching and learning the cardiac cycle. It supplements the nearly 100-yr-old Wiggers diagram, which is information rich but difficult for many students to learn. The Wright table offers a compact presentation of information, viewable both in terms of how 1) each compartment’s pressures and flows change over time; and 2) the heart works as a pump, first filling and then emptying the ventricles, thereby moving blood from low-pressure venous to high-pressure arterial compartments. This new four-by-four display of interrelated aspects of cardiac cycle events offers a more integrated view of the phases of ventricular filling and emptying than can be easily observed in the Wiggers diagram. It also shows how ECG-related waves of depolarization and repolarization drive the events of each subsequent phase. The Wright table is a stand-alone teaching aid; however, it is designed such that weaknesses of the Wiggers diagram are complemented by strengths of the Wright table, and vice versa. Results of an anonymous student survey support the utility of the Wright table in medical education. Three modifications of the Wright table, each modeling specific cardiac conditions (i.e., paradoxical split S2 in left bundle branch block, mild aortic stenosis, and moderate aortic stenosis), are included to illustrate how the Wright table might be used in clinical training and research. In summary, the Wright table of the cardiac cycle provides new perspectives for visualization of the cardiac cycle in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "This study is aimed at the implementation of a continuous assessment model in physiology for a large-enrollment classroom with 250 students. The readiness assurance process (RAP) and immediate feedback elements from team-based learning (TBL) methodology were adopted to test their ability to guide students to solve applications exercises individually. Three continuous assessments in physiology (CAPs) were conducted with the RAP to include individual (iRAT) and group readiness assurance tests (gRAT). Immediate feedback was provided with faculty-student discussion (FSD), and the individual application exercises (iAE) were designed to be answered individually. Each CAP was subjected to three types of experimental manipulation in subgroups created out of 250 students. The intervention began with iRAT for all three subgroups. The sequence of iRAT, gRAT, FSD, and iAE varied between subgroups within a CAP. In a cross-over study design, each subgroup of students was subjected to all three intervention types over three CAPs. The subgroup completing iAE after RAP and FSD showed higher scores than the subgroup with RAP alone. One hundred eight-two students (82.35% response rate; 101 women and 81 men) responded to the questionnaire. The majority of students (87.4%) felt that doing iRAT and gRAT at the beginning helped them to solve iAE better. Most of the students (86.8%) responded that they received useful feedback and clarification during the discussion with the teacher after the gRAT. In conclusion, the administration of iRAT first followed by gRAT and immediate feedback from faculty seem to be beneficial to prepare students to tackle application-based exercises.",

The faculty designed new core and concentration courses and modified existing courses to distribute the essential learning across the major curriculum. Additionally, the committee created two service courses to fill voids in nutrition education for nonmajors.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary history and structural considerations constrain all aspects of animal physiology. Constraints on invertebrate locomotion are especially straightforward for students to observe and understand. In this exercise, students use spiders to investigate the concepts of adaptation, structure-function relationships, and trade-offs. Students measure burst and endurance performance in several taxonomic families of spiders whose ecological niches have led to different locomotory adaptations. Based on observations of spiders in their natural habitat and prior background information, students make predictions about spider performance. Students then construct their own knowledge by performing a hands-on, inquiry-based scientific experiment where the results are not necessarily known. Depending on the specific families chosen, students can observe that web-dwelling spiders have more difficulty navigating complex terrestrial terrain than ground-dwelling spiders and that there is a trade-off between burst performance and endurance performance in spiders. Our inexpensive runway design allows for countless variations on this basic experiment; for example, we have successfully used runways to show students how the performance of heterothermic ectotherms varies with temperature. High levels of intra- and interindividual variation in performance underscore the importance of using multiple trials and statistical tests. Finally, this laboratory activity can be completely student driven or standardized, depending on the instructor's preference.",

    "abstract": "Compare and contrast strategies remain common pedagogical practices within physiological education. With the support of an American Physiological Society Teaching Career Enhancement Award, we have developed a junior- or senior-level undergraduate curriculum for exercise physiology that compares and contrasts the physiological adaptations of chronic terrestrial exercise (TEx) and microgravity (μG). We used a series of peer-reviewed publications to demonstrate that many of the physiological adaptations to TEx and μG are opposite. For example, TEx typically improves cardiovascular function and orthostatic tolerance, whereas μG can lead to declines in both. TEx leads to muscle hypertrophy, and μG elicits muscle atrophy. TEx increases bone mineral density and red blood cell mass, whereas μG decreases bone mineral density and red blood cell mass. Importantly, exercise during spaceflight remains a crucial countermeasure to limit some of these adverse physiological adaptations to μG. This curriculum develops critical thinking skills by dissecting peer-reviewed articles and discussing the strengths and weaknesses associated with simulated and actual μG studies. Moreover, the curriculum includes studies on both animals and humans, providing a strong translational component to the curriculum. In summary, we have developed a novel space physiology curriculum delivered during the final weeks of an exercise physiology course in which students gain critical new knowledge that reinforces key concepts presented throughout the semester.",

    "abstract": "In 1973, the Institute of Environmental Stress of the University of California-Santa Barbara, under the direction of Steven M. Horvath, began a series of field and laboratory studies of marathon runners during competition. As one of Horvath's graduate students, many of these studies became part of my doctoral dissertation. The rationale for studying runners under race conditions was based on my belief as a marathoner that runners would push themselves much harder while competing than under simulated conditions in the laboratory. Horvath's ready support of the studies likely had its roots in his graduate training at the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory, a laboratory well known for its field studies of individuals working in extreme environments. This report describes the studies of 1973-1975, focusing on how the measurements were made and detailing the learning experiences of a new graduate student. In 1973, blood chemistry and fluid shifts were studied in six runners before and for 3 days after a race. This was the first modern study to systematically examine the recovery process. In 1974, oxygen consumption was measured every 3 mi. in two runners during the race. In 1975, rectal temperature and five skin temperatures were evaluated in the same two runners every 1.4 mi. of the race. The latter two studies were the first to make such measurements under race conditions. The Institute of Environmental Stress marathon studies demonstrated the possibility of making measurements during competition without disrupting performance, enhanced our understanding of human exercise capacity under competitive conditions, and provided new insight into the postrace recovery process.",

In Europe, however, Claude Bernard and Carl Ludwig produced a new model of scientific research laboratories funded by the state that sought to develop the pursuit of biomedical research as an occupation. American physicians such as Henry Pickering Bowditch and S. Weir Mitchell were exposed to this new “research ethic” during their international studies and brought this new perspective home to America. Along with H. Newell Martin, these men began training professional physiologists who would assume new research positions in academic institutions. In 1887, Bowditch, Mitchell, and H. Newell Martin proposed the formation of a new society for these professional physiologists, the American Physiological Society (APS). Seventeen of the original twenty-eight members met on December 30, 1887, in New York City, NY, to establish APS. From these humble beginnings, APS evolved to become a force for change in American biomedical science.",

After treating young tadpoles with a cortisol receptor agonist (dexamethasone) for 1 wk, students can easily visualize the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on the intact thymus gland, which shrinks dramatically in size in response to this steroid hormone analog. However, the suppressive effect of dexamethasone is nullified in the presence of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486, which powerfully illustrates the specific effects of glucocorticoid receptor inhibition on the immune system. Image analysis and statistics software are used to quantify the effects of glucocorticoid modulation on thymus size.",

Students and faculty members agreed on the value of assessing student learning with a variety of methods, finding new information to solve problems, assessing conceptual understanding and logical reasoning, having assessments with no single correct answer, and having comments on exams. Clear differences emerged between students and faculty members on specific matters: rubrics, student choice of exam format, assessing creativity, and transfer of learning to novel situations. A followup questionnaire allowed participants to clarify their interpretation of select statements, with responses from 71 students and 17 faculty members. All parties strongly agreed that exams should provide a good learning experience that would help them prepare for the future (students: 8.64 ± 1.71 and faculty members: 8.03 ± 2.34).",

    "abstract": "Laboratory courses serve as important gateways to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. One of the challenges in assessing laboratory learning is to conduct meaningful and standardized practical exams, especially for large multisection laboratory courses. Laboratory practical exams in life sciences courses are frequently administered by asking students to move from station to station to answer questions, apply knowledge gained during laboratory experiments, interpret data, and identify various tissues and organs using various microscopic and gross specimens. This approach puts a stringent time limit on all questions regardless of the level of difficulty and also invariably increases the potential risk of cheating. To avoid potential cheating in laboratory courses with multiple sections, the setup for practical exams is often changed in some way between sections. In laboratory courses with multiple instructors or teaching assistants, practical exams may be handled inconsistently among different laboratory sections, due to differences in background knowledge, perceptions of the laboratory goals, or prior teaching experience. In this article, we describe a design for a laboratory practical exam that aims to align the assessment questions with well-defined laboratory learning objectives and improve the consistency among all laboratory sections.",

    "abstract": "We investigated how students performed on weekly two-page laboratory reports based on whether the grading rubric was provided to the student electronically or in paper form and the inclusion of one- to two-sentence targeted comments. Subjects were registered for a 289-student, third-year human physiology class with laboratory and were randomized into four groups related to rubric delivery and targeted comments. All students received feedback via the same detailed grading rubric. At the end of the term, subjects provided consent and a self-assessment of their rubric viewing rate and preferences. There were no differences in laboratory report scores between groups (P = 0.86), although scores did improve over time (P < 0.01). Students receiving targeted comments self-reported viewing their rubric more often than students that received no comments (P = 0.02), but the viewing rate was independent of the rubric delivery method (P = 0.15). Subjects with high rubric viewing rates did not have higher laboratory report grades than subjects with low viewing rates (P = 0.64). When asked about their preference for the future, 43% of respondents preferred the same method again (electronic or paper rubric) and 25% had no preference. We conclude that although student laboratory report grades improved over time, the rate and degree of improvement were not related to rubric delivery method or to the inclusion of targeted comments.",

These groups (6-7 students plus a tutor) meet for 3-hour sessions three times each week during each phase. Students receive cases, along with study guides designed to assist in selecting appropriate information sources for each phase. Each student is evaluated on group process skills, oral presentation and defense of a case analysis, and a multiple-choice exam.

Using the benchmarks process, we first set the broad skill and content goals of the course. We then prioritize the topic areas to be covered, allocating the course time accordingly, and declare the learning objectives for each topic. To clarify each learning objective, a set of benchmark statements are written that specify in operational terms what is required to demonstrate mastery. After the benchmarks are written, we assemble the learning activities that help students achieve them and write assessment items to evaluate achievement. We have implemented the curriculum in a relational database that allows us to specify the numerous links that exist between its different elements. In the future, the benchmarks model will be used for ongoing A&amp;P curriculum development with geographically distributed contributors accessing it via the World Wide Web. This mechanism will allow for the continuing evolution of the A&amp;P curriculum.",

We have employed a technique to teach physiology to bioengineering students that couples students' enthusiasm for their chosen field, bioengineering, with an active learning process in which students are asked to design a biomedical device to enhance, replace, or create a new cellular or organ system function. Each assignment is designed with specific constraints that serve to direct students' attention to specific areas of study and that require students to create original designs. Preventing students from using existing designs spurred student invention and enthusiasm for the projects. Students were divided into groups or \"design discovery teams\" as might be done in a biomedical device industry setting. Students then researched the physiological issues that would need to be addressed to produce an acceptable design. Groups met with faculty to brainstorm and to obtain approval for their general design concepts before proceeding. Students then presented their designs to the instructors in a structured, written outline form and to the class as a 10-minute oral presentation. Grades were based on the outline, oral presentation, and peer evaluations (group members anonymously rated contributions of other members of their team). We believe that this approach succeeded in generating enthusiasm for learning physiology by allowing the students to think creatively in their chosen field of study and that it has resulted in students developing a more thorough understanding of difficult physiological concepts than would have been achieved with a traditional didactic lecture approach.",

This concept is usually explained in terms of whether a gas reaches its partial pressure equilibrium in the pulmonary capillaries. If it does, the gas is considered to be “perfusion limited,” and if it does not, it is considered to be “diffusion limited.” To facilitate the understanding of this concept, we designed an analogical model using paper cups and water to simulate the physiological principles behind gas transport.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials RequiredThe following materials are required: paper cups (∼200-ml volume), a long frame in which to stick the paper cups (this should be able to hold the weight of the cups filled with water), instant glue, and a sink with a tap where the experiment is to be performed.Construction of the ModelTen identical paper cups were stuck on a plastic wire casing ∼2 in. wide and 40 in. long using instant glue. Sufficient space was given between the cups to prevent water overflowing from one cup to another. The final assembled model is shown in Fig. 1A.Fig. 1.A: model showing paper cups stuck on a long plastic frame. B: the cups are moved under a running tap. The flow of water represents the diffusion of a gas across the respiratory membrane. The speed of movement of the cups represents the rate of perfusion. The volume of the cups represents the capacity of the blood for the gas at its alveolar partial pressure.Download figureDownload PowerPointPhysiological BasisIn this analogy, each cup stood for the capacity of the blood for the gas at its alveolar partial pressure. The capacity of the blood for a gas includes dissolved gas as well as other forms, such as bound to hemoglobin. The demonstration of perfusion limitation used oxygen as the example, whereas the demonstration of diffusion limitation used carbon monoxide (CO) as the example. These gases were chosen as they have nearly identical solubility coefficients and both bind to hemoglobin. For both gases, the hemoglobin-bound form is the major determinant of the total gas content in the blood. This enabled the use of similarly sized paper cups in this analogy.The speed at which the cups are moved stood for the perfusion rate. The flow of water through the tap was equivalent to the diffusion of a gas across the respiratory membrane (Fig. 1B). Cups filled up to the brim were equivalent to the pulmonary capillary partial pressure of the gas reaching its equilibrium with alveolar air.RESULTSPresentation of the ModelThis model was presented to first-year medical students in groups of 15 students. Students were first shown the model, and the components of the model were then explained. Students were told that the cups would be positioned under a running tap and moved at a constant speed.Two volunteers from each group were asked to perform the experiment in front of the others. While one student timed the process, the other student moved the cups under the running tap. The experiment was conducted in an area where the sink had sufficient space to maneuver the setup.Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment was designed to convey the physiological principles underlying oxygen transfer that make it “perfusion limited.” The second experiment was designed to simulate the physiological factors that make CO transfer “diffusion limited.”At the start, students were given a set of instructions to perform the experiment. A set of questions was discussed during each experiment.Experiment 1: model of oxygen transfer across the respiratory membrane.Students were given written instructions to fill the water cups to approximately three-quarters of their capacity. They were to adjust the water flow through the tap such that the remaining volume filled in ∼4 s. While one student moved the cups, the other student told the first student when to do so. The first cup was placed under the tap for 12 s. After 12 s had elapsed, the next cup was to be brought under the tap. This continued for 60 s (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2.Model of oxygen transfer across the respiratory membrane. A: the cups, representing the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood at 100 mmHg (alveolar Po2), are three-quarters full to begin with, to represent 75% saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen in mixed venous blood (75% hemoglobin saturation approximately equals 75% of the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood). They are moved at a speed of 1 cup every 12 s, which represents the rate of perfusion. Water flow, representing the rate of diffusion, is adjusted such that the remaining one-quarter of the cup is filled in 4 s. The equilibrium of Po2 between the alveolus and blood, represented by a full cup, is reached in one-third of the transit time. At the end of 1 min, the total amount of water collected, representing the total oxygen transferred across the membrane, amounts to 1.25 cups. B: the cups are moved at a faster rate of 1 cup every 6 s to simulate increased perfusion. The water collected at the end of 1 min has increased to 2.5 cups, showing that the speed of the moving cups (perfusion) limits the water collected. C: the flow of water through the tap is increased to more than the initial flow in A and B while the speed of the cups remains at 1 cup every 12 s. The amount of water collected remains at 1.25 cups in 1 min, showing that water flow (diffusion) does not limit the water collected.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe questions given to aid the discussion were as follows: 1. Why were the cups three-quarters full at the beginning of the experiment?2. Why does one wait for 12 s even though the time taken for the cups to fill was only 4 s?3. Would increasing the speed at which the cups were moved increase the amount of water collected in a given time? [Students were instructed to repeat the experiment by increasing the speed of cup movement to one cup every 6 s instead of 12 s (Fig. 2B).]4. Would increasing the water flow through the tap increase the amount of water collected in a given time? [Students were asked to repeat the experiment with the normal speed of cup movement and a higher water flow (Fig. 2C).]5. What limited the amount of water carried in a given time in the above experiment and what was the physiological equivalent of this factor?It was explained to the students that the mixed venous blood having a Po2 of 40 mmHg is ∼75% saturated with oxygen. Therefore, the cups that stood for the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood at 100 mmHg (alveolar Po2) were three-fourths full at the beginning of the experiment. (At this point, the contribution of dissolved and hemoglobin-bound forms of oxygen can be introduced to the students. Pulmonary capillary Po2 is determined by the dissolved form. The difference in partial pressures between the alveoli and capillaries is one of the factors that determine the rate of diffusion. However, the dissolved form contributes very little to total oxygen carrying capacity. The oxygen carrying capacity is nearly equal to the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin.)The time taken for the pulmonary capillary blood to equilibrate with alveolar Po2 at rest is about one-thirds the transit time across the alveoli. Thus, although the cups filled in 4 s, students were asked to wait for 12 s.When the students filled water at the normal rate, five cups were full at the end of 1 min (Fig. 2A). However, when the students moved the cups at twice the rate, it was apparent that although the cups were moving faster, all the cups leaving the tap were still getting filled to the brim. At the end of 1 min, students had 10 full cups, showing that the amount of water collected in a given time had increased (Fig. 2B).When only the flow of water was increased with the rate of movement of the cups kept constant, students noticed that there was more overflow of water. At the end of 1 min, only five cups were full. The total amount of water collected did not increase (Fig. 2C).Increasing the rate of cup movement increased the amount of water collected, but increasing the water flow through the tap did not. Therefore, the limiting factor was identified as the “rate of cup movement.” As the rate of cup movement stood for the rate of perfusion, this was explained as a model of perfusion limitation.Experiment 2: model of CO transfer across the respiratory membrane.Students were instructed to use empty water cups for this experiment. The water flow through the tap was adjusted such that each cup filled in ∼30 s. One student held the row of cups while another student timed the process. The first cup was to be placed under the tap for 12 s. After 12 s had elapsed, the next cup was positioned under the tap. This was repeated for 1 min (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3.Model of carbon monoxide (CO) transfer across the respiratory membrane. A: the cups, representing the capacity of the blood for CO, are empty as there is no CO in the blood to start with. (CO can completely displace oxygen from hemoglobin, and thus all the hemoglobin in the blood can bind CO.) They are moved at a speed of 1 cup every 12 s, which represents the rate of perfusion. Water flow, representing the rate of diffusion, is adjusted such that each cup is filled in 30 s. The equilibrium of the partial pressure of CO between the alveolus and blood, represented by a full cup, is not reached. At the end of 1 min, the total amount of water collected, representing the total CO transferred across the membrane, amounts to 2 cups. B: the cups are moved at a faster rate of 1 cup every 6 s to simulate increased perfusion. Although the speed of the cup movement has doubled, the water collected in each cup has halved. The water collected at the end of 1 min has remained at 2 cups, showing that the speed of the moving cups (perfusion) does not limit the amount of water collected. C: the flow of water through the tap is increased to more than the initial flow in A and B while the speed of the cups remains at 1 cup every 12 s. The amount of water collected is >2 cups, showing that the water flow (diffusion) limits the total amount of water collected.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe questions given to aid the discussion were as follows: 1. Why were the cups empty at the beginning of the experiment as opposed to the earlier experiment?2. Why was the water flow through the tap set at a low flow?3. Would increasing the speed at which the cups were moved increase the amount of water collected in a given time? [Students were asked to repeat the experiment by increasing the speed of cup movement, once every 6 s, and note the amount of water collected (Fig. 3B).]4. Would increasing the water flow through the tap increase the amount of water collected in a given time? [Students were asked to repeat the experiment with the normal speed of cup movement and a higher water flow (Fig. 3C).]5. What limited the amount of water carried in a given time in this experiment and what was the physiological equivalent of this factor?It was explained to the students that the capacity of the blood to carry CO was shown by the volume of the cups. As CO can displace oxygen from hemoglobin, all the hemoglobin molecules are available for CO to bind. Therefore, the cups that were moved under the tap were empty. (At this point, students can be reminded of the fact that as in the case of oxygen, the hemoglobin-bound form of CO is the major contributor to the CO content of blood. Although the dissolved form determines the partial pressure of the gas, the contribution of the dissolved form to total CO content of the blood is small.) The flow of water was kept low as the diffusion rate for CO is lower than that of oxygen. This is because there is a low concentration of CO in inspired air and therefore a smaller concentration gradient across the diffusing membrane.Collecting water at the normal rate for 1 min resulted in five partially filled cups (Fig. 3A). Moving the cups every 6 s doubled the speed at which the cups were moved. However, each cup carried only half the amount of water as before. Therefore, the amount of water collected in a given time remained the same (Fig. 3B). However, when only the flow of water was increased, the amount of water collected in each cup increased, and the total amount of water collected in 1 min was more than the previous two occasions (Fig. 3C).In this experiment, increasing the rate of cup movement did not increase the amount of water collected in a given time, but increasing the water flow through the tap did. Therefore, the factor that limited the amount of water collected was the “flow of water through the tap.” This was analogous to the diffusion of a gas across the respiratory membrane. Hence, this model simulates the diffusion limitation of a gas.DISCUSSIONBoth the experiments described above were designed to incorporate different physiological factors that, under normal circumstances, make oxygen perfusion limited and CO diffusion limited. It was also emphasized that although oxygen transfer is known to be perfusion limited and CO is known to be diffusion limited, these are not intrinsic properties of the gases themselves.The factors that make oxygen perfusion limited that were modeled were as follows: 1. A high rate of diffusion as a result of a large partial pressure difference. This was modeled using a higher water flow as opposed to that of CO.2. A lower capacity of the blood to bind new oxygen (compared with CO) as hemoglobin is 75% saturated with oxygen in the mixed venous blood. This was modeled using cups that were three-quarters full.The factors that make CO diffusion limited that were modeled were as follows: 1. A low rate of diffusion due to a low concentration of the gas, such as used in diffusion studies. This was modeled using a low water flow compared with that of oxygen.2. A high capacity of the blood to bind CO, as CO can easily displace oxygen from hemoglobin due to its high affinity. This was modeled using empty cups.This model can also be used to illustrate the behavior of gases, such as nitrous oxide, that do not bind to hemoglobin. However, in this case, it must be clearly emphasized to students that the volume of the cup, which represents the gas carrying capacity at the alveolar partial pressure, mainly consists of the gas in the dissolved form.LimitationsIn our model, the water flow representing oxygen diffusion was kept at one cup every 12 s and the flow representing CO diffusion was kept lower, at one cup every 30 s. However, physiologically, the CO diffusion rate is proportionately much lower considering the low partial pressures of CO used in diffusion studies. To accurately reflect this would have required a very low water flow, which was not practical.The rate of diffusion in our model was represented by the flow of water through the tap. Equilibrium of partial pressures is represented by a full cup, after which water overflows. In the lungs, however, the rate of diffusion keeps decreasing as the partial pressure equilibrium is approached due to a decreasing partial pressure gradient, until it stops at equilibrium. Ideally, to model this, the flow of water through the tap should gradually decrease as the cup fills and stop once the cup is full. This can be modeled using a siphon and a water reservoir, but the design would be complex and the time to fill each cup would be very long.This model specifically focuses on the concepts of diffusion and perfusion limitation of gases in the lung. Care must be taken while integrating this model with other aspects of respiratory physiology.ConclusionsThe model described above can be constructed in a short time, using materials that are inexpensive, and the experiments can be done in any place having a tap and a sink. The experiments enabled the students understand the concept of diffusion and perfusion limitation of gases easily. Apart from imparting an intuitive understanding of this concept, this experiment also served to reinforce other physiological principles such as the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, partial pressure of gases, factors that govern the diffusion rates of gases, and the pathophysiology of CO poisoning.We believe that this experiment simplifies the concept of perfusion and diffusion limitation of gases, which is otherwise a difficult concept for medical students.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: P.K. and V.T.O. conception and design of research; P.K. and V.T.O. performed experiments; P.K. and V.T.O. prepared figures; P.K. drafted manuscript; P.K. and V.T.O. edited and revised manuscript; P.K. and V.T.O. approved final version of manuscript.REFERENCE1.

    "abstract": "A physical model was used in a laboratory exercise to teach students about countercurrent exchange mechanisms. Countercurrent exchange is the transport of heat or chemicals between fluids moving in opposite directions separated by a permeable barrier (such as blood within adjacent blood vessels flowing in opposite directions). Greater exchange of heat or chemicals between the fluids occurs when the flows are in opposite directions (countercurrent) than in the same direction (concurrent). When a vessel loops back on itself, countercurrent exchange can occur between the two arms of the loop, minimizing loss or uptake at the bend of the loop. Comprehension of the physical principles underlying countercurrent exchange helps students to understand how kidneys work and how modifications of a circulatory system can influence the movement of heat or chemicals to promote or minimize exchange and reinforces the concept that heat and chemicals move down their temperature or concentration gradients, respectively. One example of a well-documented countercurrent exchanger is the close arrangement of veins and arteries inside bird legs; therefore, the setup was arranged to mimic blood vessels inside a bird leg, using water flowing inside tubing as a physical proxy for blood flow within blood vessels.",

    "abstract": "We developed a model to demonstrate how a hopping kangaroo breathes. Interestingly, a kangaroo uses less energy to breathe while hopping than while standing still. This occurs, in part, because rather than using muscle power to move air into and out of the lungs, air is pulled into (inspiration) and pushed out of (expiration) the lungs as the abdominal organs \"flop\" within the kangaroo's body. Specifically, as the kangaroo hops upward, the abdominal organs lag behind, and the insertion of the diaphragm is pulled toward its origin, flattening the dome and increasing the vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity (the thoracic cavity and lungs enlarge). Increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity reduces alveolar pressure below atmospheric pressure (barometric pressure), and air moves into the alveoli by bulk flow. In contrast, the impact of the organs against the diaphragm at each landing causes expiration. Specifically, upon landing, the abdominal organs flop into the diaphragm, causing it to return to its dome shape and decreasing the vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity. This compresses the alveolar gas volume and elevates alveolar pressure above barometric pressure, so air is expelled. To demonstrate this phenomenon, the plunger of a syringe model of the respiratory system was inserted through a compression spring. Holding the syringe and pressing the plunger firmly against a hard surface expels air from the lungs (the balloon within the syringe deflates) and compresses the spring. This models the kangaroo landing after a hop forward. Subsequently, the compression spring provides the energy for the \"kangaroo\" to \"hop\" forward upon the release of the syringe, and air enters the lungs (the balloon within the syringe inflates). The model accurately reflects how a hopping kangaroo breathes. A model was chosen to demonstrate this phenomenon because models engage and inspire students as well as significantly enhance student understanding.",

These awards were designed to parallel the Society’s Research Career Enhancement Awards and provide financial support for individuals to obtain special training, develop new skills, or create educational materials or programs. Summaries of the initial projects awarded were published in the March 2003 issue of Advances (1). This article reviews the two awards funded since that time.2001James Watrous, Saint Joseph’s University, Philadelphia, PADr. Watrous worked with Dr. D. A. Baxter at the University of Texas Health Science Center Houston on the development of a Java-based program called SNNAP, which simulates single neuron and neural network phenomena. As part of his project, Dr. Watrous began developing a web-based tutorial that includes the SNNAP simulations. Posters on this project were presented at Experimental Biology 2003 and at the 2003 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, and Dr. Watrous recently submitted a proposal to the National Science Foundation’s Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement program for support to continue the project.2002Corey L. Cleland, James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VADr. Cleland requested funding to support the development of high-quality digital videos showing microcirculation in frog webbing and rat spinal cord, heart contractions in the earthworm, and ventilation in insects. The videos are intended to serve as the proof-of-concept for a grant to be submitted to the National Science Foundation’s Educational Materials Development arm of the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program.2003There were no awards made in Spring 2003. Applications from fall 2003 are pending.NEXT APPLICATION DEADLINE: APRIL 15, 2004If you are interested in applying for a Teaching Career Enhancement Award, the application form is available online at http://www.the-aps.org/awards/society.htm#Teaching or through the Awards link on the APS home page.

    "abstract": "This contribution describes a new laboratory experience that improves medical students' learning of chronobiology by introducing them to basic chronobiology concepts as well as to methods and statistical analysis tools specific for circadian rhythms. We designed an autorhythmometry laboratory session where students simultaneously played the role of researchers and experimental subjects. During this session, which lasted 24 h, students recorded their own arterial pressure, heart rate, oral temperature, forced expiratory flow, glucose tolerance, muscular strength, reaction time, and sensorimotor coordination at regular intervals and also took the Horne and Ostberg test, after which they analyzed their own data. Furthermore, to gather information from subjects under normal sleep and eating schedules, some students acquired data at home. To guide and help students with their work, a dedicated web page was implemented with scientific references, cosinor analysis software, and other valuable information. All these \"raw\" data were combined into a single database that students could use to evaluate whatever aspect of the data they seemed fit. A number of suggestions were offered to them as guidance. Students were then instructed to write a scientific article on the subject they had chosen. The experience was highly rewarding for both instructors and students alike. In view of the high level of absenteeism in Spanish universities and the fact that 93% of the students attended the exam and 95% of these passed, the experience was considered a great success.",

Students are expected to understand the mechanisms behind paranasal sinusitis, otitis media, closed pneumothorax, and atelectasis of collapsed lung tissue, all used as examples. On the basis of the interpretation that during pneumothorax resorption, gas diffuses down pressure gradients into the blood, students are encouraged to calculate tables of pressure gradients for the above-mentioned pathological conditions. After answering a few questions, students need to analyze and eventually accept the following conclusion: in cases of air trapping in collapsible body cavities, all gases will be fully reabsorbed without pain. Air trapping in bone cavities leads only to partial reabsorption of gases and results in subatmospheric intracavity pressure. Partial vacuum causes painful mucosal edema and free fluid secretion.",

We aimed to create a guide for an interdisciplinary mock trial learning activity within the medical curriculum of the College of Medicine, Anhembi Morumbi University—Laureate International Universities, Sao Paulo, Brazil. We designed an “Animal Experimentation Mock Trial” in which students are coached to search for scientific, legal, and ethical arguments pro and contra animal experimentation in medical research. The mock trial is prepared and staged with student teams to play the 1) presiding judge, 2) the plaintiff’s attorney and expert witnesses contra animal research, 3) the defense attorney and expert witnesses pro animal research, and 4) the jury. The plaintiff and defense teams made presentations, and between each presentation the jury put questions to presenters (cross-examination). The jury team gave two evaluation scores after the plaintiff’s presentation and then after the defense presentation. The formal feedback for this active learning activity indicated that students expressed satisfaction with the teaching strategies employed in the course. The mock trial with the lesson plan provides a learning mean to exemplify the complex relationship between animal experimentation, medical evidence, ethics, and law/regulations. This mock trial helps medical students to develop their soft skills, such as the ability to collaborate and also to recognize the limits of their own knowledge, important for professional development. The importance of interdisciplinary discussions is demonstrated by increasing the awareness of the multidisciplinary aspect of animal research.",

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the primary diagnostic tool in cardiovascular diseases. Hence its interpretation is a core competency in medicine, where obvious deficiencies have been reported among learners. The aim of this study was to introduce the fundamentals of ECG knowledge and interpretation through early clinical exposure (ECE) based on a six-step approach for preclinical students ( n = 110) and to study its influence on their knowledge and interpretation skills thereafter. The first step employed a blended learning format using didactic lectures on normal and pathological ECGs, each preceded by preinstructional videos. The second step focused on psychomotor skills and utilized laboratory exercises for ECG recording and interpretation. The third step focused on vertical integration, where the clinical relevance of the procedure was established with integrated lectures. The fourth step used the Moodle platform, where opportunities for peer interactions and clarifications by clinical faculty were made available. The fifth step incorporated clinical and diagnostic reasoning through cardiology ward visits and interpretation of patient ECGs. The sixth step was designed for critical thinking and problem solving through case-based discussions with peers and faculty. Students were assessed with multiple-choice questions and objective structured practical examination. Learner perceptions of the approach were evaluated with a feedback questionnaire and focus group discussion. Statistical analysis showed that ECE through a six-step approach significantly enhanced knowledge and interpretation of ECG as evidenced by the pre- and posttest scores. Analysis of the focus group data revealed that learner engagement and skills of critical thinking were enhanced along with diagnostic and clinical reasoning.",

    "abstract": "University-level physiology courses are considered challenging. Postsecondary instructors indicate the top three reasons that make physiology courses difficult for student are 1) the need for the learner to reason mechanistically, 2) the belief among students that memorization is equal to learning, and 3) the need to think about the physiological systems as dynamic systems. One topic that encompasses all three aforementioned challenges is membrane potential and its determinants in living organisms. Membrane potential is the mechanism that underlies numerous physiological processes; memorization of these processes does not equate to understanding, and its very nature is highly dynamic. Unfortunately, students find the topic challenging, and even students who have learned and practiced the topic in previous terms, fail to retain the conceptual understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Importantly, understanding many systemic physiological processes relies on students’ mastery of concepts related to membrane potential. Stephan H. Wright rightfully wrote that “It would be difficult to exaggerate the physiological significance of [membrane potential]”. Therefore, to more effectively facilitate students’ learning of additional topics, educators must ensure that students can build on, understand, and appreciate the complexities of membrane potential determination. This article presents a tool to aid instructors of all level in teaching the topic of membrane potential.",

    "abstract": "We describe an inquiry activity that aims to develop students’ ability to interpret findings that span whole body systems and so encourage the integration of knowledge. The scenario we choose was the physiological challenge posed by diarrhea and the physiological mechanisms that underpin oral rehydration therapy. Before the staff-facilitated inquiry activity, students engage with an online information resource and complete a formative, but mandatory, prelaboratory quiz. These tasks encourage students to develop some mastery of the relevant physiology before the timetabled inquiry activity. The 3-h inquiry activity is driven by a paper workbook containing data from published studies, mainly from veterinary physiology, of the various consequences of diarrhea. Figures from published data are arranged so that, initially, the impact of dehydration on a single system (the cardiovascular system) could be appreciated. Integration with other systems (respiratory and renal systems) is then introduced progressively through the activity. The exercise is designed as a team-based inquiry activity that emphasizes the value of discussion to identify appropriate features for interpretation of the data. Students are obliged to complete a postlaboratory quiz within 5 days of the inquiry activity, serving to consolidate the students’ learning and provide staff with feedback on the attainment of intended learning outcomes. Marks from formative pre- and postlaboratory quizzes typically have a median mark in excess of 80% (pass mark is 50%), and qualitative feedback suggests that the majority of students recognized the value of the activity, despite simultaneously reporting that it was intellectually demanding.",

To address this, we designed a project, Communicating Disease, for final-year undergraduate human pathophysiology students. Students chose a disease, a relevant nonscientific target audience, and a mode of communication and produced a communiqué designed to educate the audience on the pathophysiology of the disease. Separately, students justified their choice of disease and target audience. Upon completion of the project, students completed an anonymous questionnaire, and their submitted work was analyzed. Our study demonstrated that students thought it was important to learn how to effectively communicate science to a lay audience and felt that the project had supported them in developing knowledge and skills that enabled them to do so. Students were adequately challenged, and most students gave their best effort to the project, indicating a high level of engagement. Evaluation of student performance was consistent with the students’ own perceptions and showed that most students communicated the pathophysiology effectively to the target audience and appropriately justified their choice of disease and target audience. Nevertheless, opportunities for improvement with some aspects of communication, production quality, and creativity were evident. This model is suitable for a range of scientific disciplines to engage students in developing their ability to communicate scientific information to lay audiences—a skill that it can be argued is vital for improving the scientific literacy of our community at large.",

Here, we report an adaptive measure, implemented at Monash University, to run home-based studies in cognitive neuroscience and achieve learning objectives, which are normally delivered in face-to-face practicals. We introduce two specifically designed short-term research projects and describe how different aspects of these projects, such as tutorials, experiments, and assessments, were modified to meet the required social distancing. The results of cognitive tests were closely comparable between the laboratory-based and home-based experiments indicating that students followed the guidelines and the required procedures for a reliable data collection.

Thus it is necessary to develop resources that promote the integrative vision that Physiology requires. Chronobiology is a challenging discipline and one of the least addressed concepts in Physiology curricula. The activity here presented proposes a workshop with a theoretical-practical perspective in the context of the Neuroscience Conferences held annually at our university. All conference presentations are neuroscience-related topics, in combination with practical activities, some of them analyzing variables of the students themselves. We chose to assess this informal teaching scenario to involve the students with a scientific perspective while learning and hoping to increase their appreciation for different topics related to neuroscience. Specifically for this activity on chronobiology, the evaluation was carried out via a survey study including quantitative and qualitative questions and semistructured personal interviews. In general, the results reveal a very positive opinion from students regarding aspects such as the teaching methodology, the organization before and during the activity or the added value of the experience for their future professional performance. Some of the students stated they were more aware of the importance of their circadian system and even changed some of their personal daily routines after the activity. Such positive feedback encourages us to continue working in this theoretical-practical format in the future, as it contributes to improving students’ perception of their own learning.",

This activity was performed using published LBNP papers, with which students could explore LBNP as an important tool to study physiological responses to central hypovolemia as well as consider issues in performing an LBNP experiment and interpreting experimental results. The activity was performed at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, with 31 graduate students and 4 teachers of physiology. Both students and teachers were provided with a set of questionnaires that inquired about aspects related to the structure of the activity and how this activity integrated research and knowledge, as well as aspects related to motivation of the students and teachers to perform the activity. Our results from student and teacher surveys suggest that a “dry lab” activity using LBNP to teach physiology can be an important tool to expose students to the basics of systems physiology as well as to provide useful insights into how research is performed. Providing insight into research includes formulating a research question and then designing (including taking into account confounding variables), implementing, conducting, and interpreting research studies. Finally, developing such an activity using LBNP can also serve as a basis for developing research capacities and interests of students even early in their medical studies.",

    "abstract": "The value of active learning for increasing student comprehension and retention of science, technology, e,ngineering, and mathematics (STEM) concepts within undergraduate courses has proven to be beneficial many times over; however, barriers still exist for both instructors and students. For example, instructors are often left to decide what type of active learning activities to incorporate and how to implement them yet receive little to no formal training about how to do this effectively. Additionally, student resistance to active learning persists, which adds to the pressure faced by some instructors. Compounding these issues is the absence of high-speed Internet in some regions, which makes accessing active learning activities, many of which are offered through online commercial programs, impractical if not impossible for some students. This problem was highlighted during the pandemic when courses transitioned to being partially or fully online. In this article, I describe a novel active learning method that encourages students to cognitively engage with physiology concepts by using digital images to build structures and processes using an approach that is more accessible to everyone, regardless of Internet capabilities. This approach also provides instructors an option for creating their own active learning activity that may be more suitable for their specific level of students or learning outcomes.",

Popular culture, especially mainstream superheroes, can serve as an option for mending these gaps by being a gateway to connecting to many students’ lives. Superheroes can be integrated into the classroom through relevant, creative, and unique examples that include clinical correlates, modern scientific innovations, and some real-life “supers” living among us. Real anatomy and physiology can still be taught and explained through discussing these “incredible” examples and also present an opportunity for students to be creative in generating their own anatomical and physiological explanations for various superpowers. Superheroes also help open the classroom up to being a place of acceptance, primarily through their secret identities, which cover a broad range of idols that students can look up to, whether it is their career or based on a character’s race or sexual orientation. Professors can become the superhero in their classroom and help students become more engaged and interested in the material.",

Numerous physiological societies from across the world had to cancel in-person professional meetings (1). Over time, these organizations adapted by delivering their meetings virtually. Indeed, during the summer of 2020, the Michigan Physiological Society adjusted their annual meeting such that content was scaled back from a 2-day in-person meeting to a 1-day virtual meeting. The virtual meeting provided students and trainees with a professional experience to present their scholarly work, respond to questions, and receive feedback, which was critical given the impact of the pandemic on research and professional development. A limitation of this virtual meeting was a reduced opportunity for student engagement and peer-to-peer interactions typical of traditional in-person meetings. As we continue to navigate the pandemic and plan accordingly, it is likely that future professional meetings could take place in person, virtually, or some combination of both. Therefore, it is important to recognize the strengths and limitations of each format and, importantly, find ways to facilitate engagement and interaction when using virtual platforms. In this Meeting Report, we describe how we delivered the 2021 Michigan Physiological Society Meeting virtually. Our goal was to bring together students and trainees from across the state of Michigan to discuss physiology research, education, and outreach while at the same time provide a more “in-person-like” meeting feel that facilitated interaction and engagement among attendees.ABOUT THE EVENTMeeting FormatThe 8th Annual Michigan Physiological Society Meeting took place across two afternoons, on June 24–25, 2021 (3.5 and 4 h, respectively). The meeting was delivered virtually with Zoom video teleconferencing software (Zoom Video Communications, San Jose, CA). Promotion of the meeting along with the meeting program were communicated through the Michigan Physiological Society website (https://apsmichigan.org/), social media, and e-mail listserv. Registration fees for the meeting were waived, and attendees could join and leave meeting sessions at any time. Select meeting content was also recorded. As described below, the meeting included a physiology trivia challenge and a featured symposium on day 1 and a keynote lecture and presentation sessions on day 2.Day 1—Physiology Trivia ChallengeThe meeting kicked off with a live physiology trivia challenge that was an adaptation of the physiology quiz competition that had been a feature of previous in-person meetings (2). Specifically, the physiology trivia competition was adapted for online delivery with Kahoot! (Kahoot!, Oslo, Norway). Student teams (2–5 students) answered questions that focused on general physiology knowledge and application. Importantly, other students, trainees, and faculty could follow along and watch through Zoom. Overall, this technology worked well, and participants and attendees felt engaged with the material.Day 1—Featured SymposiumThe featured meeting symposium focused on “Research and Teaching during COVID-19: Challenges, Opportunities, and Lessons Learned.” The symposium included a combination of oral presentations, thematic poster session, and round table discussions. The thematic poster session took place in small Zoom “breakout” rooms where presenters briefly highlighted their work, interacted with attendees, and answered questions. Similarly, the round table activities took place in breakout rooms where faculty moderators led a guided discussion for identifying lessons learned and strategies for moving forward with research, teaching and learning, and professional development. To promote good health and break up sitting time during the symposium (3, 4), a team of students led the audience through a series of light movements and stretches while also providing education about leveraging physical activity as a form of medicine. Together, the breakout rooms and activity breaks helped bring attendees together, facilitate engagement, and provide in-person-like interactions.Day 2—Keynote LectureThe second day of the meeting started with the Distinguished Lecture entitled “Human Limits to Exploring Mars” given by James Pawelczyk, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Kinesiology and Medicine at Pennsylvania State University. His lecture highlighted the long-term plans for extended spaceflight along with physiological challenges that astronauts will face. This lecture can be viewed online through the Michigan Physiological Society website.Day 2—Presentation SessionStudents and trainees gave oral presentations (∼5 min) and answered questions. The presentations were grouped by subject matter and separated into three short sessions. Collectively, the presentations highlighted a range of projects focused on physiological mechanisms of disease, applied physiology research, and physiology education. Faculty judges evaluated presentations for awards. To promote good health and help break up the sitting time during the presentation sessions, 10-min movement breaks were included.OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSIONSOverall, the 8th Annual Michigan Physiological Society Meeting was a success as it offered a variety of formats to disseminate and discuss physiology. Based on the outcomes from the previous year’s virtual meeting and our increased experience using Zoom, we were able to deliver a more interactive virtual meeting and a better professional development experience for students and trainees. For the meeting, more than 50 people attended each day and there was a total of 25 presentations from students, trainees, and faculty, representing 10 different colleges and universities (Table 1). The top three student and trainee presentations were bestowed a small monetary award as well. It is also important to note that the virtual meeting was delivered with minimal costs to the Michigan Physiological Society and attendees. We also appreciate the continued support from the Michigan Physiological Society member institutions across the state and the American Physiological Society for supporting our annual meeting. As an officially sanctioned state chapter under the American Physiological Society, we hope that this short report sheds light on how we continued to fulfill our mission of promoting physiology research, education, and outreach in the region, with a particular emphasis on student and trainee work, and circumvented the pandemic constraints. In fact, based on this year’s experiences, we envision that a hybrid approach to future meetings could help to broaden participation. Finally, we encourage other states to consider starting their own regional chapters of the American Physiological Society.Table 1.

    "abstract": "Developing engaging activities that build skills for understanding and appreciating research is important for undergraduate and postgraduate science students. Comparing and contrasting opposing research studies does this, and more: it also appropriately for these cohorts challenges higher level cognitive processing. Here, we present and discuss one such scenario, that of calcineurin in the heart and its response to exercise training. This scenario is further accentuated by the existence of only two studies. The background is that regular aerobic endurance exercise training stimulates the heart to physiologically adapt to chronically increase its ability to produce a greater cardiac output to meet the increased demand for oxygenated blood in working muscles, and this happens by two main mechanisms: 1) increased cardiac contractile function and 2) physiologic hypertrophy. The major underlying mechanisms have been delineated over the last decades, but one aspect has not been resolved: the potential role of calcineurin in modulating physiologic hypertrophy. This is partly because the existing research has provided opposing and contrasting findings, one line showing that exercise training does activate cardiac calcineurin in conjunction with myocardial hypertrophy, but another line showing that exercise training does not activate cardiac calcineurin even if myocardial hypertrophy is blatantly occurring. Here, we review and present the current evidence in the field and discuss reasons for this controversy. We present real-life examples from physiology research and discuss how this may enhance student engagement and participation, widen the scope of learning, and thereby also further facilitate higher level cognitive processing.",

    "abstract": "Physiology education, which occupies an important place in undergraduate medical education, exhibits diversities across the world. Since there was no specific source of information about physiology education in Turkish medical faculties, the authors aimed to evaluate the general status of undergraduate physiology teaching of medical students in Turkey. A questionnaire designed for the program used for medical students was sent to the physiology departments of 38 faculties that had academic personnel and had carried out medical education for at least 3 years. It questioned the educational load, content, and duration of the lectures, written materials, techniques, assessment methods, basic equipments, and subjects used in practical sessions. All 38 departments answered the questionnaire. This study investigating 38 faculties showed that the content and time devoted to lectures and practical sessions (169 and 35 h) differed, as it does throughout the world, and teaching laboratories constituting 17% of total physiology education were performed and assessed by all of the departments. The practical hours correlated with the number of teaching staff. Our results indicated an insufficient number of teaching staff with a heavy educational load. This survey showed that the number of teaching staff is critical for practical sessions. Considering that the actual number of medical schools is 61 schools, with some established but not yet admitting students and educating with their own staff, if the requirements for teaching staff are not met, physiology education in Turkey will face important problems in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "Clinical physiologists in Sweden are physicians (the majority with a PhD degree) with thorough training in system physiology and pathophysiology. They investigate patients in a functional approach and are engaged in basic and applied physiology teaching and research. In 1954, clinical physiology was founded as an independent academic and clinical discipline by the Swedish government to ensure \"contact between routine clinical work and the scientific progression.\" Up until 2008, clinical physiology was an independent clinical discipline but was then made a subdiscipline to radiology, a fundamentally different discipline. Individuals wishing to become clinical physiologists are required to be trained and certified as European radiologists, after which training and certification as clinical physiologists may be pursued. This means that radiologists without training in clinical physiology have become gatekeepers for future clinical physiologists. Unfortunately, this development takes place at a time when research and education in preclinical integrative physiology have diminished in favor of other organizational levels, such as cellular and molecular biology. The responsibilities for education and research in integrative human physiology have therefore mainly been transferred to clinical physiologists. Clinical physiology has been a successful independent clinical discipline in Sweden for the past 55 years and could serve as a model for other countries. Unless clinical physiologists regain control over their own discipline, systems physiology as a knowledge base and resource for patient care, education, and research will be severely impaired.",

Pairs of student teams tested individual aerobically trained participants exercising to voluntary exhaustion on a cycle ergometer.

This survey was administered in 2014 and 2015 to undergraduate students who submitted physiology abstracts for and attended EB. More than 150 students responded (38% response rate). Respondents were demographically representative of undergraduate students majoring in life sciences in the United States. Most students (72%) became involved in research through a summer research program or college course. They attended a variety of EB sessions, including poster sessions and symposia, and found them useful. Undergraduate students interacted with established researchers at multiple venues. Students recommended that APS provide more research fellowships (25%) and keep in touch with students via both e-mail (46%) and social media (37%). Our results indicate that APS' EB undergraduate activities are valued by students and are effective in helping them have a positive scientific meeting experience. These results also guided the development of a more streamlined survey for use in future years.",

    "abstract": "Methods for Improving Undergraduate Physiology Education\" was part of the 38th International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) World Congress program and occurred on August 3, 2017, in Rio de Janeiro/RJ, Brazil.The symposium was proposed by Pâmela B. Mello-Carpes, from Brazil (chair), and co-chaired by Barbekka Hurtt (USA) and was intended to discuss alternative methods for improving physiology learning in undergraduate students.The 2-h symposium consisted of a short introduction to the theme, followed by five talks of 20 min each, and concluded with 15 min for audience questions and panel discussion.This session attracted a large number of delegates (conference hall capacity filled and standing room only).Indeed, we understand this symposium was among the most popular in the program.But what made it so popular?In our estimation, the symposium theme was relevant for the entire physiology community participating in the congress, including physiology professors and undergraduate and graduate students who will teach physiology in their future career, since an important challenge for physiology professors is to make physiological concepts interesting and significant to students, and we discussed different ways to do this.In her introductory remarks, Pâmela Mello-Carpes explained that the use of student-centered teaching methods assists the students in building on previous learning and drives them to actively engage in their learning experience and to prepare to be a knowledgeable future professional (12, 13).Furthermore, since physiology is sometimes a difficult course, physiology professors need to be conscious that different and/or alternative teaching-learning strategies are preferable for helping different students learn more effectively.The use of methods that stimulate the students to develop their own questions, draw on their own experiences, analyze and interpret data, and draw their own conclusions are always preferable to make the content more relevant, significant, and memorable to promote the long-term retention and application of knowledge (2, 5-7, 16, 19, 20, 23).",

    "abstract": "Regenerative medicine is a novel discipline that both excites undergraduates and may be used as a vehicle to expose students to scientific concepts and opportunities. The goal of this article is to describe the implementation of a National Science Foundation-funded Targeted Infusion Project in which underrepresented minority undergraduates are exposed to laboratory-bench skills and summer research opportunities that they may not have encountered otherwise. A 3-wk infusion of laboratory-bench and data presentation skills, in the context of a regenerative medicine/bioengineering project, aimed to engage students and expose them to opportunities as summer researchers and teaching assistants. The infusion aimed to assess the extent to which students improved 1) attitudes toward laboratory-bench-based techniques, using attitudes toward science as a proxy; 2) perceptions of scientific inquiry; 3) intentions to engage in undergraduate research; and 4) intentions to persist in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related fields. Results indicate that the 3-wk infusion had no effect on science attitudes, but transcribed responses to structured interviews administered after the summer research experience indicated that students who completed summer research projects had positive experiences. Differences in intentions to engage in research were detected between groups of students in different STEM majors, in addition to differences in intentions to pursue a career in science. We describe the implementation of the infusion and briefly discuss quantitative outcomes. We conclude that infusion of laboratory-bench modules in the context of a regenerative medicine/bioengineering project may play a small but important role in increasing (minority) participation and persistence in the STEM pipeline.",

    "abstract": "For the past 6 yr, the Department of Physiology at Michigan State University (MSU) has partnered with Impression 5 Science Center in Lansing, MI. Together, we host a day-long community engagement event on a Saturday each year in early November coinciding with the American Physiological Society's Physiology Understanding Week. The purpose was to provide a fun and memorable hands-on experience for children and families. This paper describes the detailed planning and logistics. The event takes place in the main exhibit space at the science center, generally has 15-17 physiology activities stations set up as booths run by volunteers, and the event runs as an open-house format. Three to five trained volunteers were needed per station for the full day. Since this was primarily based on undergraduate student volunteer involvement (a population already limited for time), morning, afternoon, and/or full-day shifts were offered to accommodate a variety of schedules. Additional set-up, clean-up, and general help was also recruited. Overall, ~100-150 MSU students, faculty, and staff members served as volunteers, alongside Impression 5 staff. Hosting the event at the science center generated a larger audience, aided in advertisement, and allowed for access to a large facility capable of handling the 600-1,000 attendees. The partnership facilitated the sharing of equipment and supplies for physiology demonstrations, allowed for activities on site in the chemistry laboratory space, and facilitated the growth of new community partnerships with local schools and groups who attended the event.",

    "abstract": "Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) continue to work to increase the diversity of the fields, yet there are still significant historical and societal hurdles to be overcome before we reach full representation throughout STEM. The concept of science identity has become a point of interest in this process; it has been suggested that development of one's identity as a scientist is critical to persistence in the field. Metaphors that are rooted in bodily experience can provide a starting point to understand abstract concepts, including science identity and how we as STEM educators respond to increasing diversity within our fields. Given the history of STEM being predominantly populated by people who are white and male, disorientation or discomfort with increasing diversity is not unexpected, and many women and people of color report discrimination and marginalization as a part of their experience in STEM. Here I present a neuroscience-based metaphor that can serve as a starting point for understanding some of the potential disorientation or discomfort that we may experience as we engage with the increasing diversity of STEM and acknowledge this experience as a normal but temporary part of the process of growth and development as a field. I encourage the development and use of further discipline-based metaphors to enhance our discussion and understanding of this important work.",

    "abstract": "This project used the approach of \"human situations\" to teach about the cardiovascular system within an undergraduate physiology course (PGY 412). About two-thirds of the students had previously taken a college-level physiology course (sophisticated), whereas one-third had not (naive). Nine didactic lectures were organized around the common human situations of orthostasis, blood donation, and exercise. For acceptance evaluation, the students were given a questionnaire consisting of six expectation statements (e.g., compared with other life science courses, I expect that I will better understand the material) and asked to rate the degree to which they agreed with each statement on a scale of 1 to 5. On completion of the lectures, the students were given a questionnaire asking them to compare experiences with expectations. Experiences were significantly less than expectations for naive (P < 0.05) but not for sophisticated students. On a scale of 1 to 5, sophisticated students preferred the situations approach more than did naive students (3.1 vs 2.4; P < 0.066). For performance evaluation, the students were given a set of questions used by the author in a previous PGY 412 course presented by traditional didactic lectures. There were no significant differences between present and previous scores (77 vs. 79%; P > 0.16). Furthermore, there were no significant differences between naive and sophisticated students in cardiovascular examination scores (P > 0.608) or in total course scores (P > 0.523). These results indicate that didactic lectures based on situational physiology will yield a performance outcome equivalent to traditional lectures. However, naive students may have difficulty with the procedure and require extra attention.",

    "abstract": "This report describes a Langendorff heart preparation, which utilizes frog rather than mammalian hearts to demonstrate both mechanical and electrical events of the cardiac cycle. The preparation is durable in that it can be maintained for several hours while being perfused with room-temperature solutions that are not supplemented with oxygen. Ventricular perfusion is achieved via a fluid-filled reservoir coupled to a truncus arteriosus catheter advanced into the ventricle. By varying the height of the reservoir relative to the heart, changes in ventricular pressure and the rate of ventricular pressure change during systole can be recorded by way of a side port on the catheter tubing. The former is indicative of Starling's law of the heart, whereas the latter is reflective of the contractility. Electrical activity of the heart can be observed by measuring injury potentials via a needle electrode inserted into the ventricle. These are extracellular potentials that reflect ventricular action potentials. In addition, surface electrodes placed on the ventricle can be used to detect an integrated ventricular electrocardiogram. Recording of ventricular pressure simultaneously with at least one of these two electrical recordings allows a direct comparison of electrical and mechanical events of the heart. In summary, the Langendorff frog heart preparation is economical in terms of both financial cost and simplicity; yet it enables a thorough examination of both electrical and mechanical properties of the heart either as a student lab exercise or as a classroom demonstration.",

    "abstract": "To improve and thus strengthen its teaching program, the Department of Physiology at the University of South Alabama voluntarily embarked on a multiphasic self-assessment of its medical teaching program. One phase of the greater assessment plan included an analysis of the teaching methods of each faculty member. To design and implement this phase, the services of a teaching consultant from the College of Education were obtained. The implementation of the objectives as established by the consultant resulted in 1) the development of a systematic and consistent method of evaluating the teaching practices of the faculty through the design of a standard observation instrument for use in analyzing the teaching of each individual; 2) the sampling of the teaching of each of the seven participating faculty members; 3) the collection and critical review of teaching materials used; 4) an analysis of the effectiveness of the faculty; and 5) the submission of a written report of evaluation results. The seven participating faculty members were observed during the delivery of two lectures each presented to the freshman medical class. Based on the analysis of both the lectures and materials used, a written critique of each faculty member was submitted. Lecture strengths and weaknesses, both of individual members and of the whole department were summarized. Finally, the results of a survey taken of the faculty in which the participants were asked to respond to a series of questions regarding the self-assessment program were most favorably accepted by all participating faculty.",

In this paper we provide a list of some of the misconceptions that we have encountered, some explanations of the distinctions to be made, and some of the rationale behind current surgical procedures and drug treatment. The misconceptions include failing to differentiate between the Frank-Starling mechanism and cardiac dilation as well as not grasping the significance that changes in cardiac beta-receptor function have in limiting the positive inotropic actions of circulating catecholamines. Finally, we review some of the altered neurohumoral mechanisms in heart failure and explain the basis for some common therapeutic approaches, including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in this disease.",

Small groups of four to five students critically analyze at least 10 articles from the primary scientific literature. The end result of this process is the equivalent of a scientific review article that is presented in two formats, a 10-min oral presentation and a scientific poster presentation. Students perform better on application tasks than on analysis, synthesis, or evaluation tasks associated with the project (P &lt; 0.025) and generally respond positively to process questions (59-82%) but less positively to task questions (36-76%) about group dynamics. The cognitive skills and basic content knowledge required to complete this project are developed throughout the undergraduate program. Thus the project is a type of culminating program experience.

These experiments are safe, robust, inexpensive, and time efficient, and they teach the principles of cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, nutritional, and gastrointestinal physiology. In addition, they enhance medical education in several other important dimensions. First, they teach safe venous blood collection and handling, a training appropriate for students at this level. Second, by serving each week as subjects as well as experimenters, students experience aspects of both sides of the doctor-patient relationship. Third, the laboratories can be used to teach fundamentals of research design and analysis. Finally, because blood analysis is central to medicine, and because the student's own blood data are discussed, students are enthusiastic and cooperative, and the clinical relevance of the data is clear.",

This essay uses three papers by Horace Davenport to highlight the experimental evidence for a crucial step in that process: the generation of H + and HCO 3 − through the agency of carbonic anhydrase.

Here we use a clinical scenario undertaken by second-year Bachelor of Paramedic Practice students of acute coronary syndrome to demonstrate the difference in clinical decision making when using a clinical reasoning approach to treatment rather than relying exclusively on a practice guidelines approach. We hope to demonstrate that understanding basic bioscience concepts, such as the Frank-Starling mechanism and the anatomy and physiology of the autonomic nervous system, are key to providing good clinical care in response to ambiguous patient symptoms. Students who understand these concepts underlying their patient care guideline will make better clinical decisions and better provide quality of care than students who follow the guideline exclusively. We aim this as a practical demonstration of the value of detailed understanding of human bioscience in allied health education. As health care providers transition from \"technician\" to \"practitioner,\" the key distinguishing feature of the role is the ability to practice independently, using \"best judgment\" rather than clinical guidelines (alone). Evidence suggests that complex case management requires detailed bioscience understanding.",

Accordingly, science instructors are now urged to craft their classrooms such that they serve as not only spaces for disseminating information, but also an arena through which students are encouraged to think scientifically and develop critical-thinking skills. This project aimed to develop a workbook that helps postsecondary students learn endocrinology and engages them in critical thinking. Each of the five chapters focuses on a different topic rooted within core biological concepts relevant to endocrinology. Such topics were identified on cross-referencing seminal reports on science education. Tenants of Numrich's Sequence of Critical-Thinking Tasks were used to guide the development of chapter sections with the intent of engaging students in critical thinking over time by way of practice and scaffolded guidance. Chapter sections of modeling, event sequencing, clinical application, research and communication, and simulation, target different skills presented in Numrich's framework. Students' learning, experiences, and behaviors were used to evaluate the workbook and inform the revision of the workbook into the publicly available second edition.",

The objective of this study was to explore students' perception on the importance of \"doing\" hematology experiments. The first-year medical students of the 2017-18 batch filled out a semistructured questionnaire at the end of the course of hematology practicals. The questionnaire captured their perception of the importance of doing hematology practicals on their own blood, the assessment of the same, and its value in medical training. Students indicated that doing practicals individually by pricking themselves was a necessary part of physiology teaching (n = 126 responses: 43 men, 83 women; 86%). They felt that it not only improved their knowledge (n = 120: 39 men, 81 women; 82%) and fine-motor skills (n = 107: 41 men, 66 women; 73%), but also molded their attitude (n = 101: 41 men, 60 women; 69%), gearing them to become empathetic and confident doctors. They felt that some practicals were unnecessary/outdated; this needs attention. While suggesting a few modifications in the practical curriculum, almost all students felt that the practicals should be continued for future batches. Students felt that doing hematology practical work was a necessary part of their training. It improved their knowledge, skills, and attitude, making them more empathetic and confident doctors.",

However, a medical undergraduate needs hands-on training to handle a living tissue to have a better understanding of physiology. The present sourcebook update describes the use of avian gut, which is usually discarded in abattoirs, as an effective replacement of mammalian gut to understand basic gut smooth muscle physiology. The avian gut can be used to study the effect of various drugs and ions as used in mammalian gut experiments. The experiment protocol described in the update can be performed by students of basic sciences and medical students using minimal laboratory set up and at low cost, producing results comparable to mammalian gut experiments. Ethical permissions may not be necessary; however, the disposal of tissue waste has to follow proper guidelines.",

Accordingly, we used a simple battery as an analogy for electrocardiogram vectors to introduce the theoretical physics of how the heart produces voltages that are detectable at the body surface.

We evaluated the ICT implementation in cardiovascular physiology in Slovenian primary school education. Surprisingly, we showed a relatively low acceptance rate in biology classes: only 42.8% of involved Slovenian biology teachers used a pulse rate (PR) measuring device. As a part of a Slovenian Project, students designed, developed, and manufactured a device capable of low-cost, automatic, noninvasive, and straightforward PR sampling in real time. The device was named Fingerbeeper, and teachers' perceptions of its efficacy and efficiency were evaluated in the elementary school biology lessons, comparing its ease of use with other commercially available devices: the systems from Vernier, Biopac, and the Gear Sport Samsung smartwatch. The most preferred system was the system from Vernier (36.4%), followed by the Fingerbeeper (29.1%), the system from Biopac (18.2%), and the smartwatch (16.3%). Teachers provided their opinion on the efficiency of the Fingerbeeper in terms of cost compared with the other three measurement devices. Its perception of efficiency was comparable to the other commercially available devices while having the estimated cost of only a few percent of the Biopac or Vernier systems. Considering the general low funding in the public primary schools in Slovenia, the bias toward Fingerbeeper seemed rational, outweighing the superior performance of the commercial systems. Further research and improvement of such low-cost and high-efficiency devices, also in general terms, would lead to broader acceptance and implementation of the ICT in curricula.",

    "abstract": "There is a widely variable breadth of coverage of skeletal muscle content across both undergraduate human anatomy and undergraduate anatomy and physiology (A&P) courses. In response to the need for a more global understanding of the content taught in undergraduate anatomy courses, we developed an online survey (administered through Qualtrics) where both human anatomy and A&P faculty could report skeletal muscle coverage in their courses. The survey also collected comparative demographic institutional data such as the type of institution (community college vs. 4 year), course format, and geographic location of the undergraduate institution. Skeletal muscles surveyed included those listed and described in a typical undergraduate human anatomy text (McKinley MP, O'Loughlin VD, Pennefather O. Human Anatomy (5th ed.), 2017, p. 960). The data indicated some interesting instructional trends regarding muscular system coverage. First, both the \"identification\" and \"action\" of specific muscles are taught at a higher frequency than the teaching of either \"attachments or innervation.\" Innervation of specific skeletal muscles is the least taught concept. In each body region, certain muscles were taught with higher frequency than others. This research shows there is a global trend in teaching identification of specific skeletal muscles within each body region and often this is accompanied by teaching actions of said muscles. These general instructional trends may increase our understanding of the anatomical and physiological education our undergraduate students are receiving and will lead to further critical conversations about content development and curriculum.",

This manuscript is the second in a series (Reynolds A, Goodwin M, O'Loughlin VD. Adv Physiol Educ 46: 309-318, 2022. doi:https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00084.2021) that methodically assesses skeletal muscle content coverage across undergraduate HA and A&P courses. The authors developed an online skeletal muscle coverage survey and collected 342 responses worldwide, 156 from instructors of HA courses and 186 from A&P course instructors. Demographic results showed that HA courses are primarily taught at 4-year baccalaureate institutions, have relatively larger class sizes, and are more likely to use human (vs. animal) prosections or dissections. In contrast, A&P courses are primarily taught at community colleges, have relatively smaller class sizes, and are more likely to use animal (vs. human) dissections. HA courses tend to require their students to learn all skeletal muscle aspects (i.e., identification, action, attachments, innervation), whereas A&P courses tend to focus on muscle identification or action only. The proportions of courses that require identification of large, superficial skeletal muscles are similar between the two course types. However, HA courses are more likely to require their students to identify deeper and smaller muscles, including more distal appendicular muscles and pelvic muscles. These differences likely are due, in part, to the more anatomical focus of HA courses and the slightly different student populations between these courses. These findings provide much-needed information about muscular system coverage between HA and A&P courses and may guide instructor discussions about curricula.",

    "abstract": "Undergraduate programs related to allied health are often pursued by students to prepare for entrance into professional programs, but many students also ask about what types of employment options they may have upon completion of the bachelor's degree. This experiential learning course in cardiovascular and sleep technology was designed to provide opportunities for students to gain hands-on clinical skills that could help them to enter professional programs or to find employment in an allied health field such as cardiopulmonary rehabilitation, cardiovascular technology, or sleep technology. The prerequisites for this course were the completion of two semesters of anatomy and physiology. This course was based on experiential learning and was structured into three modules: clinical exercise physiology, autonomic physiology, and sleep physiology. As part of the course students completed a 4-page scientific report for one designated topic within each of the modules. The two exams in the course were essay based. The design of this course required students to review key topics from anatomy and physiology, to comprehend peer-reviewed manuscripts, to gain hands-on experiences with sophisticated physiological equipment, to work as individuals and in groups, and to become better oral and written communicators. The sleep physiology module included an introduction to electroencephalography (EEG) and a student-led nap study, which may be an effective way to introduce students to sleep medicine. We are hopeful that the summary of this course will be useful to physiology educators as they work to provide the most meaningful experiences to their undergraduates in the health sciences.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Experiential learning in clinical exercise, autonomic regulation, and sleep physiology is an impactful way to train undergraduate biomedical students to enter a variety of careers in healthcare, graduate programs in the health professions, or traditional research graduate programs. A hands-on course such as Cardiovascular and Sleep Technology provides a way, in addition to or independent of original research, to provide clinically relevant training.",

    "abstract": "We have used ultrasound imaging and technology as a tool for nonclinical teaching of basic physiological concepts for several years and are aware anecdotally that only a few others in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland (UK/ROI) are also using ultrasound with this intention in physiology and anatomy teaching. To better understand what areas ultrasound is used for by others, along with what barriers might exist to its use, we reached out to colleagues in UK/ROI institutions instructing on anatomy and physiology courses by asking them to complete a survey regarding their experiences. Relatively few institutions (9%) reported using the technology in this way but covered physiology and anatomy teaching in most major body systems. The perception of responding educators overall is that, overwhelmingly, ultrasound offers a useful addition to the teaching of physiology and anatomy and is very popular with students. Barriers to its implementation were identified, including unfamiliarity with equipment and potential uses. Lack of funding for equipment and staff, issues with class sizes, and lack of curriculum time were also identified. Despite these potential impediments, most nonusers were interested in finding out about the uses of ultrasound as a teaching tool. We conclude that the teaching community would benefit from wider dissemination of local practices.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We surveyed UK and Republic of Ireland institutions to establish the extent of ultrasound use in teaching undergraduate modules with significant anatomy or physiology content. Responses indicate that although ultrasound is used for a wide variety of systems, only a small proportion of courses use ultrasound for teaching. There is widespread interest in its use, with the main barriers being unfamiliarity with potential uses and the technology. We endorse further dissemination of this teaching practice.",

    "abstract": "Graduate students intending to pursue an academic career in the sciences have much to gain by learning to teach science but often have limited training opportunities. In response to this need, we designed a one-semester course, Learning Design in Science Education (LDSE), in which students receive formal training in pedagogical theory with role model demonstration of current best practices in active learning. Building from previous descriptions of similar courses, we added a practical experience for the students to utilize their new skills to design and teach a mini science course at the end of the semester. Additionally, students developed a teaching portfolio, complete with a personal teaching statement, syllabus, course materials, and evaluations from peers and faculty. Overall, the course was well received by the students and there are early indications that students benefited from their participation in the course. In this manuscript, we present the design and outcomes of the course, faculty and student perceptions, and thoughts on improvements for future semesters and its potential for use by others.",

Grade-focused interactions between students and instructors have anecdotally been reported to be increasing. However, no empirical study has yet evaluated students' grade perceptions or the prevalence of these interactions. If we want to change students' grade fixation, we first need to understand it. The purpose of this research study was to investigate the prevalence of and factors that contribute to students' grade-focused interactions. Using a mixed-methods approach via surveys and a quasi-experimental intervention with focus groups and audio recordings of student-instructor interactions, we found that students' perceptions of grades are relatively fixed. Furthermore, although >25% of our respondents reported negotiating a grade, there were no significant perceptual differences or academic values held between students who self-reported engaging in grade-focused interactions and those who did not. Our findings suggest that unless institutional and professional program requirements change, the pressure faced by students and their preoccupation with grades will not change either.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Undergraduate science students face immense pressure to perform academically; this pressure may be linked to grade-focused interactions, which have been anecdotally reported among educators.

The workshop engaged students in open-ended investigations and guided experiments. Each class was divided into three or four groups, with each group working with a trained doctoral student or postdoctoral fellow. During an initial questioning phase, students observed slides depicting the glycemia of individuals in various situations. Students identified hyperglycemic individuals relative to the average glycemia of the displayed population. Students were asked to devise a treatment for these diabetics. They quickly realized that they couldn't experiment on patients and understood the need for laboratory models. Each group gave ideas of experiments to perform. We then explained, taking into account their propositions, the protocols students could execute to address one of the following questions: Which criteria must an animal model of diabetes fulfill? How do pancreatic cells maintain glycemia? Is there a way to produce an insulin protein similar to the one released by human pancreatic cells? We used two different evaluation metrics of the workshop: a questionnaire filled out by the students before and after the workshop and a poster produced by students at the end of the workshop. We found that this educational approach successfully improved student awareness and understanding of the scientific reasoning and research process.",

However, graduate programs in pharmacology and physiology have increasingly begun to focus on more reductionist approaches to basic science, neglecting training in integrative/systems physiology. In response to a decline in the competency of recent pharmacology and physiology graduates, a biennial meeting, National Directors of Graduate Studies (NDOGS) in pharmacology and physiology, was conceived to address these concerns and improve the quality of graduate education. NDOGS functions as a forum for directors of pharmacology and physiology programs to exchange ideas and tackle the challenges facing graduate education. The 2015 meeting was held on the campus of the University of Cincinnati, and each day of the meeting was allocated for discussion of a broad topic. On Friday, talks were aimed at “enhancing the professional pipeline.” On Saturday, the theme of “fitting training to emerging needs” tackled ways that universities can respond to the emerging needs of a changing society. Sunday morning updated graduate program directors about changes to National Institutes of Health T32 Training Grant applications and provided a forum for program directors to share their experiences and concerns. Throughout the meeting, presentations and discussions highlighted challenges and opportunities that apply broadly to PhD training in the biomedical sciences and revealed best practices to improve training and career preparation of PhD trainees.",

One benefit of REM is the ability to identify unintended outcomes, or \"ripples,\" of the intervention of interest. Ripples are visually represented by a mind map created during the REM session. Mind maps connect related concepts, typically with the main concept in the center of the map and supporting ideas radiating from a central node. This project applied REM to undergraduate course evaluation. The purpose of this study was threefold: to use REM to identify undergraduate student-perceived benefits of research projects, to assess whether REM could be used to confirm achievement of course learning objectives, and to compare the themes identified from the mind mapping component of REM to those identified by inductive analysis. Mind maps were generated with Xmind (Xmind Ltd., Hong Kong) during online sessions by two groups of students, those who completed a \"mandatory\" research project (n = 11) and those who chose to participate in an additional \"optional\" research project (n = 9). There was considerable overlap in identified themes between mind mapping and inductive analysis, with skills, relationships, career direction, and unexpected benefits identified by both techniques. Mind mapping identified several additional themes. Findings from both approaches were compared to course learning objectives, and both confirmed that all objectives were met. In situations where time is a limiting factor, mind mapping could be superior to the complete REM approach for course learning objective assessments.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study used Ripple Effects Mapping (REM) to identify undergraduate student-perceived benefits of research projects, to assess whether REM could confirm achievement of course learning objectives for a research project-based course, and to compare themes identified from the mind mapping component of REM to those identified by inductive analysis.

However, this examination mode lacks the process of teacher feedback. Herein, a short teacher feedback from was added immediately after the collaborative testing to improve the students' performance. A parasitology class of 121 undergraduates was randomized into two groups: group A and group B. Collaborative testing was carried out at the end of theoretical teaching. During the test, students would first answer questions as individuals for 20 minutes. Then, students from group A answered the same questions in groups (5 students in each group) for 20 minutes, while the group-testing duration was only 15 minutes in group B. Immediately after the group testing, teachers conducted a 5-minute feedback about the morphology identification according to the analysis of the answers by group B. Four weeks later, a final test was conducted in an individual test. The total scores and scores for each examination content were analyzed. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the final exam scores between both groups (t = -1.278, P = 0.204). However, the morphological and diagnostic test results of the final examination in group B were significantly higher than those of the midterm examination, while there was no significant change in group A (t = 4.333, P = 0.051). The results confirmed that the teacher feedback after the collaborative testing can effectively make up for the students' knowledge gaps.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study found that collaborative group testing is helpful for teachers to grasp students' knowledge gaps more easily and the teacher feedback after the collaborative group testing can effectively make up for the knowledge gaps of students.",

    "abstract": "Fine needle puncture (FNP) is a widespread technique used to collect cellular samples. Its efficiency can be enhanced by the use of ultrasonography to guide the procedure. Ultrasound-guided FNP is therefore an operator-dependent exam. For this reason, it demands the acquisition of psychomotor skill, ability to recognize structures, and dexterity during the needle puncture. This study describes the development of an artisanal simulator made with gelatin to replace the use of live animals during practical classes in veterinary or medical sciences education. The experimental set consisted of three phases in which the student performed different tasks such as recognition of the target structure with ultrasound and injection of ink (phase 1) or aspiration (phase 2) of its content and evaluation of a parenchymatous organ (liver) and puncture of its surface (phase 3). A survey on the acceptance of the model was carried out, and students filled out a questionnaire elaborated with the visual analog scale system. Participants considered the artisanal model a strong method to teach ultrasound-guided FNP. Other attractive advantages of this simulator are the low manufacturing costs (compared with expensive high-technology devices) and the possibility to replace the use of live animals in practical classes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study describes an artisanal simulator made with gelatin to teach ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture during practical classes in veterinary or medical sciences education. A three-phase experimental set allowed the students to practice ultrasound-guided fine needle puncture, aspiration, and injection in three different target structures.

    "abstract": "Preclinical medical education has lost its way. In fact, it seems that preclinical medical education has forgotten its mission and has become focused on assembly line efficiency and profits. Administrators and students are increasingly considering preclinical medical education as a market with credentials (access to USMLE Step 1 or COMLEX Level 1) the commodity and students the consumers. Consider that, once banned, for-profit medical schools are on the rise in the United States. In response to these changes, medical schools are adopting corporate models, cutting costs, and seeking profit-making opportunities. One example is the broadcasting of content to multiple sites and satellite campuses. In addition, the customers need to feel satisfied with the educational experience bought for them at high tuition costs. However, providing students with what they want often happens at the expense of what they need, and administrators engage in subtle pandering to students. Furthermore, although the pursuit of credentials is understandable, a university is more than a factory that produces diplomas and careers. Universities exist to educate, discover, and impart knowledge while impacting our ways of living and thinking. In this context, universities exist for the greater good and betterment of societies. The \"corporatization\" of medical education and satisfying the customer creates an environment where a university is selling socioeconomic stability, professional status, and success, rather than a setting for the formation of character, intellect, and critical thinking. Our hope is that administrators, educators, and students will reconnect to the greater purpose and value of learning.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We should be preparing future physicians to deliver the care we want to receive as patients. This requires training in communication, collaboration, inquiry, discovery, and innovation while developing the habits of the mind and heart that advance the practice of medicine and the health of the public. However, the current \"corporatization\" of medical education is failing to accomplish this outcome. Specifically, medical schools are adopting corporate models, cutting costs, and seeking profit-making opportunities without improving what goes on in the classroom. Our hope is that we will reconnect to the greater purpose and value of learning.",

Therefore, we set up an interactive practical classroom, engaging all of the attending students of the year (n = 47). Each student was assigned a physiological role (marked on a cardboard sign) in the following events: stimulation on motoneuron dendrites, sodium ions (Na+) influx and potassium ions (K+) efflux, action potentials onset and saltatory conduction along the axon, acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter exocytosis following Ca2+ influx, ACh binding to postsynaptic membrane receptors, ACh-esterase action, excitatory postsynaptic potential, release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, mechanism of muscular contraction and relaxation, and rigor mortis. A sketch was drawn with colored chalks on the ground outside the room: the motoneuron with its dendrites, cell body, initial segment, myelinated axon, and synaptic bouton; the postsynaptic plasma membrane of the muscle fiber; and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Students each had their own role and were asked to position themselves and move, accordingly. This resulted in a complete, dynamic, and fluid representation being performed. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the students' learning was limited at this pilot stage. However, positive feedback was received in the self-evaluation reports that were written by students on the physiological meaning of their own role, as well as in the satisfaction questionnaires requested by the University. The rate of students who successfully passed the written exam and the rate of correct answers that included the specific topics addressed in this practice were reported.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We set up an interactive practical classroom, engaging all the attending students of the year (n = 47).

However, several issues in the literature cause the current explanations of CCM to be inefficient and incomplete. As a result, it is challenging to clearly explain CCM in physiology education. The goal of this article is to share a modified version of CCM with more understandable explanation in the hopes of motivating peer discussion, further improvement, and future research. To reach this goal, the logical processes leading to CCM are first analyzed, which results in a set of formulas that serve as the principles governing CCM. Next, the cessation of CCM is addressed to provide a complete picture of the modified version of CCM. Throughout these two steps, the issues mentioned above are identified and addressed so that how the modified version of CCM eliminates these issues becomes clear. The formulas mentioned above are provided in the Tables S1, S2, and S3 (all Supplemental material is available in the Supplemental Excel File at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23515614) to explain how the interstitial and intrathick ascending limb osmotic concentration (OC) values used in the figures in this article are simulated and how alternative OC values can be generated from Tables S1 and S2 to illustrate CCM.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Countercurrent multiplication is widely accepted as the mechanism for the generation of the corticopapillary osmotic gradient in the outer medulla of mammalian kidneys, but the current explanations of it in textbooks and the literature are inefficient and incomplete, leading to confusion for students.

    "abstract": "This is a memoir of my experiences in learning and teaching Physiology. It begins in 1962 when I entered the University of Washington as a medical student and began research in a physiology laboratory, which led to a Ph.D. degree in Physiology and Biophysics to go with my M.D. degree in 1968. At this time, both groups of students participated in the same physiology course containing both lectures and laboratories. After postdoctoral research at the NIH and in Cambridge, UK, in 1973 I joined the faculty of the Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco where I participated in the teaching of medical students and graduate students for nearly 15 years. By this time, the teaching of medical and graduate students had largely separated. In 1987, I moved to the University of Michigan as Professor and Chair of Physiology where my role in teaching was organizational as well as participatory for the next 35 years. In this work, I compare the teaching of medical students as well as graduate students and focus on how it has changed over this 60-year period. Over this time both medical and graduate Ph.D. education have become more integrative. Medical education is now taught in organ blocks rather than courses, and I participated in organizing the teaching of the gastrointestinal block. At Michigan, there is no longer a separate medical school class in Physiology, and graduate students enter a combined, \"Program in Biomedical Science\" for a year before choosing a mentor and department.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Teaching remains an important part of the career of academic physiologists. It is important for schools offering the Ph.D. to provide instruction and experience in teaching. The American Physiology Society has developed new programs to assist teachers and many universities have centers on learning and teaching.",

It has been shown that generating explanations to oneself, or self-explaining, can improve student understanding of information. This can be achieved via student-generated videos. The quantitative effects of student-generated videos on learning and assessment in postsecondary education are unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the effects asynchronous student-generated videos have on student learning and assessment in a large-enrollment (∼400 students), undergraduate physiology course. Students were charged with making self-generated videos discussing major physiological concepts and uploading these videos to Flip for assessment. Flip is an online, social education platform for asynchronous video-based discussion. In the present study, we combined four semesters (n = 1,100 students) of Flip data and analyzed the effects it had on student examination performance. Specifically, we first analyzed how students performed on exam questions corresponding to their Flip prompts in comparison to students not assigned those prompts [25/44 (57%) were statistically significantly different]. Second, we analyzed the association between Flip prompt score and performance on corresponding exam questions [39/44 (89%) were statistically significantly different]. Third, we analyzed the association between cumulative Flip score and performance on all corresponding, and noncorresponding exam questions. Finally, we analyzed the association between cumulative Flip score and averaged exam performance. There was a positive association (r = 0.54).

The purpose of this study was to compare personalized versus standardized emails following unit quizzes on student perceptions of faculty engagement, participation in academic resources, and academic performance in a junior-level, online physiology course. Students completed the online unit quiz and received a subsequent feedback email from the course director. Students were randomized into the Control (n = 101) or the Experimental (n = 104) group for general or personalized performance feedback emails, respectively. Students completed start and end of semester surveys capturing demographics, course expectations, self-reported use of resources, and impressions of the faculty. Final exam and course grades were collected. Perceptions of faculty were similar between groups, and receiving professor feedback after quizzes did not make the Experimental group more likely to use any of the available academic support services. There was no difference in final exam grades (Control: 73.9 ± 14.1%; Experimental: 73.4 ± 15.3%) or final course grades between groups (Control: 79.2 ± 13.1%; Experimental: 78.7 ± 13.3; P > 0.05).

    "abstract": "Given the recently proposed three-filament theory of muscle contraction, we present a low-cost physical sarcomere model aimed at illustrating the role of titin in the production of active force in skeletal muscle. Using inexpensive materials, it is possible to illustrate actin-myosin cross-bridge interactions between the thick and thin filaments and demonstrate the two different mechanisms by which titin is thought to contribute to active and passive muscle force. Specifically, the model illustrates how titin, a molecule with spring-like properties, may increase its stiffness by binding free calcium upon muscle activation and reducing its extensible length by attaching itself to actin, resulting in the greater force generating capacity after an active than a passive elongation that has been observed experimentally. The model is simple to build and manipulate, and demonstration to high school students was shown to result in positive perception and improved understanding of the otherwise complex titin related mechanisms of force production in skeletal and cardiac muscles.",

    "abstract": "A practical course for preclinical medical students was developed to illustrate aspects of binocular vision and mechanisms of primary visual transduction. It is based on a graphic analysis of two optical illusions, the Pulfrich and the Mach-Dvorak phenomena. A pendulum swinging in a plane perpendicular to the direction of observation appears to follow an elliptical path when viewed binocularly with a filter in front of one eye (Pulfrich illusion) or with alternating occlusion of the right and left eye above a critical frequency (Mach-Dvorak illusion). The Pulfrich phenomenon permits us to determine the relationship between perceived illusory depth and filter density. Analyzing the Mach-Dvorak phenomenon allows us to determine the dependence of illusory depth on interocular delay. Comparison of both determinations (depth against transmission and depth against time) permits us to establish, without complex calculations, the effect of luminescence on visual processing time. In addition, this course illustrates a general methodological concept mentioned by Popper: students make an unexpected observation, put forward a testable hypothesis, and try to falsify it.",

    "abstract": "Most physiological scientists have restricted understanding of probability as relative frequency in a large collection (for example, of atoms). Most appropriate for the relatively circumscribed problems of the physical sciences, this understanding of probability as a physical property has conveyed the widespread impression that the \"proper\" statistical \"method\" can eliminate uncertainty by determining the \"correct\" frequency or frequency distribution. However, many relatively recent developments in the theory of probability and decision making deny such exalted statistical ability. Proponents of Bayes's subjectivist theory, for example, assert that probability is \"degree of belief,\" a more tentative idea than relative frequency or physical probability, even though degree of belief assessment may utilize frequency information. In the subjectivist view, probability and statistics are means of expressing a consistent opinion (a probability) to handle uncertainty but never means to eliminate it. In the physiological sciences the contrast between the two views is critical, because problems dealt with are generally more complex than those of physics, requiring judgments and decisions. We illustrate this in testing the efficacy of penicillin by showing how the physical probability method of \"hypothesis testing\" may contribute to the erroneous idea that science consists of \"verified truths\" or \"conclusive evidence\" and how this impression is avoided in subjectivist probability analysis.",

To this end, we developed an educational tool that compares and contracts the cardiopulmonary responses to exercise in an individual with heart failure with an individual with normal cardiac function. This exercise provides a unique opportunity to analyze, integrate, and interpret the changes associated with heart failure because more is learned about how a system operates when it is forced to perform than when it is idle. In this laboratory, basic anatomical and physiological data about heart failure are provided. Subsequently, figures are presented that illustrate the response of specific cardiopulmonary variables during exercise (e.g., heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure), and the students are challenged to analyze and assimilate information from figures, answer questions, make calculations, and plot graphs. The answers to the questions are provided. The students reported that this tool was an interesting and thoughtful approach to learning cardiopulmonary physiology. We conclude that this method is pedagogically sound inasmuch as students are forced to draw conclusions with directed exercises and questions.",

Basic principles of transepithelial fluid transport are taught by applying an appropriate perfusion protocol to the respiratory epithelium to either depolarize or hyperpolarize the membrane potential of the luminal cell side, thereby increasing or decreasing the nasal potential difference.

Advan Physiol Educ 25: 53–61, 2001. Significant differences exist among textbook definitions for the terms preload and afterload, leading to confusion and frustration among students and faculty alike. Many faculty also chose to use in their teaching simple terms such as “end-diastolic volume” or “aortic pressure” as common-usage approximations of preload and afterload, respectively, but these are only partial representations of these important concepts. Straightforward definitions both of preload and afterload that are concise yet still comprehensive can be developed using the Law of LaPlace to describe the relationships among chamber pressure, chamber radius, and wall thickness. Within this context, the term “preload” can be defined as all of the factors that contribute to passive ventricular wall stress (or tension) at the end of diastole, and the term “afterload” can be defined as all of the factors that contribute to total myocardial wall stress (or tension) during systolic ejection. The inclusion of “wall stress” in both definitions helps the student appreciate both the complexities of cardiac pathophysiology and the rationale for therapeutic intervention.",

These awards were designed to parallel the Society’s Research Career Enhancement Awards and provide financial support for individuals to obtain special training, develop new skills, or create educational materials or programs. The Awards announcement says: The APS Teaching Career Enhancement Award is designed to enhance the career potential of regular APS members. The award provides up to $4,000 to allow an individual to develop innovative and potentially widely applicable programs for teaching and learning physiology. The award can be used to support short-term visits to other schools to consult with experts who can assist with the development project. It can also be used to support attendance at special courses devoted to methodologies appropriate for the educational development project. Unfortunately, the response of the membership to this award has been lukewarm. The program was launched in 1997 but did not even receive an application until 1999. Since 1999, only ten people have applied for the award and only seven awards have been granted (Table 1). As the program enters its fifth year, it will be reviewed for its effectiveness and impact, and there is some concern that the award is in danger of being discontinued for lack of interest.TABLE 1 APS Teaching Career Enhancement AwardYearApplicantsAwardsFemalesMalesFemalesMales19991010200012122001020220022201Why haven’t more people applied for a Teaching Career Enhancement Award? In Education Committee discussions, the question was raised whether people were not interested in this education-focused faculty development opportunity or whether they were simply unaware of the range of activities that could be supported by the program. In the interest of increasing applications for the award, here is a summary of award reports from the past five awardees.1999Whitney M. Reilly, Indiana University School of Medicine, Bloomington INDr. Reilly attended a two-week Molecular Biology Summer Workshop hosted at Smith College with the intent of applying the techniques and concepts she learned to her own physiology course. She found that an unexpected benefit of the experience was the opportunity to observe how the organizers managed to keep a diverse group of adult students occupied, entertained, and enthusiastic from 8 AM until 10 PM each day, and she hopes to be able to apply this pedagogical component to her teaching as well.2000Sherell Byrd, Fort Lewis College, Durango CODr. Byrd’s project was to design some Web-based interactive laboratory tutorials. As part of the project, she visited the University of Texas at Austin for a week and attended a variety of student-centered lectures and inquiry-based laboratories. The opportunity to observe faculty using a variety of active learning techniques prompted Dr. Byrd to reflect on her own teaching.John D. Griffin, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg VADr. Griffin’s project was to develop a neurophysiology course with educational technology integrated in the curriculum design. He attended the Syllabus 2001 Summer Conference on educational technology and applied what he learned there to the design of his course website and CD-ROM tutorials. He also presented a seminar on his innovations for other faculty at William and Mary.Swen Kurbel, Osijek Medical Faculty, Osijek, CroatiaDr. Kurbel used his award to travel to the University of Kentucky, where he observed physiology teaching in the medical school. From his experience, he created a comparison of medical physiology teaching in Croatia and the United States. Upon his return home, he presented his findings at a roundtable on teaching at the Second Croatian Congress of Physiology.2001Daniel E. Lemons, City College of New York, New York, NYDr. Lemons’ project, which is still in progress, is to develop a teaching module in cardiovascular physiological genomics. As part of his career development in this field, he attended the APS Physiological Genomics of Cardiovascular Disease Conference in San Francisco in February 2002 and the Experimental Biology ’02 meeting.As you can see from these descriptions, the awards that were funded cover a variety of projects.If you are interested in applying for a Teaching Career Enhancement Award, the application form is available online at http://www.the-aps.org/awards/awd_tcapp.htm or through the Awards link on the APS home page. An application should include the following elements:1) Description of the proposed project (not to exceed two pages) 2) Justification for Requested Funds (not to exceed $4000) 3) Letter of support from the applicant’s department chair or other appropriate individual 4) Letters of agreement from appropriate individual or department hosts of schools to be visited 5) Description or outline of courses to be attended 6) Curriculum vitae focused on activities and achievements related to educationThe next deadline is April 15, 2003, and there is a second round of applications due October 15.

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to conduct a short-term international course on translational physiology for medical students from Wright State University and the University of Iowa. The goals were to 1) provide students with an exposure to the academic, cultural, and medical environments in Brazil; 2) promote awareness of the global medical community; and 3) provide an academic course focused on translational physiology. An evaluation of the students was conducted to determine whether such a short-term course might be useful in the medical curriculum. The 2-wk course was held in the summer of 2005 at the University of São Paulo School of Medicine in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, for 23 American students. The program included presentations of basic and clinical topics, meetings with medical students, and clinical presentations. The program finished with student attendance at a scientific meeting sponsored by the Brazilian Society of Hypertension. Student surveys evaluated issues related to perceived treatment, Brazilian medical school environment, culture and personal attributes, and career aspirations. The international Medical Sciences Translational Physiology course for medical students provided a brief, but intense, experience. It gave students a picture of the medical environment in Brazil and an appreciation for the differences and similarities in cultures. Most students reported that it was a positive experience that would be beneficial to their careers. In conclusion, a short-term international course provides an efficient means for medical students to experience aspects of global medical science.",

    "abstract": "Most undergraduates lack the scientific background to read and appreciate much of the primary literature in physiology. Even when the underlying concepts are elegantly simple, the inherent complexity of contemporary papers often makes the work inaccessible to them. However, with a little help, they can be guided to an understanding of the creative thought processes that underlie the research and to appreciate its significance. This is especially true of many classic papers in physiology that often rely on easily comprehensible techniques. Moreover, the American Physiological Society (APS) has invited prominent scientists to select important papers in their fields and to write essays that both put the work into historical context and explain why it is scientifically important. The APS Legacy Project makes these classic papers freely available online. One such paper by Gottschalk and Mylle presents data from a series of micropuncture studies that confirm all of the predictions of the countercurrent exchange model of concentrated urine production (2). The included handout of questions for discovery learning and teaching points suggest ways to use the paper as an instructional resource.",

Students will leave this activity being able to 1) critically assess behavioral, electromyographic, and single unit (extracellular) neurophysiological data typically acquired by behavioral neurophysiologists; 2) provide physiological evidence that the primate precentral gyrus (primary motor cortex) controls voluntary movements of the wrist; 3) intelligently discuss hypotheses concerning the role of the primary motor cortex in the generation of movement in mammalian species; and 4) discuss the ethical implications of using mammalian species as model organisms.

The topics covered include pulmonary function tests, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and localized airway obstruction, restrictive lung diseases, pulmonary vascular diseases, environmental or industrial lung diseases (with a short section on neoplastic and infectious diseases), and respiratory failure. Although it could be argued that PhD physiologists do not have a responsibility for teaching pathophysiology, collaborative teaching has become increasingly common in medical schools where, for example, a pulmonary block includes both normal respiratory physiology and some pulmonary pathophysiology.

The purpose is to demonstrate the role of the kidneys in the homeostatic control of extracellular fluid volume, plasma ionic concentrations, and osmolarity. Three treatment groups are utilized: a volume-expanded (access to 1 g/100 ml sucrose) group, a volume-expanded and salt-loaded (access to 0.9 g/100 ml NaCl) group, and a volume-depleted (water-deprived) group. A normovolemic control group (access to tap water) is also included. Rats are housed individually in metabolic cages that allow accurate measurement of fluid intake and urine output. Blood samples are removed via cardiac puncture. The animals recover from this procedure and can be reutilized within 2-3 wk. When class data are pooled, clear trends are seen that demonstrate the volume-, osmo-, and ionoregulatory abilities of the kidneys.",

By use of K+ macroelectrodes and a computer simulation program, students are introduced to the membrane concept on the basis of ion gradients, diffusion potentials, and membrane conductances. Subsequently, some basic principles are demonstrated in living cells by measuring the cell membrane potential of a X. laevis oocyte. The dependence of the cell membrane potential on ion gradients is shown by stepwise elevation of the extracellular K+ concentration. The clinical relevance of disturbances of the K+ homeostasis is discussed in this context. The effect of changing the membrane conductance for particular ions on the cell membrane potential is demonstrated by applying a K+ channel blocker. The experiments are discussed in the context of the action of pharmaceuticals and toxins. This student course on membrane physiology has now been held for 2 yr for medical and dental students, and their response to the oocyte demonstration, as evaluated by a student questionnaire, was mainly positive.",

    "abstract": "Although most educators have their greatest impact in the classroom, the increased need for diverse learning activities has created new opportunities for leadership. Moreover, many Tenure and Promotion Committees are finding that it is no longer sufficient to consider only lecture hours when evaluating a faculty member’s contributions to the teaching mission of an institution. Accordingly, the career path for an educator in a college or professional school is evolving. A newly recruited faculty member may start out with traditional classroom responsibilities, but activities other than lecture, such as flipped classrooms, online resources, and peer-to-peer teaching, may be quickly added to the mix. As faculty members gain experience, they often progress to positions of curriculum design or program review within an institution. Similarly, there is a need for administrators who have participated in a variety of learning activities, and schools frequently recruit for these positions from faculty with such exposure. Many senior faculty members leverage this expertise to regional or national levels by authoring textbooks and online materials or serving on advisory boards, review committees, and governance in professional societies and funding agencies. Excelling in these leadership opportunities can have a profound effect on the success of promotion and tenure applications, and they reward a skill set that extends beyond the teaching and organization needed in the classroom.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the Occupational Therapy Department requested a custom-designed medical physiology course for the students in the new occupational therapy doctoral program. The first author, a physiologist with extensive experience in teaching both undergraduate preprofessional and medical students in human physiology, was recruited to design and implement the course. The course was designed to be consistent with the constructivist philosophy that guides the occupational therapy curriculum. The course was offered for the first time during fall/spring 2015/2016 and included both first- and second-year occupational therapy doctoral students. A number of anonymous assessment tools were used to evaluate students' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of various pedagogies used in the course in enhancing their learning. A summative course assessment survey with comments was used at the end of the course. This paper describes the model of course design and the student feedback, which generated some suggestions for improvement of the course. This approach in designing a new course for a new disciplinary group of students should be helpful to other faculty involved in developing courses for health career programs populated by students with variable physiology backgrounds and different educational needs. The final relevant feedback from the course would be to have the students evaluate the usefulness of the course to their future careers immediately following their certification examinations in a year or two and during their subsequent clinical experiences; however, that information will likely be more difficult to obtain.",

    "abstract": "We describe here a collective and experimental research project-based learning (ERPBL) for master’s students that can be used to illustrate some basic concepts on glucose/lipid homeostasis and renal function around a topical issue. The primary objective of this ERPBL was to strengthen students’ knowledge and understanding of physiology and pathophysiology. The secondary objectives were to help students to develop technical/practical abilities and acquire transversal skills with real-world connections. Obesity is a worldwide public health problem that increases the risk for developing type 2 diabetes and nephropathies. To study the impact of western dietary habits, students evaluated the effects of a diet enriched with fat and cola [high-fat and cola diet (HFCD)] on metabolism and renal function in mice. Students mainly worked in tandem to prepare and perform experiments, but also collectively to compile, analyze, and discuss data. Students showed that HFCD-fed mice 1) developed obesity; 2) exhibited glucose homeostasis impairments associated to ectopic fat storage; and 3) displayed reduced glomerular filtration. The educational benefit of the program was estimated using three evaluation metrics: a conventional multicriteria assessment by teachers, a pre-/posttest, and a self-evaluation questionnaire. They showed that the current approach successfully strengthened scientific student knowledge and understanding of physiology/pathophysiology. In addition, it helped students develop new skills, such as technical and transversal skills. We concluded that this ERPBL dealing with the pathophysiology of obesity was strongly beneficial for master’s students, thereby appearing as an efficient and performing educational tool.",

Three different methods of teaching were used: 1) a straight lecture method, 2) an active method with no previous preparation of students, 3) an active method with previous preparation. Each method was evaluated by end-of-term marks, student feedback in that year, and a follow-up the next year by questionnaires distributed to both students and nursing teachers. The results of end-of-term examinations and Student Acceptance Indexes, as well as comments of nursing teachers, show that the active method of teaching is better than straight lecture and that the active method is most effective when students are familiarized with it beforehand.",

    "abstract": "A teaching-oriented multimedia database authoring system, MILES ( Multimediales Informations- und Lehrsystem), has been in development since 1980 in our department. The hardware consists of a network of personal computers connected to digital and, until recently, audio/video storage devices. The system provides a database capable of handling all kinds of multimedia data and computer programs. User-friendly software provides input, editing, retrieval, and communication; the authoring system allows these components to be organized into structures of complex menus, combined with free database access. More than 12,000 components have been stored, including approximately 3,500 pictures. The paper reports on an extensive field test, in which the system has been applied as a common source for all kinds of materials used in teaching physiology to students of medicine. ResuIts show that the \"new media\" are powerful instruments for improving teaching and learning. However, they should not be expected to provide the sole basis for education. Their application still faces many problems regarding concepts, efficiency, and acceptance by students and staff.",

Many of our students find these ideas difficult to understand. Often they try to memorize facts rather than understand mechanisms. The most difficult task may be interpretation of the pacemaker potential generation in sinoatrial (SA) cells. This illumination attempts to improve students’ understanding of membrane potentials by giving them a simplified interpretation of pacemaker potential generation before they have group discussions.This simplified model interprets the pacemaker potential as a hyperpolarization wave that is not able to reach the hypothetical resting membrane potential (calculated to be about −14 mV), because the triggering potential of calcium/sodium channels (−40 mV) initiates the next cycle. The continuous cycle of electrical activity in SA cells would then consist of four stages: depolarization (opening of calcium/sodium channels), repolarization with hyperpolarization (opening of several types of potassium channels), hyperpolarization recovery (cessation of potassium permeability), and triggering of depolarization without ever reaching the resting membrane potential. Although this is an oversimplified interpretation of SA potential generation, students who can understand and discuss it are better able to interpret resting and action membrane potentials.The following text is given to medical students as reading material for discussion that is usually scheduled for the following week. The students can use their textbooks (1, 3) or other references (2, 4). In Simplified characteristics of SA cells below, students are asked to calculate the hypothetical resting potential for the SA cells based on a Na/K permeability ratio of 0.58:1.00 and the following ion concentrations: extracellular Na+ = 142 meq/l and K+ = 4; intracellular Na+ = 14 meq/l and K+ = 142 meq/l (4).Answer where EMF is electromotive force.They are also expected to draw a graph similar to Fig. 1.FIG. 1Hypothetical resting potential for sinoatrial (SA) cells. Area of hyperpolarization is marked. A continuous cycle of electric activity in SA cells consists of depolarization (opening of calcium/sodium channels), repolarization with hyperpolarization (opening of several types of potassium channels), hyperpolarization recovery (cessation of potassium permeability), and triggering of depolarization without ever reaching the resting membrane potentials.Download figureDownload PowerPointText for Study by Students.A simplified interpretation of the SA potential generation. Please refer to your textbooks and other sources.Simple facts about membrane potentials.1) More permeable membranes have better defined membrane potentials that are less variable than potentials of less permeable membranes. The high permeability seems to anchor the membrane potential near the Nernst potential of that ion. The cost of stabilization is the high ion flux that must be compensated by more work of ion pumps.2) Hyperpolarization can be described as a more pronounced negativity of the membrane potential after repolarization. The occurrence, quantity, and duration of the hyperpolarization wave necessarily reflects momentary membrane permeability for certain ions. Hyperpolarization is caused by the temporary relative increase in potassium permeability compared with the resting phase. If this increase in potassium permeability is small, the hyperpolarization wave will also be small. For example, if a certain membrane is almost exclusively permeable to K+ ions, it will have a membrane potential near the potassium Nernst potential. During repolarization, this membrane will not hyperpolarize, because additional opening of the potassium channels cannot move the potential any closer to the Nernst potential.Simplified characteristics of SA cells.In SA cells, permeability for Na+ and K+ is similar, so the membrane potentials are between the Nernst potentials for potassium and for sodium. Because the overall permeability is small, the membrane potential is also less stable. Calculate the resting potential if the Na/K permeability ratio is 0.58:1.00 and extracellular Na+ = 142 meq/l, K+ = 4; intracellular Na+ = 14 meq/l and K+ = 142 meq/l (4).Proposed hyperpolarization-based interpretation of SA potentials.1) During repolarization from the peak depolarization, slow K+ channels that are gradually activated during depolarization make the membrane much more permeable to potassium. So the membrane potential progressively becomes more negative, moving toward the potassium Nernst potential. This hyperpolarization wave is shaped by the opening and closing of different sets of K+ channels.2) When all the K+ channels that were opened during depolarization are closed, the membrane potential will reach the resting potential that reflects the Na/K permeability ratio. In SA cells, the resting membrane potential is never reached, because it lies above the triggering potential of calcium/sodium channels.3) A continuous cycle of electrical activity in SA cells consists of the following four stages: depolarization (opening of calcium/sodium channels), repolarization with hyperpolarization (opening of several types of potassium channels), hyperpolarization recovery (cessation of potassium permeability increase), and triggering of depolarization without ever reaching the resting membrane potentials.Activities for Students1) Use figures of SA potentials from your textbook and mark the calculated level of the hypothetical resting membrane potential of SA-nodal cells.2) Does this make sense to you?3) Draw a graph of two SA action potentials. Label the vertical axis in mV (+ and −) and the horizontal axis in seconds.4) List pros and cons for the proposed model.5) Discuss the model with your classmates.I thank Drs. D. C. Randall and D. F.

Here, we report our experience in teaching medical students with a simple, practical protocol that transforms the physiology of glutamate receptors into neuronal staining, observable under bright-field microscopy. Essentially, the students were challenged to selectively stain a subpopulation of cultured neurons expressing Ca 2+ -permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors (a subgroup of ionotropic glutamate receptors). Neurons expressing this type of receptors were loaded with Co 2+ (in substitution for Ca 2+ ) after nondesensitizing activation of AMPA receptors. After precipitation, the Co 2+ was revealed after treatment with silver. At the end of the procedure, the neurons expressing Ca 2+ -permeable AMPA receptors were visually identified under bright-field microscopy. The procedure allowed the visualization of the complete dendritic network of the stained neurons and allowed the students to learn very efficiently about the physiology of glutamate receptors.",

Orphaned of his mother, he spent his early years in the city of Orvieto; when he was 12, his father brought him back to Rome and enrolled him to study medicine at the Sapienza University in Rome. His dedication to study and work soon led him to increasingly important positions. Within a few years, the fame of Lancisi became such that he was appointed the personal physician of three popes. In De Subitaneis Mortibus (1707), he described the pathophysiology of heart diseases, identifying the cause of sudden deaths in structural anomalies of the heart, lungs, and brain. He also wrote about cerebral localizations and first discussed the physiological mechanisms of urine formation and excretion. In 1717, Lancisi described the pathogenesis of malaria and the close correlation between its onset and the swampy waters of the Tiber River, proposing the draining of marshes to eradicate malaria. In the posthumous De Motu Cordis et Aneurysmatibus (1728) he described for the first time heart dilatation and aneurysms of the great vessels, providing a fundamental contribution to the history of cardiovascular physiology. Proof of his interest in medical education is the establishment of an academy and the donation of a library to the hospital, bridging the gap between theory and practice in medical training. Over the centuries, Lancisi’s memory has faded, but his work is still relevant for anyone practicing the medical profession.",

Students were provided with online self-study modules as preparation for a mandatory small group case-based learning activity. A detailed case of an elderly female patient being assessed for fall risk was provided. Students were required to document a “Review of Systems” predicting decreased system functions due to senescence and to prepare a group concept map illustrating how physiologic deficits contributed to fall risk in the patient. Students successfully completed the activity and reported generally good satisfaction with the experience. The activity was judged an effective tool for students to consolidate prior learning and to apply physiology to an important medical topic. The lesson also provided several opportunities for curriculum integration with cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and clinical skills components.",

In one analysis, the study compared terminal degree and career choices between a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) and traditional non-course-based undergraduate research experiences at one primarily undergraduate institution (PUI). Students who pursued postbaccalaureate programs chose terminal degrees at levels exceeding 75%, with no significant difference between a CURE experience and a traditional research experience. Analysis of terminal degree and career choices at four PUIs providing traditional research experiences showed a marked difference in the number of students pursuing terminal degrees. Two PUIs showed rates &gt; 75%, whereas students at the other two PUIs pursued terminal degrees &lt;50% of the time. The majority of students not pursuing terminal degrees chose M.S. degrees in education and healthcare. An analysis was also performed among students participating in traditional summer undergraduate research on a research-intensive university (RIU) campus with a medical school. Students were accepted from two programs, an NIH IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) program recruiting students from the RIU and an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program recruiting undergraduates from rural PUIs and minority-serving institutions, particularly tribal colleges. Analysis showed that &gt;70% of the students who pursued postbaccalaureate programs chose terminal degrees. INBRE undergraduates displayed a marked preference for the M.D. degree (73.9% vs. 17.4%), whereas the REU students chose the Ph.D. degree (75.0% vs. 22.9%). American Indian students were also analyzed separately for career choice and showed an equal preference for the M.D. and Ph.D. degrees when pursuing postbaccalaureate education. Overall, the results provide evidence that undergraduate student research stimulates student careers in areas needed by the nation’s citizen stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Students’ course performance is fundamental for any institution to carry out its academic mission. Often, in-class disengagement and lack of after-class course support in large-enrollment classes trigger academic problems for students. This leads to poor exam performance and an increased rate of final letter grade of a D or F or student withdrawal (DFW), an indicator of students’ poor academic success. Changing teaching strategies by using interventions that incorporate student-student interaction and student-faculty interaction may offer the opportunity to improve course performance. In this retrospective study, we examined the effect of changing teaching strategies on student course performance of 5,553 students enrolled in an undergraduate health sciences course over a span of 20 semesters. Three different interventions namely 1) daily low-stake in-class quizzes, 2) team-based learning, and 3) after-class review sessions were incorporated as teaching strategies. To assess the combined effect of these strategies’ students’ performance in the intervention period (12 semesters) was compared with control period (8 semesters). Student performance in the course was measured by exam grades; overall score; percentage of students receiving letter grades and A, B, C; and DFW rates. The data indicated that in the intervention period, exam scores increased by 6.6%, overall course score increased by 6.2%, percentage of students receiving letter grade A/B increased by 21.3%, percentage of students receiving letter grade C decreased by 6.9%, and the DFW rates decreased by 14.5%. Overall, changing teaching strategies through incorporation of these interventions improved students’ performance in the course.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the gross organization of skeletal muscle is critical to understanding the mechanism of action of muscle physiology. Due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), many colleges have had to discontinue or curtail teaching and laboratory activities. Whether students are in the classroom or learning online, it is important for them to understand the basics of skeletal muscle organization that allows for movement. Manipulatives have been shown to enhance student learning and understanding in many fields, including physiology. This gives instructors an easy-to-follow tool for making a manipulative that allows students to see the organization of the skeletal muscle. Students can make this manipulative themselves from supplies commonly found in the home or office.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative teaching strategies such as peer instruction and conventional group work have previously been shown to enhance meaningful learning, but they have not previously been compared. In this present study, we compared the impact of solving quizzes with peer instruction and conventional group work on immediate learning in a laboratory exercise. A total of 186 second-year medical students were randomized to solve two quizzes by either a peer instruction strategy (n = 93) or conventional group work (n = 93) during a mandatory laboratory exercise on respiratory physiology, after which all students completed an individual test. There was no difference in total test scores between groups, but students randomized to peer instruction obtained the highest test scores in solving simple integrated questions. Conversely, students randomized to conventional group work provided the best evaluations of the overall assessment of the laboratory exercise. In conclusion, different collaborative teaching strategies implemented during a laboratory exercise appear to affect immediate learning and student satisfaction differently.",

    "abstract": "Practical demonstration of cardiomyocyte function requires substantial preparation, a source of freshly isolated animal hearts, and specialized equipment. Even where such resources are available, it is not conducive for demonstration to any more than a few students at a time. These approaches are also not consistent with the 3R principle (replacement, reduction, and refinement) of ethical use of animals. We present an implementation of the LabHEART software, developed by Donald Bers and Jose Puglisi, for medical students. Prior to the activity, students had lectures covering the physiological and pharmacological aspects of cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. We used this problem-based activity to help students consolidate their knowledge and to allow a hands-on approach to explore the key features of EC coupling. Students simulate and measure action potentials, intracellular calcium changes, and cardiomyocyte contraction. They also apply drugs that target ion channels (e.g., nifedipine or tetrodotoxin) or sympathetic input (using isoproterenol) and explore changes to EC coupling. Furthermore, by modifying the biophysical parameters of key ion channels involved in the electrical activity of the heart, students also explore the effect of channelopathies such as long QT syndromes. We describe approaches to implement this activity in a flipped classroom format, with recorded lecture materials provided ahead of the practical to facilitate active learning. We also describe our experiences implementing this activity online. The content and difficulty of the activity can be altered to suit individual courses and is also amenable to promote peer-driven learning.",

    "abstract": "Patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity require a large amount of space and equipment. The technique is difficult to master and not conducive to demonstration to more than a few medical students. Therefore, neurophysiological education is mostly limited to classroom-based pedagogies such as lectures. However, the demonstration of concepts such as changes in membrane potential and ion channel activity is best achieved with hands-on approaches. This article details an in silico activity suitable for large groups of medical students that demonstrates the key concepts in neurophysiology using the LabAXON simulation software. Learning activities in our practical include 1) measurements of voltage and time parameters of the neuronal action potential and its relationship to the Nernst potentials of Na + and K + ; 2) determination of the stimulus threshold to evoke action potentials; 3) demonstration of the refractory period of an action potential; and 4) voltage-clamp experiments to determine the current-voltage relationship of voltage-gated Na + and K + channels and the voltage dependence of, and recovery from, inactivation of voltage-gated Na + channels. We emphasized the accuracy of quantitative measurements as well as the correct use of units. The level of difficulty of the activity can be altered through different multiple choice questions relating to material introduced in the associated lectures. This practical activity is suitable for different class sizes and is adaptable for delivery with online platforms. Student feedback showed that the students felt the activity helped them consolidate their understanding of the lecture material.",

    "abstract": "In endothermic mammals total energy expenditure (EE) is composed of basal metabolic rate (BMR), energy spent for muscle activity, thermoregulation, any kind of production (such as milk, meat, or egg production), and the thermic effect of feeding. The BMR is predominantly determined by body mass and the surface-to-volume ratio of the body. The EE can be quantified by either direct or indirect calorimetry. Direct calorimetry measures the rate of heat loss from the body, whereas indirect calorimetry measures oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production and calculates heat production from oxidative nutrient combustion. A deep and sustainable understanding of EE in animals is crucial for veterinarians to properly calculate and evaluate feed rations during special circumstances such as anesthesia or in situations with increased energy demands as commonly seen in high-yielding livestock. The practical class described in this article provides an experimental approach to understanding how EE can be measured and calculated by indirect calorimetry. Two important factors that affect the EE of animals (the thermic effect of feeding and the effect of ambient temperature) are measured. A profound knowledge about the energy requirements of animal life and its measurement is also relevant for education in general biology, animal and human physiology, and nutrition. Therefore, this teaching unit can equally well be implemented in other areas of life sciences.",

The current dearth of quality applicants from this country to medical and graduate schools suggests that our existing undergraduate and high school science curriculum is failing to provide the necessary stimulus for gifted students to seek careers in the health sciences. Recognizing the need to become more directly helpful to high school and college science teachers, members of the faculty of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine held a 5.5-day Physiology Summer Workshop during June, 1989. Participants included 25 college teachers from Kentucky and 5 other states plus 22 Kentucky high school teachers. The presence of the two levels of educators provided communication about curricular concerns that would be best addressed by mutual action and/or interaction. Each day's activities included morning lectures on selected aspects of organ system and cellular physiology, a series on integrative physiology, and afternoon laboratory sessions. The laboratory setting allowed the instructor to expand on principles covered in lecture as well as provided the opportunity for in-depth discussion. A selection of evening sessions was presented on 1) grants available for research projects, 2) obtaining funds for laboratory equipment, and 3) graduate education in physiology.",

It is based on the view that the following four \"function curves\" cooperate in long-term regulation: the relation between blood volume and ventricular filling pressure, the relation between ventricular filling pressure and cardiac output, the relation between cardiac output and peripheral resistance, and the relation between arterial pressure and natriuresis. Positioning the function curves in the format presented here clarifies their cooperativity. The distinction between a nonsteady state and a steady state deserves emphasis. Long-term pathophysiology of the circulation is most easily taught on the basis of the assumption that, generally, there will be a steady state. The format clarifies why some known physiological relations are almost impossible to demonstrate in the intact organism, and it discourages explanations of pathophysiology that are not firmly based on physiology.",

A pre-lab, interactive tutorial develops the rationale for this experiment by reviewing the renal and cardiovascular mechanisms involved in the response to extracellular fluid volume expansion. After a hypothesis is stated, an experiment is designed to determine the relative importance of dilution of plasma proteins to the overall renal excretory response following volume expansion with intravenous saline. In the lab, students collect data from two groups of anesthetized rats. The protocol involves continuous monitoring of arterial pressure and periodic collection of urine and blood samples after volume expansion with either isotonic NaCl or isotonic NaCl plus 5% albumin. A post-lab tutorial is used to analyze, interpret, and discuss the data. Students next prepare an oral presentation, practice it, and finally present their results and answer questions before peers and instructors. This overall experience involves all of the components of doing a \"real\" experiment, starting with a question that is not answered in general textbooks of physiology and finishing with an oral presentation of the results. Along the way, students gain a better understanding of a complex homeostatic response and learn the care and value of using animals in research and teaching.",

Adjacent rectangles representing \"ventilation\" and \"perfusion\" are slid past one another so that portions of the ventilation and perfusion rectangles are not touching, illustrating the concepts of dead-space ventilation (VD) and shunt flow (QS). The portion of the ventilation bar representing VD is further subdivided into anatomical and alveolar VD and used to show the effects of alveolar dead space on the PO2 (PAO2) and PCO2 of alveolar air (PACO2); movement away from the \"ideal\" point). Similarly, the portion of the perfusion bar representing QS is used to define anatomical and physiological shunts and the effect of shunts on the PO2 (PaO2) and PCO2 of arterial blood (PaCO2). The genesis of the PAO2-PaO2 (A-a) PO2 difference as well as the effects of VA/Q mismatching and diffusion abnormalities can all be discussed with this visual aid.

Therefore, this course was organized in Sri Lanka for the first time in collaboration with the Comparative Biology Centre of Newcastle University, UK.

Rather than specifying a strict sequence of drug additions that aim to provide ideal demonstrations of pharmacological and physiological antagonism, I have instead designed switches into the drugs provided and set students, working in small teams, the task of identifying the switched drugs, an inquiry activity. To extend the teamwork aspect, laboratory reports were submitted by the student teams rather than individual students. Staff observed that discussions within the teams were stimulated by the inquiry-led nature of the practical. The quality of the laboratory reports submitted by teams were substantially improved over the individual reports submitted in previous years. (Students previously worked in teams, but simply followed a list of prescribed experiments and wrote individual reports.) Although, in conversation, teams of students had an improved understanding of the regulation of gut motility by the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system and could readily distinguish between pharmacological and functional antagonism, no attempt was made to evaluate learning because the revision was triggered by the observed effect of a technical error and was not otherwise planned. It is likely that laboratory practicals, in general, would benefit from inclusion of inquiry.",

The results allow them to examine the different patterns of autonomic response they elicit (approximated by heart rate and blood pressure responses), and knowledge of these responses can then be used to infer the governing autonomic aspect of the increases in circulating immune cells from the results. This activity can be either adapted from teacher-led methods to inquiry, asking students to design the details of the acute stress tasks, or developed by asking students to design a follow-up experiment that could be used to provide direct evidence for their conclusions.

    "abstract": "We describe a simple, cost-effective experiment to demonstrate cardiovascular integration of heart rate and blood pressure to accommodate the environmental and dietary factors of gravity and caffeine. Specific learning objectives associated with this include understanding the effects of posture on blood pressure and heart rate, coupled with the role of caffeine in modifying this response. Inclusion of ECG measurements, coupled with heart rate variability analysis, added a demonstration of the contribution made by the autonomic nervous system under these conditions. We clearly demonstrate that the cardiac work, estimated as rate-pressure product, necessary to undertake the transition from supine to standing, is fixed for a given group of subjects. However, the individual contribution of heart rate and systolic pressure to the cardiac workload is subject to the external factors of gravity and caffeine. Such an activity also demonstrates additional benefits, including unstructured teaching opportunities to augment classroom learning associated with integrative physiology and also the discussion of ethical issues with regard to human experimentation.",

    "abstract": "Undergraduate biomedical students often have difficulties in understanding basic concepts of respiratory physiology, particularly respiratory mechanics. In this study, we report the use of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to improve and consolidate the knowledge about physiological aspects of normal regional distribution of ventilation in humans. Initially, we assessed the previous knowledge of a group of medical students ( n = 39) about regional differences in lung ventilation. Thereafter, we recorded the regional distribution of ventilation through surface electrodes on a healthy volunteer adopting four different decubitus positions: supine, prone, and right and left lateral. The recordings clearly showed greater pulmonary ventilation in the dependent lung, mainly in the lateral decubitus. Considering the differences in pulmonary ventilation between right and left lateral decubitus, only 33% of students were able to notice it correctly beforehand. This percentage increased to 84 and 100%, respectively ( P < 0.01), after the results of the ventilation measurements obtained with EIT were examined and discussed. A self-assessment questionnaire showed that students considered the practical activity as an important tool to assist in the understanding of the basic concepts of respiratory mechanics. Experimental demonstration of the physiological variations of regional lung ventilation in volunteers by using EIT is feasible, effective, and stimulating for undergraduate medical students. Therefore, this practical activity may help faculty and students to overcome the challenges in the field of respiratory physiology learning.",

A discussion question is provided before the laboratory exercise in which each student is asked to search the literature and provide written answers to questions and to formulate an experiment to test the role of estrogen in imprinting the mating behavior of male and female rats. Students discuss their answers to the questions in laboratory with the instructor and design an experiment to test their hypothesis. In male rats, testosterone is converted by aromatase expressed by neurons in the brain to estrogen. Production of estrogen in the brain of neonatal rats imprints mating behavior in males, where a lack of estrogen action in the brain imprints female sexual behavior. The model involves administering exogenous testosterone to imprint male behavior in female pups or administration of an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) or an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) to imprint female sexual behavior in male pups. In the model, litters of neonatal pups are treated with either carrier (control), testosterone propionate, aromatase inhibitor (letrozole), or an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) postnatally on days 1 and 3. Alteration of mating behavior is evaluated through the numbers of males and females that breed and establish pregnancy. This is a very simple protocol that provides an excellent experiment for student discussion on the effects of hormone action on imprinting brain sexual behavior.",

This study at Alfaisal University aimed to explore the motivations, benefits, and challenges faced by medical students in extracurricular research activities. Using a mixed-method approach, we combined quantitative surveys with qualitative group interviews. Findings revealed that both extrinsic (e.g., enhancing postgraduate training prospects) and intrinsic (e.g., personal interest and skill refinement) factors significantly motivate students to be involved in research activities. Participants unanimously acknowledged skill enhancement, particularly in literature comprehension, creative ideation, and networking. However, challenges such as conflicts with course scheduling, lack of hands-on experiences, and mentorship issues were identified as potential barriers to research participation. Addressing these barriers and understanding motivations can inform the design of research programs, enhancing the overall student research experience. This study underscores the importance of research in medical education, emphasizing the need for institutions to prioritize addressing challenges and leveraging benefits to prepare medical students for a research-integrated clinical future.",

The ability to host synchronous lectures on platforms like Zoom gave students continued access to classroom material in the face of an ongoing pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in exam scores between students attending a physiology class (PHSL3051) synchronously via Zoom or asynchronously by viewing recorded lectures posted after class. Students in PHSL3051 were evaluated with four unit exams and one cumulative final exam. Although pooled analysis of all students showed that synchronous lecture viewing positively predicted exam scores, this positive association was even larger when the data were analyzed by gender and ethnicity. For female-identified students and students of color (SOC), attending lectures synchronously was associated with average scores on every unit exam that were higher by 2.7-7.4 percentage points. Moreover, the greater a student's synchronous participation in the course throughout the semester, the better that student's performance on the cumulative final exam was likely to be. These data highlight the need to better understand how different groups of undergraduate students select and respond to different assessment methods used in the same course, which may have long-term effects on their overall performance at 4-year institutions.",

To alleviate and address these concerns, identifying, engaging, and training a diverse environmental health research workforce will be critical and necessary steps to combat and prevent the consequences of environmental injustice. While there is an obvious need to enhance diversity in environmental health research, this process is hampered by facets of systemic racism that reduce access to educational resources needed to build interest and knowledge in students and teachers. We present here a historical perspective to offer a guide for building programs and relationships with underserved schools to help overcome limiting factors that have plagued certain public school systems. With the proper training and mentorship, the untapped workforce present within these schools will be empowered to understand and address current and emerging environmental health and safety threats. Through this transformative 8-week high school research program, we will develop well-prepared, ethical researchers committed to scientific inquiry, intensive fieldwork, and collaborative problem solving to address environmental health challenges. Following the four-step risk assessment process, students, teachers, and faculty mentors will work collaboratively to identify toxicants, potential hazards and risks, and environmental disparities in urban neighborhoods, which provides the necessary training to formulate critical thinking skills for use in academic or nonacademic careers.",

Many undergraduates in prenursing or biology programs have little exposure to the physiology and pathophysiology of obesity, including learning about leptin and other hormones involved in appetite control. I developed materials for teaching about the pathophysiology of obesity in two different pathophysiology courses: one designed as a survey of pathophysiology topics for prenursing majors, and the other designed as an in-depth exploration of the molecular and cellular basis of selected diseases for upper-division biology majors. In the molecular basis of disease course, obesity is covered as part of a unit organized around metabolic syndrome. The discussion includes molecular and cellular mechanisms that link obesity to several other diseases, including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. This article briefly describes the approaches I have taken for teaching obesity to two different undergraduate student populations and lists several resources that may be useful tools for teaching about obesity.",

Traditionally, measuring the skeletal muscle oxygen cost associated with exercise/muscle contractions can be rather expensive or invasive (i.e., muscle biopsies). More recently, specific protocols designed around the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) have been shown to provide a quick, noninvasive easy-to-use tool to measure skeletal muscle oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]). However, the data and results from NIRS devices are often misunderstood. Thus the primary purpose of this sourcebook update is to provide several experimental protocols students can utilize to improve their understanding of NIRS technology, learn how to analyze results from NIRS devices, and better understand how muscle contraction intensity and type (isometric, concentric, or eccentric) influence the oxygen cost of muscle contractions.",

Quantitative information regarding the impact of emergency remote teaching (ERT) during COVID-19 on SFI is limited. This retrospective, observational cohort study tests the hypothesis that COVID-19 ERT negatively affected SFI in a gender-dependent manner. Electronic records of office hour (OH) appointments, used to measure SFI, for first-year medical students across three time periods, before, during and after COVID, were obtained and analyzed. A concerning, marked decline in SFI during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is noted. Before COVID, significantly more women (75.20%) made at least one OH appointment compared with men (40.54%). During COVID, the proportion of women making an OH appointment (69.71%) was statistically indistinguishable from women before COVID-19. In contrast, significantly fewer men during COVID (10.34%) than before COVID made an OH appointment. On return to face-to-face teaching, no rebound effect was observed. Compared with before COVID gender-matched peers, fewer men and women after COVID made OH appointments. Discipline-based analyses show that for all three time periods physiology emerged as the content area in which students made most OH appointments. The reduction in SFI observed, combined with the consistency with which the participants in our study indicated a need for assistance with the physiology discipline, emphasizes the importance of active promotion of faculty support and deliberate efforts to reconnect with students in the post-COVID context.",

In the lab, students watched and listened to a random student try to use these problem-solving skills to solve the problem. This made them appreciate how much others also struggle in solving the problem. Some students with imposter syndrome think their classmates immediately know how to solve a problem, and therefore, seeing others also struggle has the potential to reduce imposter syndrome. Rather than having the students do experiments, they did kinesthetic activities with mechanical models to generate data without biological variation. They then graphed their data, thus improving their ability to actually read graphs rather than memorize patterns.",

Many nonanatomists may thus believe that studying anatomy does not develop transferable higher-order cognitive skills. Published lists of anatomy learning objectives (LOs) might reinforce this view by focusing attention on numerous details of specific structures and regions. To explore this issue further, we have analyzed the structure of published peer-reviewed LOs by characterizing their organization (single-tiered or multi-tiered), inclusion of function, use of action verbs, and dependence on or independence of context. Our results suggest that previously published LO lists, despite their value, may not fully showcase opportunities for students to develop higher-order skills. In the hope of stimulating further discussion and scholarship, we present here a two-tiered framework of human anatomy competencies, i.e., generalizable skills beyond straightforward recognition and memorization. This framework, which is intended to be both student-facing and faculty-facing, illustrates how anatomy courses may be reframed as opportunities to think critically and develop sophisticated, professionally relevant skills.",

The paper encompasses three of the physiology core concepts, cell membranes, flow down gradients, and scientific reasoning, which were recently assigned to the classes The Biological World, The Physical World, and Ways of Looking at the World, respectively. Thus, analysis of such a paper illuminates the relationships that exist between distinct concepts and encourages a holistic approach to understanding physiology. In-depth analysis of the paper allows us to follow the authors' thought processes from their realization that previous methods lacked the resolution to answer a fundamental question relating to ion movement across membranes to the application of a more sensitive technique and ultimately the development of a novel model describing ion flux. This paper was the culmination of work started in the mid-1930s, strongly supported the ionic theory of nervous conduction proposed by Hodgkin and Huxley, and predicted the presence of ion channels as narrow pores through which ions move sequentially four decades before these features were convincingly demonstrated.",

This paper describes a fourth-year medical school elective, Advanced Physiology in Critical Care Medicine, that focused on integrating physiology core concepts in a case-based learning approach.

Senior students were asked to generate mechanism of disease (MOD) maps, highlight the physiology core concepts associated with paper cases of critically ill patients, and discuss with faculty the relevance of the underlying basic science. The weekly footprint consisted of a student led session presenting MOD maps for three cases which examined aspects of core physiology concepts, and later in the same week, student presentation of order sets for the management of the cases. Students ended the 4-week elective with a mini-grand rounds presentation on a topic of their choice incorporating the core concept paradigm. Student perception data and faculty reflections of the elective course are included. Student data and faculty observations suggest they appreciate and can apply physiological core concepts to patient care.

    "abstract": "As public-facing global institutions, modern universities are subject to equality legislation (locally the United Kingdom Equality Act) 1 and the need to represent an increasingly diverse student body. For effective education, this broad cohort needs to see itself represented, both in the curriculum, and in the very structures of the university 2 . It is with this in mind that staff in the Centre for Biomedical Sciences Education in Queen's University Belfast recruited three students from diverse backgrounds to co-design aspects of the Undergraduate Physiology Curriculum for Medicine and Health and Life Sciences (MHLS) degrees. As part of a 6-week summer internship, our students set out to identify gaps in the physiology curriculum regarding those with protected characteristics as described by the UK Equality Act 2010 (race, sex, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, religion and belief, disability and sexual orientation; Figure 1 1 ). Our aim was to incorporate Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) principles to create a learning environment that celebrates people's differences and represents individual students. Themes that developed over the six week period of the internship were recognizing oneself in the curriculum, cultural humility and intersectionality.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive science principles can facilitate integrating and retaining basic science concepts during the clinical years of undergraduate medical education. We hypothesized that reinforcing foundational science concepts during the core clerkship experiences fosters the development of clinical reasoning in medical students. A patient simulation session on diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the pediatric clerkship was chosen to pilot the program. We introduced an intervention in which a team of clinical and foundational science faculty facilitates student discussions, helping them connect important physiological and pathophysiological concepts to the disorder's clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management. The student survey reported that 87% strongly agreed that it helped them reinforce their understanding of foundational science concepts related to clinical cases. The NBME subject exam results of the pediatric clerkships from the corresponding years were subjected to a cognitive diagnostic assessment called the DINA model analysis. The student content mastery in acid-base disorders was improved following the intervention (student mastery of skills, 0.73 vs 0.80, P=0.035). Similarly, analysis of the Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) skills from the NBME subject exam item analysis reports showed improvement in the skill \"diagnosis\" on the topic of diabetes (probability value- before and after the intervention, respectively, 0.73 and 0.85, p=0.04) following implementation. Our study shows the impact of foundational science reinforcement during clinical clerkships in developing undergraduate medical students' clinical reasoning and diagnostic skills.",

    "abstract": "Testing is a highly important tool, used ubiquitously in academia, to assess student comprehension and understanding of material. Unfortunately, the emphasis placed on test grades has resulted in a modern epidemic of test-related anxiety, which can have adverse health effects on students. Over time, novel testing strategies have been developed to more precisely assess individual skills such as remembering, analyzing, and synthesizing. Yet there exist few strategies that were also developed to simultaneously reduce stress in the testing environment. We posit here a teaching innovation whereby we modified the classic interteaching session developed in the social sciences to serve as a stress-reduction testing format that also builds student communication and critical thinking skills in an upper-level pathophysiology course. After implementing this novel testing approach, we anonymously surveyed the students in the class to understand how the testing format affected their self-perceived stress levels, their self-perceived learning, and to identify their testing preferences. Of 28 students, 12 responded (43%). Our survey data highlight that students largely preferred partnered, open-response, case-based exams to multiple choice exams. Moreover, students perceived themselves as having lower test-related stress when taking partnered, open-response, case-based exams, as well as strong overall agreement that partnered, open-response, case-based exams enhanced their learning. We posit this application of modified interteaching can be employed in upper-level physiology or pathophysiology courses as a stress-reduction testing strategy.",

The characteristics of introductory exercise science courses, as well as faculty impressions of course benefits and areas for improvement, were explored in this study. Electronic survey data from 181 universities around the United States were analyzed. A wide range of course content was reported. Institution type was related to the status of the faculty teaching the course, method of course delivery, class size, and class availability. The number of majors was related to faculty status, class availability, and class size. Specifically, private 4-year institutions were more likely to teach smaller, face-to-face classes. Introduction courses at R1, R2, Doctoral/Professional institutions, and programs with 300 or more majors were less likely to be taught by only tenured/tenure track faculty. Classes were more likely to be offered in various modalities as opposed to only face-to-face at community colleges, and programs with 300 or more majors were more likely to have classes with 50 or more students. Enrollment in the introductory course was more likely restricted to majors and minors at public 4-year schools and programs with 300 or more majors. Faculty perceived knowledge acquisition and relationship building as benefits of introductory classes for students and programs. The overarching themes for course improvement were modifying course content and characteristics of course delivery. Considering the varied course characteristics, we encourage faculty and administrators to be intentional when designing and implementing introductory exercise science courses.",

    "abstract": "An increase in scholarly publishing has been accompanied by a proliferation of potentially illegitimate publishers (PIP), commonly known as “predatory publishers”. These PIP often engage in fraudulent practices and publish articles that are not subject to the same scrutiny as those published in journals from legitimate publishers (LP). This places academics at risk, in particular students who utilize journal articles for learning and assignments. This analysis sought to characterise PIP in physiology, as this has yet to be determined, and identify overlaps in lists of PIP and LP used to provide guidance on legitimacy of journals. Searching seven databases (2 of PIP, 5 of LP), this analysis identified 67 potentially illegitimate journals (PIJ) that explicitly include \"physiology\" in their titles, with 8801 articles being published in them. Of these articles, 39% claimed to be indexed in GoogleScholar, and 9% were available on PubMed. This resulted in 17 publications ‘infiltrating’ PubMed and attracting &gt;100 citations in the process. Overlap between lists of PIP and LP was present, with eight PIJ occurring in both LP and PIP lists. Two of these journals appeared to be ‘phishing’ journals, and six were genuine infiltrations into established databases; indicating that LP lists cannot be solely relied upon as proof a journal is legitimate. This analysis indicates that physiology is not immune to the threat of PIP, and that future work is required by educators to ensure students do not fall prey to their use.",

    "abstract": "We have observed two starkly contradictory notions regarding the sympathetic influence on the salivary outflow in discussions with our students. Most of them believe that sympathetic nerves decrease salivation and are antagonistic to parasympathetic nerves. Some students, however, show awareness of the cooperative stimulatory action of both types of autonomic fibers. We have found a similar dichotomy in the descriptions of the sympathetic effect on secretion of the main salivary glands and their inconsistent illustrations in Anatomy/Physiology textbooks. We have investigated the historical roots of this discrepancy. Ludwig discovered excitatory actions of both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves on salivary flow by 1856. The next year, Czermak proposed the hypothesis of an inhibitory effect of sympathetic nerves, observing their interference with salivation induced by the chorda tympani (i.e., parasympathetic) stimulation. Bernard and Eckhard soon confirmed Ludwig's findings, but Czermak's notion persisted because sympathetically evoked salivation was unstable and potentially abatable by glandular vasoconstriction. The salivary secretory response to moderate sympathetic nerve electrostimulation was reaffirmed by Langley who also discovered salivation in response to adrenaline injection at the beginning of the 20th century. A few years later, Cannon, on a purely theoretical basis, attributed the sensation of dry mouth occasionally associated with fear to hyposalivation induced by elevated sympathetic discharge. Despite subsequent researchers' inability to find unequivocal evidence of salivary flow reduction by sympathetic activation, Cannon's assumption gained acceptance in some textbooks. Most Anatomy/Physiology textbook authors, however, recognized the excitatory action of sympathetic nerves on salivary glands established by Ludwig and Bernard.",

Resting membrane potential is simulated by a large capacitance reservoir of fixed level, connected to reservoir V through a tube having the role of the electrical conductance of the membrane. Injection of electrical current into the cell is simulated by injection of water into the membrane capacitance reservoir. Reversal potentials of the end-plate potential are simulated by another water reservoir, with fixed level (analogous to the reversal potential of the end-plate potential) connected to the membrane capacitance reservoir through a tube corresponding to the acetylcholine-activated ion channels. Different phases of the synaptic potential are then described using the hydraulic analogs. Hydraulic analogs have proved, in our experience, to be an efficient tool in complementing the already established electrical equivalents.",

Physiology grades obtained by past medical students were regressed on their undergraduate grades and MCAT scores. This regression model was used in a prospective manner to predict a physiology course grade for the entering class. Six of the seven summer program participants achieved scores equal to or higher than their predicted scores.

    "abstract": "Faculty enthusiasm, with actual hands-on involvement, is a critical factor in establishing student research interest and excitement in a university or college science environment. Such faculty involvement is infectious to students and therefore key to restoring United States leadership in science and technology in the next decades. Most scientists acknowledge that they were initially attracted into scientific careers through one or two notable teachers who served as role models. However, with the introduction of so-called \"big science\" and its distraction of university faculty away from meaningful, direct student contacts, and with associated withdrawal of funding from \"little science\" in the college teacher's laboratory, research languishes in nearly all undergraduate teaching institutions. The inspiring college science teacher seems essentially gone, tired or burnt out, unable to keep pace with the rigorous demands of an active research lab while simultaneously meeting the exhausting load of 15-18 (or more) contact teaching hours per week. With all of the associated lecture preparations, student counseling, and Dean's committee assignments, the teacher has little or no scholarly \"think time\" or opportunity to inspire even the bright students. Without the teacher's honest and evident involvement and deep commitment, the student fails to experience the essential impact of a convincing role model. It is therefore necessary to restore the college science teacher's opportunity and aspirations to be personally involved in research. This can only be accomplished by providing time, facilities, incentives, and encouragement to do what originally attracted the teacher into a career in science and teaching in the first place.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

These demonstrations, on the topic of sensory system structure and function, rely on two perceptual consequences of neural adaptation in the visual system: afterimages and aftereffects. Viewing specific visual stimuli under binocular or monocular conditions with interocular transfer permits several concepts to be observed and discussed, including neural adaptation, anatomical and functional segregation of visual system pathways, and the relationship among visual system structure, function, and perception.

Even in the application phase of TBL, all teams must work on the same, significant problem and be required to make a specific choice and simultaneously report them to the whole class, which the MCQ format with predetermined answer choices allows. However, the founders of the TBL method rightly emphasize that the intended learning outcomes of a course using TBL underlie the design of the various components of TBL. The main point of this brief essay is to suggest that, if the ability to generate solutions to problems without predetermined answer choices is an intended learning outcome, it is advantageous to include carefully constructed free-standing, open-ended questions (OEQ) for both RAT and application activities in courses using TBL as the primary instructional method, in addition to the use of MCQs. Free-standing OEQs are OEQs not linked to an MCQ used for RAT or application activities. How this might be incorporated in what one may envision as TBL is discussed.",

While this may be justified under these unprecedented circumstances, a key question is what do schools that typically reuse summative test items across cohorts do to minimize threats to validity of test scores from future administrations of summative assessments of competence with possibly compromised items? The beneficiaries would take the exam under standard conditions in the future, yet their exam would be suspect. As it is rarely possible to replenish an entire summative MC test form with valid high-quality items on a yearly basis, maintaining a secure item database is a key measure (1). This is also an issue that directly relates to public accountability of medical schools.A legal defense of the validity of unproctored high-stakes online testing in the face of arguably unknowable effects of cheating would be problematic (2). As documented earlier (3), it is possible to obtain screenshots of test items with smart phones or other devices, potentially compromising test item security. Even with web-based remote monitoring, these actions may escape detection.We suggest that, during the pandemic (while test item security is potentially compromised), faculty committees select 50–70% of the questions of a given exam from the proven items (with acceptable item performance data) in their secure database, with new items to make up the remainder. Additionally, a transient 15–25% reduction in the number of summative MC items for a course held during the pandemic might be considered, if it would still allow for an adequate sampling of learning from across various aspects of a course and enable valid pass-fail adjudications in each course/program.After the pandemic, the same exam might be composed of ~70% protected, uncompromised, proven items from the secure database and ~30% newly written ones. This approach would allow comparison of cohorts of examinees, validate the exam, and maximize exam security, but might be wasteful and would not enable the institution to ascertain the necessity to discard valuable test items.Alternatively, ~25% of test items used during the pandemic under nonstandard proctoring conditions would be reused, with ~50% of items drawn from the secure database, and newly written items making up the rest. This approach enables a statistical screen for a \"boost\" in scores suggestive of significant irregular behavior connected to unprotected (potentially compromised) reused items at the level of a cohort of examinees, or potentially at the level of individual examinees. To be clear, this letter does not pertain to deliberately designed, authentic summative assessments of competence intended to be of the \"open-book\" type.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.DISCLAIMERSThe views expressed herein are strictly the personal views of the authors.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSE.S.P. and B.K. conceived and designed research; E.S.P. drafted manuscript; E.S.P. and B.K. edited and revised manuscript; E.S.P. and B.K. approved final version of manuscript.REFERENCES1.

Surprisingly, the link between the membrane excitation and contraction was entirely unknown. This dilemma has been called the time-distance paradox. The path to discovery of the missing link between excitation and contraction was a rocky one involving the simultaneous but independent development of physiological and morphological studies. From the viewpoint of physiology, significant events included the most thrilling moment of a scientific life, confirmation of a hypothesis that was wrong, a major surprise and shock, a result not expected from evolutionary relationships, and disappointment and confusion before clarity. From the viewpoint of morphology, there was the exciting beginning and rapid development of biological electron microscopy, heroic experiments, the importance of sample preparative procedures, and discovery of clues from the old light microscopic literature. However, it was the confluence of physiology and morphology that brought clarity and a major advance in understanding, leading to the discovery of the transverse tubular system and inward spread of activation in skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "Here, we describe a pedagogical approach that combines didactics with active learning to facilitate integration across physiological systems in a team-taught, graduate-level physiology course. We covered the major physiological systems, with each system preceded by an overview of its evolution/ontogeny to provide a broader perspective. Lectures provided a framework for integration by giving examples of how each system interacted with systems that preceded and followed. In lieu of a final exam, the course culminated in capstone presentations by small groups to promote student-centered learning of integrative physiology. At the beginning of the semester, students were assigned to groups; each group chose from predetermined topics. This allowed them to accumulate information throughout the semester and required them to attend to lecture content to assess how the material applied to their topic, thereby facilitating learning and retention. Faculty were deliberate in choosing material that was presented in each system, and material that was strategically omitted, establishing “gaps” that students filled in their capstone presentations. The final week was dedicated to student preparation for their presentations, which promoted peer-to-peer teaching and problem solving by the group, assisted by faculty as necessary. Capstone presentations demonstrated students’ mastery of basic physiological principles and their ability to integrate among physiological systems, and they rated capstone presentations highly in helping with integration and critical thinking. Thus students showed a better understanding of systems physiology and the importance of integration across systems in normal function and in responding to homeostatic challenges.",

We took an opportunistic approach when the COVID-19 pandemic forced our content into virtual delivery mode, as clinical medical education required a shift to nonpatient contact. We describe our experience in building a 2-wk course that consisted of online small groups during week 1 and panels and cases during week 2. The physiology content involved faculty-vetted resources, along with both discrete and open-ended focus questions for each learning objective. The course also included mechanical ventilation, and the physiologist utilized discussion points and developed a formative quiz to emphasize the physiology correlates, in addition to the very clinical aspects of mechanical ventilation. There were pathophysiology opportunities with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multiple-organ system dysfunction among the clinical correlates. Review and recall of the foundational sciences occurred, allowing links between the pre-clerkship and clerkship years that were previously undiscovered in our institution. This virtually delivered medical curriculum related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 is timely, carries high student interest, and can benefit medical students and the communities they serve.",

However, motivating students to establish personal and emotional connections with the curricular content is challenging. We presented a didactic strategy named \"the presidential election of the human body,\" created to use the presidential election context to engage students in studying cell function and structure using role-playing and appropriation of scientific concepts. Four groups of students (n = 124) of the science and mathematics teacher training program chose a cell of the human body to impersonate, they studied the biology of their cell, and they ran in a presidential election campaign. They created slogans, videos, and materials for their campaign, and on the day of the election the group of students voted for the best slogan. The didactic strategy was capable of stimulating the appropriation of the characteristics of the cells they represented. The majority (75%) of the elected candidates represented cells that are linked to the nervous system. Musicality and humor were the most frequent styles that appeared in the slogans. Students strongly agreed that they enjoyed the activity and considered it valuable for contextualizing the learning of anatomy and physiology. Thus, the activity is a didactic resource to stimulate the students to embrace the content they are learning in the contextualized momentum of a presidential election.",

    "abstract": "Flipped teaching (FT) is a student-centered instructional method that shifts lectures out of the classroom and uses a variety of activities to apply content during class time. FT has gained attention among educators as a student-centered instructional method. However, many faculty still lack the skills, knowledge, confidence, and expertise to implement FT in their classrooms. Therefore, course-specific training and focused mentorship are critical in successfully implementing FT. Four faculty members, from an adjunct professor to a full professor, from four diverse institutions around the country, were recruited and funded through the American Physiological Society's Teaching Career Enhancement Award to receive training in the implementation of FT in their courses. This study aimed to provide specific tools and strategies to engage students in deeper learning through activities in the participants' courses. A course was built using the Blackboard Learning Management System for the participants to receive relevant readings to be completed prior to the FT workshop. Upon completing this training, the participants examined the design and execution of FT in their classrooms and, subsequently, reflected on and refined their future course offerings. The facilitator mentored the participants throughout the process, including an on-site observation of a live FT session. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected before and after their FT experiences. Based on the survey results, this study helped improve the FT knowledge and self-efficacy of all participants. In conclusion, the faculty utilized the training and mentoring to implement FT in their classrooms successfully and disseminate their experiences and findings.",

Giving sound advice on these questions requires the ability to find, interpret, and communicate the evidence to support or reject the use of a given intervention. \"Evidence-based practice\" (EBP) provides a philosophical framework for combining personal experience, client/patient values, and scientific evidence to give informed advice in a professional setting. Here, we describe the development and implementation of a semester-long EBP project in an introductory exercise physiology course. We discuss how specific components of the project are designed to enhance classroom equity, improve scientific communication, and integrate course content with the student's lived experience and personal interests.",

However, in our experience teaching medical students over the years, many students struggle to make connections between a brief introduction of the Nernst equation and its clinical application to K+ imbalances. This article aims to connect the introduction of the equation to its clinical application to understand K+ imbalances using six logical steps with detailed visual illustrations that make the connection explicit and cohesive. In addition, we highlight a few common areas related to the six steps that are often overlooked by both teachers and students. Students who are able to thoroughly demonstrate an understanding of all the six steps highlighted in this article will achieve mastery of this topic.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article fills the gaps in teaching about the Nernst equation, which is important in medical physiology. Six logical steps are presented that connect the introduction of the equation to its clinical applications to hyperkalemia and hypokalemia, two conditions that can be life-threatening if left untreated.

    "abstract": "The interchange among the energy-providing phosphagen, glycolytic, and aerobic systems during exercise is often poorly understood by beginning students in exercise physiology. Exercise is oftentimes thought of as being aerobic or anaerobic, with the body progressing sequentially from one system to the next, although the energy systems work synergistically to produce energy from the onset of exercise, and all ultimately use oxygen. Traditional methods of teaching these concepts using only indirect calorimetry and a metabolic cart can be misleading. Relatively inexpensive noninvasive monitors of muscle oxygenation levels ([Formula: see text]) provide a useful tool to help students better understand the contribution and timing of these three systems of ATP generation and convey the concept that ultimately all energy production in the human body is oxygen dependent. In this laboratory, students use near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to visualize oxygen utilization by skeletal muscle during exercise by devising three exercise unique protocols, with each designed to stress a different energy system. Students then perform their protocols while using NIRS to measure and analyze [Formula: see text]. Students generate graphs with collected data, allowing them to visualize and appreciate oxygen consumption during all three protocols as well as elevated oxygen consumption after exercise. The students learn that any exercise is really all about oxygen.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Traditional methods of teaching bioenergetics using indirect calorimetry and a metabolic cart may be misleading. Recent advances in technology have made near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) a relatively inexpensive, noninvasive means of monitoring muscle oxygen levels during exercise.

    "abstract": "The frog sciatic nerve provides a robust physiological preparation students may conveniently use to investigate the properties of compound action potentials. Electrical stimulation with standard physiology teaching equipment elicits compound action potentials that are easily recorded by upper-level undergraduate students. The amplitude of compound action potentials increases with greater stimulation voltages, up until a maximum response is achieved. Plotting action potential size as a function of stimulating voltage produces a curve that illustrates the responsiveness of a nerve. In the present study, several local anesthetics (MS-222, procaine, lidocaine, benzocaine, and tetracaine) were used to reversibly suppress compound action potentials within a time frame consistent with the limitations of teaching labs. Highly responsive nerves generate steep response curves that reach asymptotes at relatively low stimulating voltages. Less active nerves require higher stimulating voltages and appear \"right-shifted.\" Anesthetized response curves may also appear \"flatter,\" exhibiting lower peak amplitude, when compared to fully active nerves. The magnitude of action potential suppression and time course of recovery depended upon the specific anesthetic applied. Nerves anesthetized with MS-222 were the fastest to recover, reaching their original responsiveness within 20 min. Tetracaine had the most dramatic effects, with nerves typically requiring more than a day to fully recover physiological responses. Carefully dissected nerves maintained their physiological responses for many days when stored in Ringer solution at 4°C, making this preparation particularly useful for undergraduate lab experiences. Quantitative analyses may be performed on the data collected, providing students with opportunities to design and implement their own experiments.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The frog sciatic nerve preparation represents a \"classical\" physiology lab for demonstrating principles of action potentials. Local anesthetics provide an inexpensive tool to manipulate the physiological activity of nerves and other excitable tissues. Isolated nerves retain their physiological activity for up to several days when kept in Ringer solution at 4°C. Quantitative data analysis from this robust nerve preparation should present students with many opportunities for designing their own experiments with anesthetics.",

The scenario described below was experienced during an in-class exam that included the possibility of an Honor Code violation between two students that was observed independently by three different faculty proctors. Herein we detail an objective, statistical approach taken to maintain exam and academic integrity that is compelling and transparent to students and the University Honor Council. Using the established error-similarity analysis for multiple-choice exams, it was determined that the number of identical incorrect answers found on the exams of the two individuals in question was sufficiently greater than the number expected by chance (probability of P < 0.00001). The number of total identical incorrect answers found on the remaining exams (across 65 students, n = 89 comparisons) was plotted as function of the number of total incorrect answers found on these exams (incorrect answers ranged from 1 to 22) and clearly supported that there was an Honor Code violation between the two students in question. The techniques used herein established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a form of cheating had occurred between these students. However, caution must be taken as further investigation is requisite to establish whether the Honor Code violation was unidirectional (one student copying off the other) or bidirectional (collusion between the two students) in nature.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Academic dishonesty is prevalent in universities, especially on examinations with a large number of students in close seating arrangements.

The understanding of these diseases relies on strongly interwoven aspects of vascular physiology and vascular medicine. We aimed to connect these within a horizontally integrated laboratory class on vascular physiology of the leg that was designed in cooperation between the departments of physiology and vascular surgery. Conceptually, we applied examination techniques of vascular medicine to visualize physiological parameters that are altered by the most frequent diseases. This facilitates integrative discussions on malfunctions, trains diagnostic skills, and bridges to vascular medicine. In four experiments, we use oscillometry and impedance venous occlusion plethysmography to address key aspects of the arterial and venous system of the legs: 1) arterial pulse wave, 2) arterial systolic blood pressure, 3) venous capacitance and venous outflow, and 4) reactive hyperemia. After the experiments, physiological vascular function, the associated diseases, their impact on the recorded parameters, and diagnostic options are discussed. To allow reproduction, we describe the course structure and the experimental setup in detail. We present the experimental data of a cohort of medical students and document learning success and student satisfaction. All experiments were feasible and provided robust data on physiologically and clinically relevant vascular functions. The activity was perceived positively by the students and led to a substantial improvement of knowledge.

    "abstract": "Reading nutrition facts label is a competency for which training is given in several nutrition education programs, especially in obesity outreach workshops. The top trump-style card game is commonly used in obesity prevention educational programs to engage participants in reading nutrition facts labels; however, the success of TV cooking shows among children and teenagers has not been explored for educational purposes. This paper is a descriptive study of developing a gamified activity as part of the one-time outreach workshop facilitated by the Obesity and Comorbidities Research Center (OCRC) in Brazil. By playing the MestreChef Nutritional (MCN) game, participants followed similar rules as the corresponding TV cooking show. They were challenged to decide to select food items, calculate dietary food intake and prepare a recipe to visualize the proportion of macronutrients contained in daily diets. The analysis of the nutritional dietary table completed by participants revealed to be a rich source of information, and we identified in our cohort that selecting an adequate number of food items and making healthy food choices was not concerning. However, their lack of competency in performing mathematical reasoning, particularly in calculating serving sizes and converting grams of macronutrients into calories, was evident. Moreover, facilitators of the workshops agreed that the MCN game presents definitively more didactic effectiveness and playability than the Foods Top Trumps, a former game used in the outreach workshops. The MCN game nourishes the engagement of the participants in learning nutrition-related concepts and may be an efficient didactic resource to improve nutrition knowledge in outreach activities when an alternative method is required to stimulate reading nutrition facts labels.",

Thus students typically view physiology as a \"difficult\" subject and place an emphasis on rote learning and memorization. Here, we attempted to address this knowledge gap by introducing a pedagogical intervention into the neurophysiology lesson plan of first-year medical and health physiology students at the University of La Réunion. This intervention aimed to better link abstract concepts (e.g., saltatory conduction) and a pathological disorder (multiple sclerosis), together with a discussion of a specific therapeutic intervention (fampridine). Students were required to complete readings (focused on neurophysiology aspects) and two online quizzes before two scheduled in-person lectures. They could also pose questions on a dedicated online forum. Thereafter, the in-person lectures discussed questions posted on the online forum, provided feedback on poorly answered questions (from the online quizzes), and dealt with questions posed by students attending classes. Student feedback regarding the pedagogic intervention was assessed by an anonymous online survey. This survey revealed that the pedagogical intervention was positively received. For example, 94% of respondents agreed the course was well developed, while 80% indicated that the pedagogical intervention was beneficial in terms of their understanding of basic and abstract neurophysiology concepts. Together, this pedagogical intervention was enthusiastically received by the students who better understood how basic nerve physiology concepts fit into the broader context and that such an understanding can result in the development and the roll-out of unique therapeutic interventions for multiple sclerosis.",

The PhysioCAFUN consists of 23 modules. Modules 1-15 cover the organ systems, including principles and concepts of physiology, molecular biology and cell physiology. Modules 16-23 contain optional content, including environmental physiology, pharmacology, and topics related to skill development. PhysioCAFUN serves as a freely available resource document for African stakeholders regarding the desired undergraduate physiology training and competencies. It will help universities in Africa, and elsewhere, to draft a curriculum suitable for their local needs where there is a dearth of physiologists, or to benchmark and revise their curricula where physiology programs are already in place.",

Student performance in the FT (92.78p±3.93) and FTR (92.98p±3.73) methods surpassed that of the TT method (89.28p±4.67); p&lt;0.01), with a notable correlation between science grade point averages and the instructional methods employed (p&lt;0.01). Analysis of the impact of teaching methods on different segments of the class revealed higher scores for both upper and lower halves in the FT (95.78p±1.85 Upper; 89.52p±2.79 Lower) and FTR (95.95p±1.48 Upper; 89.89p±2.68 Lower) compared to the TT group (92.44p±1.76 Upper; 85.85p±4.43 Lower; p&lt;0.0001). The gender-based evaluation indicated similar performance between male and female students across the teaching methods tested. Although survey data suggested a preference for TT (100%) over FT (58%) or FTR (85%), student performance contradicted this preference. These findings underscore the effectiveness of FT and FTR methods compared to traditional instructional modalities, with male and female students responding similarly to the teaching approaches. Despite student preferences favoring TT, actual performance indicates that FT and FTR methods enhance student learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Games and analogies can significantly enrich the learning experience when integrated with traditional expository teaching methods. With this aim, we developed The Mystery of the Cell Kingdom, an online game designed to enhance understanding of the physiology of thyroid hormones through a medieval analogy. In the game, students are challenged to apply their knowledge of endocrine physiology to solve a series of relevant questions on the topic. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the game as a complementary review tool for a theoretical lesson on thyroid hormones. After an online class, 18 students participated in the game and completed questionnaires before and after the activity. The results showed a 14.9% increase in post-game scores. Feedback revealed that all students enjoyed the experience and provided positive evaluations of both the game and the analogy used. These findings suggest that the online game “The Mystery of the Cell Kingdom” can facilitate learning about thyroid hormones while offering an engaging, enjoyable, and motivating approach to physiology education.",

    "abstract": "The physiology of excitable membranes is a fundamental topic in neuroscience and physiology courses at graduate and undergraduate levels. From the building blocks of ionic gradients and membrane channels whose permeability is selective and variable, we build the concepts of resting potential, action potential, and propagation in neurons and muscle fibers. Many students have an intuitive understanding of the movements of ions and the associated changes in membrane potential. For example, potassium ions leaving a cell through potassium-selective channels become unbalanced positive charges on the outside of the cell (and leave unbalanced negative charges on the inside), thus producing a potential across the membrane with the inside negative with respect to the outside. Later, when we discuss the local circuit currents that underlie propagation or the basis for extracellular stimulation, we make the general statement that \"outward currents depolarize cells.\" Students respond with utter disbelief. Two simple additions to a discussion of membranes are suggested that permit the formulation of a consistent set of rules that apply to everything from the resting and action potentials of nerve and muscle through synaptic potentials and stimulation techniques.",

Students in the upper-level physiology class at Dickinson College are responsible for formulating a set of testable hypotheses as to the possible compensatory mechanisms that will result from a unilateral nephrectomy in the rat. To test their hypotheses, each group of students is made responsible for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, removal of the left kidney, closure, and recovery of the animal in their experiment. Before and 1 wk after nephrectomy, blood samples are collected via tail section for measurement of hematocrit and plasma creatinine concentrations. Pooling data across all student groups (n = 6) for pre- and postnephrectomy hematocrit and creatinine values allows students to run statistical comparisons testing their hypotheses. This laboratory experience in integrative physiology is a successful exercise in introducing fundamentals of experimental design and, most importantly, provides students with an appreciation for the process of humane use of animals in research and teaching.",

    "abstract": "As teachers we feel the need to do more than merely teach basic facts and concepts. We want to make the subject matter more relevant; we would like to help integrate the various threads of the students' education and life experiences; and, finally, we wish to increase the students' interest and involvement in the learning process. There is the temptation, however, when thinking along these lines, to consider the use of time-consuming, complex methods of approach. These might involve slide presentations, videos, special lectures, special assignments, student, reports, etc: The very complexity of these approaches often reduces their effectiveness. Moreover, the time and effort required often keeps us from attempting them more than once or twice. Are simpler and more effective approaches to enrichment possible? Reflecting on our own education, many of us may recall the disproportionate impact of some revealing aside thrown by a teacher unexpectedly into an otherwise mundane lecture or discussion: perhaps a short, penetrating observation providing an unexpected perspective on what was being discussed, a bolt of lightening that briefly illuminated the dim landscape of the classroom. This we may remember when much from the course has been totally forgotten. These jewels of thought--epiphanies--can be shared by teachers to enrich, enlighten, and refresh their students and each other. The jewels we speak of need not be precious or rare. Indeed, the metaphors \"a bolt of lightening\" and \"jewels\" may mislead by their intensity and drama. Is it not in the often unexamined, simple, and humble all around us that wisdom can be found?

Recording of isotonic contraction, which is the more familiar behavior of skeletal muscle, is made convenient by an accessory to convert the commonly available Statham force transducer to isometric recording.

The behaviors of various components in neuromuscular systems do not always interact in obvious ways, and the function of hundreds of components can be very different from the function of just one or two \"representatives.\" In this paper, a simulator is presented that can model both small and large spinal circuitry systems thus allowing students to explore the dynamic functional implications of the static circuitry diagrams that are common in many neuroscience textbooks. The simulator brings to life many concepts in neuromuscular physiology and permits students to explore such concepts without extensive supervision. The benefits and drawbacks of using this kind of simulator in the classroom are discussed, based on initial field tests with undergraduate and graduate students as well as input from the literature. It was found that such a simulation can be very useful as a teaching tool if it is used properly with the right audience.",

We too think it is good news that participants are still interested in science-related careers. The purpose of our descriptive data is to demonstrate the plausibility of the concept of inspiring careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics as well as healthcare fields through a simulation-based MEDscience program as well as the feasibility of successful implementation (1). Our hope is that others will find this to be a useful building block in creating programs for high school students.In response to the concern that this program is an “add on” to an already packed curriculum, please note our program is fully integrated into the existing high school science curriculum and is part of the student's school day. Our program is a collaboration between a classroom teacher and a clinical educator and is tailored to meet the specific needs of the class, as noted in a previous paper (2). MEDscience is currently offered in five schools, where it has been fully embedded in courses such as advanced placement biology, nursing, health, and anatomy and physiology. An important part of this program is that it is built on creative community partnerships among K–12 schools, medical schools, and affiliated institutions. These partnerships add vibrancy and ameliorate costs.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthor contributions: N.E.O. drafted manuscript; N.E.O. edited and revised manuscript; N.E.O. approved final version of manuscript.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "Decades of behavioral observations have shown that invertebrate and vertebrate species have the ability to distinguish between self-generated afferent inputs versus those that are generated externally. In the present article, I describe activities focused around the discussion of a classic American Physiological Society paper by Curtis C. Bell that lays the foundation for students to investigate the neural substrate underlying this ability. Students will leave this activity being able to 1) describe the technical aspects and limitations of an electric fish preparation commonly used to acquire single unit (extracellular) neurophysiological data, 2) provide physiological evidence showing that the activity of principal cells in the posterior lateral line lobe of the electric fish brain reflects that of a reafference comparator that could be used in dissociating self-generated versus externally generated sensory signals, and 3) knowledgeably discuss hypotheses concerning the role of corollary discharge and cerebellar-like structures in vertebrate and invertebrate species. The skills and background knowledge gained in this activity lay the platform for advanced study of scientific investigations into sensory, motor, and cognitive processes in undergraduate, graduate, or medical school curricula.",

The goal of the project was to improve the teaching of physiology in the medical curriculum and to establish a neuroscience research laboratory able to address Honduran needs. In addition to a computer learning facility and wet labs in neurophysiology for medical students, an independent research program that focused on social problems in the country (for example, the effects of malnutrition on the developing central nervous system) was developed, paving the way for the first graduate program in physiology in Honduras. Funded by a Fulbright Lectureship Grant, the shoe-string budget was augmented by donations of equipment by colleagues. This first-hand account describes the planning and implementation of the project, covering both expected and unexpected problems and successes. An update on the progress of the lab after two years of independent operation is also described.",

    "abstract": "With growing concern over the use of animal experimentation in the teaching of physiology, many biology departments are reassessing the use of animal experiments in the teaching lab. However, it may be just as important to assess how animal experimentation is used in the undergraduate teaching laboratory rather than simply assessing if animal experimentation should be used at all. In our study, sophomore-level life science students enrolled in a core organismal biology course undertook a laboratory exercise designed to elucidate properties of muscles and neuromuscular communication following two protocols: 1) a standard demonstrational model wherein students were told to undertake the exercise as a means to understand physiological processes that they had been exposed to previously in lecture or 2) an investigative model wherein the use of the gastrocnemius preparation was a logical next step in an ongoing investigation, the content of which was driven by student-generated hypotheses. We have observed a significant decrease in a number of the negative comments concerning the use of animals in experimentation (25.6 vs. 3.6%) since the implementation of the investigative approach to the laboratory, suggesting that curricular approaches to the use of animals in the teaching laboratory may have an impact on student attitudes concerning animal experimentation.",

It offers an off-line analysis of a set of typical and frequently occurring physiological and pathological electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked potential (EP) recordings, which are stored in an IBM-compatible personal computer (PC) system. The users are requested to measure and analyze the data sets and to work through a base of questions relevant in the frame of the particular topic. The program is structured in several exercises: calibration, pickup of non-EEG signals (eye movements, chewing), waveforms in EEG recordings from awake subjects (alpha-waves, beta-waves), desynchronization of cerebral activity (visual activation, acoustic activation, mental activation), habituation of cerebral activity upon acoustic stimuli, EEG recordings from asleep subjects (different sleep stages, sleep-specific EEG signals), epileptic seizures, and EPs (principle of averaging, visually evoked potentials in different cortical areas). The program runs under MS-DOS and is network capable. The software structure ensures maximal flexibility for rapid changes and adaptations of the program to specific needs of a particular EEG course. The program has been used for three years, and the response from &gt; 800 students has been consistently positive.",

In our course, students measure their own gastric secretory activity by the use of nasogastric tubes. Gastric secretion can be stimulated by insulin-induced hypoglycemia or by pentagastrin, a synthetic gastrin analogue. The time course of the secretory responses, i.e., volume, acid output, and pH, are followed by collecting control and poststimulatory secretions into 15-min samples. The effect of antiulcer drugs, such as cimetidine, can be easily studied in such experiments. The results of these experiments are very reproducible, allowing year-to-year comparisons of treatments. Examples of results of various experimental protocols are shown. We believe this to be a useful class exercise not only because of the excellent results it yields but because of the experience and insights it produces.",

Such skills are best developed by instructors and students working together in an active learning environment as opposed to instructors and students being, respectively, sources and sinks of factual knowledge. Most models of active learning are geared toward small group (< 15 students) settings in which interactions between students and instructor are optimized. However, basic courses in physiology are often forced to meet in large classes in which it is more difficult to utilize active learning methods. The panelists in this workshop demonstrated techniques that they use in large class settings to promote an active learning experience. We hope that this summary of the workshop will encourage you to experiment with educational approaches to improve the efficacy of teaching in the large class setting.",

His immense contributions to the field of physiology is an example of how challenges can bring benefits. Flipped teaching has been gaining attention among educators because of its ability to engage students in learning. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed educators to adopt this instructional design based on its conduciveness to technology, as well as its blend of both asynchronous and synchronous components of online teaching.

This is a concern since there is a positive correlation between increased engagement and student success. The lack of student feedback on content delivery prevents lecturers from identifying topics that would benefit students if reviewed. Implementing novel methods to engage the students in course content and create ways by which they can inform the lecturer of the difficult concepts is needed to increase student success. In the present study, we investigated the use of Twitter as a scalable approach to enhance engagement with course content and peer-to-peer interaction in a large course. In this pilot study, students were instructed to tweet the difficult concepts identified from content delivered by videos. A software program automatically collected and parsed the tweets to extract summary statistics on the most common difficult concepts, and the lecturer used the information to prepare face-to-face (F2F) lectorial sessions. The key findings of the study were 1) the uptake of Twitter (i.e., registration on the platform) was similar to the proportion of students who participated in F2F lectorials, 2) students reviewed content soon after delivery to tweet difficult concepts to lecturer, 3) Twitter increased engagement with lecturers, 4) the difficult concepts were similar to previous years, yet the automated gathering of Twitter data was more efficient and time saving for the lecturer, and 5) students found the lectorial review sessions very valuable.",

    "abstract": "Bolstered by evidence of the health benefits of exercise, health professionals advise their patients about it. Thus these professionals should have a basic knowledge of exercise physiology. In Brazil, a graduate degree is not mandatory, so for many health providers, the only opportunity to receive information on exercise physiology content is during their undergraduate study. Therefore, it is imperative that health science undergraduate programs include content on exercise physiology. The aim of the study was to verify the presence of exercise physiology (or similar coursework) in the curricula of seven health science undergraduate programs (biomedicine, physical education, nursing, physiotherapy, medicine, nutrition, and psychology). The study was divided into three phases: 1) a survey of the total number of undergraduate programs ( n = 4,940) through an electronic system of the Brazilian Ministry of Education (e-MEC); 2) a random selection of 10% of the total undergraduate programs ( n = 494) for further analysis of the curriculum; and 3) analysis of the curricula of the selected undergraduate programs. Of 494 undergraduate programs, we did not find curricula for 77 of them. Therefore, the final sample consisted of 417 undergraduate programs. In total, 65.9% of the undergraduate programs did not offer coursework in exercise physiology. The chi-square test revealed a significant association between undergraduate curricula in health science and the presence or absence of exercise physiology coursework [ X 2 (6, n = 417) = 293.0, P &lt; 0.0001]. We did not find exercise physiology coursework in most of the analyzed undergraduate programs. Alternatives to solve the lack of exercise physiology coursework would be the inclusion of content related to exercise physiology in professional/graduate education or in continuing education programs.",

We introduced the “concept-sharing approach” in our neurophysiology course. This approach explicates how the content relates with learning objectives throughout the entirety of each teaching session to help the students assimilate the learning material and direct their learning in an objective-orientated way. In this study, we aimed to examine satisfaction of the concept-sharing approach in medical students and to investigate the relationship between student perception of this teaching strategy and academic performance. The results demonstrated that most participants (74.1%) had a positive impression of this teaching strategy at the end of the course, which was significantly &gt;50.7% at the beginning of the course ( P &lt; 0.001). The participants who agreed the concept-sharing approach was useful had significantly higher final assessment ( P = 0.014) and end-of-course formative assessment scores ( P = 0.001). The findings indicate that after experiencing this new teaching approach, medical students appreciate its utility and that students who engage with this approach are more likely to perform well in assessments. In summary, the concept-sharing approach is a simple teaching strategy which was favored by students and may promote academic performance.",

These misunderstandings could point toward robust misconceptions. We examined first whether common misunderstandings persist throughout a medical curriculum, followed by a fine-grained analysis to identify their nature. We designed and administered a 2-tier test to 987 medical students across our curriculum, with 8 questions covering the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, cell division, and homeostatic processes. Proportions of incorrect responses were computed. Four questions where misunderstandings persisted were further qualitatively analyzed. A one-way ANOVA showed the proportion of incorrect responses decreased significantly by students’ academic year [ F(6, 986) = 96.05, P &lt; 0.001]. While novices and end-of -first-year students showed similar proportion of incorrect responses ( P &gt; 0.05), incorrect responses decreased significantly between first years and second years ( P &lt; 0.001). Thereafter, the proportion of incorrect responses remained stable from second to final year ( P &gt; 0.05), with ∼35% of incorrect responses. Five questions showed no decrease of incorrect responses between second and final years, with two questions where final year students performed marginally better than novices. A Chi-square analysis, with Bonferroni post hoc test, showed certain misunderstandings appeared frequently across the curriculum. The qualitative analysis of the open-ended questions yielded 15 categories of common misunderstandings of fundamental biomedical concepts in all years of training. If educators become aware of commonly misunderstood biomedical concepts, preventative measures could be taken to prevent robust misconceptions.",

Longitudinal data for each participant include weekly written reflections and interviews at the beginning, middle, and end of the two-semester sequence. The themes that emerged describe three variations of approach to learning the course content. In some cases, the focus was on completing tasks and actions without connecting those to a specific outcome. In other cases, the focus was on outcomes without specific references to what steps might lead to that outcome. A third approach explicitly linked tasks and actions to one or more of nine different outcomes, including both personal and course expectations. Two other themes emerged as salient in combination with the three approaches: self-identified shortcomings with their study approaches and affective responses to the course and content. Affective responses included both positive affect such as enjoyment or excitement and negative affect such as frustration or dislike. Understanding the approaches that students take to learning, combined with their affect and shortcomings in those approaches, can inform instructor decisions about course activities and resources that support specific learning outcomes. It also provides a foundational knowledge base for the development of context-specific instruments for quantifying student learning processes in A&amp;P.",

    "abstract": "Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree program curricula are typically comprised of heavy course loads and assessment burden. Typically, students “live” from exam to exam only preparing and studying for the exam directly ahead of them while neglecting concurrent courses. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the impact of weekly multicourse collective exams academic behaviors and learning in an integrated biological sciences (BSI) course within a PharmD program. Weekly multicourse exams included questions, four per credit hour, from all first semester courses that traditionally included summative exams. Seven courses contributed questions, which amounted to 15 weekly exams of ∼60 questions. No other graded assessments were given in any of the courses, other than individual course cumulative final exams; the final exams in each course were not collective. After completion of final exams, a Qualtrics survey was emailed to all students and the two professors teaching the course. Course grades, not including the final exam, were compared between two cohorts with or without the collective exams to determine impact on learning. The cumulative final exam was compared between cohorts to determine impact on retention. The majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that the weekly collective exams encouraged them to study BSI more frequently, most days of the week, reduced the likelihood of skipping class, and increased likelihood to pay attention and engage in class. The majority believed that they better learned and retained the BSI material. The majority specified that they liked the collective exams for BSI and preferred it over a traditional exam schedule. Learning also appeared to be improved. However, the impact on retention is less clear and requires further research. In conclusion, the weekly multicourse collective exams improved academic behaviors and learning.",

    "abstract": "Although considerable staff resources are often allocated to the teaching of undergraduate laboratory classes, there is a paucity of discussion regarding the extent and substance of the staff-student interactions that occur within classes and also whether these interactions benefit student learning in any way. Performed across four undergraduate laboratory sessions, this exploratory study aimed to quantify the interactions in terms of frequency, duration, and initiation of interactions, as well as gathering staff and student perceptions of the impact of the interactions. Staff gathered descriptive data by completing an observation checklist after each interaction and also provided their own perceptions of the interaction focus and outcome. Student perceptions were collected using an online survey after each class. Staff perceived that the most frequent achievement of the interactions was to enable students to progress with work. However, students’ perceptions suggested that staff may underestimate the impact of staff-student interactions on conceptual learning. The most striking findings were the students’ perceptions of the impact of interactions on their affective domain. On average, 93% of students agreed that when staff take an interest in their work, it motivates them to work hard, and 78% agreed that interactions with staff made the classes more enjoyable. With evidence that positive affect such as enjoyment is positively associated with aspects of learning, this is a salient finding. The study underscores the value of staff availability within the laboratory class and provides impetus to reevaluate how we perceive these interactions and their impact on student learning.",

    "abstract": "Supplemental resources in science education are made available to students based on the belief that they will improve course-based student learning. This belief is ubiquitous, with supplemental resources being a traditional component of physiology education. In addition, the recent large-scale transition to remote learning caused by the Covid-19 pandemic suggests an increased relevance and necessity of digital versions of supplemental resources. However, the use of a supplemental resource is entirely dependent on whether students view it as beneficial. If students in a specific course do not perceive a supplemental resource as useful, there is little reason to believe the resources will be used and are worthy of investment. Consequently, measurement of student perception regarding the effectiveness of any digital learning tool is essential for educators and institutions in order to prioritize resources and make meaningful recommendations to students. In this study, a survey was used to determine student perceptions of a digital, supplemental resource. Quantitative methods, including exploratory factor analysis, were performed on data collected from the survey to examine the dimensionality and functionality of this survey. The findings from this study were used to devise an improved, standardized (i.e., reliable and valid) survey that can be used and adapted by physi3ology researchers and educators to determine student perception of a digital supplemental resource. The survey, with known construct validity and internal reliability, can provide useful information for administrators, instructors, and designers of digital supplemental resources.",

This study aimed to evaluate student satisfaction in two SGL models among third-year medical students enrolled in a blood and lymphoid systems II course at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 318 students were divided into 12 groups, and each group had one facilitator. All included students and groups were exposed to both the central summary (CS) model and the individual facilitator summary (IFS) model (both SGLs). A questionnaire was developed to evaluate student rating of learning activities, perceived benefit, timing, workload, and satisfaction. Medical students rated the IFS model superior to the CS model for four of five parameters [confidence in performing and interpreting a laboratory test (83.6% vs. 78.8%), guidance for self-learning (52% vs. 39.5%), increased understanding of a disease (87.7% vs. 72.1%), and application of knowledge (77.4% vs. 70.2%), respectively]. Moreover, the IFS model was rated as having more suitable timing and workload and better satisfaction than the CS model. The results of this study suggest a strong preference for the IFS model over the CS model among medical students.",

    "abstract": "The current heightened social awareness and anxiety triggered by escalating violence against Black Americans in the United States demands a safe space for reflection, education, and civil discourse within the academic setting. Too often there is an unmet need paired with a collective urgent desire to better understand the chronic existing structural, social, educational, and health inequities affecting disadvantaged populations, particularly Black Americans. In this perspective, the authors provide insight into a shared learning approach that provided a forum to discuss Perspectives Against Racism (PAR). Unlike existing top-down approaches, faculty, trainees, and staff were engaged in leading a series of focused discussions to examine unconscious bias, promote awareness of implicit biases, and reflect on individual and collective roles and responsibilities in working toward becoming antiracist. An existing 1-h graduate elective seminar course was dedicated to creating a space for learning, discussion, and exchange of ideas related to the experience and existence of racism (personal and institutional/systemic). A goal of each session was to go beyond didactics and identify mechanisms to implement change, at the level of the individual, department, and institution. This perspective of the shared experience may provide an adaptable framework that can be implemented in an academic setting at the departmental, center, or institutional level.",

    "abstract": "This article traces 60 years of investigation of the molecular motor of skeletal muscle from the 1940s through the 1990s. It started with the discovery that myosin interaction with actin in the presence of ATP caused shortening of threads of actin and myosin. In 1957, structures protruding from myosin filaments were seen for the first time and called \"cross bridges.\" A combination of techniques led to the proposal in 1969 of the \"swinging-tilting cross bridge\" model of contraction. In the early 1980s, a major problem arose when it was shown that a probe attached to the cross bridges did not move during contraction. A spectacular breakthrough came when it was discovered that only the cross bridge was required to support movement in an in vitro motility assay. Next it was determined that single myosin molecules caused the movement of actin filaments in 10-nm steps. The atomic structure of the cross bridge was published in 1993, and this discovery supercharged the muscle field. The cross bridge contained a globular head or motor domain that bound actin and ATP. But the most striking feature was the long tail of the cross bridge surrounded by two subunits of the myosin molecule. This structure suggested that the tail might act as a lever arm magnifying head movement. Consistent with this proposal, genetic techniques that lengthened the lever arm resulted in larger myosin steps. Thus the molecular motor of muscle operated not by the tilting of the globular head of myosin but by tilting of the lever arm generating the driving force for contraction.",

(1) comparing in-person physiology laboratories to virtual alternatives with interest. As final year medical students, we agree with the utility of virtual physiology laboratories as they have played an important role in our learning. A virtual platform facilitates a personalized approach in which students can learn at their own pace and carry out further self-directed research into aspects of the course they find interesting. However, it is also important to note that there are certain skills taught through in-person physiology teaching sessions that perhaps cannot be quantified or replicated in a digital setting.Of note, we believe that in-person laboratories offer students the opportunity to develop their problem-solving and lateral thinking skills. Unlike in virtual laboratories, in-person experiments are subject to random, unplanned errors. On occasions where experiments produced unexpected results, we were required to work as a team and hypothesize why this might be and potentially attempt to correct the issue. Not only does this ensure that students have a holistic understanding of the topic, but it also requires them to employ reasoning and creative thinking skills that are essential for research. Overall, we felt that in-person laboratory teaching during our first and second years were invaluable for preparing us for our third-year independent research projects.Another important consideration is that certain modules within the physiology course may lend themselves better to virtual teaching and others to in-person teaching. Future studies should aim to characterize this further and the course should be adapted accordingly. Not only would this optimize teaching, but it would also identify and minimize any unnecessary use of animal models which could cause ethical concern, as noted by the authors.In conclusion, we agree with the authors that virtual laboratories play an important role in teaching students physiology. However, it is important to ensure that the incorporation of the virtual laboratory into the curriculum is not at the expense of valuable learning opportunities that are better provided in person.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSS.F. and K.M. conceived and designed research; S.F. and K.M. drafted manuscript; S.F. and K.M. edited and revised manuscript; S.F. and K.M. approved final version of manuscript.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "Increasing diversity, including diverse perspectives in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) classrooms and teaching practices, is recognized as a current higher education priority. Resources to assist institutions and instructors are growing; however, many STEM instructors still hesitate to implement diverse teaching practices and discussions of diversity issues in their courses for a variety of reasons. This paper describes an example of the incorporation and discussion of diversity and social justice issues as part of an upper level physiology of aging course. The general approach was to examine the functional intersection of the sociology and physiology using social determinants of health as mechanistic influencers of physiology and examining how they affect healthy aging and etiology of age-associated diseases. Activities included in-class and virtual discussion, collaboration with the university diversity department, and a written assignment where the students explored in depth how a social determinant of health affected molecular physiology of aging. Students were also provided with strategies they can use in careers as health practitioners to be more inclusive in their practices. Student participation and feedback indicated that this approach and activities were engaging, enlightening and useful and should be continued. They specifically appreciated the social issues discussed in their sociology courses being included in their physiology major course and thinking about how those issues are mechanistically linked to physiology. This was the first attempt at this approach, and strategies for future activity improvement and tips for successful implementation are also addressed.",

Most of the APS activities in the past quarter century were guided by a series of strategic plans. Membership in the APS increased by 76% since 1987, and there are now 8,342 regular members of the society, including an expansion of international members to 26% of APS's membership. The numbers of elected officers and committee members have expanded to accommodate this larger membership. APS Publications changed dramatically during this time, having adopted online submission and review of manuscripts as well as a streamlined review and publications process that have significantly shortened the period from submission to acceptance to publication. Compared with 1987, the number of manuscripts submitted has increased by 80% and the number of printed pages increased by 52%. In addition to the refinement of the Experimental Biology meeting (Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology meeting before 1993) format, APS launched a specialty conference program in the 1990s. The educational offerings of APS also dramatically expanded in the past 25 yr, often supported by external grants and contracts. APS education programs now support physiology education and science awareness at K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels as well as continuing education of its members. The founding of APS was tied to the need for effective advocacy, and APS continues to meet those goals through its Science Policy Committee and Animal Care and Experimentation Committees. At its 125th birthday, APS continues to serve the discipline and the needs of its membership.",

As part of the activity, the teachers were asked to collect data by replicating the method and to analyze and report the data. All concluded that the rate data they had collected were hyperbolic. As part of a guided inquiry plan, teachers were then prompted to reexamine the method and evaluate its efficacy as a teaching strategy for developing specific kinetic concepts. After further data collection and analysis, the teachers discovered that their data trends were not, in fact, hyperbolic, which led to several teacher-developed revisions aimed at obtaining a true hyperbolic outcome. This article outlines the inquiry process that led to these revisions and illustrates their alignment with several key concepts, such as rapid equilibrium kinetics. Instructional decisions were necessary at several key points, and these are discussed.",

The device was conceived, designed, and built at the University of Coimbra, in response to a request from the Exploratório Infante D. Henrique Science Centre Museum, where it is presently installed. The device was designed to allow lay audience to operate it, including school-age youngsters. The two blood flow reduction mechanisms that can be visualized are 1) thickening of the artery wall and 2) hardening of the artery wall. The main objective is to promote the understanding of atherosclerotic cardiovascular physiology by simple and direct experiments. This original educational interactive device was constructed using, in the conceptual and design stages of the project, a Newtonian theoretical flow model based on Poiseuille's equation. This device is driven by human force and provides a visualization of the effect of atherosclerosis on flow. The main aspects relating to its design and construction are described here to explain and disseminate this approach. Throughout more than 4 yr of real operation, this educational device proved to be a simple and attractive way of understanding atherosclerosis, especially among young people.",

    "abstract": "To address a growing need to make research trainees in physiology comfortable with the tools of molecular biology, we have developed a laboratory-intensive course designed for graduate students. This course is offered to a small group of students over a three-week period and is organized such that comprehensive background lectures are coupled with extensive hands-on experience. The course is divided into seven modules, each organized by a faculty member who has particular expertise in the area covered by that module. The modules focus on basic methods such as cDNA subcloning, sequencing, gene transfer, polymerase chain reaction, and protein and RNA expression analysis. Each module begins with a lecture that introduces the technique in detail by providing a historical perspective, describing both the uses and limitations of that technique, and comparing the method with others that yield similar information. Most of the lectures are followed by a laboratory session during which students follow protocols that were carefully designed to avoid pitfalls. Throughout these laboratory sessions, students are given an appreciation of the importance of proper technique and accuracy. Communication among the students, faculty, and the assistant coordinator is focused on when and why each procedure would be used, the importance of each step in the procedure, and approaches to troubleshooting. The course ends with an exam that is designed to test the students' general understanding of each module and their ability to apply the various techniques to physiological questions.",

These tests usually pose a different question, based on the possibility that nothing has happened. The question becomes: “how probable are these data, if there were NO difference between the original populations from which the data have been randomly drawn?” (In fact for most laboratory experiments, this supposition is patently false–the experiment has been conducted using a pre-ordained sample, possibly randomly divided into treatment and control groups, but certainly not randomly sampled.)However, if we continue to consider the usual analysis that is used, we have to assume that we have random samples, from the same population. Such samples will always differ to some extent. Occasionally, the difference might be substantial, large enough to suspect that they might not have come from the same source population. The usual context in which we use this test is that the data are already “under suspicion”: we usually don't want to believe the null hypothesis at all, and we are testing to see if the data are unlikely to be consistent with this hypothesis. To assess how “suspicious” our results can be, we estimate how frequently we might obtain results like ours:if the “null hypothesis” were true,if we were to repeatedly sample the population, andif the results are workings of chance.Generally, we reject the null hypothesis if chance alone could yield data like ours less than 1 time in 20 (or equivalently 95 times out of 100), an arbitrary and probably unnecessarily inflexible value (6). We believe our suspicions are justified, and we can then accept the alternative hypothesis: the samples are not from the same population. We rarely employ the same cautious vocabulary as the statistician, who might qualify this interpretation. The researcher assumes, wrongly, a possibility of 0.05 (i.e. 5%, or 1 in 20) to indicate that the null hypothesis is false, there is therefore a genuine difference, and that the result can be reliably replicated (1). The more cautious statistician would argue that the findings are consistent with that conclusion, but are not unequivocal. Indeed, this is so: if a single experiment just meets the level of significance, it is just as likely NOT to give a significant result if the same experiment were to be repeated. It's a bit like exams: the marks of students that just fail are often considered carefully, in case the examiners have been too severe, but the students that scrape through are illogically allowed to pass without further scrutiny. In testing our results, we accept the fact that we may conclude that an intervention has had a “real effect” when in fact we may be wrong 5% of the time: this is the type I error rate (Figure 1).Fig. 1.In the long run, if we accept P = 0.05 as a threshold possibility, we make the correct decision 95 times in 100 experiments. We will misclassify 5% of experiments as positive when this is not the case. The type I error rate is the rate of classification of results as positive (different) when in fact there is no difference: the false positive rate. In the context of “trust” in results, a false positive rate of 5% is generally considered acceptable.Download figureDownload PowerPointUsually scientists do one experiment at a time, or at least they think they do: the experiment asks the question “has this treatment had an effect?”, and if P < 0.05 we accept that we have found an effect. However, in many experiments a variety of factors such as time, expense, resources and concern about animal use may lead to a single study asking several questions. Each of these may require statistical testing. As soon as more answers are sought from the same data, the trustworthiness of the answers can change. The error rate in the experiment as a whole (experiment-wise error rate) will increase, and become greater than the error rate in each comparison (comparison-wise error rate).However, the context of experiments and tests can vary, and context affects the logic of the tests. Yet again, statistical terminology can be confusing, and clear definitions are often lacking. Suppose we go back to our Californian frogs, and choose to study samples supplied by a dealer. She assures us that these are random samples from seven different counties: Alpine, Butte, the well-known Calaveras county, Del Norte, El Dorado, Fresno and Humboldt (California lacks a county with the initial G). We measure how far they can jump, and use analysis of variance to assess the possibility that performance may differ, according to origin (Figure 2).Fig. 2.The samples we have obtained, and the test result.Download figureDownload PowerPointThe ANOVA (analysis of variance) test assesses the possibility that all these samples have come from a single population. This is an “omnibus” test, considering all the results together and comparing the variation (and potential differences) between and within all the groups. It's a good name: we load all the sets of data into the omnibus and test them together. Subsequently we may choose to make a “family” of comparisons between the data sets present in the “omnibus”. “Family” is a more difficult statistical concept, and often loosely used, different authors expressing different opinions. Ludbrook suggested “A family of hypotheses is all those actually tested on the results of a single experiment” and also that a family is “all those experimental observations that could be analysed statistically by a global procedure” (such as an omnibus test) (5). Perhaps it's as well to bear in mind that data families, like social ones, can breed trouble.Looking at our results, we're surprised that ANOVA suggests there is no evidence of a difference between the groups. We could have sampled data like this, or even more extreme, about 40% of the time. This can happen: differences can be detected with further tests that are not shown up by an omnibus test. We conducted this study with the suspicion that there could be a difference here, because one group comes from Calaveras county. So we start to compare the groups in pairs. (We ignore more complex possibilities; it's possible that we might want to compare northern counties with southern counties, and so on.) There are 21 ways to conduct simple pairwise comparisons: the family is shown in Figure 3.Fig. 3.Family of pairwise comparisons.Download figureDownload PowerPointHere we have 21 comparisons (the comparison of A vs. B will yield the same result as B vs. A, so this doesn't need a separate comparison), and repeat comparisons alter the overall error rate. Table 1 gives the results in order of P value.Table 1. Adjusting significance levelsOriginal P ValueComparisonCritical P Value0.015C vs. D0.0020.020C vs. H0.0050.059A vs. C0.0070.097C vs. F0.0100.098B vs. C0.0120.119C vs. E0.0140.488D vs. E0.0170.494B vs. D0.0190.502D vs. F0.0210.555E vs. H0.0240.563B vs. H0.0260.572F vs. H0.0290.704A vs. D0.0310.766A vs. E0.0330.782A vs. H0.0360.782A vs. B0.0380.791A vs. F0.0410.913D vs. H0.0430.967E vs. F0.0450.976B vs. E0.0480.991B vs. F0.050Original P values for all the possible comparisons, in order of size, are given in column 1. The comparisons are in the second column. In the third column, the critical P values required have been generated by dividing the originally chosen threshold of 0.05 by the number of comparisons remaining as the column is descended. In no case is the original P value less than the adjusted critical value: we conclude that none of the comparisons is significant.Two of the comparisons in the left-hand column would be “significant” if they had been tested individually. In a single comparison, when we take P = 0.05 as a threshold probability, we know our conclusion could be wrong. Nevertheless we accept this possibility since, in the long run, our decision would only be wrong once out of 20 times. This is the “comparison-wise” error rate, and it is the same as the probability that we set as our threshold for “significance”. In contrast, if we make 21 comparisons, the risk that at least one of these several comparisons could lead to an error increases substantially. The risk of error, in several comparisons, is shown in Figure 4.Fig. 4.The number of pairwise comparisons that can be made (dashed line) increases with the number of groups available. As the number of comparisons increases, the error rate (rate of false positive conclusions) also increases (continuous line).Download figureDownload PowerPointThe likely error in a family of tests increases with each set of data, up to the point where with seven sets of data, there are 21 tests, and the overall risk of error is 0.67. This is the experiment-wise or family-wise error rate. The usual solution proposed to the problem imposed by the multiple tests is to impose a more stringent threshold for “significance”. The advantage is that we are less likely to have false positive classifications. The disadvantage is equally clear: with a more stringent criterion, we will fail to detect occasions where the null hypothesis is not “true”. In other words, false negatives will become more common (Figure 5).Fig. 5.To reduce the experiment-wise false discovery rate, the test criterion can be made more stringent. The result is more false negative findings.Download figureDownload PowerPointIn the case we are considering here, we predict that the Calaveras frogs will be better jumpers, so we conduct a complex comparison between Calaveras versus all the others. This would be an “a priori” test. Some authorities would consider a comparison of this sort to be acceptable with no change to the test criterion. We move into considerations of design, motive and the need to balance the risks of confirming bias, missing interesting or important new information, or making a decision with insufficient evidence. In many instances, scientific papers are brimful of two-way comparisons and we cannot be sure that we are not just being presented with a chance finding that has resulted from a succession of comparisons, as the authors seek for something positive to report.Naturally, many studies present several experiments, for example there may be experiments to show that a gene has been deleted, does not generate RNA, that a receptor protein is absent, that stimulation is ineffective. These are all separate experiments and can be legitimately assessed without adjusting the test criterion. Indeed, a single “a priori” test is a rare event.However, multiple testing can often be avoided. There are sensible steps that can be taken to avoid conducting a plethora of comparisons. One is to combine data into a summary statement or expression. A simple and obvious example might be a dose-response curve (3, 5), or a growth trajectory, where separate groups of data can be summarized into a single relationship. More subtly, this is the principle found in the interaction term in the MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) procedure. However, MANOVA itself is a “multiple” test, since it can yield several F values (each of which represents a test result). Another safeguard to avoid inconsistency is to set a composite hypothesis to avoid contradictory findings: for example both A and B have to be better, or A has to be better and B not worse. (This latter test is a non-inferiority comparison.)A different approach is to use a procedure that does not control the error rate, but concentrates on the rate at which false positive conclusions are likely. These simple procedures use the P values generated by each test, and are particularly useful because the results from different types of tests can be considered together. The primary comparisons are well sustained, even if a lot of additional tests are done (2).Look again at the P values in Table 1. The right-hand column shows more rigorous P value thresholds. The threshold P value chosen for a single test has been divided by the total number of tests. Thus for all 21 comparisons the corrected value should be 0.05/21, which is ∼0.0025. If the corresponding P value in the left-hand column were less than this, then the next larger P value would be compared with a threshold value corrected using N − 1, i.e., 20. This gives a sequence of thresholds in the right-hand column that is progressively more lenient. We find that there are no significant comparisons in our table. The last P value is of course 0.05, but this is far less than the corresponding P value for the 21st comparison, which is 0.99. (This method is a Ryan-Holm stepdown procedure.)If such techniques are not used, then one of the many methods for dealing with multiple comparisons will be required to reduce the impact of an elevated false discovery rate. There are many of these–too many to describe in a short introduction–and there is far from total agreement over which tests are best. Some books suggest that with unplanned comparisons the conclusions should be graded according to differences found, into occasions where the null hypothesis should be retained, be rejected, and into an intermediate group of “not proven” verdicts. Others, more lenient, suggest that if the data are really being “explored” then correction for multiple tests may not be needed, or if there is an “a priori” proposal that particular test need not be corrected, but further tests should be. The most stringent verdict is that all comparisons should be corrected and analysis should be conducted “independent of expectation”. Horton exemplified the pitfalls of raking through the coals of an experiment to find undiscovered treasures (4). The authors of a paper were asked to conduct an unplanned comparison in subgroups of subjects, because the assessors thought there were features of interest. They agreed, on the understanding that the first feature they would analyse was the star sign of the participants, and they showed how this could be statistically interpreted as an important factor in drug response.We have now discovered that our frog dealer was a fraud: all the frogs in our example were sampled randomly from the same population.

When measurements are taken of subjects in separate groups, the variance of the measurements within the group can be compared with the variance that exists between groups. This allows us to estimate the likelihood that groups were drawn from the same population. Commonly, a treatment has been applied to these groups, and the aim would be to find if this had increased the variance between the groups, which might then indicate that the treatment had caused an effect (Figure 1A).Fig. 1.A: analysis of variance is based on comparing variance between the groups, possibly due to a treatment effect, with the variance observed within the groups. It assumes that the groups are drawn at random. B: if groups are selected on the basis of another feature, such as the site where they are found, a fixed effect is introduced that may reduce the variance within the groups. Comparison of variance between groups could then yield an apparently more prominent effect.Download figureDownload PowerPointWe have also discussed how to assess correlation, the tendency of two measurements, taken of the same subject, to vary ‘in the same direction’ (2). This concept can be extended to study the tendency of a particular measurement, made in individuals from a specific (non-random) group, to be less variable than measurements made from a more general population (Figure 1B). This is a common feature, particularly in ecology, where the ability to sample at random may be restricted. However, this feature can be introduced easily and inadvertently into laboratory studies by poor study design or lack of attention to detail. The important effect is that samples are no longer truly random. Individuals in the group could have a particular feature that accounts for their presence in that particular group. This ‘fixed’ (i.e. non-random) factor may affect the results. How this factor could possibly affect the measurements of the group, or even the nature of the factor itself, may not be clear, other than in a prosaic way. For example, we can study only the frogs that we can catch. This fixed factor (catchability) may affect the measurements we are making. It might be that we only catch the ones that can't jump too far, or those that jump towards a flashlight, or those that are awake, or sexually active . . . There are lots of reasons, but we must recognize that a potential fixed factor is at play, which could affect the measurements. Lab experimental samples are often far from random, and may be very restricted, such as studies of genetic modifications.Our group of frogs isn't random. These captive frogs are clustered, affected by the fixed factor: the fact that we have been able to catch them. The frogs in the cluster are more related to each other, and less related to the frog population that remain free. This factor may affect how far they jump. We can estimate how related these frogs are in terms of jumping distance. The method is similar to the way we compare the ‘related-ness’ of pairs of measurements: a correlation. The intra-class correlation indicates how closely these frogs are like each other, in respect of the measurement we are making. If they all jump exactly the same distance, then there is a perfect correlation, and intra-class correlation = 1. If their jumps vary as much as the population as a whole (assuming we can estimate it!), there is no correlation within the cluster measurements, and intra-class correlation = 0.Correlation of features within a group causes problems with many statistical tests. Fixed factors can reduce the within group variation between measurements. If variation is less than would be expected if sampling were truly at random, then we cannot apply tests that assume that the variance results from random sampling. The measurements now contain less variance than would be expected. By taking repeated measures from a sample that is subject to a fixed factor, we may commit pseudoreplication. The term was popularized in a long and idiosyncratic article by the ecologist Hurlbert, which is widely cited, but is far from an easy read (4). The article uses colourful vocabulary to discuss a diverse range of concepts, such as rage between statisticians, original sin at Rothamstead, human sacrifice, pseudo-experiments and pseudo-design. One observation in the paper repeats a familiar theme: ‘Statistics and experimental design are disciplines with an impoverished vocabulary.’ In other words, the specialized, opaque, and non-colloquial use of some of the terms that are used to tackle these important concepts can confuse and bewilder the novice. We shall choose simpler expressions in an attempt to explain the problem, although they may be less exact.What exactly is a replicate? It is literally ‘another version of the same thing’, but in this context, it is a repeated measurement from the same experimental unit. An experimental unit is the smallest part of an experiment or a study that can be subject to a discrete treatment, or has a recognizable fixed factor present. Other similar words for such an element or unit could be a group, nest, cluster, or cell, although all of these words can be used in other ways. A unit is often a group of individuals, such as the group of frogs that we have captured. Replication consists of measuring more than one individual from within an experimental unit which has been given the same treatment, or has been exposed to the same fixed effects, or has been drawn from the same group. Of course, there is likely to be variation in the values we find in replicate measurements. By taking several samples we can obtain a more representative picture of that particular unit as a whole, and this is perfectly legitimate, but we should not assume that the variance (usually gratifyingly small) could be attributed to random sampling.Individual animals, rather than groups, may of course be ‘experimental units’. If we took our captured frogs and randomly divided them into two groups, we could conduct a comparison of two different treatments given to the two randomly selected groups, which both represent the ‘captured frog population’. Each frog would be a ‘unit’ because it had been individually and randomly assigned to a treatment. The variance contributed by each individual would be related to its random origin (from within the group of captured frogs) and the conclusion we drew from our study would be valid, for captured frogs. We might, with reservations, wish to extrapolate the finding to all frogs, but we should do this circumspectly, since the group has not been taken at random.What is pseudoreplication? This error comes from assuming that all the measurements made of elements within the experimental unit have variance that can be attributed to random factors, when in fact some additional factor is present which could alter (usually reduce) this variance, and then taking the data out of this unit, without qualification, and managing them as if they were a random sample. If there is some correlation between the replicate measurements obtained from within an experimental unit, the variance is less than would be expected if the numbers were randomly selected. The practical importance is that the influence of that number of measurements, when used elsewhere, counts for less than we might expect. We have to be more sceptical about their importance, to paraphrase a well-known political saying: ‘well they would show that, wouldn’t they?'If we were interested in the features of the entire frog population of California, we would try to randomly sample from all the frogs in the State. This is probably impossible, and not what usually happens in biological experiments anyway. Suppose rather than sampling randomly, we proposed to take a random sample of counties from within the State, and then sample frogs from these counties. One of those randomly chosen counties happens to be Calaveras. Over the years, several champion jumping frogs have escaped after the annual competition. Their progeny are all pretty good jumpers! In the other counties, the frogs we sample are similarly related genetically to others from the same region. Although the jumping abilities of frogs in each county are quite similar, these can vary from place to place, and very few are up to Calaveras standard (Figure 2). Thus we find that there is an intra-county correlation in jumping abilities in our sampling units (counties).Fig. 2.Samples from three counties showing the effect of a fixed factor: a correction should be applied for comparisons between the groups, to reduce the effect of the reduced within group variation.Download figureDownload PowerPointUsing these samples, we can calculate the average jump distance of frogs from each county. However, we are not justified in comparing the counties by taking all the jump distances of these frogs from each sample as a separate measure. We should correct for the correlation between the replicate measures from each county, to take account of the reduced variation. In practice, we reduce the effect of the number of observations in the calculation. This will reduce the likelihood of concluding that there could be a significant difference. To make this correction, a measure of the intra-class correlation is required, and information from previous studies may be needed. However, careful thought or inspection of the data can indicate if there is a need for correction.Compare two possible experiments. In the first, we wish to see if training affects muscle strength in frogs. We take two samples of 20 frogs at random from Abilene county and train one sample. We measure the muscle strength in the leg muscles of the frogs using a sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius preparation. We reason that if we take two preparations from each frog, we could have a greater chance of finding an effect.Figure 3A shows the results, displaying each sample from each frog, for right and left legs. In Figure 3B, we compare the left leg preparations and the P value is 0.06. On the basis of this finding, we might conclude that training shows no evidence of an effect. When we combine the data from right and left leg preparations we get a P value of 0.003. However, this comparison is based on the premise that the samples are random samples, which is not the case. Pairs of samples have come from each frog. In each frog, the relationship between the strength of the right and left legs varies slightly and randomly. However, the variation is small: much smaller than the variation between the frogs. This can be seen in Figure 3C. When the right and left leg samples are compared with a paired test, there is no evidence of a difference between the strengths. However, there is a strong correlation between the strength of the right and left legs in each frog (Figure 3D).Fig. 3.A: muscle force developed in all samples. Two samples of frogs have been taken, one trained. Two sciatic-gastrocnemius preparations have been made from each frog. B: comparison of control and trained groups using a single sample from each frog, and comparison using two samples from each frog. The second comparison has NOT been corrected for intra-class correlation (relationship between right and left samples). C: comparison of right and left preparations in the control frogs. There is no difference between the paired samples. D: relationship between right and left preparations in the control frogs. There is a strong correlation between the tensions developed between right and left leg muscles.Download figureDownload PowerPointIn fact, this feature could be usefully exploited if we wanted to compare the effects of applying a drug to the preparation. We would have a statistically efficient comparison if we applied the drug to the preparation from one leg, and used the other leg as a control, in each pair of preparations. This is because there is only a small, random, insignificant difference between these preparations before the treatment is applied.Pseudoreplication is a widespread and under-recognized problem in biology (5). In part, this occurs because experimental units (animals, brain slices, cell bodies) can be sparse and expensive, and the impulse to wring results out of the last scrap of data is overwhelming. In addition, there is a desire or perceived obligation to apply tests for statistical significance whenever measurements are reported, even if the logic of significance testing in descriptive studies may be tenuous. Pseudoreplication may be unavoidable. One of the simplest ways to acknowledge and describe the problem is to report test details in full, particularly the sample size, degrees of freedom, and the test statistics.On the other hand, reduced variation may be a distinct advantage in some experiments, because if the ‘noise’ is less, then the signal can be detected more easily. Variation can be reduced by suitable study design. In one of our previous examples, we used the proposal that breeding our frogs reduced the variation in the progeny, and we could then demonstrate an effect that was not shown in the original population. When genetic and familial factors are shared, and if the treatment can be randomized within a group with shared fixed factors, the number of individuals needed to demonstrate an effect can be reduced. Similarly, careful design of studies to assess and attribute variation to different factors can increase power, and reduce the number of subjects needed. Randomization can take into account fixed factors such as species, strain, sex, age, and so on, by using a blocked design in which the sample is first divided in terms of the chosen factors, and the sub-groups are then randomized (3). This process recognizes and exploits shared and distinct features from the total data set.DISCLOSURESNo conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the author(s).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSG.B.D. and S.L.V. conception and design of research; G.B.D. and S.L.V. performed experiments; G.B.D. and S.L.V. analyzed data; G.B.D. and S.L.V. interpreted results of experiments; G.B.D. and S.L.V. prepared figures; G.B.D. and S.L.V. drafted manuscript; G.B.D. and S.L.V. edited and revised manuscript; G.B.D. and S.L.V. approved final version of manuscript.FOOTNOTESThis article is covered by a non-exclusive license between the authors and the Nutrition Society (London, UK) and is being simultaneously published in 2011 in The Journal of Physiology, Experimental Physiology, British Journal of Pharmacology, Advances in Physiology Education, Microcirculation, and Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology as part of a collaborative initiative among the societies that represent these journals.REFERENCES1.

    "abstract": "A shift is currently taking place in which explicit connections between content are being emphasized. Biology is not an isolated discipline, yet undergraduate courses frequently focus on discrete knowledge. Students often engage in rote learning, struggle with transforming and applying content. Integrative thinking occurs when students recognize connections to content. Written reflections provide students with the opportunity to demonstrate this thinking. We transformed student-written reflections into concept webs to gain insights into how students connect biological concepts. We were interested in determining if characteristics of integrative thinking develop through reflections. The results indicate a significant relationship between concepts and integrated relationships. Integrative thinking varied but declined overall. Concept webs allow for an examination of student integrative thinking through the transformation of reflection and provide insights into the connections and relationships that students draw between biological concepts. Reflections can transform learning by facilitating and allowing for the evaluation of integrative thinking.",

There is a whole class of physiological topics, represented here by the neural generation of respiratory rhythm, that are best taught using \"dynamic diagrams,\" a series of diagrams generated through simple animations and based on user-provided inputs. The theory of neural generation of respiratory rhythm discussed here is not necessarily correct or widely read accepted. It continues to find a place, however, in some of the most widely read textbooks of physiology, which obligates the teacher to devise effective methods of putting it across to the students. Selected criteria can be defined for identifying areas in which dynamic diagrams would be effective as a teaching tool. Unlike those animations that are used to provide a debatable alternative to wet laboratory, dynamic diagrams explaining certain theoretical concepts should have few rivals.",

In addition to regular course work, each of the 24 students spent 12 hours shadowing and assisting staff at Sturdy Memorial Hospital, Attleboro, MA, with 4 hours in the emergency room and 8 hours in two other departments. Every student kept a log of his or her observations, reactions, and learning in the field and wrote a paper on a pathophysiological condition encountered in the hospital. To compare and contrast the real hospital experience with a fictional one, the students also studied patients from the television show ER. Each week in lab, two students showed a short videotape of one particular patient and discussed the diagnosis, symptoms, treatments, and surgical procedures involved. Questionnaire evaluations indicated that this program is effective in helping students learn more physiology and exposing them to community service. Health workers and patients also agreed that providing social support to patients while shadowing and assisting hospital staff was a valuable service.",

ST knowledge of students was evaluated before, immediately after, and 15 days after interventions. Additionally, students completed a questionnaire about their perception of teaching-learning methods used in physiology classes and their self-perception of engagement in the physiology content. The CT groups improved their ST knowledge score from pretest to immediate (P < 0.0001 for all groups) and late posttest (P < 0.0001 for all groups). 3Dsp groups also enhanced their score from pretest to immediate (P = 0.029 for public university students; P < 0.0001 for private university students) and late posttest (P < 0.0001 for all groups). We also observed improvement from the immediate to late posttest in the 3Dsp group from private universities (P < 0.001). Both private groups performed better in general ST and specific electrical synapse questions in the pretest and immediate posttest compared to the public CT group (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).

In this research, we have designed and assessed the effectiveness of the \"Zoom-sandwiched cross-chapter concept map\" model in an online biology course. The model has optimized the concept map project because it incorporates synchronous interaction as well as asynchronous communication among students, assigns required meetings with flexible schedules, endows students with intrinsic motivation, and is facilitated by indirect instructor intervention. Our results showed improved student skills in constructing the cross-chapter concept map and positive student perceptions of the model. In addition, this study provided an in-depth analysis of how students benefit from cross-chapter concept maps. Our findings could guide educators on how to optimize the concept map project and utilize concept maps effectively to overcome some primary learning challenges and enhance student learning in online education, especially in STEM fields.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research aims to optimize the concept map project for STEM courses in the virtual delivery system and to explore its effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Why are my students not paying attention in class? Why are they not engaged? What am I doing wrong? These are questions that even seasoned faculty pose in moments of self-reflection. Although it is good practice for educators to continually evaluate their presentations for areas of improvement, it is unfortunately also true that questions of why students lack attention or engagement in class are often raised by school administrators as subtle implications of failure on the part of faculty. But why is it so hard for our students to pay attention? Why is it that students' focus can so easily ebb away during a class? Why are my students seemingly indifferent to the presented material? To address these issues, and to provide solutions that can be incorporated easily into class preparation and presentation, it is important to define precisely what we mean by attention and engagement. Are they the same thing, and if not, how do they differ? To what extent is the student responsible for acquiring and applying the material presented? Ultimately, of course, the student is accountable for learning the material and passing exams, but there are practices that we as educators often employ that erect hurdles and barriers to student learning, that can make the process significantly harder than it needs to be.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although many articles and books exist describing various classroom strategies to increase student engagement, often advice to newer faculty is given as prescriptive ways to organize a class or to repeat what was given by the last person who presented the material. Yet irrespective of the structure of the class or learning environment, there are subtle hurdles that many faculty erect that hinder a student's progress. This Personal View discusses some of the potential barriers educators put up that deter effective student learning and, importantly, offers advice on how those barriers can be dismantled.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity rates continue to rise and appear unlikely to abate. While physical activity (PA) is an important contributor to health and successful weight maintenance, exercise science and health students (ESHS) often endorse negative weight status biases that could undermine PA promotion. This experiential learning activity was intended to help foster weight status understanding among ESHS. Nine ESHS completed the learning activity across two 75-minute class periods. During the initial didactic lesson, the instructor presented on psychophysiological responses to PA among normal and overweight individuals. During the second simulation lesson, the students first responded with their predictions of how the experience of four common physical activities, including shoe tying, brisk walking, running, and climbing and descending stairs, could differ with additional body mass. Next, students twice completed each of the four physical activities while first wearing a weighted vest that simulated 16 lb followed by 32 lb of additional mass. At the beginning, middle, and end of the stair climb and descent, the students provided ratings of affective valence (i.e., pleasure-displeasure). Following the PA simulations, the students wrote about their experiences and how their PA promotion strategies could be modified for overweight clients. The changes in student qualitative responses, particularly following the 32-lb simulations, suggested an increased understanding of the psychophysiological experience of PA while carrying additional mass. Learning activities like this one may be meaningful additions to ESHS curricula aiming to mitigate weight status bias and improve PA promotion among overweight clients.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Exercise science and health students (ESHS) often enter the field with the noble intention to help people become more physically active. However, many ESHS endorse negative weight status biases that could undermine health promotion efforts among overweight individuals. Experiential learning simulations that approximate the experiences of physical activity while overweight may be helpful tools to foster understanding and reduce bias. This article outlines a two-part didactic/simulation learning activity to promote weight status understanding among ESHS.",

It has recently gained relevance as a biomarker to assess the neurotoxicity of environmental substances. Its practicability in the laboratory makes it an excellent pedagogical tool for promoting students' inquiry skills. However, the time and cost of materials and facilities limit their usage in undergraduate laboratories. This study presents the design of a computer-based educational module called ZebraSTMe, which is based on a tail coiling assay and aims to improve science process skills in undergraduate students by connecting them to relevant and novel content. We evaluate students' perception of learning, the quality of materials used, and the knowledge gained. Our results show that students perceived an improvement in their statistical analysis, representation, and discussion of experimental data. Additionally, the students evaluated the quality and ease of use of the materials and provided feedback for revision. A thematic analysis of the opinions revealed that the module activities promoted students' reflection on their professional strengths and weaknesses.NEW & NOTEWORTHY ZebraSTMe is a novel computer-based educational module that utilizes spontaneous tail coiling analysis in zebrafish embryos to enhance undergraduate students' scientific inquiry skills. By addressing the challenges of time, cost, and laboratory resources, the module improves students' science process skills and promotes reflection on their professional strengths and weaknesses.

However, the effectiveness of online classes as an educational strategy has been questioned by medical educators and students. In a prospective observational study design, students enrolled in a renal physiology and pathophysiology course were exposed to either face-to-face or remote synchronous classes. Students taught online obtained significantly higher mean scores than the group who had in-person classes, both groups assessed with identical exams. Appropriate screening tests suggested that fraud is unlikely to have significantly influenced these results and that the observed differences in performance reflected increased learning by the remote group. These observations suggest that online classes can help to maintain the continuity of physiology and pathophysiology courses during periods of social isolation and may contribute to improving learning under normal conditions.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we were able to make a rare direct comparison of face-to-face and remote strategies for the teaching of undergraduate medical students in a specific area, namely, renal pathophysiology.

    "abstract": "Communication skills are fundamental in healthcare, but assessing them among medical students presents challenges. In the Indian context, the lack of a specific assessment tool further compounds the issue. Thus this study aimed to develop and validate an observation-based communication skills checklist tailored to Phase I Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) students. The checklist was developed using both inductive and deductive approaches and underwent rigorous testing to ensure its reliability and validity. After piloting, the finalized version was administered to 84 Phase I MBBS students. Results indicated a critical content validity ratio of 0.78, face validity of 0.80, and an impressive Cronbach's alpha of 0.91, indicating good internal consistency and reliability of the checklist. The students scored over 80% in all checklist domains, except for empathy (73%) and support (74%), highlighting areas for potential improvement. Nonetheless, about 75% of students expressed satisfaction with the checklist's communication skills assessment. The feedback from faculty members was positive, as they found the checklist was easy to use, quick, and effective for evaluating communication skills. Consequently, the checklist's introduction has been well received by both students and faculty. In conclusion, the developed checklist proves to be an effective and valid instrument for assessing communication skills in Phase I MBBS students. By integrating this tool into observed station clinical examinations, medical educators can comprehensively evaluate students' communication behaviors. Moreover, the checklist serves as a valuable resource for bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, enabling future physicians to excel in doctor-patient interactions, a crucial aspect of patient-centered care.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article presents a highly unique and novel approach by introducing a structured checklist for communication skill assessment in medical students. Its rigorous validation process ensures reliability and effectiveness, while its adaptation to sociocultural norms highlights its relevance and applicability. The user-friendly design with a single-page layout and dichotomous scale further enhances its practicality in objective structured clinical examinations. The developed checklist equips educators with a valuable resource to assess and improve students' communication abilities.",

    "abstract": "The development of science writing and presentation skills is necessary for a successful science career. Too often these skills are not included in pre- or postsecondary science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, leading to a disconnect between high schoolers' expectations for college preparedness and the skills needed to succeed in college. The Young Scientist Program Summer Focus recruits high school students from historically marginalized backgrounds to participate in 8-week summer internships at Washington University in St. Louis. Students conduct hands-on biomedical research projects under the mentorship of Washington University scientists (graduate students, postdoctorates, lab staff). Here, we present the curriculum for a science communication course that accompanies this early research experience. The course is designed to strengthen students' communication skills (critical reading, writing, presenting, and peer review) through a combination of weekly lectures and active learning methods. It prepares students for the capstone of their summer internship: writing a scientific paper and presenting their results at a closing symposium. We administered pre- and postprogram surveys to four Summer Focus cohorts to determine whether the course met its learning objectives. We found significant improvements in students' self-confidence in reading, interpreting, and communicating scientific data. Thus, this course provides a successful model for introducing science literacy and communication skills that are necessary for any career in STEM. We provide a detailed outline of the course structure and content so that this training can be incorporated into any undergraduate and graduate research programs.",

    "abstract": "A 3-year study (2017-2019) was conducted to obtain the views of nonmajor undergraduate students about discussions in learning physiology. The teaching methods used were lecture only (lecture), group discussion alone (discussion), and a combination of lecture and discussion (lecture + discussion). Students were assigned homework in a textbook, and they did not have access to textbook/notes during discussions. Under these conditions, 58% of students indicated that they learned best with lecture + discussion strategy, compared with 49% for lecture and 18% for discussion approaches. Remarkably, 61% of students said the discussion did not enhance learning; by comparison, 35% and 14% had the same views about lecture and lecture + discussion, respectively. Furthermore, if given the opportunity to choose a teaching/learning environment, 66% of students would select lecture + discussion, 33% would pick lecture, and only 6% would choose discussion setting. As many as 77% of students would reject the discussion setting if given the choice. The opinions of students were similar irrespective of their expected grades (whether A, B, or C); however, greater proportions of B or C students disliked discussion than A students. Thus, whereas 63% of A students disliked discussion, 81% of B students and 83% of C students disliked it. Also, 64% of students indicated that they would have been poorly prepared for classes without assigned homework. Essential outcomes of this study include undergraduates viewed the lecture + discussion setting as a supportive/desirable environment for learning physiology, and they consistently rated the lecture method higher than the discussion-only approach. Students did not relish learning physiology in a discussion-only setting. These findings may help in establishing teaching/learning environments from the student's perspective.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This article reports perspectives of nonmajor undergraduates about group discussions in learning physiology. Three teaching methods were used: traditional lecture alone (lecture), discussion alone (discussion), and combined lecture and discussion (lecture + discussion). Students rated lecture + discussion setting as the most conducive for learning. The rank order of student preference for learning environment was, first, lecture + discussion; second, lecture; and third, discussion. These opinions were similar irrespective of expected grades in the course. Enjoyment of the teaching/learning process and environment is important to students.",

A native of England, Hoyle studied under Bernard Katz in London before earning his D.Sc. in neurophysiology from the University of Glasgow. He immigrated to the United States in the mid-1950s and worked with C.A.G. Wiersma at Caltech, with whom he shared a love for crustacean neuromuscular physiology. Hoyle accepted a position at the University of Oregon in 1961 and remained there as a professor until his death in 1985 at the age of 61. Hoyle was active scientifically at a time when the basics of muscle biology were still being discovered. He made many important contributions to the field of neuromuscular physiology, particularly in the realm of comparative physiology. Hoyle was passionate about the importance of a comparative approach in physiology and emphasized that \"as a comparative physiologist, I value knowledge of the diverse forms not only for its own sake, but also because it embodies the general truth.\" Perhaps Hoyle's most lasting legacy is embodied in the many students and postdocs who trained with him early in their careers. Many of these young scientists went on to build prominent careers and trained numerous students of their own. In addition to offering an overview of Hoyle's career, this article revisits some of Hoyle's central contributions to muscle biology and assesses them in light of our current understanding of muscle structure and function.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Graham Hoyle was an important neuroscientist, muscle biologist, and zoologist throughout much of the second half of the twentieth century.

    "abstract": "Clinical practice has benefited from new methodologies such as realistic simulation (RS). RS involves recreating lifelike scenarios to more accurately reflect real clinical practice, enhancing learners' skills and decision-making within controlled environments, experiencing remarkable growth in medical education. However, RS requires substantial financial investments and infrastructure. Hence, it is essential to determine the effectiveness of RS in the development of skills among medical students, which will improve the allocation of resources while optimizing learning. This cross-sectional study was carried out in the simulation laboratory of a medical school and the performance of students who underwent two different curriculum matrices (without RS and with RS, from 2021 to 2022) in the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) course was compared. This test was chosen considering that the competencies involved in cardiac life support are essential, regardless of the medical specialty and ACLS is a set of life-saving protocols used worldwide. We observed that RS impact can be different for practical abilities when compared with the theoretical ones. There was no correlation between the general academic performance and students' grades reflecting the RS impacts. We conclude that RS leads to less remediation and increased competence in practical skills. RS is an important learning strategy that allows repeating, reviewing, and discussing clinical practices without exposing the patient to risks.",

In this study, the wet spirometer has been modified to investigate the fundamental laws of flow and different types of lung disease. This modification was achieved by changing the dimensions of the device, printing a scale on the bell, and attaching an airflow control system (ACS) between the corrugated tube and hollow tube of the inner cylinder. The ACS allowed for flow control during the exercises. Two exercises were performed: Exercise I compared the parameters measured by the wet spirometer, modified spirometer, and computerized spirometer to determine the suitability of the modification, while Exercise II tested the variables affecting flow. These exercises introduce students to data collection, analysis, and the use of statistical tests as they compare various spirometers. Additionally, students gain valuable experience in experimental design by conducting diverse experiments that investigate factors influencing flow dynamics. By plotting the results and participating in small group discussion (SGD), students can apply flow principles in respiratory and circulatory system, offering a hands-on experience that integrates physics and physiology.

A graphic analysis of glucose homeostasis was constructed by considering the main factors that influence glucose dynamics. The analysis is achieved by equating curves representing both the inflow and outflow of glucose from the circulation as dependent upon the serum insulin concentration. The point where these two curves intersect is the steady-state balance for blood glucose exchange and is termed the equilibrium point. With the use of this graphic depiction of glucose homeostasis, it is now possible to study the influence of multiple factors on glucose dynamics. A variety of metabolic states can also be analyzed by reconstructing the effects of the pathophysiology on the form and shape of the curves. Some of the metabolic states that have been analyzed by this technique include starvation, exercise, obesity, type I and type II diabetes mellitus, stress, hypopituitarism, hyperpituitarism, and hyperthyroidism. Although the analyses do not reflect all of the controversial nuances of the field, they do provide a means for a general approach to the study of glucose homeostasis and serve as a methodology that can be extrapolated to many areas of physiological study.",

    "abstract": "Academic physiologists in universities have three jobs: teaching, research, and service. They also operate at many levels of education: undergraduate, graduate, and medical. Each level carries special problems and special rewards. It is argued in this paper that teachers should be facilitators in learning no matter what level or what aspect of the job. If physiologists behave as facilitators of learning at all levels, then they will be able to help undergraduates by the most appropriate choice of textbooks and handbooks; to develop case histories, scenarios, and summaries; and to show students how physiology got to where it is, developing in the students a healthy concept of skepticism. This can be expanded when the students are graduate students and the teacher acts as an advisor and is still facilitating the students' learning.",

    "abstract": "A unique clinical correlation in gastroenterology for first-year medical students is described. This interactive demonstration is conducted in a clinical setting and is designed to introduce the student to a broad range of topics in clinical gastroenterology while complementing lecture material in gastrointestinal (GI) physiology. Faculty and fellows of the Department of Internal Medicine at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center present minilectures and demonstrations at five different stations held in endoscopy rooms of the GI Diagnostic Center (GI Lab). The first-year class is divided into groups of 20 students or less. Each group visits a given station for 30 min, and each station has a specific topic. The topics are motility studies, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, gastric analysis, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. At each station, physicians pose clinical questions related to the students' understanding of GI physiology and, in turn, respond to students' questions. For students who have been learning basic concepts of GI physiology, this clinical demonstration offers a more meaningful clinical correlation than standard clinical lectures could afford. In addition, the demonstration brings enhanced interest and enthusiasm for the subject matter.",

Students can change parameters such as metabolic rate, blood hemoglobin concentration, barometric pressure, air composition, etc., and study parameter effects on blood gas concentrations and partial pressures. An important feature of the model program is that there are no negative feedback controls to maintain homeostasis. However, after a perturbation has been introduced, adjustments can be made to appropriate variables to correct for abnormal effects. For example, ventilation rate and blood hemoglobin concentration might be adjusted to compensate for low atmospheric oxygen. Because these do not change automatically in the model program, learning is enhanced when the student has to make the appropriate adjustments needed to correct disturbances in the blood gases that follow a perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Developing a curriculum that integrates laboratory, field, and nonlaboratory experiences requires solid planning, cooperation, and compromise among the faculty members in a department. This is especially true for laboratory experiences where basic skills and familiarity with the different groups of plants and animals carry over to upper-division courses. In an introductory Principles of Biology laboratory, for example, exercises can be designed to give students a clear idea of a statistical distribution and the consequences of random molecular motion. Both concepts are used in nearly all upper-division courses to some extent. Some important but \"mechanical\" features of courses within a curriculum, such as adopting within the department a single format for writing a scientific paper, will go a long way in tying together different laboratory experiences. Other similar but simpler ideas are to develop appendexes to laboratory exercises that can be used in introductory and upper-division courses, e.g., how to do dilutions, the use of SI units, etc. The latter may be a good way to stimulate departments to think more carefully about continuity and consistency in the design of the overall curriculum. Continuity of instruction from lower-division to upper-division courses and among upper-division courses requires communication between instructors at all levels.",

This course served the community by contributing to the continuing education efforts of teachers and concurrently enhanced our recruitment program by advertising \"physiology\" to teachers who will influence college-bound students for years to come. In addition, we established ties between teachers and physiology faculty such that continuing interactions (e.g., collaborative research during the summer) should be facilitated. The success of the course suggests that this is an effective way to serve local communities, enhance efforts to recruit graduate students into the basic sciences, and at the same time help reverse the educational crisis in the US by bolstering the backgrounds of secondary school teachers.",

Students who have completed typical medical school preparatory programs, however, have been poorly equipped to embark on serious graduate study in physiology. Because undergraduate education in the sciences is typically structured as narrowly defined, disjointed degree programs in separate disciplines, students of biology have had only limited access to the resources of physical science departments. Attempts by physiology faculty to remedy specific deficiencies on a piecemeal basis have been found to be both time consuming and ineffective. We describe an intensive one-semester course as an alternative. Maintaining high levels of generality and concentrating on the development of physical insight were possible only when the mathematical foundation attained by the students was adequate. Although physiological applications were stressed throughout, extended examination of complex problems was limited to a few examples of particular interest. Emphasis was placed on rigor and sophistication rather than proficiency and detail.",

Students performed respiratory, cardiovascular, temperature regulation, energy expenditure, oxygen uptake, and exercise modules. During most modules, the students made measurements at rest and during the performance of exercise at different intensities. The students were very involved and engaged in problem solving throughout the session. The program was given for 10 days to more than 500 students representing 18 classes from 10 different schools. Evaluations indicated that the program was a real-life science experience that gave the students a new understanding of how their bodies worked and the purpose of exercise.

    "abstract": "Students are challenged in transitioning from acquiring knowledge and understanding through reading textbooks to their learning to select, read, evaluate, and synthesize the primary literature. A customary approach to teaching this transition to beginning graduate students is for a faculty member to assign \"readings\" from the recent literature that promise to become key publications; such assignments generally underscore recent, novel scientific content. We advocate here an alternative approach for coaching students very early in their training: first, to read, analyze, and discuss a paper that highlights critically important features of effective and valid experimental design; and, second, to study a paper that can be shown historically to have fundamentally changed the way in which physiological function is understood. We consider as an example of the first goal a study that purports to demonstrate a principle of thermoregulation, but that interaction between students and instructor reveals the study's lack of an essential control. The second goal requires sufficient time for the publication to concretely validate its contribution(s). The purpose is to identify those essential properties of the selected paper that contributed to its having become a truly exemplary study. We present a 1957 paper by Dr. A. C.

    "abstract": "Twenty-eight undergraduate students in a health sciences program volunteered for an exercise in the history of examinations. They had completed a second-year course in anatomy and physiology in which they studied modern texts and took standard contemporary exams. For this historical \"experiment,\" students studied selected chapters from two 19th century physiology texts (by Foster M. A Textbook of Physiology, 1895; and Broussais FJV. A Treatise on Physiology Applied to Pathology, 1828). They then took a 1-h-long exam in which they answered two essay-type questions set by Thomas Henry Huxley for second-year medical students at the University of London in 1853 and 1857. These were selected from a question bank provided by Dr. P. Mazumdar (University of Toronto). A questionnaire probed their contrasting experiences. Many wrote thoughtful, reflective comments on the exercise, which not only gave them an insight into the difficulties faced by students in the past, but also proved to be a valuable learning experience (average score: 8.6 ± 1.6 SD).",

    "abstract": "Many complex physiological processes can be introduced and explored using the framework of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), including neurotransmitter release, membrane depolarization, and ion channel activity. While traditionally used instructional tools such as static complex drawings are useful, these images can be incomplete physiological representations due to the lack of physically moving parts. As a result, they often misrepresent the complexity of physiological phenomena to students. We describe an effort to create a more accurate, dynamic representation of the NMJ to enhance instruction in an undergraduate anatomy and physiology course. We sought to create a unique and memorable moving diagram that combines elements of static images with moving parts. To evaluate the impact of the dynamic model, students were asked about their understanding of the NMJ before and after exposure to the model. In addition, students were asked for attitudinal responses to the model and their preferred method of instruction. Analysis of student responses indicated that students enjoyed the model, although they also had concerns about the speed of the simulated ion movement being too fast. The model has also served as an informal science education art installation in presentations for prospective students, stakeholders in the broader community, including local and statewide politicians, the University president and board of trustees, donors, and other regional economic and educational leaders.",

    "abstract": "Reflective narrative writing on unfolding ethics case vignettes has the potential to promote values like empathy among medical students, which will prove useful in their future. The objective of this study was to explore the scope of guided reflective narratives on unfolding ethics case vignettes integrated into physiology teaching to promote empathy among first-year medical students. First-year medical students (n = 150) were presented with unfolding case vignettes exploring ethical issues, as part of their physiology curriculum, with questions and prompts for a guided reflective narrative. Feedback about the program was obtained through a semistructured questionnaire. The contents of the students' reflective narratives and feedback were analyzed. The narratives revealed that students empathized with the various individuals involved in medical treatment and research, which was also reflected in student feedback (n = 116; 79%) and high Likert scale scores (74%). The program was considered effective by students in broadening their perspective and promoting critical thinking (n = 129; 88%). Through analysis of reflections, a rubric that would enable the evaluation of students' empathy on a scale of increasing ability to look at a situation from another's point of view emerged. This rubric could be used to quantitatively assess the impact of similar programs. Although divided in their individual opinions, the study population was able to relate to all individuals involved in medical practice and research, recognizing the need for fair and ethical practices. The content analysis led to the development of a rubric to grade empathy.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Unfolding case vignettes exploring ethical issues were introduced into the physiology curriculum of first-year medical students. The effectiveness of guided reflections following the case vignettes was explored. The analysis of the reflections and feedback on the program revealed that students became more empathetic. The reflections broadened their perspective and encouraged critical thinking. The analysis led to development of a rubric to grade the level of empathy, which can be used for quantitative assessment of empathy.",

    "abstract": "Difficulty index and its derivative performance index (PFI) have been commonly used to measure student learning outcomes. However, these indexes have a high volatility and low sensitivity. This work has established the simplex learning index (SLI), which has a low volatility and high sensitivity. To construct SLI, students were divided into two groups based on their scores on the whole quiz. The item SLI and lecture SLI were derived from the results of students in the high-scoring group. Exam results from nine cohorts of medical students in two phases of learning were analyzed. The volatility, measured by the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean, was >65% lower in SLI than in PFI. Using the lecture SLI as a metric, one lecture B22 (Metabolism of Amino Acids), was identified that had an average SLI of 0.66 in earlier four student cohorts in phase 1 learning. Two major changes were made on the lecture, lecture organization and the delivery method, in phase 2. Students from recent five cohorts in phase 2 had an average SLI of 0.84, which was 26.6% higher than that in phase 1 (P < 0.02). In contrast, when PFI was used, the change was only 13.46% and insignificant (P = 0.29). In the same period, implementation of the same delivery method did not yield significant changes in learning outcomes in lecture B24 (Metabolism of Nucleotides). Taken together, this work shows that SLI is a better indicator for learning outcomes and suggests that lecture reorganization is the key to improved student learning.",

The comprehension of basic concepts, such as chemical hormone classification, is essential to understand the differences in synthesis, secretion, transport, and mechanism of action of hormones. To assist the students on this subject, we developed an analogy between the basic concepts of hormone synthesis, transport, and mechanism of action and a bank robbery as a first approach to engage and stimulate their learning process. In the analogy, the students are asked to help identify and characterize two bank robbery crews based on a set of evidence collected by the police. The goal is to identify the general profile of lipid- and water-soluble hormones synthesis, transport, and mechanism of action on target cells. When applying the activity, the students showed a great deal of interest in solving the crime and they seemed to understand the similarities between the analogy and the subject.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Two endocrine bank robbery crews are being searched by the police.

    "abstract": "Increasingly, the curricula of many clinical programs have been restructured to an integrated model in which foundational sciences such as physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology are taught side by side with clinical reasoning. Case studies are an excellent pedagogical strategy for enhancing such integration, especially if such cases are authentic, that is, they include a broad range of information that could influence the individualization and optimization of patient care. However, authentic cases may be too advanced and thereby dissuade preclinical students. We offered an optional semester-long authentic pharmacotherapy case study to undergraduate students in an introductory pharmacology class in a liberal arts college in the United States Midwest and sought to know what might motivate students to complete this challenging task. Connection with and relevance of the case study were assessed with an anonymous survey. Open-ended questions were analyzed qualitatively. Exploratory factor analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling were employed to investigate underlying commonalities and patterns in the motivations for participating in and relating to the case study. Students were motivated more by the perceived relevance and transferability of knowledge acquired to their future career than by their current clinical technician jobs or their personal lives. Rather than causing an information overload and dissuading students, this complex pharmacotherapy case assignment harnessed preclinical students' experiences from cognate cocurricular activities, created numerous points of relevant engagement with instructional content, and therefore motivated students to deeper learning.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Early introduction to clinical reasoning is widely advocated. Case studies are frequently used to enhance integration of foundational sciences with clinical reasoning. Preclinical students may be overwhelmed by complex cases because of the higher-order cognitive tasks involved. We find that complex cases permit connection with students' own experiences and aspirations. These preclinical students were motivated to engage in such challenging academic work because of the perceived transferability of knowledge to their future careers.",

    "abstract": "The authentic teaching and learning approach introduces real-world scenarios into the classroom to better engage Generation Z students. Considering this, we introduced an authentic learning practical exercise (breakfast meal and glycemic variation) to undergraduate biology students at the University of La Réunion (France). Here, students were initially briefed regarding the practical and subsequently determined their baseline glucose values (glucometer). They then consumed 200 mL of fruit juice together with a pain au chocolat (chocolate pastry) and subsequently recorded their glucose values at regular intervals. The last reading was done after 150 min, and they thereafter plotted such data to reveal temporal glycemic variations. During this time, the students also worked on a report to document information collected and began to supply responses to several listed questions. Three weeks after completion of the practical, we evaluated whether this intervention would lead to changes in their views regarding the nature and regularity of breakfast meal intake (employing survey questions). Our findings show that a reasonable proportion of the students indicated that the intervention did change their dietary habits, with 50% sometimes opting for an improved breakfast, whereas 10% also changed their habits albeit for only a small while. Of note, >60% of students indicated that they changed their breakfast intake habits by the end of the endocrinology module. These findings show that the beneficial effects of authentic teaching approaches may elicit relatively long-lasting changes in terms of breakfast behavioral patterns in young people and that such effects may also impact the broader society.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study introduced an authentic learning exercise (endocrinology practical exercise) to undergraduate biology students and ascertained whether it changed their views regarding the nature and regularity of breakfast meals.

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether a significant relationship exists between a student's college (Allied Health, Arts and Science, Education, and Graduate School) and achievement in an advanced-level course in human physiology (PGY 412G). The mean percentage of correct answers on four multiple-choice tests, collectively totaling 400 points, was used to assess each student's performance. A four (college)-by-three (academic year) analysis of variance was used for statistical comparisons among 660 students enrolled in PGY 412G from the fall semester of 1995 through the spring semester of 1998. Subsequent pairwise comparisons tests found that the College of Education students had a significantly lower mean percentage of correct answers (61%) compared with students in each of the other colleges (P < 0.001). No significant differences in percentage scores were found among students enrolled in Allied Health (78%), Arts and Science (78%), or the Graduate School (77%). Also, percentages of correct answers averaged across all students were significantly lower during the 1997-1998 academic year than those in either the 1996-1997 year (P < 0.001) or the 1995-1996 year (P < 0.05). Students' scores during these two earlier years did not differ significantly. Upward letter grade adjustments based on class distributions were made each semester, and more As and Bs and fewer Cs and Ds were given as course grades than expected from an absolute assessment scale. This grade inflation benefited low-scoring students from all colleges, particularly those students enrolled in the College of Education. To improve the understanding of human function of these low-scoring students may require special educational programs.",

    "abstract": "Two surveys were conducted between 1994 and 1996. The purpose of the initial survey was to obtain demographic information about prebaccaulareate human physiology courses. Of the 117 responding physiology departments, 50% offered human physiology at the prebaccalaureate level to 14,185 students during the 1994-1995 academic year. The mean was 245 students per year (+/- 30 SE). Class size was limited by 44% of the respondents. Prebaccaluareate human physiology was offered as a separate course from anatomy by 93% of the departments. Sixty-one percent scheduled the course once a year. The purpose of the second survey was to determine how physiology departments evaluated prebaccalaureate physiology courses and faculty. All responding departments utilized student feedback; 38% of the departments included physiology chair review, 38% peer review, and 9% allied health faculty review. Twenty-eight percent of allied health programs evaluated the course. Results indicated that, whereas a significant number of undergraduate students are enrolled in prebaccaluareate physiology courses annually, those courses appear to lack formal, consistent formative evaluation.",

The exercise further offers an opportunity to closely observe an experimental preparation commonly used to study the pulmonary circulation and allows students the opportunity to interpret the resulting physiological data. Student evaluations indicate that the demonstration was received with enthusiasm and provides an effective teaching tool for reinforcing concepts in pulmonary vascular physiology.",

For hygienic reasons we used a bag-in-the-box system to dilute helium within alveolar space by performing the single-breath method. Although each participant independently underwent only one single-breath maneuver, we gained a reliable relationship between residual volume and subjects' height and body weight in 68 female (r = 0.6, P < 0.0001) and 99 male (r = 0.42, P < 0.0001) students. From this successful outcome and with the opportunity to discuss the limitations of the single-breath method as well, we inferred that this experiment affords a transparent and instructive approach to interpreting the determination of lung volumes on the basis of the indicator-dilution technique.",

Often animal experiments have been replaced by computer simulations, but a simulation is only as good as the model or algorithm on which it is based and can never contain the depth of information or unpredictability displayed by real animals or patients. We used a computer-based system to collect cardiovascular data from patients instrumented for cardiac surgery, allowing students to \"replay\" an operation. These recordings were annotated with notes, diagrams and video clips, and a student workbook was written. The resulting package contained a wealth of physiological data and was perceived by students to be very clinically relevant. The very wealth of information, however, tended to overwhelm students, and so a series of introductory Computer tutorials were written to provide students with the background necessary to cope with the clinical data.",

The process of oncogenesis is conceptually important for physicians, both for clinical reasons, and for their engagement in oncological research. However, these reviews are written for specialists in the field, which presents barriers for novice learners. Therefore, to allow students, and also clinicians external to the oncological field, to access this valuable framework for understanding oncogenesis, we have created a condensed summary of the original reviews. Our institutions use a “flipped” approach to the large-group components of our preclinical education. We have successfully used our Hallmarks of Cancer summary as the prework for sessions on oncogenesis for five years at one institution, and nine years at the other, typically at the end of cancer blocks within integrated, multidisciplinary courses. We report here survey results indicating learners strongly appreciate the summary as both preparation material for participation in relevant flipped classroom sessions, and as a general review of oncogenesis. This condensed summary of the original Hallmarks of Cancer reviews makes many of the key concepts of oncogenesis available to medical students in their preclinical years, as well as to physicians outside the field of oncology.",

Developmental physiology is one of these disciplines that can describe the origins of life at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal level. However, organismal development is a continual process that transcends conception and progresses throughout the lifetime of an organism. In this Illumination, we discuss opportunities that secondary-level life science educators have when teaching developmental physiology through an agricultural lens. Specifically, we propose teaching about the origins of meat and milk, as a nontraditional approach for introducing developmental physiology to students. To justify this notion, we explore how novel research in livestock production focuses on meeting food demands imposed by our growing global population. In addition, we link these concepts to commonly employed standards in secondary-level science classrooms across the United States. In conclusion, the science of livestock production provides a window of opportunity for secondary-level physiology instructors to teach developmental physiology in a form that can readily adhere to institutionally employed standards.",

However, in subjects that involve relevant physical quantities, even students who successfully pass exams may be unable to realize the actual quantities involved. For example, students may know what the values of the aortic diameter and cardiac output are, and they may be skilled at calculating changes in variables without being able to realize the actual physical magnitudes of the variables, resulting in limited understanding. To address this problem, here we describe and discuss simple practical exercises specifically designed to allow students to multisensory experience (touch, see, hear) the actual physical magnitudes of aortic diameter and cardiac output in adult humans at rest and exercise. The results obtained and the feedback from a student survey both clearly show that the described approach is a simple and interesting tool for motivating students and providing them with more realistic learning.",

Despite this NIGMS requirement, and the many career-related benefits associated with mentoring, few tools exist for purposes of rigorously evaluating COBRE and INBRE mentoring programs. The purpose of this project was to develop a mentoring assessment tool to aid in the evaluation of COBRE and INBRE mentoring programs. In study 1, a list of items comprising the tool was created via a multiphase item generation process based on input received from subject matter experts within the Cognitive and Neurobiological Approaches to Plasticity Center. In study 2, feedback about this tool was solicited from 78 grant directors, mentees, and mentors representing 21 unique COBRE programs and 8 unique INBRE programs from across the United States. The results provide initial evidence that this tool possesses suitable psychometric properties, is a flexible instrument with many potential uses, and represents a valuable resource for helping evaluate COBRE and INBRE mentoring programs. Having a tool for evaluating mentoring can help promote the grant success and career development of junior investigators in COBRE and INBRE programs and help program directors develop more sustainable research centers.",

    "abstract": "This article summarizes the comments made in the introductory session of the Medical Physiology course taught at the University of Alabama School of Medicine. The main thesis is that learning physiology is easier when fundamental principles are first delineated. Four general principles of physiology (mass balance, force-flow, capacitance, and equilibrium) are discussed. Clinical medicine becomes more comprehensible when these basic principles are understood. Cellular Physiology is taught first because it forms the conceptual basis for what follows in the course. The idea that the root of clinical medicine lies in the basic sciences is emphasized.",

    "abstract": "This work suggests that the amount of information included in biochemistry texts is artificially increased, because the knowledge presented contains tautologies that are obscured by the use of inappropriate methods of representation. The work then proposes alternative methods of representation for describing biochemical systems that are based on the dynamics of an idealized chemical open-flow system. They would clarify the fact, in an open system, the concentrations of the reactants and reaction products depend not only on the equilibrium constants but on the absolute velocities of the reactions as well. Similar rules apply to phenomena involving other processes, such as diffusion of ions. Biochemical systems are considered as a set of chemical flow systems in which individual processes have the potential for interactions if their end products influence the rate of other processes. These interactions are used to explain how biochemical systems maintain themselves in states of high order. By use of these formulations, some of the logical sequences by which biochemical principles can be deduced from the principles of chemistry can be given simple and illustrative expression.",

When the program is protected, students use it as a cell with unknown osmotic properties. They run experiments on the computer with different concentrations of impermeant or permeant solutes or combinations of the two. Changes in cell volume or solute concentration are collected as data and analyzed with the program, PERMEABILITY LAB.BA. This program provides a parameter list, and students try to fit the data that are graphed on the screen by choosing values for the unknown cell parameters and generating model curves.
